<p>North Korea <a href="http://dailysignal.com/2013/02/12/north-korea-defies-with-nuclear-test/">conducted its third nuclear weapons test</a>
 in February in defiance of international efforts to halt its nuclear 
weapons program. Although details about the test remain elusive, it 
appeared to be North Korea’s largest nuclear weapons test to date. In 
March, North Korea <a href="http://dailysignal.com/2013/03/07/north-korea-threatens-nuclear-strike-on-u-s/">publicly threatened a nuclear attack</a> on targets in the U.S.</p>
<p>2. Can North Korean ballistic missiles reach the United States?</p>
<p>North Korea recently claimed that it can <a href="http://dailysignal.com/2013/03/07/north-korea-threatens-nuclear-strike-on-u-s/">already hit the U.S. with a nuclear weapon</a>. In December 2012, North Korea <a href="http://dailysignal.com/2012/12/12/north-korean-missile-defiance-requires-stern-response/">launched</a>
 an Unha-3 rocket (the same vehicle as its Taepo Dong-2 
intercontinental-range ballistic missile). North Korea can already hit 
Hawaii, parts of Alaska, and California. It can also hit U.S. 
forward-deployed troops in South Korea, Japan, and Guam. It would take 
only about <a href="http://dailysignal.com/2008/11/10/33-minutes-trailer-released/">33 minutes</a> for a North Korean long-range ballistic missile to reach the U.S. homeland if it obtains that capability.</p>
<p>3. Can North Korea launch a nuclear attack on the United States?</p>
<p>The missile that North Korea <a href="http://dailysignal.com/2012/12/12/north-korean-missile-defiance-requires-stern-response/">launched</a>
 in December 2012 had a payload. The regime claimed it was a satellite 
for civilian purposes. A satellite payload and a nuclear payload share a
 great deal of technology and while the Obama Administration does not 
believe that North Korea is capable of hitting the U.S. with a nuclear 
weapon, the U.S. has a history of underestimating North Korea’s 
ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs.</p>
<p>4. Is Kim Jong-un bluffing?</p>
<p>North Korea is one of the most closed societies in the world. While 
many hoped for a change with the new leader, these hopes were <a href="http://www.heritage.org/research/commentary/2012/10/new-style-same-old-north-korea">misplaced</a>.
 Very few know what is really going on in North Korea or in Kim 
Jong-un’s head. That is why it is essential to treat North Korean 
threats seriously.</p>
<p>5. What should the U.S. do?</p>
<p>The U.S. should be at the forefront of deploying a layered 
comprehensive ballistic missile defense system to protect its homeland, 
its forward-deployed troops, and its <a href="http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2011/01/the-case-for-comprehensive-missile-defense-in-asia">allies in Asia</a>. The Obama Administration’s recent decision to <a href="http://dailysignal.com/2013/04/02/north-korean-threat-another-u-s-reversal/">deploy 14 additional</a>
 Ground-Based Midcourse Defense interceptors is a step in the right 
direction, but it should also include a revival of programs that 
President Obama killed since he took office, such as the Airborne Laser,
 Multiple Kill Vehicle (MKV), and Kinetic Energy interceptor. The 
Administration must <a href="http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2013/03/north-korean-threat-to-attack-south-korea-what-us-needs-to-do">reverse sequestration</a>, particularly to naval and air force procurement plans, to send a <a href="http://dailysignal.com/2013/04/03/video-north-korea-is-capable-of-incredible-destruction/">credible signal</a> it will defend its interests in Asia. In must also increase its diplomatic efforts to <a href="http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2012/12/north-korean-missile-launch-challenges-us-foreign-policy">further isolate North Korea</a> and strengthen the <a href="http://dailysignal.com/2013/03/07/north-korea-threatens-nuclear-strike-on-u-s/">international sanctions regime</a>.</p></article>

<p class="rm-manual"><span>April 25, 2020 Update: Kim Jong-un Dead?</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.snopes.com/news/2020/04/25/kim-jong-un-near-death/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rumors are swirling on the internet</a>
 that Kim Jong-un is in a vegetative state or has died as the result of a
 botched cardiac procedure; however, there has been no confirmation of 
these reports by official government agencies or reliable sources.</p>
<p>38 North <a href="https://www.38north.org/2020/04/wonsancompound042520/" rel="noopener noreferrer">reports</a>:</p>
<p>A train probably belonging to Kim Jong Un has been parked at the 
Leadership Railway Station servicing his Wonsan compound since at least 
April 21, according to commercial satellite imagery. The train’s 
presence does not prove the whereabouts of the North Korean leader or 
indicate anything about his health, but it does lend weight to reports 
that Kim is staying at an elite area on the country’s eastern coast.</p>
<p><span>April 26, 2020 Update: Dynastic Succession in North Korea</span></p>
<p>Anna Fifield, Washington Post bureau chief in Beijing and author of 
The Great Successor: The Divinely Perfect Destiny of Brilliant Comrade 
Kim Jong Un provides an informative <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/is-the-talk-about-kim-jong-un-being-sick--or-worse--true-pyongyang-is-abuzz-too/2020/04/26/d29b9770-873e-11ea-81a3-9690c9881111_story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">analysis</a> of the prospects for dynastic succession or continuity of governance in the event of Kim Jong-un’s death.</p>
<p>If Kim turns out to be fine, it would hardly be the first time that 
reports of the death of a North Korean leader had been greatly 
exaggerated. Japanese and South Korean newspapers killed off his 
grandfather, Kim Il Sung, and his father, Kim Jong Il, multiple times in
 the years before either man actually died.</p>
<p>Kim Jong Un’s premature demise was also reported in 2014, when his <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/north-korean-media-report-that-kim-jong-un-is-back/2014/10/13/b3545c63-0d8e-4edf-b9f5-06321d3da037_story.html" rel="noreferrer noopener">disappearance from public view for six weeks</a> sparked talk of death by military coup, heart attack, or excessive cheese consumption. …</p>
<p>What if Kim Jong Un dies? There is no clear successor for him. …</p>
<p><span>April 28, 2020 Update: Medical Opinion by Kenneth B. Dekleva, M.D.</span></p>
<p>[Kim Jong Un’s] absence now is of notable concern, given multiple 
reports about Kim having received some form of cardiac surgery and 
possibly suffering from subsequent complications. While these reports 
remain unconfirmed, the security consequences of Kim’s sudden demise or 
incapacitation could be enormous, given the lack of clarity on what 
comes next. …</p>

<p><span>April 29, 2020 Update: Imagery Shows Train at Kim Jong Un’s Wonsan Compound Again</span></p>
<p>38 North <a href="https://www.38north.org/2020/04/wonsancompound042920/" rel="noopener noreferrer">reports</a>:</p>
<p>Commercial satellite imagery from April 29 shows a train at the 
leadership train station that services Kim Jong Un’s compound in the 
coastal city of Wonsan. While a train was first observed at this station
 on April 21 and again on April 23, it cannot be determined whether it 
has remained at the station since then. On April 29, the train is 
situated in the same position as before. However, the engine is no 
longer parked alongside the south end of the train. Whether the engine 
car has departed or was simply moved under the station’s canopy is 
unclear. But in either case, the train does not appear to be prepared 
for departure.</p>

<p><span>May 1, 2020 Update: Does Kim Jong Un Have a Succession Plan?</span></p>
<p>Chris Steinitz, Ken Gause, and Elizabeth Yang offer an insightful <a href="https://www.38north.org/2020/05/csteinitzkgauseeyang050120/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>analysis</span></a> at 38 North of scenarios for succession and continuity of governance in the event of Kim Jong-un’s demise.</p>
<p>If the leader were merely incapacitated, the immediate, temporary 
structure would likely be led by a small group of family and close 
aides, who would make decisions along established lines, maintaining the
 status quo. This small collective would carry out the day-to-day 
affairs of the regime, not unlike the group that supported Kim Jong Il 
after his stroke in 2008.</p>
<p>If Kim Jong Un dies, however, the situation would become much more 
precarious. An initial leadership group would likely be set up that 
includes those above, as well as members from the Party, military, and 
internal security. Whether someone like Kim Yo Jong would sit atop this 
structure or would assume the role of Supreme Leader is unclear. It is 
also possible that some male member of the Kim family could be put forth
 as a figurehead for legitimacy purposes, instead of Kim Yo Jong.</p>
<p><span>May 2, 2020 Update: Kim Jong Un Resurfaces</span></p>
<p>The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/world/asia/kim-jong-un-resurfaces.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">reports</a>:</p>
<p>North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, resurfaced in public view on 
Friday, the North’s state news media reported Saturday, controverting 
three weeks of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/26/world/asia/kim-jong-un-absence-north-korea.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">rumors and unconfirmed news reports</a> that he was in grave danger after undergoing heart surgery. …</p>
<p>Mr. Kim, 36, had last appeared publicly on April 11. … Rumors subsequently went into overdrive, claiming that Mr. Kim was “<a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/04/20/politics/kim-jong-un-north-korea/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">in grave danger</a>,” in a “<a href="https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/international/asia-pacific/1587811046-report-kim-jong-un-in-vegetative-state-after-stent-procedure-gone-wrong" rel="noopener noreferrer">vegetative state</a>” after botched heart-valve surgery, or in quarantine after contracting Covid-19. Other reports said that China had <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-politics-exclusive-idUSKCN2263DW" rel="noopener noreferrer">sent doctors</a> to Pyongyang to save him.</p>
<p>After its initial report on Saturday, the North Korean news agency 
released photos showing a smiling Mr. Kim applauding, cutting a ribbon, 
and standing with his hands behind his back at a new fertilizer factory.</p>

<p> <span>April 2013</span></p>
<p><span>Kim Jong-un delivers his 2013 New Year’s Day address in Pyongyang, North Korea.</span></p>
<p>A remote psychological assessment of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un is currently in progress <span>[scroll down for April 2017 and April 2018 updates]</span>,
 using the third edition of the Millon Inventory of Diagnostic Criteria 
(MIDC), which yields 34 normal and maladaptive personality 
classifications congruent with Axis II of DSM-IV.</p>
<p>Preliminary analysis of the data suggests that Kim Jong-un’s 
personality is primarily an amalgam of the Accommodating and Outgoing 
patterns, a fitting descriptive label for which would be 
congenial–cooperative.</p>
<p>The core characteristics of congenial–cooperative leaders may be summarized as follows:</p>
<ul> <li>Agreeable, acquiescent, and affiliation-motivated; tend to be 
inclusive, accommodating, and obliging in their relationships with 
others; characteristically gracious, neighborly, and benevolent, 
pre­ferring to avoid conflict and seek harmony — occasionally at the 
expense of their own internal beliefs and values.</li> <li>Charming and socially gregarious, with a knack for focusing attention on themselves through dramatic or self-dramatizing action.</li> <li>Place
 a high premium on external approval, to the extent that in some 
respects they may value themselves more in terms of their relationships 
with others than for their own intrinsic qualities; by allying 
themselves with the virtues of others, they bolster themselves through a
 sense of shared competence.</li> <li>Tend to smooth over life’s 
problems, main­taining an air of pleasantry and goodwill, with a 
corresponding tendency to disavow disturbing emotions and maintain a 
relatively uncritical, optimistic outlook on human events.</li> <li>Value
 service to others and are sympathetic to others’ needs, which at times 
may be self-defeating in the sense of relinquishing too much authority, 
failing to assert themselves sufficiently, delegating too much 
responsibility, or hesitation in taking the initiative when 
circumstances demand boldness or daring.</li> </ul>
<p>The personality profile raises the question of who is really in 
charge in North Korea; in short, the bellicose rhetoric emanating from 
the DPRK is inconsistent with Kim Jong-un’s psychological profile.</p>

<p>In a 1965 World Politics article titled “The Dictator and 
Totalitarianism,” Princeton Sovietologist Robert Tucker wrote that 
totalitarian regimes serve as conduits for dictatorial psychology 
because of the weak structural constraints their political machinery 
impose on the leader. Considering the Democratic People’s Republic of 
Korea counts among the most totalitarian of contemporary regimes, one 
would think it would be a simple matter to assess the personal 
psychology of its supreme leader, Kim Jong-un.</p>
<p>Not so. It has proven extraordinarily difficult to find reliable 
information pertaining to Kim’s personal psychology. The first obstacle 
is the secrecy surrounding the Kim dynasty, exacerbated by the 
state-sponsored cult of personality and deification of the Kim family. 
Second, and equally problematic, is the tendency of news reports and 
media commentary to conflate regime behavior and Kim’s personal traits. 
Thus, characterizations of Kim as “erratic” or “unstable” tend to be 
spurious attributions of regime behavior to the person of Kim Jong-un.</p>
<p>The Unit for the Study of Personality in Politics’ first study of Kim
 Jong-un – completed in April 2013, a year after Kim assumed the mantle 
of chairman of the Workers’ Party of Korea and supreme leader of the 
DPRK – found him to be generally congenial and cooperative, with no 
indication of remarkable aggressive tendencies or an unstable 
personality.</p>
<p>A follow-up study conducted four years later in spring 2017, in the 
wake of increasingly bellicose rhetoric and escalating military 
provocations on the part of the North Korean regime, specifically 
searched for evidence that could link this aggression to Kim’s personal 
attributes. Kim was found, at most, to have only a moderate 
predisposition to aggressive behavior.</p>
<p>Specifically, Kim Jong-un’s score of 10 on MIDC scale 1A (Dominant) –
 a measure of aggressiveness – is modest compared with recent U.S. 
presidents (Donald Trump, 17; George W. Bush, 11; Bill Clinton, 7; 
Barack Obama, 7).</p>
<p>Moreover, Kim Jong-un’s score of 5 on MIDC scale 4 (Accommodating) – a
 measure of cooperativeness – is comparable to those of recent U.S. 
presidents (Barack Obama, 5; Bill Clinton, 5; George W. Bush, 4) and 
significantly higher than that of the incumbent president (Donald Trump,
 0).</p>
<p>After close scrutiny of the data and careful examination of the 
empirical research results, it is concluded that a valid assessment of 
the military threat posed by North Korea with respect to the U.S. and 
its allies cannot be conducted without access to classified intelligence
 and collateral information from individuals personally acquainted with 
Kim Jong-un throughout his lifespan. Nonetheless, research efforts will 
continue through 2017, with updated findings scheduled for release early
 in 2018.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>A remote psychological assessment of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un 
was conducted from 2017 to 2018. Psychodiagnostically relevant data 
regarding Kim were extracted from open-source media reports and 
synthesized into a personality profile using the Millon Inventory of 
Diagnostic Criteria (MIDC), which yields 34 normal and maladaptive 
personality classifications congruent with DSM–III–R, DSM–IV, and DSM–5.</p>
<p>The personality profile yielded by the MIDC was analyzed in 
accordance with interpretive guidelines provided in the MIDC and Millon 
Index of Personality Styles manuals. Kim’s primary personality patterns 
were found to be Outgoing/gregarious and Dominant/controlling, 
supplemented by secondary Ambitious/confident, Dauntless/adventurous, 
and Accommodating/cooperative features. Given his Outgoing–Dominant 
primary personality composite, Kim may be classified as a high-dominance
 extravert.</p>
<p>Outgoing individuals are dramatic attention‑getters who thrive on 
being the center of social events, go out of their way to be popular 
with others, and are confident in their social skills; they may have an 
impulsive tendency and be prone to boredom. Dominant individuals enjoy 
the power to direct others and to evoke obedience and respect; they can 
be tough and unsentimental and often make effective leaders. Ambitious 
individuals are bold, competitive, and self-assured; they easily assume 
leadership roles, expect others to recognize their special qualities, 
and may act as though entitled. Dauntless individuals tend to flout 
tradition, conventional standards, and cultural mores, dislike following
 routine, and may act impulsively and recklessly; they are resistant to 
coercion and may exhibit a strong need for autonomy and 
self-determination. Accommodating individuals are notably cordial, 
cooperative, and amicable; they are willing to adapt their preferences 
to be compatible with those of others, to reconcile differences to 
achieve peaceable solutions, and to concede or compromise when 
necessary.</p>
<p>Kim Jong-un’s major personality-based leadership strength is a 
distinctly outgoing tendency, supplemented by an accommodating 
inclination, a fitting descriptive label for which would be 
congenial–cooperative. Leaders matching this profile can be expected to 
be jovial, socially gregarious, agreeable, accommodating, and obliging 
in their relationships with others; they are characteristically 
gracious, neighborly, and benevolent, pre­ferring to avoid conflict and 
seek harmony with others.</p>

 “Kim Jong-un’s major personality-based leadership strength is a

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>A remote psychological assessment of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un 
was conducted from 2013 to 2018. Psychodiagnostically relevant data 
regarding Kim were extracted from open-source media reports and 
synthesized into a personality profile using the Millon Inventory of 
Diagnostic Criteria (MIDC), which yields 34 normal and maladaptive 
personality classifications congruent with DSM–III–R, DSM–IV, and DSM–5.</p>
<p>The personality profile yielded by the MIDC was analyzed in 
accordance with interpretive guidelines provided in the MIDC and Millon 
Index of Personality Styles manuals. Kim’s primary personality patterns 
were found to be Outgoing/gregarious and Dominant/controlling, 
supplemented by secondary Dauntless/adventurous, Ambitious/confident, 
and Accommodating/cooperative features.</p>
<p>Outgoing individuals are dramatic attention‑getters who thrive on 
being the center of social events, go out of their way to be popular 
with others, and are confident in their social skills; they may have an 
impulsive tendency and be prone to boredom. Dominant individuals enjoy 
the power to direct others and to evoke obedience and respect; they can 
be tough and unsentimental and often make effective leaders. Dauntless 
individuals tend to flout tradition, conventional standards, and 
cultural mores, dislike following routine, and may act impulsively and 
recklessly; they are resistant to coercion and may exhibit a strong need
 for autonomy and self-determination. Ambitious individuals are bold, 
competitive, and self-assured; they easily assume leadership roles, 
expect others to recognize their special qualities, and may act as 
though entitled. Accommodating individuals are cordial, cooperative, and
 amicable; they are polite, respectful, and agreeable, willing to adapt 
their preferences to reconcile differences, and to concede or compromise
 when necessary to achieve peaceable solutions.</p>
<p>It may be inferred on the basis of his primary Outgoing personality 
pattern, infused with secondary Accommodating qualities, that in the 
absence of strong situational constraints Kim will be inclined to 
congenial–cooperative behavior in negotiations; a generalized expectancy
 for leaders with this particular psychological predisposition is to 
behave in a manner that is gracious, jovial, socially gregarious, 
agreeable, accommodating, and obliging in relating to others, with an 
underlying attitude of benevolence and neighborliness and a pre­ference 
for avoiding conflict and seeking harmony with others.</p>
<p>Framed in terms of heuristic leadership models in political 
psychology, Kim appears to be temperamentally active-positive, with an 
active-independent orientation to foreign affairs and high-dominance 
extraversion as his preferred operating style in the international 
system.</p>

<p><span>Latest analysis: December 15, 2019</span></p>
<p>On December 14 the New York Times reported:</p>
<p>A second test [at the <a href="http://www.immelman.us/north-korea/u-s-response-to-north-koreas-rebuilding-activity-at-sohae-satellite-launching-station/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sohae Satellite Launching Station</a>]
 of what appeared to be an advanced missile engine, part of what North 
Korea said on Saturday was part of a “reliable strategic nuclear 
deterrent,” left little doubt that the country is moving quickly toward 
resuming the program that led to a crisis with Washington two years ago.
 … It was the second such test in a week, and came after weeks of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/05/world/asia/north-korea-trump-dotard.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">increasingly vocal attempts</a>
 to press the United States into further talks and new concessions. … 
American analysts and intelligence experts said they believe the ground 
test … was intended as a signal that the country could soon resume 
testing of an intercontinental ballistic missile.</p>
<p>Analysts have speculated an ICBM test might occur after the end of December, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/28/world/asia/north-korea-trump-nuclear-talks-deadline.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">deadline Kim Jong-un imposed</a> for the U.S. to resume negotiations and provide sanctions relief.</p>
<p>In its report, the New York Times quotes Pak Jong-chon, chief of the 
general staff of the North Korean People’s Army, as saying: “We should 
be ready to cope with political and military provocations of the hostile
 forces, and be familiar with both dialogue and confrontation” and that 
the U.S. and its allies would “spend the year-end in peace only when 
they hold off any words and deeds rattling us” — signaling that amid 
stalled diplomacy “the voice of North Korea’s hard-line military was 
rising,” according to Cheong Seong-chang, vice president of research 
planning at South Korea’s Sejong Institute.</p>
<p>In conjunction with the North Korean foreign ministry’s veiled threat
 in early December that North Korea was preparing a surprise <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/04/asia/north-korea-christmas-gift-kim-jong-un-intl-hnk/index.html">“Christmas gift”</a> for the United States, the latest rhetoric emanating from the DPRK sounds ominous.</p>

<p>How should the U.S. respond?</p>
<ol> <li>In planning its response, the U.S. should exercise caution in 
ascertaining the personal policy preferences of Kim Jong-un and 
distinguishing between that and the intent of hardliners in the DPRK 
military establishment.</li> <li>To the extent that Kim is losing ground
 in his grip on power vis-à-vis the top military leadership, the U.S. 
could strengthen Kim’s hand by giving due consideration to the 
resumption of personal diplomacy between the two nations’ leaders as a 
complement to the continuation of working-level talks.</li> <li>It would
 be prudent to delay any significant response or intervention until 
after evaluating the tone, and learning more about the details, of Kim’s
 policy options in his annual New Year’s Day speech.</li> <li>In the 
context of the central role of personal diplomacy in the US-DPRK nuclear
 negotiations, consider that with the specter of impeachment and the 
uncertainty of Donald Trump’s reelection as president, Kim might be 
reluctant to strike a deal at the present juncture, preferring to adopt a
 wait-and-see attitude; thus, it would be prudent to exercise patience 
and avoid any abrupt policy reversals.</li> </ol>

<p>Commentary by Kenneth B. Dekleva, M.D.</p>
<p> January 30, 2020</p>
<p><span>Excerpts</span></p>
<p>At the recent December 2019 plenum, Chairman Kim, rather than giving 
his traditional New Year’s speech, outlined a different strategy toward 
the US moving forward in 2020. … Kim’s strategic shift portends not only
 political, military and diplomatic changes, but also offers clues as to
 his evolving leadership style, intentions and flexibility as he begins 
his ninth year in power. …</p>
<p>Chairman Kim has shown restraint and patience. He has not tested an 
intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) or resumed nuclear testing—nor
 is he likely to do so, although a public “display” of a new ICBM or 
ballistic missile submarine is not out of the question.</p>
<p>Rather, Kim has carefully allowed his subordinates to give lip 
service to a “Christmas gift,” and he has substituted strategic 
ambiguity for his previously demonstrated (during 2018) nuclear opacity.
 Doing so highlights his strategic sensibility, patience and evolving 
maturity as a leader. Importantly, while disappointed (and likely 
humiliated) by his failure to achieve sanctions relief at the 2019 Hanoi
 Summit with US President Donald Trump, Chairman Kim has refrained from 
attacking the president personally. …</p>
<p>Kim remains an aspirational leader, even as the DPRK’s diplomacy is 
likely to shift—given the replacement of Ri Yong Ho and appointment of 
Ri Son Gwon (a military hardliner and protégé of Kim Yong Chol) as 
foreign minister—to a more muscular, hard-nosed version. And Kim, rather
 than acting impulsively to provoke an unpredictable President Trump, 
has surely taken measure of America’s current impeachment drama, the 
upcoming American presidential election, and Trump’s recent show of 
resolve with respect to the killing of Iran’s Quds Force leader General 
Soleimani, as well as the signing of the China trade deal. Kim is 
patiently waiting—with a tendency to avoid unnecessary political 
risks—knowing that, if Trump were to serve another four years, time is 
on his and the DPRK’s side. …</p>

<p><a href="http://www.immelman.us/news/u-s-response-to-north-koreas-rebuilding-activity-at-sohae-satellite-launching-station/" rel="bookmark noopener noreferrer">U.S. Response to North Korea’s Rebuilding Activity at Sohae Satellite Launching Station</a></p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/world/asia/kim-jong-trump-summit.html" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported in the New York Times</a>
 (March 8, 2019), the collapse of the Feb. 27-28 Hanoi summit meeting 
with U.S. President Donald Trump “was considered a big embarrassment” 
for North Korean leader Kim Jong-un “because he had to return home 
empty-handed after Mr. Trump rejected his demand for relief from United 
Nations sanctions.”</p>
<p>Satellite imagery indicating North Korea has begun to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/05/world/asia/north-korea-missile-site.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">rebuild the Sohae Satellite Launching Station</a>
 at Tongchang-ri has raised fears among some analysts that the country 
might resume missile tests (New York Times, March 5, 2019).</p>
<p>Sohae Satellite Launching Station, March 6, 2019 (Credit: Pleiades © CNES 2019, Distribution Airbus Defence &amp; Space via <a href="https://www.38north.org/2019/03/sohae030719/" rel="noopener noreferrer">38 North</a>)</p>
<p>The U.S. response to these developments is critical to the progress 
of denuclearization talks with North Korea. In that regard, it is 
noteworthy that DPRK state media adopted a conciliatory tone, expressing
 the hope that “the whole world sincerely hopes that the peace process 
on the Korean Peninsula will proceed smoothly and the North Korea-United
 States relations will improve soon” (Rodong Sinmun, March 8, 2019).</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/world/asia/kim-jong-trump-summit.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Times notes</a>
 that the DPRK “has shied away from using harsh language against the 
United States or Mr. Trump” and that by “only indirectly blaming 
Washington for the failure and voicing hopes for better ties,” the 
Rodong Sinmun commentary “appeared to signal a willingness to keep 
diplomacy alive with the United States.”</p>
<p>That perspective suggests a path forward for the U.S., considering the <a href="http://digitalcommons.csbsju.edu/psychology_pubs/119" rel="noopener noreferrer">political psychology of Kim Jong-un</a>:</p>
<p>Chairman Kim is cooperative, willing to compromise or make 
concessions to resolve differences; however, he is also confident, 
competitive, and assertive and expects others to recognize his 
capabilities. As a dominant, controlling leader, he demands respect and 
can be tough and unsentimental in asserting himself. Finally, as an 
outgoing, expressive personality, he is not averse to employing 
dramatic, attention‑getting maneuvers to signal intent or to achieve his
 political objectives.</p>
<p>Thus, for President Trump, this is not the time to employ coercive 
diplomacy by reverting to “maximum pressure,” personal affronts to 
Chairman Kim’s dignity, or otherwise signaling hostile intent. Instead, 
the president should stay the course by continuing to emphasize his 
special relationship with Kim to accommodate his need for 
self-validation and permit him to save face as his nation’s supreme 
leader in the aftermath of the failed Hanoi summit.</p>
<p>In response to signals from North Korea on the resumption of rocket 
testing and satellite- or missile launches, there are three 
political-psychological inflection points for targeting resistance and 
gaining compliance:</p>
<ul> <li>President Trump should guard against manipulative behavior by the DPRK designed to secure short-term payoffs.</li> <li>President
 Trump should be aware of and preempt Chairman Kim’s predisposition to 
terminate the negotiation partnership upon realizing the structural 
constraints on the ability of the president to make concessions or offer
 assistance.</li> <li>President Trump should deescalate the situation by reaffirming the strength of the negotiation partnership.</li> </ul>

 war early on in the Trump administration. … The unmuzzling of the 
attack dogs on each side is a reminder that Trump and Kim are each 
contending with a hard-line faction at home that views the diplomacy 
they’re engaged in as a hopeless and dangerous endeavor. As [North 
Korea’s vice foreign minister, Choe Son Hui] noted this week, Kim 
decided to press ahead with diplomacy in Vietnam despite the fact that

<p> July 16, 2009</p>
<p>LIEBEFELD, Switzerland — In August 1998, as famine reached a terrible
 climax in North Korea, the destitute Asian nation enrolled a shy 
teenager in a Swiss state school. He arrived with a fake name, a 
collection of genuine, top-of-the-line Nike sneakers and a passion for 
American basketball.</p>
<p>“We only dreamed about having such shoes. He was wearing them,” 
recalled Nikola Kovacevic, a former schoolmate of the curiously 
well-heeled North Korean. Each pair, estimates Kovacevic, cost more than
 $200 — at least four times the average monthly salary in the Democratic
 People’s Republic of Korea, where perhaps 1 million people died as a 
result of food shortages in the mid- and late 1990s.</p>
<p>Today, the student — who vanished from this sleepy Swiss district as 
mysteriously as he appeared — is a key figure in a puzzle that U.S. and 
Asian intelligence services are scrambling to solve: Who will lead 
nuclear-armed North Korea — and where to — once its gravely ill leader, 
Kim Jong Il, passes from the scene?</p>
<p>The answer is of vital importance to Washington, which has about 
25,000 troops in South Korea, on guard against any resumption of a 
conflict frozen — but never formally ended — by a Korean War armistice 
accord in 1953. Who rules North Korea will decide whether Seoul, Tokyo 
and perhaps even Hawaii risk attack from a nation that has tested two 
nuclear devices, the most recent in May, and built up an arsenal of 
missiles and long-range artillery. The Pentagon has sent missile-defense
 systems to Hawaii just in case. North Korea marked July 4 this year by 
test-firing seven more rockets.</p>
<p>North Korea shrouds the biographies of its rulers and their offspring
 in a fog of fiction and silence. “It is pretty amazing how very little 
real information we have,” said Victor Cha, who served as a Korea expert
 on the National Security Council in the Bush administration.</p>
<p>A rare insight into this sealed world is offered by Swiss 
recollections of the young North Korean who, from 1998 until late 2000, 
lived here in Liebefeld at No. 10 Kirchstrasse, a sedate suburban street
 with two pizza joints, a Credit Suisse bank and a Coop supermarket. He 
was around 17 when he abruptly left in the middle of the school year, 
apparently to return to Pyongyang.</p>
<p>There are many signs that he may now be the next leader of North 
Korea — 26-year-old Kim Jong Un, the third and youngest son of Kim Jong 
Il.</p>
<p>Known as “Pak Un” to his teachers at Liebefeld-Steinhözli Schule, a 
German-speaking state school, he was registered with Swiss authorities 
as the son of an employee at North Korea’s embassy in the nearby city of
 Bern, Switzerland’s capital, according to Ueli Studer, director of 
education in the local administration.</p>
<p>Throughout Pak Un’s time in Liebefeld, however, neither friends nor 
teachers ever met the parents. “I never saw his father or mother,” said 
the school’s principal, Peter Burri, recalling how they repeatedly 
failed to show up for parents’ night. Attending in their place, Burri 
said, were assorted North Koreans who apologized for the parents’ 
absence and said this was due to their inability to speak German.</p>
<p>A more likely reason: The boy’s father didn’t work in Bern at the embassy but was more than 5,000 miles away in Pyongyang.</p>
<p>Maria Micaelo, the mother of one of Pak Un’s closest school friends, 
said the North Korean teenager once confided to her son, Joao, that his 
father was the leader of North Korea. She recalled that she dismissed 
the claim as a fanciful teenage boast, but had second thoughts when her 
son saw pictures of Kim Jong Il on television and told her that he’d 
seen the same man in a photograph with Pak Un. Joao Micaelo, now a cook 
in Vienna, did not respond to repeated e-mail messages seeking comment.</p>
<p>Kongdan Oh Hassig, an expert on North Korea at the Alexandria-based <a href="http://www.ida.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Institute for Defense Analyses</span></a>,
 which does research for the Pentagon, says Pak Un certainly appears to 
be Kim Jong Il’s third son, Kim Jong Un, adding that members of North 
Korea’s elite usually use bogus names outside their homeland. Pak is a 
very common Korean surname akin to Smith.</p>
<p>When reports of a Pyongyang succession plan began to leak out of 
North Korea this year, heir apparent Kim Jong Un was widely reported to 
have attended the International School of Berne, a private, 
English-speaking establishment near the North Korean Embassy in the 
Swiss capital.</p>
<p>But, North Korea watchers say, that student — who went by the name 
“Pak Chol” — was most likely Kim Jong Un’s older brother, Kim Jong Chol.
 Both were born to Kim Jong Il’s third wife, a former dancer who died in
 2004. The North Korean leader has another son, his oldest, by another 
wife. He also has four daughters. The oldest son, Kim Jong Nam, also 
studied for a time in Switzerland under an alias, as well as in the 
Soviet Union. …</p>
<p>Question of Culture’</p>
<p>The Swiss education of North Korea’s apparent future leader raises a 
tantalizing question: Did it open his horizons beyond the narrow, 
xenophobic worldview of his homeland, where schools bombard pupils with 
the evils of “U.S. imperialism” and instill unquestioning obedience to a
 highly centralized state headed by a leader-for-life? This is in stark 
contrast to Switzerland, a democratic federal state in which power is 
widely diffused, where all laws can be challenged by citizens through 
referendum, and where the presidency is a rotating position that changes
 every year.</p>
<p>“There is a big difference between attending a school in a free 
country and a school where everyone has to salute,” said Studer, the 
local education director. Schooling, he added, is a “question of 
culture,” and a North Korean schooled in Liebefeld “will take something 
away that will have an effect on his life.” Pak Un, along with fellow 
students, had three classes a week on Swiss history from 1291 and the 
evolution of the country’s modern system of governance known as “direct 
democracy,” as well as current events, which in 2000 included the U.S. 
election campaign.</p>
<p>The North Korean Embassy in Bern, housed in an elegant villa 
festooned with geraniums in the capital’s most expensive neighborhood, 
declined to comment. Some analysts in South Korea have expressed 
uncertainty about whether Kim Jong Un has definitely been selected as 
successor, noting that no official announcement has yet been made by 
Pyongyang.</p>
<p>A propaganda display on the embassy’s ivy-covered wall obliquely 
addresses the issue of succession, stressing the reinvigorating vitality
 of youth, a frequent theme of North Korean propaganda in recent months 
as the regime prepares for a transfer of power. Featuring photographs of
 young soldiers, young athletes and Youth League zealots, it shows Kim 
Jong Il as he “hands over the torch of revolution to young vanguards of 
Juche,” the regime’s idiosyncratic state ideology.</p>
<p>Since North Korea’s founding in 1945, power has passed exclusively 
from father to son. A hereditary dynasty, it mixes communist cant with 
Confucian emphasis on the primacy of family ties. Its founder, Kim Il 
Sung, known as the Great Leader, fabricated a patriotic lineage 
stretching back to the mid-19th century. After his death in 1994, power 
passed to his eldest son, the Dear Leader Kim Jong Il, who, according to
 his own falsified biography, was born on a Mount Paektu, a sacred 
mountain. He was really born in the Soviet Union, where he was known as 
Yuri.</p>
<p>With Kim Jong Il, 67, now ailing, North Korea is preparing to hand 
the baton to the third generation — and gearing up for a new round of 
hagiography and mythmaking. …</p>
<p>Last month, according to Open Radio for North Korea, a Seoul-based 
group with extensive contacts in North Korea, Pyongyang began holding 
lectures for selected audiences to trumpet the “greatness” of Kim Jong 
Un, the heir apparent. He was celebrated as a “genius of literary arts” 
and tireless patriot who “is working without sleep or rest” to promote 
North Korea as a nuclear superpower, according to the organization’s 
account of the sessions. Among his purported feats: He so inspired North
 Korea’s national soccer squad that it recently qualified for the World 
Cup finals, the first time the team has done so since 1966.</p>
<p>A confidential report prepared in May by the <a href="https://www.opensource.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Open Source Center</span></a>,
 a U.S. agency that monitors foreign media outlets, said North Korea 
began to prepare the way for a hereditary successor to Kim Jong Il in 
2001 with an essay in a party newspaper titled “A Brilliant Succession.”
 It didn’t name anyone but defined father-son succession as a “pure” 
tradition, and warned that any revolution that doesn’t follow tradition 
is “dead.”</p>
<p>This subtle campaign accelerated sharply, according to the report, 
after Kim Jong Il fell seriously ill, possibly suffering a stroke, last 
August and vanished for months. U.S. analysts, seeking clues in 
mountains of North Korean propaganda, noted increasingly frequent 
mentions of the importance of “bloodlines” and detected veiled 
endorsements of Kim Jong Un.</p>
<p>Kim Jong Il’s eldest son, Jong Nam, was for a time viewed as a likely
 heir but apparently bungled his chances in 2001 by trying to sneak into
 Japan under a fake Chinese name on a bogus Dominican Republic passport.
 He told Japanese immigration officials he wanted to visit Tokyo 
Disneyland. Interviewed briefly last month in the Chinese gambling 
enclave of Macau by Japanese television, Jong Nam said he had heard 
reports that his younger brother, Jong Un, had been chosen as successor 
but couldn’t comment because that “is a very sensitive question.”</p>
<p>Focused and Competitive</p>
<p>Kim Jong Un has not been seen in public since his apparent time in 
Switzerland. Neither his name nor his photograph has ever appeared in 
North Korean media. After leaving Europe, he is reported to have 
attended Pyongyang’s Kim Il Sung Military University, an officer 
training school, but virtually nothing else is known about him.</p>
<p>A senior U.S. official says he appears to have “the same interests as
 most 26-year-olds,” noting that these do not generally involve nuclear 
strategy.</p>
<p>If Liebefeld’s former student Pak Un is indeed Kim Jong Un, the 
memories of his former friends and teachers here offer a sketch of his 
character. He first started school after the summer holidays in 1998, a 
time when it looked as if North Korea might soon collapse. At about the 
same time, Kim Jong Il launched a secret program to produce highly 
enriched uranium for a nuclear bomb.</p>
<p>During his first few months in Liebefeld, Pak Un attended a remedial 
language course for foreign students with poor German. A swift learner, 
he soon switched to a regular class, said Studer, the education 
official, who described the boy as “well-integrated, diligent and 
ambitious.” Friends recalled that Pak Un spoke fluent, if sometimes 
ungrammatical, German but struggled with the Swiss dialect. He also knew
 English.</p>
<p>A video of a school music class he attended shows a lithe, 
intense-looking Asian boy wearing black sweat pants, Nike Air Jordan 
shoes and a long-sleeved black sports shirt. He sways uncomfortably 
while classmates pound African drums and beat tambourines. Though 
generally quiet in class and sometimes awkward, particularly around 
girls, Pak Un showed a different personality on the basketball court, 
former friends recalled. He fell in with a group of mostly immigrant 
kids who shared his love of the National Basketball Association. 
Kovacevic, who shot hoops with the North Korean most days, said Pak Un 
was a fiercely competitive player.</p>
<p>“He was very explosive. He could make things happen. He was the 
playmaker,” said Kovacevic, who now works as a tech specialist in the 
Swiss army. “If I wasn’t sure I could make a shot, I always knew he 
could.”</p>
<p>Marco Imhof, another Swiss basketball buddy, said the Korean was 
tough and fast, good at both shooting and dribbling. “He hated to lose. 
Winning was very important,” recalled Imhof. Pak Un also liked action 
films featuring hand-to-hand fighting, particularly those starring the 
Hong Kong kung fu star Jackie Chan, and played combat games on a Sony 
PlayStation.</p>
<p>This picture of a focused, competitive young man matches what until 
now has been the only firsthand account of Kim Jong Un. That was 
provided by a Japanese sushi chef who claims to have worked in Pyongyang
 as a cook for the Kim family. The chef, who wrote a book on his 
experiences in Japanese under the pseudonym Kenji Fujimoto, described 
the boy as strong-willed, proud and “boss-like.”</p>
<p>During his time in Liebefeld, friends remembered, Pak Un showed scant
 interest in politics and never vented publicly against Americans. 
Instead, he worshiped American basketball stars. He spent hours doing 
meticulous pencil drawings of Chicago Bulls superstar Michael Jordan.</p>
<p>At his spacious apartment on Kirchstrasse, said one friend who 
visited, Pak Un had a room filled with American basketball 
paraphernalia. He proudly showed off photographs of himself standing 
with Toni Kukoc of the Chicago Bulls and Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles 
Lakers. It is unclear where the pictures were taken. On at least one 
occasion, a car from the North Korean Embassy drove Pak Un to Paris to 
watch an NBA exhibition game.</p>
<p>With no parents in sight, Pak Un was watched over and waited on by 
North Koreans who appeared to combine the duties of servants, guardians 
and guards. A pair of Korean women, says Imhof, often observed him 
playing basketball and sometimes videotaped the action. A 
Korean-speaking man frequently hovered nearby. “It was a bit strange,” 
Imhof said. But he figured this was just “a Korean thing.”</p>
<p>Pak Un’s ultimate guardian in Switzerland was Ri Tcheul, North 
Korea’s veteran ambassador in Bern. Ri has served in the Swiss capital 
for 21 years, making him the city’s longest-serving foreign envoy. Over 
the years, he has turned the embassy into the nerve center for 
Pyongyang’s sometimes furtive contacts with businessmen, bankers, 
officials and aid workers from across Europe.</p>
<p>Studer, the local education official, said school authorities never 
had reason to question whether Pak Un really was the son of an embassy 
employee. Now that he’s gone, he added, “there is no need to go into the
 matter.”</p>
<p>Pak Un’s former friends are more curious and say they’d like to know 
the real identity of the teenager they used to hang out with. They last 
saw him in 2000, when he suddenly vanished. He left no address and 
didn’t tell anyone where he was going.</p>
<p>“We thought he was ill or something and would soon be back. He never 
came to school again. He totally disappeared,” said Kovacevic, his 
former friend. He and others asked teachers what had happened. They had 
no idea either. “We were just playing basketball — now he is going to be
 a dictator,” said Kovacevic. “I hope he is a good leader, but dictators
 are usually not that good.”</p>

<p><span>The Associated Press and Reuters via MSNBC.com</span></p>
<p> September 30, 2010</p>
<p>North Korea on Thursday released what is believed the first official 
image of leader Kim Jong Il’s youngest son and heir apparent. …</p>
<p>The photo’s release comes after the younger Kim earlier this week was
 handed top military and party posts at a Workers’ Party conference.</p>
<p>The ascension of Kim Jong Un to a prominent ruling party post put him
 well on the path to succeed the supreme leader at the helm of 
nuclear-armed North Korea and carry the family dynasty into a third 
generation.</p>
<p>Rising with him were the ailing Kim Jong Il’s sister and her husband,
 creating a powerful triumvirate ready to take over the family dynasty 
that has ruled North Korea since its founding after World War Two.</p>
<p>Kim’s Swiss-educated, youngest son was made a four-star general in 
his first mention in North Korea’s state media on Tuesday. Early 
Wednesday, the communist nation announced that Kim Jong Un was appointed
 to the Workers’ Party Central Committee.</p>
<p>After months of speculation, the state KCNA news agency announced on 
Wednesday that the untested Kim Jong Un had been made second in command 
to his father at the ruling party’s powerful Central Military 
Commission.</p>
<p>“It is another step toward a new power structure which will consist 
of Kim Jong Un, a young and inexperienced dictator, and two people — his
 aunt and her husband — who will be making all real political decisions 
while mentoring the young leader,” said Andrei Lankov, a North Korea 
expert at Kookmin University. “A figurehead and a couple of powerful 
regents, if you like.”</p>
<p>Kim Jong Il’s sister Kim Kyong Hui, 64, retained her position as a 
department director on the Central Committee and gained a new post as a 
member of the Central Committee’s Political Bureau — the country’s 
second-highest political body. She has risen sharply in prominence in 
recent months and has been seen frequently at her brother’s side.</p>
<p>Her husband was also awarded new political titles. Jang Song Thaek was named an alternate Political Bureau member, KCNA said. …</p>
<p>Kim Jong Un is believed to be only 27 and until this week held no 
known political or military positions. However, he was always his 
father’s favorite, and the most like him in looks and ambition, the 
family’s former chef wrote in “I Was Kim Jong Il’s Cook” under the pen 
name Kenji Fujimoto. …</p>
<p>Experts are skeptical of any new dawn.</p>
<p>“Even with a new leader, North Korea is not likely to give up its nuclear ambitions,” said Anh Yinhay of Korea University. …</p>

<p> October 10, 2011</p>
<p>PYONGYANG, North Korea — The Illustrious General has had a busy year.</p>
<p>Since making his international debut a year ago Monday, Kim Jong Un 
has been serving as military strategist, political statesman and trusted
 deputy to his father, leader Kim Jong Il.</p>
<p>The newly minted four-star general, believed in his late 20s, is 
widely credited at home with orchestrating a deadly artillery attack on a
 front-line South Korean island that nearly brought the foes to the 
brink of another war. He appears regularly with his father at marquee 
events and accompanies him on inspection trips to farms and factories — 
visits now commemorated with plaques bearing his name.</p>
<p>Officials even say Jong Un, who was on hand for a recent state visit 
by Laos’ president, has been entrusted with full leadership of the 
country while his father has made extended trips to China and Russia 
over the last year.</p>
<p>At least that’s the official portrait emerging of the young man who 
in just one year has cemented his status as North Korea’s next leader. …</p>

<p> January 17, 2012</p>
<p>PYONGYANG, North Korea — Kim Jong Il’s eldest son has predicted that 
North Korea’s regime will “not last long” under the rule of his half 
brother, a newspaper reported Tuesday.</p>
<p>Citing e-mails exchanged between Kim Jong Nam and a Japanese 
journalist, South Korea’s Chosun Ilbo newspaper said that the dictator’s
 son described the country’s dynastic succession as “a joke to the 
outside world.”</p>
<p>Kim Jong Nam also predicted that his half brother Kim Jong Un would 
be “just a nominal figure,” adding: “The members of the power elite will
 be the ones in actual power.”</p>
<p>Kim Jong Un was vaulted into the leadership role with the death of 
his father, Kim Jong Il, in December. He had made his public debut as 
anointed successor only 15 months earlier.</p>
<p>His half brother suggested that North Korea’s new leader, who is believed to be aged 27, faced many challenges.</p>
<p>“Without reforms, North Korea will collapse, and when such changes 
take place, the regime will collapse,” the newspaper quoted Kim Jong Nam
 as saying. “The Kim Jong Un regime will not last long.” …</p>
<p>Among Kim Jong Il’s three sons, Kim Jong Un is seen as most like his father in manner and personality.</p>
<p>Kim Jong Nam is aged about 40 and is known for his playboy lifestyle 
and love of casinos. He is believed to have fallen out of favor with his
 father after being caught trying to enter Japan on a fake passport in 
2001 saying he wanted to visit Disney’s Tokyo resort. Kim Jong Nam has 
lived in China in recent years.</p>
<p>“Because I was educated in the West, I was able to enjoy freedom from
 early age, and I still love being free,” Kim Jong Nam reportedly told 
the Japanese journalist. “The reason I visit Macau so often is because 
it’s the most free and liberal place near China, where my family lives.”</p>
<p>According to Chosun Ilbo, Kim Jong Nam said his half brother had 
traveled to Japan in the past using a “fake Brazilian passport.”</p>
<p>Chosun Ilbo said Yoji Komi, a former Seoul correspondent for Tokyo 
Shimbun newspaper, exchanged almost 100 emails with Kim Jong Nam between
 2004 and December. They also spoke on at least two occasions. …</p>

priority is to develop the decaying economy and improve living standards
 in one of the world’s poorest states, the latest sign that he may be

dictatorship last December, has presented a sharply contrasting image to

 theme park with his young wife on his arm and riding a roller coaster

<p> March 29, 2013 </p>
<p>Is Kim Jong Un crazy — or crazy like a fox?</p>
<p>Analysts said Friday there’s a familiar method to the madness coming 
out of North Korea, where the rookie supreme leader has put rockets on 
standby, threatened to “settle accounts” with the U.S., and posed near a
 chart that appeared to map missile strikes on American cities. On 
Saturday, North Korea said it had entered a “state of war” against South
 Korea, according to a statement reported by the north’s official news 
agency, KCNA.</p>
<p>Kim Jong Un’s father and grandfather were also serial saber-rattlers 
when they headed the secretive regime, and experts said there are clear 
strategic reasons why the world’s youngest head of state is ramping up 
the rhetoric now, after little more than a year in power.</p>
<p>But if the bluster is predictable, the results may not be.</p>
<p>North Korea has enhanced its nuclear capabilities and Kim Jong Un has
 something to prove to his people and the world. Some outside observers 
are warning that a misstep, or overstep, by Pyongyang could bring north<span>[east]</span> Asia to the brink of war.</p>
<p>“I think there is always room for miscalculation and things spiraling
 out of control,” said Sung-Youn Lee, professor at the Fletcher School 
of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. “But he is following the 
playbook set by his father and grandfather.”</p>
<p>North Korea is “very adept at engaging at psychological warfare,” Lee
 said. It cranks up the tensions, putting pressure on Seoul and 
Washington, and is rewarded with aid and concessions when it tones 
things down, Lee said.</p>
<p>“No leader wants a foreign policy crisis created by North Korea on 
their hands … the impulse is to de-escalate,” Lee added. “North Korea 
has been very good at playing this game — nuclear diplomacy, even 
extortion — for the past 20 years.”</p>
<p>This time around, foreign-policy watchers said, a confluence of circumstances have set the stage for Kim Jong Un’s provocations:</p>
<ul> <li>Pyongyang is stewing over the U.N. Security Council, with the 
support of China, tightening sanctions after satellite and nuclear 
testing that suggested they could one day attack the U.S.</li> <li>There
 are new administrations in South Korea, China and Tokyo, and President 
Barack Obama is making second-term changes to his defense and 
national-security leadership, so the timing is right to test the waters.</li> <li>Kim
 Jong Un may need to consolidate his political power at home. A strong 
response by the U.S. or South Korea, such as this week’s B-2 bomber 
flyover, helps rally domestic support and distract from economic 
problems.</li> <li>North Korea’s last nuclear test showed progress. “You
 feel you can afford to threaten because you feel you have a deterrent,”
 said Scott Snyder, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.</li> </ul>
<p>Joel Wit, visiting fellow at the US-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins 
University, said that from the North Korean perspective, Kim Jong Un and
 his lieutenants “aren’t crazy” and are falling back on a tried-and-true
 strategy.</p>
<p>“They’re a very small country dealing with much more powerful 
countries, and they can’t show any weakness. For them, the best defense 
is a good offense,” he said.</p>
<p>Yet Snyder said Kim Jong Un’s standing as a new, untested ruler is “the real wild-card factor that makes this different.” …</p>
<p>A hit on U.S. targets seems highly unlikely and would be “suicidal,” 
Lee said. But South Korea and Japan are within striking distance, and 
many experts say it’s not impossible that Kim Jong Un could act rashly.</p>
<p>“While these weapons can’t reach the U.S., it’s an extremely tense 
situation, and wars don’t always start logically,” Wit said. …</p>

<p>As North Korea — under its 29-year-old leader — makes ever-more 
bellicose threats against the United States and South Korea, the 
spotlight is falling on those older heads often seen standing beside

<p>Commentary</p>
<p><span>North Korea’s November 25, 2010 artillery attack on Yeonpyeong 
island, in conjunction with the sinking of the South Korean warship 
Cheonan on March 26, 2010, most likely is indicative of a hardline 
policy shift in North Korea coinciding with the military leadership 
cementing its control over Kim Jong-il’s successor, Kim Jong-un.</span></p>
<p><span>In that context, my 2003 assessment of the threat posed by 
North Korea, conducted for the U.S. military, should no longer be 
regarded as valid.</span></p>
<p><span>Consequently, South Korea, the United States, and their allies 
now face an elevated military threat from North Korea, with the imminent
 risk that miscalculation on the part of South Korea or the U.S. could 
prompt misperception on the part of North Korean decision-makers, 
resulting in a military conflagration.</span></p>
<p><span>As suggested in my 2003 threat assessment and associated 
briefing reports in 2004 and 2005, the ability of the United States and 
its allies to emerge victorious from a militarily conflict with North 
Korea is not at issue; the point is that it will be a Pyrrhic victory, 
considering the capacity of the North to inflict mass civilian 
casualties on South Korea — most notably in Seoul — where fatalities 
could run into the hundreds of thousands.</span></p>

Science at Yonsei University in South Korea. … Moon added that his aunt,

<p> April 12, 2013</p>
<p>Faced with annoyed allies and unblinking enemies, North Korea is 
likely to pull the plug on the current crisis by test-firing a missile 
or two and declaring victory ahead of a national celebration on Monday, 
analysts say.</p>
<p>After weeks of escalating tensions and threatening nuclear war, 
shooting off a missile that causes no damage will give Kim Jong Un the 
opportunity to save face with his people — and appease his military — 
without inviting serious retaliation, experts say. …</p>
<p>Observers caution, however, that with so much unknown about the 
political situation inside the secretive rogue state, it’s possible that
 North Korea could take more aggressive action that would goad a fed-up 
South Korea into a forceful reaction. …</p>
<p>Experts agree, however, that because the leadership dynamics in 
Pyongyang are murky, it’s impossible to know how far Kim, or whoever is 
running the country, will go.</p>
<p>Many believe Kim’s incessant saber-rattling — irritating even China 
and Russia — is an effort to recompense North Korea’s powerful military 
leaders and consolidate a weak power base. …</p>
<p>[Doug Bandow of the Cato Institute] said the danger of trying to

 Kim, his aunt and uncle, or the generals? …</p>

<p><span>By</span> <span>Jethro Mullen</span></p>
<p> April 18, 2013</p>
<p>President Barack Obama has said he doesn’t believe North Korea can 
fit a nuclear warhead on a missile, casting strong doubt on an alarming 
assessment disclosed last week by the Pentagon’s intelligence arm.</p>
<p>And he warned the young North Korean leader Kim Jong Un that weeks of
 threats against the United States and South Korea had only served to 
isolate the regime further. …</p>
<p>Recent threats</p>
<p>Obama said that North Korea’s recent behavior under Kim Jong Un was both familiar and counterproductive.</p>
<p>“This is the same kind of pattern that we saw his father engage in 
and his grandfather before that,” he said, referring to the two previous
 North Korean leaders Kim Jong Il and Kim Il Sung. “Since I came into 
office, the one thing I was clear about was, we’re not going to reward 
this kind of provocative behavior. You don’t get to bang your spoon on 
the table and somehow you get your way.”</p>
<p>‘I’m not a psychiatrist’</p>
<p>Asked if he thought Kim Jong Un was unstable, Obama said, “I’m not a psychiatrist, and, I don’t know the leader of North Korea.”</p>
<p>But he said that “the actions they’ve taken, the rhetoric they’ve engaged in has been provocative.” …</p>

<p> May 6, 2013</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The black hole of North Korea intelligence gathering is getting blacker. …</p>
<p>When President Obama and South Korea’s new president, Park Geun-hye, 
meet for the first time at the White House on Tuesday, intelligence 
officials and outside experts say, they will be working, by necessity, 
from a deeply incomplete understanding of their common adversary. At a 
time when the United States has learned to conduct drone strikes with 
increasing accuracy in Pakistan, and direct cyberweapons at specific 
nuclear centrifuges deep under the Iranian desert, its understanding of 
North Korea’s leadership and weapons systems has actually gotten worse. …</p>
<p>The most recent intelligence failures included what administration 
officials now acknowledge was the C.I.A.’s initial judgment — now 
reversed — that the North’s young new leader, <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/k/kim_jongun/index.html?inline=nyt-per" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Kim Jong-un</span></a>,
 was probably more interested in economic reform than in following his 
father’s and grandfather’s “military first” policy of bolstering the 
North’s missile and nuclear arsenals, and threatening to use them unless
 the world came to its door. …</p>
<p>In a sign of continuing confusion, the Defense Intelligence Agency — 
the Pentagon’s intelligence arm — recently declared with “moderate 
confidence” that the North can now shrink a nuclear warhead to fit onto 
one of those missiles, only to find its assessment disputed, in public, 
by both President Obama and the director of national intelligence. …</p>
<p>The depth of the inability to figure out what is happening was 
reflected on Thursday in an unclassified Pentagon report to Congress on 
North Korea’s military capabilities, which read much like it had been 
written in the late 1980s. It also cast, by implication, significant 
doubt that returning to negotiations would do much good: “In North 
Korea’s view,” it concluded, “the destruction of regimes such as 
Ceausescu, Hussein and Qaddafi was not an inevitable consequence of 
repressive government, but rather of a failure to secure the necessary 
capabilities to defend their respective autocratic regime’s survival.”</p>
<p>But the more immediate concern is that Kim Jong-un could follow North
 Korea’s recent playbook and create another provocation — akin to the 
sinking of a South Korean navy ship in 2010 or the recent cyberattack on
 South Korean banks and news media companies. It took weeks of 
investigation before South Korea could blame the North for those past 
provocations. …</p>
<p>But the heart of the intelligence weakness centers on Mr. Kim, who is
 thought to be in his late 20s. The Chinese, who regularly invited his 
father, <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/k/_kim_jong_il/index.html?inline=nyt-per" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Kim Jong-il</span></a>,
 to Beijing for consultations, praise and occasional dressing-downs, 
contend they have had few meetings with him. The only American to have 
dealt with him, quite famously, is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/01/sports/basketball/dennis-rodman-meets-north-korean-leader.html" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Dennis Rodman</span></a>,
 the former basketball star, whom the F.B.I. was reported to have 
debriefed after he returned from a recent trip to North Korea. …</p>
<p>In fact, in South Korea there is a theory that behind his baby-faced 
look and easy smile is a Machiavellian who already has top generals and 
party secretaries cowering at home, and is gambling that he can force 
Washington to accept the North as a nuclear power.</p>
<p>South Korean officials were surprised to conclude in recent months 
that despite Mr. Kim’s youth and inexperience, his government and party 
are exerting control over the military, which many regarded as too 
influential and too corrupt for that to occur. By some counts, 
two-thirds of the North’s senior generals have been demoted, replaced or
 shunted to less-powerful jobs; a few have been banished by the young 
leader. All have had to sign loyalty letters.</p>
<p>Yet the view that Mr. Kim has become as powerful as his father is not
 universal. “Who is in charge in North Korea? It’s hard to say,” said a 
senior South Korean policy maker. “How strong is Kim Jong-un? We don’t 
know exactly. Who is giving orders in Pyongyang? Apparently, it’s Kim 
Jong-un, but we are not sure about the inner-circle decision-making 
process.” <span>[emphasis added]</span></p>
<p>It is a measure of the varying interpretations inside the United 
States government that, testifying before the Senate Armed Services 
Committee, Adm. Samuel J. Locklear III, the head of the Pacific Command,
 called Mr. Kim “impetuous” and “more unpredictable” than his father. 
But speaking to the same committee, Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, the 
Defense Intelligence Agency’s director, called Mr. Kim a leader “firmly 
in control” who “possesses a charisma that his father did not,” and who 
understands realpolitik, including that he could not survive full-scale 
war. …</p>

of the Central Committee of the Workers’ Party in Pyongyang on Sunday, 
Dec. 8, 2013. (KCTV / Yonhap via EPA)</span></p>
<p><span>By</span> <span>Eric Talmadge</span></p>
<p> December 13, 2013</p>
<p>PYONGYANG, North Korea — The execution of North Korean leader Kim 
Jong Un’s uncle brought a swift and violent end to a man long considered
 the country’s second-most powerful. But while Jang Song Thaek is now 
gone, the fallout from his bloody purge is not over.</p>
<p>In a stunning reversal of the popular image of Jang as a mentor and 
father figure guiding young Kim Jong Un as he consolidated power, North 
Korea’s state-run media on Friday announced he had been executed and 
portrayed him as a morally corrupt traitor who saw the death of Kim’s 
father, Kim Jong Il, in December 2011 as an opportunity to make his own 
power play.</p>
<p>Experts who study the authoritarian country, which closely guards its
 internal workings from both outsiders and citizens, were divided on 
whether the sudden turn of events reflected turmoil within the highest 
levels of power or signaled that Kim Jong Un was consolidating his power
 in a decisive show of strength. Either way, the purge is an unsettling 
development for a world that is already wary of Kim’s unpredictability 
amid North Korea’s attempts to develop nuclear weapons. …</p>
<p>The first appearance of the new narrative came out just days ago, 
when North Korea accused Jang, 67, of corruption, womanizing, gambling 
and taking drugs. It said he’d been eliminated from all his posts. 
Friday’s allegations heaped on claims that he tried “to overthrow the 
state by all sorts of intrigues and despicable methods with a wild 
ambition to grab the supreme power of our party and state.” …</p>
<p>South Korean intelligence officials say two of Jang’s closest aides have already been executed last month.</p>
<p>Narushige Michishita, a security expert at the National Graduate 
Institute for Policy Studies in Tokyo, suggested that Jang’s removal 
shows “that Kim Jong Un has the guts to hold onto power, and this might 
have shown his will to power, his willingness to get rid of anything 
that stands in his way.” …</p>
<p>Jang’s removal leaves no clear No. 2 under Kim, whose inner circle 
now includes Vice Marshal Choe Ryong Hae, Premier Pak Pong Ju, and Kim 
Yong Nam, the ceremonial head of state. …</p>
<p>State media said Jang was tried for treason by a special military tribunal and executed Thursday. …</p>
<p>Jang was seen prominently by Kim Jong Un’s side as he walked by his 
father’s hearse during his 2011 funeral. He was also a fixture at the 
new leader’s side as he toured the country.</p>
<p>The KCNA report was unusually specific in its accusations. In 
particular, it criticized Jang for not rising and applauding his 
nephew’s appointment to a senior position because Jang “thought that if 
Kim Jong Un’s base and system for leading the army were consolidated, 
this would lay a stumbling block in the way of grabbing the power.” …</p>
<p>Jang’s death could herald a “reign of terror,” including more purges,
 said Lim Eul Chul, a North Korea expert at South Korea’s Kyungnam 
University.</p>
<p>Another question mark is how the purge will impact North Korea’s 
relationship with its only major ally, China. Jang had been seen as the 
leading supporter of Chinese-style economic reforms and an important 
link between Pyongyang and Beijing. China has called Jang’s execution a 
domestic issue and has avoided further public comment. …</p>

its roots in a firefight between forces loyal to Mr. Kim and those

 (Jeremy Diamond and Zachary Cohen, CNN, May 1, 2017) — President Donald
 Trump said Monday he would be willing to meet with North Korean leader 
Kim Jong Un “under the right circumstances” to defuse tensions over 
North Korea’s nuclear program. “If it would be appropriate for me to 
meet with him, I would absolutely, I would be honored to do it,” Trump <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-05-01/trump-says-he-d-meet-with-north-korea-s-kim-if-situation-s-right" rel="noopener noreferrer">told Bloomberg News</a>

<p><span>By</span> <a href="https://www.acsh.org/profile/alex-berezow" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Alex Berezow</span></a></p>
<p> <span>The American Council on Science and Health</span></p>
<p> August 8, 2017</p>
<p>Winston Churchill once said that Russia is “a riddle, wrapped in a 
mystery, inside an enigma.” That’s in many ways still true. However, 
Russia is a complete open book compared to the Hermit Kingdom.</p>
<p>The latest development in the ongoing saga of North Korea is Kim 
Jong-Un’s threat to attack Guam. If he was capable of that (and he very 
well might be), would he actually do it?</p>
<p>That sort of question is the domain of intelligence analysts and 
others who engage in psychological profiling. One public source of 
information on this is the <a href="http://personality-politics.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unit for the Study of Personality in Politics</a>, a research project directed by psychology professor Aubrey Immelman. The unit has a page dedicated to <a href="http://personality-politics.org/north-korea" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim Jong-Un</a>, which has been updated sporadically as more information has become available.</p>
<p>The team’s initial assessment, published in April 2013, was that Mr. 
Kim is a congenial-cooperative leader, displaying traits such as 
agreeableness, charm, and a need for external approval. The team 
concluded that Mr. Kim’s personality was inconsistent with North Korea’s
 continued belligerence, which made the profilers wonder if somebody 
else was actually running the country.</p>
<p>This was a perfectly decent psychological profile, but it certainly 
seems to be wrong. In August 2012, a writer for Foreign Policy <a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2012/08/21/kim-jong-un-is-no-reformer/" rel="noopener noreferrer">warned</a>,
 “The North Korean regime will not change because Little Kim studied in 
Switzerland, likes Mickey Mouse, and has a hot wife.” Indeed, North 
Korea’s aggression has only increased in the years since.</p>
<p>Kim Jong-Un: An Updated Psychological Profile</p>
<p>In April of this year <span>[2017]</span>, Prof. Immelman’s team 
updated Mr. Kim’s profile with another detailed assessment. Once again, 
they found that the dictator’s personal psychological profile is rather 
benign and similar to that of recent U.S. presidents, specifically in 
areas such as aggressiveness and cooperativeness. In fact, the authors 
conclude that “at worst, [he has] only a moderate predisposition to 
aggressive behavior.” <span>[Note:</span> <a href="https://digitalcommons.csbsju.edu/psychology_pubs/119/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>New update published April 2018</span></a><span>]</span></p>
<p>This is difficult to believe, however, given that Mr. Kim murdered his half-brother, Kim Jong-Nam, with <a href="http://www.acsh.org/news/2017/02/23/vx-nerve-agent-killed-kim-jong-nam-how-does-it-work-10904" rel="noopener noreferrer">VX nerve agent</a>
 in February. But the profilers would likely warn us that it is very 
easy to conflate an individual leader’s psychological profile with the 
actions of the regime. It is possible, for instance, that Mr. Kim’s 
advisors told him to murder his half-brother, and he did so. Without 
access to classified information — which the authors do not have — 
trying to decipher the behavior of such an enigmatic figure is like 
reading tea leaves.</p>
<p>Would Kim Jong-Un Attack Guam?</p>
<p>What can a psychological profile tell us about whether Mr. Kim would 
attack Guam? Not much, it seems. Even if it is true that Mr. Kim is not 
personally aggressive, it has become clear that he has allowed his 
regime to behave that way. North Korea is armed to the teeth, and it may
 even possess a <a href="http://www.acsh.org/news/2017/07/26/does-north-korea-have-biological-weapons-program-11615" rel="noopener noreferrer">biological weapons program</a>.</p>
<p>When a person with big guns and bombs makes threats, we should take 
him seriously. We don’t need a psychological profile to reach that 
conclusion.</p>

<p><span>By</span> <span>Steven Jiang</span> <span>and</span> <span>Joshua Berlinger</span></p>
<p> March 28, 2018</p>
<p><span>Excerpts</span></p>
<p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un met with the Chinese president on a 
surprise trip to Beijing this week, his first visit abroad since he took
 power in 2011.</p>
<p>Kim traveled to the Chinese capital because he felt compelled to 
personally inform President Xi Jinping of the rapid diplomatic 
developments on the Korean Peninsula in recent weeks, according to 
China’s state-run Xinhua news agency.</p>
<p>The visit is a stunning shift for Kim, who appears to be fashioning 
himself as a leader in search of a peaceful solution to the crisis on 
the Korean Peninsula. It’s in sharp contrast to 2017, when Kim oversaw a
 string of missile and nuclear tests that drew the ire of the 
international community.</p>
<p>Kim’s trip, which was shrouded in secrecy, was the first of three 
potential meetings with some of the world’s most powerful leaders.</p>
<p>Kim is set to attend a summit with South Korean President Moon Jae-in
 next month, and, in a bombshell move, US President Donald Trump has 
also accepted an invitation to meet Kim. It would be the first 
face-to-face encounter between a sitting US president and a North Korean
 head of state. …</p>
<p>Kim called for a “new era” in bilateral relations in a letter to Xi 
published on North Korean state media and invited the Chinese President 
to visit Pyongyang.</p>
<p>“In this spring full of happiness and hopes, I believe my first 
meeting with General Secretary Xi Jinping will yield abundant fruits of 
DPRK-China friendship, and facilitate peace and stability on the Korean 
Peninsula,” said Kim, referring to Xi by his title as leader of the 
Chinese Communist Party. …</p>
<p>North Korea’s diplomatic charm offensive is likely part of an attempt
 to show Kim as a world player equal in stature to leaders like Xi, said
 Jean Lee, an analyst at the Hyundai Motor-Korea Foundation Center for 
Korean History and Public Policy at The Wilson Center.</p>
<p>“We’re seeing a carefully crafted North Korean strategy on diplomacy 
unfold on the world stage, starting with Beijing,” Lee said.</p>
<p>“He’s positioned himself as the peacemaker, he’s made all the first moves.”</p>
<p>Kim told his hosts that he chose China as his first overseas 
destination as leader to show “his will to carry forward the tradition 
of DPRK-China friendship, and how he valued the friendship between the 
two countries.”</p>
<p>Chinese state media quoted Kim as saying that he is committed to the 
denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, a key Chinese goal, but Lee 
warned Kim would seek major concessions in exchange for giving up 
nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>“The issue of denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula can be 
resolved, if South Korea and the United States respond to our efforts 
with goodwill, create an atmosphere of peace and stability while taking 
progressive and synchronous measures for the realization of peace,” Kim 
said, according to Xinhua. …</p>

<p>The leaders of North and South Korea will meet on April 27 for the 
first time since 2007, the two countries announced Thursday after 
high-level talks.</p>
<p>The landmark meeting between President Moon Jae-in and Kim Jong Un 
will be held at Freedom House on the southern side of the Demilitarized 
Zone (DMZ), according to the joint statement issued after the talks.</p>
<p>Officials from both sides will hold working-level talks on April 4 to
 prepare for the meeting and agree on security and media arrangements, 
it added. …</p>
<p>The last Inter-Korean summit was held in October 2007, when then President Roh Moo-hyun met Kim’s father, Kim Jong Il. …</p>
<p>On Thursday, high-ranking Chinese diplomat and Politburo member Yang 
Jiechi arrived in Seoul to brief South Korean officials on the North 
Korean leader’s visit to Beijing.</p>
<p>The Kim-Moon summit will precede a bombshell encounter between the 
young North Korean leader and US President Donald Trump — the first time
 a sitting US leader has met with a member of the Kim dynasty. …</p>
<p>Thursday’s North and South Korean delegations were both headed by the
 same men who engaged in the first negotiations in January, after 
Pyongyang agreed to reopen diplomatic communications with Seoul.</p>
<p>Ri Son Gwon, chairman of Pyongyang’s “Committee for the Peaceful 
Reunification of the Country” led the North Korean delegation while 
Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyon represents Seoul. …</p>
<p>This year’s diplomatic thaw comes in sharp contrast to 2017 when the 
peninsula appeared to be barreling toward conflict, with Kim overseeing a
 string of missile and nuclear tests and Trump promising “fire and fury”
 as Pyongyang threatened Guam, Hawaii and even the US mainland. …</p>

<p><span>By</span> <span>Kevin Liptak</span> <span>and</span> <span>Jeremy Diamond</span></p>
<p> March 29, 2018</p>
<p><span>Excerpts</span></p>
<p>President Donald Trump’s rosy outlook at the prospect of meeting with
 North Korean despot Kim Jong Un is about to hit a wall of hard truths 
erected by US allies, outside experts and officials within his 
administration. …</p>
<p>Privately, Trump has made clear to advisers that he wants the meeting
 to happen, expressing few reservations about the prospects of a 
face-to-face meeting with Kim, a source familiar with the ongoing 
negotiations said. But in the coming weeks, US officials and at least 
one key US ally will look to dampen that optimism.</p>
<p>Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will come bearing a list of 
concerns over Trump’s face-to-face with Kim when he arrives in the US 
next month to meet with the President, a person familiar with the 
Japanese efforts said. The meeting — which could occur at Trump’s 
Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida after he returns from a trip to South 
America — came at Abe’s insistence after learning that Trump had 
accepted an invitation to meet with Kim. …</p>
<p>Just this month — days before Trump quickly accepted North Korea’s 
invitation to meet — senior administration officials told reporters the 
US would not hold direct talks until North Korea takes “concrete steps” 
toward denuclearization. That condition has since been discarded, but 
now those officials are working to ensure Trump does not walk into his 
meeting with Kim with unduly high expectations.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t say optimism is called for right now. I would be very 
cautious because … what North Korea expects out of this summit and what 
the US expect may not be potentially aligned,” said Sue Mi Terry, a 
former CIA analyst and North Korea expert. “Optimism is the last word I 
would use for this.” …</p>
<p>The planning for a summit has included Mike Pompeo, the director of 
the CIA whom Trump has tapped to become secretary of state. …</p>
<p>As the White House works to secure his confirmation, Pompeo and a 
team at the CIA have been working through intelligence backchannels to 
make preparations for the Kim talks. Meanwhile, officials at the State 
Department — led by Marc Knapper, the chargé d’affaires in Seoul, and 
Susan Thornton, the assistant secretary of State for East Asian and 
Pacific affairs — have been working separately to prepare for the 
summit. …</p>
<p>The efforts have fed into a working group convened by the National Security Council’s top Asia hand, Matthew Pottinger. …</p>
<p>US officials say the talks will most likely take place in late May — or perhaps even June — should they occur. …</p>
<p>The White House has declined to say whether official contact has yet 
been established between North Korea and Washington, which would allow 
US officials to confirm whether Kim had indeed vowed to halt missile and
 nuclear testing ahead of talks. In the absence of that confirmation, 
Trump and his aides have relied partly on the characterizations of the 
South Koreans, who came bearing the invitation earlier this month, and 
the Chinese, who provided a briefing to the White House on Tuesday after
 Kim and President Xi Jinping met in Beijing.</p>
<p>According to Chinese state media, Kim told Xi he was open to summit 
talks with Trump. But the North Koreans have not themselves confirmed 
Kim’s intent to meet with Trump.</p>
<p>“If South Korea and the United States respond with good will to our 
efforts and create an atmosphere of peace and stability, and take 
phased, synchronized measures to achieve peace, the issue of the 
denuclearization of the peninsula can reach resolution,” Kim said, 
according to Xinhua. …</p>
<p>Senior administration officials spent Wednesday trying to decipher 
North Korean intentions following Kim’s meeting with Xi. Some officials 
noted the optics — including body language and rhetoric — from both the 
North Koreans and the Chinese was hardly warm and fuzzy, determining the
 meeting appeared like it was for show.</p>
<p>China’s ambassador in Washington, Cui Tiankai, traveled to the White 
House on Tuesday afternoon to brief officials, confirming that it was 
indeed Kim who had paid a visit to President Xi Jinping. In their 
conversations, they dictated a message to Trump from Xi which was 
subsequently shared with the President. …</p>

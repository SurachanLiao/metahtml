<p><span>R</span>adio host Hugh Hewitt interviewed Donald Trump Thursday
 and asked the Republican frontrunner some details on foreign policy. 
After Trump confused some terminology, he accused Hewitt of asking 
"gotcha questions." </p>
<p> Hewitt, who will also be moderating CNN's September 16 presidential 
debate, first asked Trump if he was familiar with General Qasem 
Soleimani. When Trump asked for a little more information about 
Soleimani, Hewitt said, "He runs the Quds Forces," the Iranian military 
unit that engages in terrorism and guerilla tactics outside of Iran. But
 Trump seemed to have confused that term with the Kurds, an ethnic group
 being targeted by ISIS in northern Iraq. </p>
<p> "The Kurds, by the way, have been horribly mistreated," Trump began. </p>
<p> "No, not the Kurds," Hewitt cut in. "The Quds Forces, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard's Quds Forces." </p>
<p> In the interview, Trump also expressed his belief that it isn't 
important at the moment that he know the difference between Hamas (the 
Palestinian political and paramilitary group) and Hezbollah (the 
Iran-backed political party in Lebanon). He also said asking about who 
the various leaders and players in the Middle East was asking about 
"history" because those leaders would likely not be in power by the time
 Trump became president. </p>
<p> Trump called Hewitt's inquiries "gotcha questions," although the 
level of detail Hewitt asked about was not different from that he's 
asked of other Republican candidates. Listen to excerpts from the 
interview below: </p>
<p> Update: Hewitt later recorded an interview with Trump rival Carly 
Fiorina. The radio host claimed Fiorina was not aware of Trump's 
interview and asked her the same questions he asked Trump. Fiorina, the 
former CEO of HP, responded somewhat better than Trump to the same 
questions. </p>

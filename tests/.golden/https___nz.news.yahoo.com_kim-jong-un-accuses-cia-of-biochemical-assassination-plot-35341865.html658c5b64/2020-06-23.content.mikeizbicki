<h1 class="rm-manual">Kim Jong Un accuses CIA of biochemical assassination plot</h1>
<p class="rm-manual"><span><span><a href="https://www.afp.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">AFP</a></span></span>•6 May 2017</p>
<p>North Korea on Friday accused the CIA and Seoul's intelligence 
services of conspiring to assassinate the isolated country's leader Kim 
Jong-Un with a biochemical weapon, amid heightened tensions in the 
region.</p>
<p>In a statement the powerful ministry of state security, said it had 
foiled a "vicious plot" by a "hideous terrorist group" to attack the 
North's "supreme leadership".</p>
<p>The accusations come with the US and North trading threats over the 
latter's nuclear and missile programmes, and as Washington considers 
whether to re-designate Pyongyang as a state sponsor of terrorism.</p>
<p>That follows the killing of Kim's estranged half-brother Kim Jong-Nam
 by two women using the banned nerve agent VX at Kuala Lumpur 
international airport.</p>

</ul>
<p>Both Malaysia and South Korea have blamed the North for the 
assassination, which retorts that the accusations are an attempt to 
smear it.</p>
<p>The security ministry statement, carried on the North's official 
Korea Central News Agency (KCNA), said the CIA and the South's 
intelligence had suborned, bribed and blackmailed a North Korean citizen
 named only as Kim to carry out the attack.</p>
<p>Possible locations included the mausoleum where Kim Jong-Un's father 
and grandfather -- the North's founder -- lie in state, or a military 
parade.</p>
<p>Such an operation would be extremely difficult to prepare and carry 
out successfully. The North's leader is surrounded by tight security at 
all times, and Pyongyang maintains a gigantic surveillance system over 
its own population that is ingrained at every level of society, where 
open dissent is unknown.</p>
<p>The CIA told its agent Kim it had access to radioactive and "nano 
poisonous" substances whose lethal results would appear only after six 
to 12 months, the statement said.</p>
<p>Kim -- described as "human scum" -- received payments totalling at 
least $740,000 and was given satellite transceivers and other materials 
and equipment, it said.</p>
<p>He had multiple contacts with South Korean intelligence personnel, 
and an accomplice who had a Chinese-sounding name, Xu Guanghai of the 
Qingdao Nazca Trade Co.</p>
<p>Checks on China's National Enterprise Credit Information system show 
that a company of that name was formed on March 7 this year, with a Xu 
Guanghai named as its legal representative, and business areas including
 "chemical products".</p>
<p>No details were given in the ministry statement of how the supposed 
plot was uncovered, or of Kim's fate. But in a potential sign of an 
internal purge, it said that the ministry will "ferret out and 
mercilessly destroy the terrorists".</p>
<h2>'Empire of evil'</h2>
<p>The lurid accusations come with Pyongyang and Washington at 
loggerheads over the North's banned weapons programmes, which have seen 
it subjected to multiple sets of United Nations Security Council 
sanctions.</p>
<p>Pyongyang, which says it needs nuclear weapons to defend itself 
against invasion, has carried out a series of missile launches and 
threatened a sixth atomic test, while the administration of new US 
President Donald Trump has said that military action was an "option on 
the table" -- raising fears of a spiralling conflict.</p>
<p>The alleged plot was a "hideous crime" the security ministry said, and tantamount to "the declaration of a war".</p>
<p>The statement came hours after the US House of Representatives in Washington voted to broaden US sanctions against the North.</p>
<p>The measure, which now heads for the Senate, also gave the Trump 
administration 90 days to determine whether Pyongyang should be 
re-designated as a state sponsor of terrorism, after it was removed from
 the list in 2008.</p>
<p>The North Korean statement described the US as a state sponsor of terrorism itself, and an "empire of evil".</p>
<p>Analysts said the accusations could be a pre-emptive attempt to try 
to dissuade Washington from any attempt at a surgical strike on its 
leadership, as suggested by some commentators.</p>
<p>The North believes the US and South are seeking to assassinate Kim, said Professor Koh Yu-Hwan of Dongguk University.</p>
<p>It was "unimaginable that individuals can get close enough to Kim to 
harm him in light of supertight security there", he told AFP.</p>
<p>But the allegation was also "aimed at keeping its people on their 
toes and strengthening its grip on them", and intended "to distance 
itself from the assassination of Jong-Nam who was killed by a chemical 
weapon".</p>
<p>North Korean commandos infiltrated Seoul in January 1968 in a failed 
attempt to assassinate its then leader Park Chung-Hee. Bullet holes are 
still visible on a tree above the presidential Blue House.</p>

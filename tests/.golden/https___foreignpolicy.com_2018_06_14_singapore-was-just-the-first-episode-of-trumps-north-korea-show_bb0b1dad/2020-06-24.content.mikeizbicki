<h2 class="rm-manual">Here are five issues to watch moving forward. </h2>

<p> U.S. President Donald Trump speaks at a press conference following 
the U.S.-North Korea summit in Singapore on June 12. (Saul 
Loeb/AFP/Getty Images) </p>
<p>The past week of summitry has been as disorienting as any in recent 
memory. It started with the worst G-7 meeting ever and ended with U.S. 
President Donald Trump’s historic sit-down with North Korea’s leader 
that displayed all of the skills Trump sharpened as a reality TV host 
and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5TDq5YUCrA">occasional wrestling</a> star, complete with a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/13/trump-video-national-security-council-destiny-pictures">movie trailer</a> that seemed to a be a mashup of a travel commercial and Team America: World Police.</p>
<p>We’ll be spending weeks puzzling over these summits — no doubt 
entertained by more leaks of behind-the-scenes stories and further 
confused by officials scurrying to give conflicting versions of what 
actually happened.</p>
<p>But what does this mean for Trump’s foreign policy? Here are five things I expect to follow the Singapore summit:</p>
<p>1. This was just the first episode of the North Korea show. As Trump <a href="http://time.com/5309357/trump-kim-summit-signing-agreement-comments/">said</a>
 about Kim Jong Un, “We will meet many times.” From the president’s 
perspective, Singapore was a runaway hit. He got wall-to-wall fawning 
television coverage, aired in prime time, with a program that was a 
diplomatic combination of The Apprentice, the Super Bowl and a buddy 
movie.</p>
<p>Sure, experts are wringing their hands because the substance was 
underwhelming, but that’s not a problem in Trump’s world: For two days, 
he presided over the greatest show on earth. Trump understands that, as 
with his off-the-hook political rallies, people can’t turn away. 
Thinking ahead, the usual North Korean foot-dragging won’t be a sign of 
failure — it will only build anticipation for the next episode, perhaps 
coming this fall in New York on the margins of the United Nations 
General Assembly (which would be nice timing for the U.S. congressional 
midterm elections).</p>
<p>2. The issue of U.S. troops in South Korea is not going away. Trump 
offered the biggest substantive surprise of the summit, announcing a 
pause in the U.S. “war games” with South Korea. In typical Trump 
fashion, this apparently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/12/world/asia/trump-military-exercises-north-south-korea.html">wasn’t coordinated</a>
 with either the Pentagon or allies such as South Korea and Japan, and 
in explaining his decision, he parroted the Chinese and North Korean 
line that such exercises aren’t about maintaining military readiness and
 are unnecessarily “provocative.”</p>
<p>For years, Trump has made it clear that he sees little strategic 
value in keeping troops in South Korea — in his mind, this is another 
example of the U.S. wasting money to protect ungrateful allies. And his 
repeated assertion that the potential withdrawal of troops could save a 
lot of money (a dubious claim, given what it costs in military 
readiness) shows he’s laying the groundwork for them to come home. This 
would be the greatest shift in Washington’s approach to Asia since the 
normalization of relations with China in 1979, and it set up a major 
clash with Asian allies, Congress, and Trump’s own Pentagon.</p>
<p>3. The NATO summit could be a train wreck. Think the G-7 was bad? 
Wait until next month when Trump sits down in Brussels with 28 U.S. 
allies, most of whom he thinks are deadbeats for not meeting their 
pledge to spend 2 percent of their GDP on defense. The alliance has 
worked up some good deliverables for leaders to agree to, but it is very
 likely these get overshadowed by major drama over burden-sharing.</p>
<p>NATO summits are tedious for even the most diligent presidents — I 
recall President Barack Obama reading on his iPad during one especially 
boring session — and at this one, Trump’s impatience will be tested 
(last year’s meeting was just a “mini-summit”). He will likely go out of
 his way to create an image to respond to the confrontational <a href="http://time.com/5307314/donald-trump-angela-merkel-g-7-photograph/">photo</a>
 released by the Germans at the G-7. Expect more talk of “old Europe” 
versus “new Europe.” I also wouldn’t be surprised if Trump suggests that
 NATO return to its practice of inviting the Russian president to attend
 summits — last the case in 2010 — which would drive a spike into the 
middle of the alliance.</p>
<p>4. The U.S. midterm elections will make trans-Atlantic relations even
 worse. Even with the likely turbulence to come, we may come to think of
 the NATO summit as smooth compared to the state of trans-Atlantic 
relations after November. If there is no Democratic wave, Trump will be 
further emboldened, and European leaders will be even more dyspeptic and
 resigned to preparing for a post-American world.</p>
<p>If there is a change in power, with Democratic leaders and committee 
chairs working to thwart Trump and promote policies the Europeans favor —
 on climate change, trade, and the Iran nuclear deal — Trump will take 
it personally and assert that Europeans are now siding with his 
political enemies, the very people who are investigating his 
administration and, quite possibly, trying to impeach him. This is going
 to make the “freedom fries” tensions seem quaint.</p>
<p>5. Coming attractions include the diplomatic play with Iran. 
Successful shows spawn sequels — think The Celebrity Apprentice — and 
once the ratings drop for North Korea diplomacy, look for Trump to take 
his act to Iran.</p>
<p>As the summit with North Korea showed, Trump is not burdened by the 
intricacies of nonproliferation policies, and he would find the 
spectacle of an Iranian summit irresistible. Remember that Trump didn’t 
just want to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal, but to pull out of the 
whole of the Middle East, and what better way to do that than to make 
peace with Iran? Sure, leaders in the Gulf and Israel would be 
apoplectic. But they have to know that in Trump’s world, there are never
 any friends, only business associates who can be jettisoned for higher 
profits.</p>

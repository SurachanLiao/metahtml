<figcaption> 17. New Era Pinstripe Bowl Teams: Boston College (7-5) vs. 
Penn State (6-6) When: Saturday, Dec. 27, 4:30 p.m. (ESPN) Where: New 
York, N.Y. Why to watch: While they finished just 7-5, BC showed a 
propensity to rise to the occasion for big games, beating then 
ninth-ranked USC and nearly toppling both Clemson and Florida State. 
Meanwhile, the Nittany Lions took Ohio State to two overtimes before a 
heartbreaking loss. Both teams sport top-20 defenses, which should lead 
to an old-fashioned, low scoring game. Bonus: This has the best venue of
 any game this year -- Yankee Stadium. </figcaption><p> Courtesy: New Era Pinstripe Bowl </p>
<figcaption> 19. Autozone Liberty Bowl Teams: Texas A&amp;M (7-5) vs. 
West Virginia (7-5) When: Monday, Dec. 29, 2 p.m. (ESPN) Where: Memphis,
 Tenn. Why to watch: Both schools notched upsets over top-five programs,
 with A&amp;M toppling Auburn and WVU handing Baylor its lone defeat of 
the year. But missed opportunities in their other big games left each 
team with only seven wins. Both are capable of putting up big numbers, 
especially with Clint Trickett guiding the Mountaineers' ninth-ranked 
passing offense. </figcaption><p> Courtesy: Autozone Liberty Bowl </p>
<figcaption> 20. Russell Athletic Bowl Teams: Oklahoma (8-4) vs. #17 
Clemson (9-3) When: Monday, Dec. 29, 5:30 p.m. (ESPN) Where: Orlando, 
Fla. Why to watch: Once a top-five ranked team, the Sooners took TCU to 
the wire in Fort Worth and battled Kansas State to a one-point game, but
 were blown out in Norman by Baylor, then lost the Bedlam game in a 
stunning finish. They have the talent to compete with a Clemson squad 
that didn't beat a ranked opponent all year. But with a promising season
 derailed, will Trevor Knight and company show up? </figcaption><p> Courtesy: Russell Athletic Bowl </p>
<figcaption> 21. Advocare V100 Texas Bowl Teams: Arkansas (6-6) vs. 
Texas (6-6) When: Monday, Dec. 29, 9 p.m. (ESPN) Where: Houston, Texas 
Why to watch: While both teams are just 6-6, each is playing some of 
their best football of the year. With a Razorbacks defense that blanked 
two top-20 opponents in the final three weeks of the season and a UT 
offense that was held to 10 points or less four times, this game has the
 highest likelihood of producing a shutout in this year's bowl slate. </figcaption><p> Courtesy: Advocare V100 Texas Bowl </p>
<figcaption> 22. Franklin American Mortgage Music City Bowl Teams: Notre
 Dame (7-5) vs. #23 LSU (8-4) When: Tuesday, Dec. 30, 3 p.m. (ESPN) 
Where: Nashville, Tenn. Why to watch: Notre Dame looked to be knocking 
on the door of the playoff picture before entering a death spiral that 
saw them drop five of their final six games. Their reward? A feisty LSU 
team with the nation's third-best scoring defense. Of course, the Tigers
 were nails at Death Valley (averaging less than 12 points per game 
allowed), but were a different team away from home (more than 25 PPG). </figcaption><p> Courtesy: Franklin American Mortgage Music City Bowl </p>
<figcaption> 23. Belk Bowl Teams: #13 Georgia (9-3) vs. #21 Louisville 
(9-3) When: Tuesday, Dec. 30, 6:30 p.m. (ESPN) Where: Charlotte, N.C. 
Why to watch: The first matchup of ranked teams come in…the Belk Bowl. 
It may be an underwhelming title -- and we may still not know exactly 
what Belk is, or what it does -- but the Dawgs crushed Auburn and the 
Cardinals won in South Bend, so both teams have bona fide resumes 
heading into what should be an entertaining matchup. </figcaption><p> Courtesy: Belk Bowl </p>
<figcaption> 24. Foster Farms Bowl Teams: Maryland (7-5) vs. Stanford 
(7-5) When: Tuesday, Dec. 30, 10 p.m. (ESPN) Where: Santa Clara, Calif. 
Why to watch: Let's see, a 10 p.m. ET start against a power conference 
program playing less than 15 miles from campus? That's not an ideal 
setup for the Terps, who at +14 are the biggest underdog of the bowl 
season. Then again, Randy Edsall's crew was 5-1 away from College Park 
this year, with wins in Happy Valley and The Big House. Don't count them
 out yet. </figcaption><p> Courtesy: Foster Farms Bowl </p>
<figcaption> 25. Chick-Fil-A Peach Bowl Teams: #9 Ole Miss (9-3) vs. #6 
TCU (11-1) When: Wednesday, Dec. 31, 12:30 p.m. (ESPN) Where: Atlanta, 
Ga. Why to watch: Now we're talking. This clash of top-10 programs who 
each occupied a playoff spot at some point this year is a perfect start 
to the second-best day of games this year. TCU's second-ranked offense 
(46.8 points per game) runs into the Rebels' top scoring defense (13.8 
PPG). The Horned Frogs (-3) will look to show the committee that they 
deserved a spot in the final four. </figcaption><p> Courtesy: Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl </p>
<figcaption> 26. Vizio Fiesta Bowl Teams: #20 Boise State (11-2) vs. #10
 Arizona (10-3) When: Wednesday, Dec. 31, 4 p.m. (ESPN) Where: Glendale,
 Ariz. Why to watch: Have you ever seen Boise State in a big bowl game? 
The Broncos have only produced two of the most exciting college football
 games of all time. The hook and ladder. The Statue of Liberty play. 
On-field marriage proposals. Miss this game at your own peril. </figcaption><p> Courtesy: Vizio Fiesta Bowl </p>
<figcaption> 27. Capital One Orange Bowl Teams: #7 Mississippi State 
(10-2) vs. #12 Georgia Tech (10-3) When: Wednesday, Dec. 31, 8 p.m. 
(ESPN) Where: Miami, Fla. Why to watch: Georgia Tech was the biggest 
surprise in college football this year outside of TCU, riding the 
nation's third-best rushing attack to a road upset of in-state SEC rival
 Georgia and a near-takedown of Florida State in the ACC title game. 
Mississippi State, meanwhile, saw its big wins (Texas A&amp;M, Auburn) 
diminished as the season progressed, then lost to both Alabama and Ole 
Miss late to fall out of the playoff picture. Can the Yellow Jackets 
expose the SEC again? </figcaption><p> Courtesy: Capital One Orange Bowl </p>
<figcaption> 28. Outback Bowl Teams: #19 Auburn (8-4) vs. #18 Wisconsin 
(10-3) When: Thursday, Jan. 1, 12 p.m. (ESPN2) Where: Tampa, Fla. Why to
 watch: While this matchup probably looked better at the beginning of 
the year than it does now, both teams have registered a pair of top-20 
wins. Wisconsin rode Heisman finalist Melvin Gordon through their Big 10
 slate, but will the feature back be able to carry the Badgers against 
the Tigers, or did Ohio State expose Wisconsin's weaknesses in that 
unsightly conference title game? </figcaption><p> Courtesy: Outback Bowl </p>
<figcaption> 29. Goodyear Cotton Bowl Classic Teams: #8 Michigan State 
(10-2) vs. #5 Baylor (11-1) When: Thursday, Jan. 1, 12:30 p.m. (ESPN) 
Where: Arlington, Texas Why to watch: Baylor gets its chance to make the
 committee look bad for excluding them, drawing a top-10 Michigan State 
squad in a virtual home game. The Spartans rank 7th in points scored and
 12th in points against, but struggled the most this year in a 19-point 
loss in Eugene, against an Oregon squad that operates very similarly to 
the Bears. Baylor has the top scoring offense in the nation and has not 
scored less than 27 points in any game. Can Sparty keep up? </figcaption><p> Courtesy: Goodyear Cotton Bowl Classic </p>
<figcaption> 30. Buffalo Wild Wings Citrus Bowl Teams: #16 Missouri 
(10-3) vs. #25 Minnesota (8-4) When: Thursday, Jan. 1, 1 p.m. (ABC) 
Where: Orlando, Fla. Why to watch: The networks probably wish they could
 swap coverage for this game. Easily the weakest of the New Year's Day 
bowls, this matchup features Mizzou and Minnesota squads that combined 
for a grand total of zero wins against teams that finished in the Top 
25. But hey, you need something to watch during the commercial breaks of
 Baylor-Michigan State, which figure to be plentiful. </figcaption><p> Courtesy: Buffalo Wild Wings Citrus Bowl </p>
<figcaption> 31. Rose Bowl Game, Presented by Northwestern Mutual 
(Semifinal) Teams: #2 Oregon (12-1) vs. #3 Florida State (13-0) When: 
Thursday, Jan. 1, 5 p.m. (ESPN) Where: Pasadena, Calif. Why to watch: 
The Grandaddy of Them All may be just a semifinal game this year, but 
it's still a dandy. The last two Heisman Trophy winners will square off 
as Oregon looks to finally break through and vanquish America's villain,
 the Florida State Seminoles. Vegas has the Ducks as nine-point 
favorites, but if the Ducks' defense can force Jameis Winston into 
mistakes, Marcus Mariota and company -- who haven't won a game by fewer 
than 25 points since Oct. 11 -- may deliver an even bigger knockout 
blow. </figcaption><p> Courtesy: Rose Bowl Game, Presented by Northwestern Mutual </p>
<figcaption> 32. Allstate Sugar Bowl (Semifinal) Teams: #1 Alabama 
(12-1) vs. #4 Ohio State (12-1) When: Thursday, Jan. 1, 8:30 p.m. Where:
 New Orleans, La. Why to watch: Saban vs. Meyer. One legacy program 
against another. As if you needed any additional reason to watch a 
national semifinal game, the prospect of seeing one of the most reviled 
programs in the nation knocked out should make nearly every college 
football fan happy. Did Ohio State deserve to make the playoff? Prove 
it. (Courtesy: Allstate Sugar Bowl </figcaption><p> ESPN </p>
<figcaption> 33. Lockheed Martin Armed Forces Bowl Teams: Houston (7-5) 
vs. Pittsburgh (6-6) When: Friday, Jan. 2, 12 p.m. (ESPN) Where: Fort 
Worth, Texas Why to watch: While it's odd to take a step back in terms 
of important bowl games after New Year's Day, games like this function 
like the NIT between the first two weekends of March Madness. There's 
still football on TV. That's all you can really ask for, right? </figcaption><p> Courtesy: Lockheed Martin Armed Forces Bowl </p>
<figcaption> 34. Taxslayer Bowl Teams: Iowa (7-5) vs. Tennessee (6-6) 
When: Friday, Jan. 2, 3:20 p.m. (ESPN) Where: Jacksonville, Fla. Why to 
watch: The best sponsor name of any bowl this year comes buried in the 
post-New Year's purgatory of two middling major-conference programs. 
Iowa lost at home to Iowa State and the Hawkeyes' most impressive win 
this year was…at Pitt? Maybe? Tennessee won in overtime at South 
Carolina. The Vols also lost at home to Florida, 10-9. </figcaption><p> Courtesy: Taxslayer Bowl </p>
<figcaption> 35. Valero Alamo Bowl Teams: #11 Kansas State vs. #14 UCLA 
When: Friday, Jan. 2, 6:45 p.m. (ESPN) Where: San Antonio, Texas Why to 
watch: Bill Snyder is the man. He is, perhaps, the only reason K-State 
isn't the laughingstock of the Big 12, building up the program from 
nothing, retiring, then coming back to do it all over again. His 
overachieving Wildcats take on the underachieving Bruins and Brett 
Hundley, who probably should have lost at Virginia, at home against 
Texas and at Cal. UCLA is clearly more talented, but can Snyder coach 
his way to a win? </figcaption><p> Courtesy: Valero Alamo Bowl </p>
<figcaption> 36. TicketCity Cactus Bowl Teams: Washington (8-5) vs. 
Oklahoma State (6-6) When: Friday, Jan. 2, 10:15 p.m. (ESPN) Where: 
Tempe, Ariz. Why to watch: You may have gone a little too hard on 
Wednesday night. It's OK; we understand. No need to try to go out again 
on Friday. There's football on. No, it's not good football. Yes, 
Oklahoma is the only ranked team (and not ranked anymore) that either 
team beat this year. Just let it wash over you; let it put you to sleep.
 </figcaption><p> Courtesy: TicketCity Cactus Bowl </p>
<figcaption> 37. Birmingham Bowl Teams: East Carolina (8-4) vs. Florida 
(6-5) When: Saturday, Jan. 3, 12 p.m. (ESPN) Where: Birmingham, Ala. 
(where else?) Why to watch: More football! Hey, East Carolina gave us 
one of the more fun blowouts of the season when they hung 70 on UNC. The
 Pirates sport the second-best passing offense in the game, so at least 
we can expect some fireworks. With Will Muschamp already out the door at
 Florida, who knows what to expect out of the Gators? </figcaption><p> Courtesy: Birmingham Bowl </p>
<figcaption> 38. GoDaddy Bowl Teams: Toledo (8-4) vs. Arkansas State 
(7-5) When: Sunday, Jan. 4, 9 p.m. (ESPN) Where: Mobile, Ala. Why to 
watch: Bet you didn't know this game existed. Heck, you might not even 
have known that Arkansas State was an FBS school. This matchup has all 
the allure you would expect from a game scheduled for 9 p.m. on a 
Sunday. But it's your last vestige of college football before the 
eight-day break that leads into the title game. </figcaption><p> Courtesy: GoDaddy Bowl </p>
<figcaption> 39. CFP National Championship Game Presented by AT&amp;T 
Teams: TBD vs. TBD When: Monday, Jan. 12, 8:30 p.m. (ESPN) Where: 
Arlington, Texas Why to watch: This is what we all wanted, right? The 
culmination of a full season of games, picking the top four teams and 
letting them battle each other to the finish. No matter which two teams 
advance, it promises to be a well-watched, exciting matchup. Enjoy. </figcaption><p> Courtesy: CFP National Championship Game Presented by AT&amp;T </p>

 1. R+L Carriers New Orleans Bowl Teams: Nevada (7-5) vs. 
Louisiana-Lafayette (8-4) When: Saturday, Dec. 20, 11 a.m. (ESPN) Where:
 New Orleans, La. Why to watch: The bowl season begins with a virtual 
home game for the school with the greatest nickname in Division I: the 
Ragin' Cajuns. </figcaption><p> Courtesy: R+L Carriers New Orleans Bowl </p>
<figcaption> 2. Gildan New Mexico Bowl Teams: Utah State (9-4) vs. UTEP 
(7-5) When: Saturday, Dec. 20, 2:20 p.m. (ESPN) Where: Albuquerque, N.M.
 Why to watch: The Miners very nearly beat Texas Tech (30-26) early in 
the season, and the Aggies knocked off BYU to hand the Cougars their 
first loss of the year, a 15-point win on the road. </figcaption><p> Courtesy: Gildan New Mexico Bowl </p>
<figcaption> 3. Royal Purple Las Vegas Bowl Teams: #22 Utah (8-4) vs. 
Colorado State (10-2) When: Saturday, Dec. 20, 3:30 p.m. (ABC) Where: 
Las Vegas, Nev. Why to watch: The best matchup of the opening day of 
bowl season features a Utah squad that beat UCLA and USC against a Rams 
team that reeled off nine straight wins before a heartbreaking loss as 
time expired at Air Force in their final regular-season game. </figcaption><p> Courtesy: Royal Purple Las Vegas Bowl </p>
<figcaption> 4. Famous Idaho Potato Bowl Teams: Western Michigan (8-4) 
vs. Air Force (9-3) When: Saturday, Dec. 20, 5:45 p.m. (ESPN) Where: 
Boise, Idaho Why to watch: It's always fun to watch teams compete on the
 frozen blue turf in Boise. Will Air Force -- which handed Boise State 
its lone conference loss -- try to exploit the advantage the Broncos 
often do and wear matching blue uniforms? </figcaption><p> Courtesy: Famous Idaho Potato Bowl </p>
<figcaption> 5. Raycom Media Camellia Bowl Teams: South Alabama (6-6) 
vs. Bowling Green (7-6) When: Saturday, Dec. 20, 9:15 p.m. (ESPN) Where:
 Montgomery, Ala. Why to watch: Game-wise, there isn't much here (South 
Alabama gave Navy a scare…that's about as good as it gets), but it'll be
 worth it to see if whoever gets stuck broadcasting this one can get 
through the title "Raycom Media Camellia Bowl" without stuttering. </figcaption><p> Courtesy: Raycom Media Camellia Bowl </p>
<figcaption> 6. Miami Beach Bowl Teams: BYU (8-4) vs. Memphis (9-3) 
When: Monday, Dec. 22, 2 p.m. (ESPN) Where: Miami, Fla. Why to watch: 
While BYU no doubt was hoping for a more prestigious bowl after a 4-0 
start that included a trouncing of Texas in Austin, they're probably 
happy to be in South Beach in late December. The Cougars draw a stout 
Memphis defense that hasn't allowed more than 20 points since 
mid-October, raking fifth in the nation in points against. </figcaption><p> Courtesy: Miami Beach Bowl </p>
<figcaption> 7. Boca Raton Bowl Teams: Marshall (12-1) vs. Northern 
Illinois (11-2) When: Tuesday, Dec. 23, 6 p.m. (ESPN) Where: Boca Raton,
 Fla. Why to watch: This should be a terrific game between two 
top-flight mid-major programs. Marshall was one devastating 67-66 
overtime loss from an undefeated season, while Northern Illinois 
survived the MACtion and trashed Bowling Green in the conference title 
game to set up this high-powered matchup. </figcaption><p> Courtesy: Boca Raton Bowl </p>
<figcaption> 8. San Diego County Credit Union Poinsettia Bowl Teams: 
Navy (6-5) vs. San Diego State (7-5) When: Tuesday, Dec. 23, 9:30 p.m. 
(ESPN) Where: San Diego, Calif. Why to watch: Aside from the local Navy 
angle, this game is a really well thought-out matchup of two teams that 
enjoy great support in sunny Southern California. The strong naval 
presence in San Diego makes this a home matchup for both teams and 
should sport the most goodwill of any contest this bowl season. </figcaption><p> Courtesy: San Diego County Credit Union Poinsettia Bowl </p>
<figcaption> 9. Popeyes Bahamas Bowl Teams: Central Michigan (7-5) vs. 
Western Kentucky (7-5) When: Wednesday, Dec. 24, 12 p.m. (ESPN) Where: 
Nassau, Bahamas Why to watch: Do you want to live vicariously through 
two Midwestern teams enjoying the warm, island breeze? If that doesn't 
do it for you, enjoy what promises to be a high-scoring affair, as 
Western Kentucky features the number-three passing offense and number 
six-scoring offense in the country. </figcaption><p> Courtesy: Popeyes Bahamas Bowl </p>
<figcaption> 10. Hawai'i Bowl Teams: Fresno State (6-7) vs. Rice (7-5) 
When: Wednesday, Dec. 24, 8 p.m. (ESPN) Where: Honolulu, Hawaii Why to 
watch: Give Fresno State and Rice credit -- each played a tough 
non-conference slate. But neither team beat anybody. That makes the 
chance for a bowl-bound team to finish with eight losses perhaps the 
most compelling storyline in this one. </figcaption><p> Courtesy: Hawai'i Bowl </p>
<figcaption> 11. Zaxby's Heart of Dallas Bowl Teams: Illinois (6-6) vs. 
Louisiana Tech (8-5) When: Friday, Dec. 26, 1 p.m. (ESPN) Where: Dallas,
 Texas Why to watch: After a day off for Christmas, the Big 10 gets its 
first test of the bowl season. Tech gave Marshall a scare and trounced 
bowl-goers UTEP and Western Kentucky. There's a reason the Bulldogs are 
six-point favorites over the Fighting Illini. </figcaption><p> Courtesy: Zaxby's Heart of Dallas Bowl </p>
<figcaption> 12. Quick Lane Bowl Teams: Rutgers (7-5) vs. North Carolina
 (6-6) When: Friday, Dec. 26, 4:30 p.m. (ESPN) Where: Detroit, Mich. Why
 to watch: The Tar Heels have been one of the most enigmatic teams in 
college football this season. They beat decent San Diego State, Georgia 
Tech and Duke teams and took Notre Dame to the wire. They were also 
blown out by East Carolina, Miami and N.C. State. Tune in to see which 
Carolina team shows up against The State University of New Jersey. </figcaption><p> Courtesy: Quick Lane Bowl </p>
<figcaption> 13. Bitcoin St. Petersburg Bowl Teams: N.C. State (7-5) vs.
 UCF (9-3) When: Friday, Dec. 26, 8 p.m. (ESPN) Where: St. Petersburg, 
Fla. Why to watch: Yes, Bitcoin is sponsoring a bowl game. 
Unfortunately, neither team involved won any games of note this year, 
although N.C. State was the first in a line of many to give Florida 
State a scare. No word yet on whether the winner will receive an actual 
trophy or merely online credit. </figcaption><p> Courtesy: Bitcoin St. Petersburg Bowl </p>
<figcaption> 14. Military Bowl, Presented by Northrop Grumman Teams: 
Cincinnati (9-3) vs. Virginia Tech (6-6) When: Saturday, Dec. 27, 1 p.m.
 (ESPN) Where: Annapolis, Md. Why to watch: These teams had a pair of 
shared opponents this year: Ohio State and East Carolina. Virginia Tech 
beat the Buckeyes in Columbus, only to lose at home to the Pirates the 
next week. Meanwhile, the Bearcats were handled by Ohio State, but won a
 high-scoring thriller over East Carolina in Cincinnati. The transitive 
property of football tells us nothing, other than that the closest bowl 
to D.C. should be a close game. </figcaption><p> Courtesy: Military Bowl, Presented by Northrop Grumman </p>
<figcaption> 15. Hyundai Sun Bowl Teams: #15 Arizona State (9-3) vs. 
Duke (9-3) When: Saturday, Dec. 27, 2 p.m. (CBS) Where: El Paso, Texas 
Why to watch: The Sun Devils had as many quality wins as any team not in
 the Playoff, beating USC, Stanford, Utah and Notre Dame, but missed a 
shot at the PAC-12 title after a tough loss to rival Arizona. They 
should be a tough matchup for Duke, which will need its 20th-ranked 
scoring defense to be at its best to keep this one close. </figcaption><p> Courtesy: Hyundai Sun Bowl </p>
<figcaption> 16. Duck Commander Independence Bowl Teams: Miami (6-6) vs.
 South Carolina (6-6) When: Saturday, Dec. 27, 3:30 p.m. (ABC) Where: 
Shreveport, La. Why to watch: In the first of two bowl matchups without a
 winning team, the free-falling Hurricanes look to end their season 
strong against an underachieving South Carolina squad that some saw as a
 dark horse playoff contender prior to the season. Despite their SEC 
roots, the Gamecocks' opening line of -1.5 has flipped to +3 as the 
bettors seem to like Miami. Did we mention this game is sponsored by 
Duck Commander? Well, it is. </figcaption><p> Courtesy: Duck Commander Independence Bowl </p>
<figcaption> 18. National University Holiday Bowl Teams: Nebraska (9-3) 
vs. #24 USC (8-4) When: Saturday, Dec. 27, 8 p.m. (ESPN) Where: San 
Diego, Calif. Why to watch: Nebraska and USC had very similar seasons, 
largely beating the teams they were expected to beat and losing to 
higher-ranked opponents. But Trojans quarterback Cody Kessler dismantled
 Notre Dame in USC's final game and is someone to keep an eye on as an 
emerging pro prospect. </figcaption><p> Courtesy: National University Holiday Bowl </p>

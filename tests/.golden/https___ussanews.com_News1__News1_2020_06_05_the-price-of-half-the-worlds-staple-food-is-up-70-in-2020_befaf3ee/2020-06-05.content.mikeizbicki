<p>First the good news: after soaring to record highs one month ago due 
to widespread shutdowns of meat processing plants and supply chain 
impairments, wholesale beef prices have tumbled sharply and are just 
barely higher than where they were before the coronavirus pandemic 
struck.</p>
<p>Now the not so good news: as Bank of America’s Michael Hartnett notes
 in his Flow Show today, while beef may be affordable again, rice – the 
staple food for half of world’s population – is becoming increasingly 
unaffordable, “surging 70% since Jan on COVID-19 labor supply chain hit 
&amp; stockpiling.”</p>
<p>Should rice prices not revert to normal and soon, how long before the
 protests, riots and looting that are currently sweeping the US and 
various European countries spread across the entire world, this time 
over a far more tangible cause: hunger. As a reminder, it was the surge 
in food prices in late 2010 and early 2011 that precipitated the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0143622812000161">Arab Spring</a>
 protests that toppled numerous political regimes and eventually 
culminated with the mass exodus of migrants from northern Africa and the
 middle east toward Europe.</p>

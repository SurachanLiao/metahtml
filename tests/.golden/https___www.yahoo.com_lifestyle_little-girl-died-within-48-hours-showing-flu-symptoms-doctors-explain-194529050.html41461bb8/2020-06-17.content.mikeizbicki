<figcaption>A family is mourning the loss of a 6-year-old, who died just
 48 hours after contracting influenza. Here’s what might have happened. 
(Photo: GoFundMe).</figcaption><p>Flu season is well underway in the 
U.S., and the virus has already claimed the lives of 13 children so far,
 according to recently released data from the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm#S3" rel="nofollow noopener">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>. Among them is 6-year-old Allison Eaglespeaker, who died of the flu on Dec. 1</p>
<p>Eaglespeaker’s mother, Crystal White Shield, told <a href="https://www.wcvb.com/article/as-flu-is-on-the-rise-mom-says-i-didn-t-know-i-was-going-to-lose-my-baby-to-the-flu/25749201" rel="nofollow noopener">WCVB5</a>
 that her daughter — who suffered from mild asthma — first showed signs 
of being sick just 48 hours before she died. “This illness hit her 
really hard and really fast,” Shield said. “I didn’t know I was going to
 lose my baby.” Eaglespeaker’s aunt reportedly set up a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/funeral-expenses-for-allison" rel="nofollow noopener">GoFundMe</a> for her niece’s family, calling her their “beautiful baby girl.”</p>
<p>It seems shocking that someone could die that quickly from the flu, 
but it happens, Gina Posner, MD, a pediatrician at MemorialCare Orange 
Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, Calif., tells Yahoo Lifestyle. 
“The flu can move super quickly in children and adults,” she says. “The 
flu can come and just overwhelm the system. That’s why we always tell 
people to get their flu shot.”</p>
<p>Having an underlying condition like asthma, being immunocompromised, 
and not getting a flu shot increase the chances that someone will have a
 serious, rapidly progressing case of the flu, infectious disease expert
 Amesh A. Adalja, MD, senior scholar at the John’s Hopkins Center for 
Health Security, tells Yahoo Lifestyle. In general, “to die that fast 
from flu likely means that it caused a primary viral pneumonia, which 
can interfere with oxygen function,” he says. But overall, “there’s a 
lot of mystery in understanding who dies from flu and who doesn’t die 
from flu,” Adalja says. “There may be some genetic variation in the 
immune system of some people that allows the flu to progress rapidly.”</p>
<p>If your child becomes sick with an upper respiratory infection, it 
can be tough to know whether it’s due to something like a cold, general 
cough, or the flu, Posner says. “Typically the fever is higher and more 
persistent with the flu, but not always,” she says.</p>
<p>If your child has any kind of underlying medical issue, Adalja 
recommends taking them to the doctor ASAP to be tested for the flu and 
potentially put on an anti-viral drug like Tamiflu, which can shorten 
the duration of the flu and lower the odds that your child will 
experience serious complications from the illness. “Also, if they don’t 
have any medical problems but are short of breath, have uncontrollable 
fever, are lethargic, or have a change in behavior, that should prompt 
you to see a doctor,” Adalja says.</p>
<p>You’ll also want to provide lots of comfort care, including pushing 
fluids, having your child rest, and giving them ibuprofen or 
acetaminophen if they’re uncomfortable and feverish, Posner says. “Keep 
an eye on them and call your doctor if they seem to get worse,” she 
adds.</p>
<p>Overall, experts stress that prevention is crucial. “The most 
important thing that anyone can do is the flu shot,” Posner says. “Even 
if the shot does not prevent your child from getting the flu, at least 
it can help prevent your child from dying from the flu.”</p>

 you’ve noticed you’ve put on the ‘quarantine 15’ it’s OK, it’s

“Losing weight, it's not just about looking in the mirror and trying to 
look fantastic,” she explains. “It's really more about your overall 
health.” To look and feel good, Bhatia recommends ditching the comfort 
foods and reorganizing your refrigerator to include healthy foods like: 
lean proteins and vegetables. She also emphasizes the importance of 
movement. The real secret to weight loss is that we need to move 
throughout the day,” Bhatia says. Instead of putting in a full hour of a
 hardcore workout, try exercising three times a day for 30 minutes.

 Clarke Buckley was just 26 when she was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.
 She says the diagnosis came as a shock, especially since she was eating
 well, exercising regularly and had recently lost 30 pounds. “I thought I
 was doing everything right,” Buckley tells Yahoo Life.&amp;nbsp; She 
discovered that there weren’t many resources online that catered to 
someone her age, so Buckley created Hangry Woman, a food and lifestyle 
website that features diabetes wellness tips and recipes. “I just 
started talking about what life with type 2 diabetes is like,” she says.
 The Houston-based food blogger has since built an empire, and she says 
maintaining her health is crucial.&amp;nbsp;One way she does it? By 
eating healthy foods that also happen to taste delicious. “People often 
think when you have to eat healthy foods that it’s going to be bland and
 boring — it’s not going to be fun to eat, you’re going to dread every 
meal that you have,” says the 30-year-old. “But you can adapt the foods 
that you love by just paying attention to the labels that you’re 
reading. Once you get a little more thoughtful about the foods that you 
cook, you can figure out what to make.” Here’s what Buckley eats in a 
day: Breakfast Buckley kicks off her day by checking her blood sugar. 
Then, she can figure out what her dose of insulin, a hormone that your 
pancreas naturally makes to allow your cells to use glucose, should be 
for the day. (People with diabetes have trouble making insulin, or make 
none at all, which is why they often take insulin in the form of an 
injection, according to the American Diabetes Association.)&amp;nbsp; 
Next, Buckley says she usually has a “light” breakfast because she likes
 to exercise right after eating. One go-to meal: chia seeds, Greek 
yogurt, and granola. “I mix it all up and it’s delicious and easy.” 
Lunch “I appreciate lunchtime because that’s where I can go wild, and 
just figure out what I want to do when I have the rest of the day to 
correct it,” says Buckley. She’s big on “lots of fresh vegetables.. but I
 won’t say no to a good burger.”&amp;nbsp; One lunch she enjoys is a 
takeout burger with bacon and cheese on a lettuce bun. “It’s so 
important that you don’t deprive yourself of the foods that you love, 
but you just figure out how to change them in a way that’s going to be 
better for your blood sugar,” she explains. &amp;nbsp; Dinner Buckley 
checks her blood sugar right before she makes dinner. “Sometimes if my 
blood sugar is a little higher, maybe after exercise, I'll go for a 
protein-heavy dish or something with lots and lots of veggies, just to 
make sure that my blood sugar isn't skyrocketing too much,” she says. 
Buckley says that she and her husband keep “lots of ingredients in our 
house at all times, so we have a lot of choices when it comes to making 
food.” Buckley also keeps tabs on what she eats via her Diabetes Food 
Journal, which she released in May. “It’s a food log that gives you the 
ins and outs of what to do,” she says. “I like to fill mine out and just
 kind of reflect on all of my progress.” Overall, Buckley wants people 
to know that you can have type 2 diabetes and be healthy. “The biggest 
thing that I’ve learned in being diagnosed and having type 2 diabetes is
 that I take more care of my health than I ever have,” she says. “You 
could feel discouraged and you could feel upset, but you could also feel
 happy that you have this opportunity to be more in-tune with yourself.”

 Serra was a 21-year-old rookie firefighter when he became a 9/11 first 
responder. He had graduated from firefighter academy just the day 
before. &amp;nbsp; “On the bus on the way there, I was pulling stickers 
off of my gear because it was brand new,” he tells Yahoo Life. “All of 
the guys were making fun of me. Then, a priest got on the bus and read 
us our last rites and everything stopped being fun.” &amp;nbsp; Serra 
says he saw the Twin Towers on fire as his bus drove over the Verrazano 
Bridge. “It was a lot to take in,” he says. “You could barely see it 
because there was a giant cloud of dust everywhere.” &amp;nbsp; Serra 
says he wore a paper mask, but it was difficult to breathe through. “It 
was just covered in the dust,” he recalls. “Your face had a ½ inch of 
paste on it. It was pretty clear right away that dust was bad.” 
&amp;nbsp; Serra’s nose started bleeding after an hour or two of work, 
and he says it hurt to breathe in the dust. “There were at least 160 
toxins we now know of,” he says. “Thousands of gallons of jet fuel 
burning – it burned for 90 days. There were chemicals created that day.”
 &amp;nbsp; “We ate down there, we slept down there,” he says. “[The 
dust] went through our skin, through our eyes. It got into our bodies 
every which way.” &amp;nbsp; Serra struggled with his health soon after.
 &amp;nbsp;“I took my pre-hiring physical and my lung capacity was at 
94%,” he says. “They sent us all for medicals after 9/11, and my lung 
capacity was down to 79%.” Serra’s breathing issues became so bad that 
he couldn’t breathe through his nose anymore. &amp;nbsp; “They did a 
scan of my head and they found dozens of polyps in my sinuses and nasal 
passages,” he says. That impacted his work. “I would breathe in the 
tiniest bit of smoke [and] I would instantly get sick,” he says. 
&amp;nbsp; Serra also developed neurologic issues. Among other things, 
was diagnosed with peripheral neuropathy, a condition that’s the result 
of damage to the nerves outside of the brain and spinal cord.&amp;nbsp; 
Peripheral neuropathy often causes weakness, numbness, and pain, 
according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and 
Stroke. Serra’s says his legs will go numb, and he’s had to rely on the 
use of a cane to walk. If he has to walk more than 1,000 feet, he needs 
to use a wheelchair or scooter. &amp;nbsp; Serra ended up having to 
retire from the FDNY early due to his health issues. “I had always 
planned on doing at least 20 years, but I ended up retiring at 33,” he 
says. &amp;nbsp; Serra joined forces with other 9/11 first responders to
 lobby for a bill that would provide medical support for sick 9/11 first
 responders. The bill, called the&amp;nbsp;“Never Forget the Heroes: 
James Zadroga, Ray Pfeifer, and Luis Alvarez Permanent Authorization of 
the September 11 Victim Compensation Act,” was finally signed in 2019 
with the help of Jon Stewart. &amp;nbsp; Serra says there was a lot of 
emotional stress involved in lobbying. “Having to tell my 9/11 story, 
and listen to my friends’ 9/11 stories over and over…all the friends 
that had died, all the days I spent myself crying in pain,” he says. 
&amp;nbsp; He, along with six other firefighters, started the Ray 
Pfeifer Foundation, named after former New York City firefighter Ray 
Pfeifer, who was diagnosed with renal cancer after being a 9/11 first 
responder. The foundation is designed to help with medical bills that 
aren’t covered by law, and to quickly provide financial assistance to 
9/11 first-responders. Pfeifer died in 2017 and “cared more about other 
people, so we felt compelled to carry on,” Serra says. &amp;nbsp; Now, 
Serra says, “it’s hard. My health is not good.” &amp;nbsp;In addition to
 his physical issues, Serra says he struggles with emotional trauma and 
fears that he will develop cancer, like so many other 9/11 first

<p>“Coronavirus” isn’t a specific term, because the common cold can be a
 coronavirus. But you won’t often hear the media refer to it as “Wuhan 
virus” or “Chinese virus,” let alone “Chinese Red Death” or “Kung Flu” —
 even though these terms would be more apt.</p>
<p>Via <a href="https://noqreport.com/2020/03/17/why-is-american-media-echoing-communist-chinas-propaganda-about-racism/" rel="noopener noreferrer">NOQ Report</a>:</p>
<p>First, the Wuhan Coronavirus originated in Wuhan, China. Second, the 
Chinese Communist Party not only ignored but completely covered up the 
disease for as long as they could, allowing it to not only spread among 
its own people but to countries around the world. Third, diseases are 
regularly named after the area (like Ebola), city (like Lyme Disease), 
or region/nation (like Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) of their 
origin.</p>
<p>Deranged by political correctness and obsessive hatred of Trump (who has called it <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1239685852093169664" rel="noopener noreferrer">“the Chinese Virus”</a>),
 the liberals who run the media reject these terms in favor of the vague
 “coronavirus” or awkward “COVID-19.” More descriptive terms are 
denounced as racist and xenophobic. However,</p>
<p>No American who has ever heard of West Nile Virus, German Measles, 
Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever, St. Louis Encephalitis, or Rocky Mountain 
Spotted Fever believes the phrase “Chinese Virus” is racist or 
xenophobic. The World Health Organization even acknowledged the reason 
they came up with the clunky, manufactured name “COVID-19” was to 
prevent the stigma from touching China.</p>
<p>Here a Chinese propaganda service exploits political correctness to 
bully people into pretending not to notice that the virus came from 
China:</p>
<p>Racism is not the right tool to cover your own incompetence <a href="https://t.co/LmGDyPsULt">pic.twitter.com/LmGDyPsULt</a></p>
<p>— China Xinhua News (@XHNews) <a href="https://twitter.com/XHNews/status/1239753294265765888?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 17, 2020</a></p>
<p>In effect, every time the media says “COVID-19” instead of “Wuhan 
virus,” it is complying with China’s tyrannical communist party, which 
helped the virus spread by trying to cover it up.</p>

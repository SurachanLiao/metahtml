 government and Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) are conducting 
thousands of trials of Islamic State suspects without a strategy to 
prioritize the worst abuses under Iraqi and international law, Human 
Rights Watch said in a report released today. The haphazard approach and
 rampant due process violations are likely to deny justice to the 
victims of the worst abuses during ISIS control of parts of Iraq.</p>

<p>Accountability for ISIS Crimes in Iraq</p>

<p>The 76-page report, “<a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2017/12/05/flawed-justice/accountability-isis-crimes-iraq">Flawed Justice: Accountability for ISIS Crimes in Iraq</a>,”
 examines the screening, detention, investigation, and prosecution of 
some of the thousands of Islamic State (also known as ISIS) suspects in 
Iraq. Human Rights Watch found serious legal shortcomings that undermine
 the efforts to bring ISIS suspects to justice. Most significantly, 
there is no national strategy to ensure the credible prosecution of 
those responsible for the most serious crimes. The broad prosecution 
under terrorism law of all those affiliated with ISIS in any way, no 
matter how minimal, could impede future community reconciliation and 
reintegration, and clog up Iraqi courts and prisons for decades.</p>
<p>“Iraq’s handling of ISIS trials are a missed opportunity to show its 
people, the world, and indeed ISIS that it is a nation ruled by laws, 
due process, and justice, capable of bringing accountability for the 
gravest crimes and reconciliation for all of the communities affected by
 this war,” said <a href="https://www.hrw.org/about/people/sarah-leah-whitson">Sarah Leah Whitson</a>,
 Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. “Iraqi justice is failing 
to distinguish between the culpability of doctors who protected lives 
under ISIS rule and those responsible for crimes against humanity.”</p>
<p>The report will be presented to government officials at roundtables 
in Erbil and Baghdad. It is based on information gathered in Erbil, 
Nineveh governorate, and Baghdad from November 2016 to July 2017. 
Researchers visited prisons holding thousands of ISIS suspects and 
courthouses in Nineveh, Baghdad, and Erbil where trials were taking 
place, and met with senior Iraqi and KRG officials. Human Rights Watch 
also interviewed at least 100 families of ISIS suspects, and dozens of 
people who suffered grave abuses at the hands of ISIS or lost loved ones
 as a result, as well as representatives of international 
nongovernmental organizations working on justice issues in Iraq, local 
lawyers, and other legal experts.</p>
<p>Human Rights Watch found that the Iraqi government and KRG have no 
national strategy to prioritize prosecutions of those responsible for 
the worst abuses, or to bring charges that capture the broad range of 
crimes ISIS members have committed. Authorities appear to be prosecuting
 all ISIS suspects in their custody under counterterrorism laws, 
primarily for ISIS membership, and not focusing on specific actions or 
crimes that may have been committed.</p>
<p>Human Rights Watch has identified at least 7,374 people who have 
faced these charges since 2014, with 92 sentenced to death and executed.
 The total number of people held as ISIS suspects is estimated by 
researchers to be at least 20,000 based on information provided by 
government officials.</p>
<p>Human Rights Watch research raised concerns about due process in the 
screening process for people leaving ISIS-controlled areas, including 
vetting procedures for lists of suspects compiled by local security 
forces. Those wrongfully identified as suspects may spend months in 
arbitrary detention.</p>
<p>Iraqi authorities detained ISIS suspects in overcrowded and in some 
cases inhuman conditions and failed to segregate children from adult 
detainees, Human Rights Watch found. Officials have ignored due process 
rights, including guarantees in Iraqi law to bring detainees before a 
judge within 24 hours, to grant access to a lawyer throughout 
interrogations, and to notify families of their detention and allow 
families to communicate with detainees. Detainees also alleged that 
authorities tortured them to confess to ISIS membership.</p>
<p>The overbroad counterterrorism laws that the Iraqi government and KRG
 authorities are using to prosecute ISIS suspects have allowed judges to
 charge people not implicated in specific violent acts, but alleged only
 to have been ISIS members or assisted ISIS. They include individuals 
who reportedly worked in ISIS-run hospitals or cooks who prepared food 
for fighters. The counterterrorism laws carry harsh sentences, including
 life in prison or the death penalty, even for ISIS membership.</p>
<p>“I had a case yesterday of an ISIS cook and I have recommended giving
 him the death penalty. How could the ISIS fighter have executed someone
 if he had not been fed a good meal the night before?”, a senior 
counterterrorism judge told Human Rights Watch.</p>
<p>Charging ISIS suspects with violating the counterterrorism laws, 
rather than specific offenses under the criminal code, is often easier 
as an evidentiary matter, especially for crimes that took place in the 
chaos of war. But that makes it more difficult to prioritize and punish 
the most serious crimes and to establish a thorough judicial record of 
the full range of the crimes ISIS committed in Iraq. The authorities 
have also made no efforts to solicit victim participation in the trials,
 even as witnesses.</p>
<p>ISIS suspects who can demonstrate that they joined the group against 
their will and did not participate in certain violent acts may be 
entitled to release after conviction under the General Amnesty Law 
passed in August 2016 (no.27/2016), but Iraqi judges are not 
consistently applying the law. The KRG has not passed an amnesty law for
 ISIS convicts or suspects, and a KRG spokesperson said none was under 
consideration.</p>
<p>The authorities should prioritize prosecuting those who perpetrated 
the most serious crimes for the full range of crimes committed while 
seeking alternatives to prosecution, such as participation in national 
truth-telling processes, for those ISIS members whose only crime was 
membership.</p>
<p>At a minimum, they should drop charges against those whose functions 
under ISIS contributed to the protection of human rights of civilians, 
such as individuals providing healthcare or other welfare services , 
Human Rights Watch said. For children in particular, authorities should 
consider alternatives to detention and criminal prosecution, and develop
 rehabilitation and reintegration programs to aid their return to 
society.</p>
<p>“Iraq’s amnesty law is no substitute for a national strategy that 
will provide fair trials and find alternatives to prosecution for those 
not involved in ISIS violence or serious abuses,” Whitson said. “Iraq 
needs a plan for reconciliation and truth-telling as much as it needs a 
plan to throw the worst criminals in jail.”</p>

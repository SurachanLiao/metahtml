<p>BEIJING, Monday, Sept. 19 - North Korea agreed Monday to end its 
nuclear weapons program in return for security, economic and energy 
benefits, potentially easing tensions with the United States after a 
two-year standoff over the North's efforts to build atomic bombs.</p>
<p>The United States, North Korea and four other nations participating 
in negotiations in Beijing signed a draft accord in which the North 
promised to abandon efforts to produce nuclear weapons and re-admit 
international inspectors to its nuclear facilities.</p>
<p>Foreign powers said they would provide aid, diplomatic assurances and
 security guarantees and consider North Korea's demands for a 
light-water nuclear reactor.</p>
<p>The agreement is preliminary and will require more rounds of 
negotiations to flesh out because it does not address a range of issues 
like timing and implementation that are likely to prove contentious. 
China announced that the nations taking part in the talks would 
reconvene in November to continue ironing out the details.</p>
<p>Even so, the agreement marks the first time since the United States 
accused North Korea violating a previous accord in 2002 that the two 
countries have drawn up a road map for ending their dispute through 
peaceful means.</p>
<p>It also appears to rescue a diplomatic process that appeared to be on
 the verge of collapse after multiple rounds of negotiations failed to 
produce even a joint statement of principles. The Bush administration 
had said it was prepared to take tougher measures, including freezing 
North Korean assets abroad and pushing for international sanctions, if 
the latest round of talks collapsed.</p>
<p>Christopher Hill, the chief American negotiator, had said before the 
agreement was announced that he was determined to end the discussions 
and return to Washington. The breakthrough came at the last minute, 
after American officials had prepared to wrap up the negotiations 
without an accord.</p>
<p>Progress in the talks may also give the United States and European 
countries some diplomatic momentum in their negotiations with Iran over 
its nuclear weapons program, which is not considered as advanced as the 
North Korean one.</p>
<p>More generally, it would appear to boost support for people inside 
the Bush administration who favored pursuing laborious negotiations with
 the North Koreans. Hard-liners in the administration and in Congress 
had raised questions about the usefulness of negotiations with the 
North, which they argued had no intention of abandoning its nuclear 
weapons.</p>
<p>The draft accord commits North Korea to scrap all of its existing 
nuclear weapons and nuclear production facilities, to rejoin the Nuclear
 Nonproliferation Treaty, and to readmit international nuclear 
inspectors. North Korea withdrew from the treaty and expelled inspectors
 in 2002, after the United States accused it of violating a previous 
agreement to end its nuclear program.</p>
<p>The United States and North Korea also pledged to respect each 
other's sovereignty and right to peaceful coexistence and to work toward
 normalization of relations. The two countries have no full diplomatic 
relations and did not sign a peace treaty after the Korean War.</p>
<p>Washington declared as part of the agreement that it does not have 
any nuclear weapons at its bases in South Korea and that it "has no 
intention to attack or invade the D.P.R.K. with nuclear or conventional 
weapons." The D.P.R.K. stands for the Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea, North Korea's formal name.</p>
<p>The accord finessed what had been the biggest sticking point in the 
latest round of talks -- the light-water nuclear reactor -- by leaving 
it to be resolved in future discussions. North Korea demanded throughout
 the week-long session that the international community agree to provide
 it with a light-water reactor before it took steps to dismantle its 
nuclear program.</p>
<p>The United States firmly rejected that demand, though it did not rule
 out the possibility that the North could retain some kind of civilian 
nuclear program down the road if it abandoned its weapons program.</p>
<p>The statement said North Korea claimed the right to pursue "peaceful 
uses of nuclear energy." Mr. Hill said he expected that a light-water 
reactor would cost $2 billion to $3 billion and would take a decade to 
build. While a light-water reactor does not produce fuel for atomic 
weapons the way the North's existing modified-graphite reactors do, 
American officials have said it still raises proliferation risks and 
cannot be a first step in arranging the nuclear disarmament of the 
country.</p>
<p>North Korea has said it requires the new nuclear plant to provide 
electricity. But Mr. Hill said building a new nuclear plant would be an 
inefficient way of boosting electricity supplies. He said the North 
considers a civilian nuclear plant a "trophy."</p>
<p>The draft agreement includes a commitment by South Korea to build 
power plants and transmission lines to provide the North with two 
thousand megawatts of electricity, enough to roughly double to total 
supply of electrical power for its northern neighbor.</p>
<p>Although many details remain unresolved, the accord appears to be a 
significant victory for China. Beijing brokered the agreement after 
being the host for multiple rounds of difficult and inclusive talks. It 
cajoled both the United States and North Korea to continue meeting each 
other despite repeated threats by both sides to discontinue 
negotiations.</p>
<p>China has long argued that North Korea's nuclear problems cannot be 
dealt with through pressure or military force and must be addressed 
through comprehensive negotiations aimed at addressing the North's full 
range of concerns.</p>
<p>The Bush administration also overhauled the substance and the style 
of its approach to North Korea. Officials stopped using the accusatory 
language President Bush once used when he called North Korea a member of
 the "axis of evil" and called the nation's leader, Kim Jong Il, a 
tyrant.</p>
<p>Instead, the Americans have worked closely with South Korea and China
 to address the North's security and economic concerns and have 
reassured the North that the United States recognizes it as sovereign. 
Officials relaxed their stand on the North retaining some kind of 
peaceful nuclear program, and offered the prospect of normalizing 
relations with country.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the agreement will still face hurdles, including the 
degree of intrusiveness of inspections in the closed North Korean state,
 as well as to scope and nature of any peaceful nuclear program the 
North is allowed to retain.</p>

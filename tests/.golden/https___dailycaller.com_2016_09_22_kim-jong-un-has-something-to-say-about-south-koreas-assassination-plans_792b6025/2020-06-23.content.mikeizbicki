<p>North Korea is fuming over South Korean talk of “decapitation 
strikes” and U.S. strategic bomber deployments to the Korean Peninsula.</p>
<p>“The US imperialists and the South Korean puppet warmongers anti-DPRK
 military provocations have pushed the situation on the Korean Peninsula
 to the uncontrollable and irreversible phase of the outbreak of nuclear
 war,” the General Staff of the Korean People’s Army (KPA) <a href="https://nkleadershipwatch.wordpress.com/2016/09/22/kpa-general-staff-issues-statement-on-decapitation-chatter-b-1-presence/">said</a> in a statement Thursday.</p>
<p>Since North Korea conducted its fifth nuclear test, the U.S. and 
South Korea have been preparing for the possibility that the North will 
launch a preemptive nuclear strike on its southern neighbor.</p>
<p>Seoul is “considering launching a special forces unit to assassinate 
North Korean leader Kim Jong-un,” South Korean Defense Minister Han 
Min-koo <a href="http://atimes.com/2016/09/s-korea-has-plan-to-assassinate-kim-says-defense-minister/">said</a> Wednesday during a parliamentary meeting.</p>
<p>In accordance with its Korea Massive Punishment and Retaliation (KMPR) <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2016/09/12/nuclear-north-inside-south-koreas-plan-to-survive/">plan</a>,
 South Korea will move to assassinate Kim Jong Un with special forces 
and decapitation strikes if the North attempts to attack the South. 
Seoul will also obliterate Pyongyang. Next month, South Korea will train
 with the U.S. to <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2016/09/21/u-s-ups-the-ante-with-b-1b-bomber-deployments-to-south-korea/">eliminate</a> North Korea’s nuclear facilities.</p>
<p>“The nuclear warheads fired by the KPA as punishment will completely 
reduce to ashes Seoul, the center of confrontation,” the General Staff 
of the KPA said in response to these plans.</p>
<p>The U.S. sent two supersonic B-1B Lancers to <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2016/09/21/u-s-ups-the-ante-with-b-1b-bomber-deployments-to-south-korea/">fly</a>
 closely along the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) Wednesday. In an 
unprecedented move, one of the bombers landed and is currently stationed
 on the Korean Peninsula. B-52 and B-2 bombers may join the aircraft in 
the future.</p>
<p>“Should [the U.S.] escalate the danger of military provocations by 
letting B-1Bs fly over the air of Korea, the KPA will sweep Guam, the 
base of provocations, from the surface of the earth,” said KPA 
officials.</p>
<p>“The ‘operation for eliminating the leadership of the north’ much 
touted by the Park Geun Hye group would result in reducing Seoul to 
debris, and the U.S. introduction of nuclear war means would put the 
aggressor forces’ bases in the theatres of Pacific operations into a 
nuclear nightmare,” KPA officials explained.</p>
<p>Pyongyang has the ability to turn some of its threats into actions. 
For other threats, the North still needs time to develop the necessary 
capabilities. With significant investments in its military, North Korea 
is rapidly moving towards the realization of its military ambitions.</p>
<p>After its latest nuclear weapons test, North Korea claimed that it 
can now mount nuclear warheads on ballistic missiles. Whether it can or 
not has yet to be determined, but if Pyongyang has not mastered these 
skills yet, it is likely to do so soon.</p>
<p>“The DPRK’s access to the treasured nuclear sword is aimed to foil 
the adventurous nuclear war racket of the U.S. imperialists,” North 
Korea’s KPA officials warned.</p>

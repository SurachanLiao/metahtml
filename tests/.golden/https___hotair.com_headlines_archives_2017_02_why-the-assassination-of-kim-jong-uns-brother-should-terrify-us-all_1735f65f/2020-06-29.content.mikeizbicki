<h1 class="rm-manual">Why the assassination of Kim Jong Un’s brother should terrify us all</h1>
<p>Running a reign of terror is tricky business. Don’t kill enough 
people and you might be perceived as too weak, and be killed yourself. 
But if you kill too many people, some will start thinking they’re next 
on your list, and they will gang up on you. This is what happened in the
 Soviet Union upon Stalin’s death, when Lavrentiy Beria, the infamous 
head of Stalin’s secret police, made a bid for power. Unlike Stalin, for
 whom killing was just business, Beria was a sadist who joyfully 
relished torture, murder, and rape. Beria very briefly ruled the 
country, but the rest of the Politburo had absolutely no doubt that 
Beria would eventually have them all tortured and killed. So they killed
 Beria before he could kill them.</p>
<p>The same thing could happen to Kim Jong Un. It’s possible that he has
 stepped on this treadmill of purges and paranoia, and the killing of 
his own half-brother is evidence of that.</p>
<p>Maybe I’m wrong. Maybe Kim Jong Un will die of old age, still in 
power, like his father and grandfather before him. Or maybe he will be 
taken out, but in a relatively bloodless coup, and be replaced by some 
other strongman who can hold the country together. Or maybe taking out 
Kim Jong Un will lead to the collapse of the regime.</p>
<p>But let me be clear: The question is not if the North Korean regime will collapse, but when.</p>

<p class="rm-manual"> Updated on: April 21, 2020 / 7:47 AM / CBS/AP </p>
<p class=""> <span> Questions surround Kim Jong Un's health </span> </p>
<p>Seoul, South Korea — The South Korean government said Tuesday no 
unusual activity has been detected in North Korea after unconfirmed 
reports described leader Kim Jong Un as in fragile condition after heart
 surgery. The presidential Blue House says it had no information about 
the rumors on Kim's health.</p>
<p>Speculation often surfaces about North Korea's leadership based on 
attendance at important state events. Kim, who is in his mid-30s, missed
 the celebration of his late grandfather and state founder Kim Il Sung 
on April 15, the country's most important holiday. </p>
<p>At his last public appearance, he presided over a political bureau 
meeting of the ruling Workers' Party on April 11, discussing preventive 
measures against <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/feature/coronavirus/">the coronavirus</a>
 and electing his sister as an alternate member of the bureau. However, 
state media reported Kim sent greetings to Syrian President Bashar Assad
 last week and a "birthday spread" to a North Korean woman who turned 
100 on Monday. </p>

<p class="rm-manual"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/feature/north-korea-tensions/?intcid=CNI-00-10aaa3a"> More in North Korea </a> </p>
<p>"We have no information to confirm regarding rumors about Chairman 
Kim Jong Un's health issue that have been reported by some media 
outlets. Also, no unusual developments have been detected inside North 
Korea," Blue House spokesman Kang Min-seok said in the statement.</p>
<p>The White House and State Department had no comment.</p>
<p>CNN had a report citing an anonymous U.S. official who said Kim was 
in bad shape after an unspecified surgery. Later, another U.S. official 
told the same network that the concerns about Kim's health are credible 
but the severity is hard to assess.</p>
<p>Daily NK, an online newspaper focused on North Korea that often cites
 defectors or unspecified sources within North Korea, cited anonymous 
sources as saying Kim was recovering from heart surgery and that his 
condition was improving. The outlet later said its story was based on a 
single source inside North Korea.</p>
<p>An official from Seoul's National Intelligence Service, who didn't 
want to be named, citing office rules, said the spy agency couldn't 
confirm whether Kim had had surgery. </p>
<p>Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said his government was monitoring the situation. </p>
<p>A political upheaval in North Korea would be unlikely even if Kim 
became sidelined by health problems, according to analyst Cheong 
Seong-Chang at the private Sejong Institute in South Korea. </p>
<p>Cheong said Kim's sister, Kim Yo Jong, is already exercising 
significant influence within the government and that most members of 
Pyongyang's leadership share an interest with the Kim family in 
maintaining the North's system. </p>
<p>But North Korea expert and CBS News contributor Robert Carlin says if
 Kim were to die, there would be "fairly inexperienced North Koreans at 
the top. ... A lot of them don't know a lot about the outside world. ...
 There are going to be factions trying to scramble to the top." </p>
<p>Outside governments and media have a mixed record on tracking 
developments among North Korea's ruling elite, made difficult by 
Pyongyang's stringent control of information about them. </p>
<p>In 2016, South Korea media quoted intelligence officials as saying 
Kim Jong Un had had a former military chief executed for corruption and 
other charges. But North Korea's state media months later showed Ri Yong
 Gil alive and serving in new senior posts. </p>
<p>Kim's absence from state media often triggers speculation. In 2014, 
Kim vanished from the public eye for nearly six weeks before reappearing
 with a cane. South Korea's spy agency said days later that he had a 
cyst removed from his ankle.</p>
<p>Kim, believed to be 36, took power upon his father's death in 
December 2011 and is the third generation of his family to rule the 
nuclear-armed country. </p>
<p>Kim met President Trump three times in 2018 and 2019 and had summits 
with other Asian leaders as he pursued diplomacy in hopes of ending 
crippling sanctions and getting security guarantees. But he <span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/north-korea-is-advancing-its-nuclear-program-and-increasing-illicit-trade-new-u-n-report-says/">maintained his right to a nuclear arsenal</a></span> and most diplomacy has stalemated since.</p>
<p>Still, Carlin says, "People will breathe a big sigh of relief if they
 discover Kim showing up in a few days," due to concern over control 
over Pyongyang's nuclear weapons if Kim dies or is shelved by illness.</p>

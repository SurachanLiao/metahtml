<p>BERLIN (AP) — German Chancellor Angela Merkel called Thursday for 
international cooperation on the development of a vaccine for the new 
coronavirus, saying that the pandemic transcends borders and can only be
 countered jointly.</p>
<p>Speaking to parliament in a session where lawmakers sat at a careful 
distance from one another in line with the country’s social-distancing 
regulations, Merkel said German scientists were busily researching the 
virus at home, but that “international cooperation against the virus is 
extremely important.”</p>
<p>“Science is never national, science serves mankind,” she said. “Thus 
it goes without saying that when medication or a vaccine is found, 
tested, released and is ready for use, it must be available all around 
the world and affordable for the whole world.”</p>
<p>U.S. President Donald Trump has announced he is halting funding for 
the World Health Organization to review how it has handled the outbreak,
 but Merkel lauded the agency’s work in the fight against the 
coronavirus. </p>
<p>“For the German government, I emphasize the WHO is an indispensable partner and we support them in their mandate,” she said.</p>
<p>Asked later Thursday whether she believed there was sufficient 
willingness among countries to cooperate in tackling the pandemic, 
Merkel told reporters that recent conversations with other world leaders
 — including the G-7 currently chaired by the U.S. — had given her the 
impression that “we know this is an illness which has reached all of us.
 It’s a pandemic that nobody can avoid.”</p>
<p>Germany this week began slowly easing restrictions after being on 
lockdown for weeks, allowing small shops to start opening while keeping 
social distancing in place. All states are also moving ahead with 
regulations requiring protective masks in public transport, shops or 
both.</p>
<p>In her speech to lawmakers, Merkel chastised some German states for 
moving too quickly to relax measures, however, saying they’re risking 
setting back what the country has achieved.</p>
<p>Germany has reported more than 150,000 infections but a relatively 
low death toll of about 5,000, while more than 100,000 people have 
recovered, according to a tally compiled by Johns Hopkins University.</p>
<p>Merkel cautioned that, while the rate of new infections has been 
slowing, “we’re still walking on thin ice, one could also say the 
thinnest ice.”</p>
<p>“We’re not living in the final phase of the pandemic, but still at 
the beginning. We will be living with this virus for a long time.”</p>
<p>Merkel told parliament that in her time as chancellor the decision to
 “restrict personal freedoms” in the fight against the virus was one of 
hardest she has made, and urged people to proceed carefully now as steps
 were being taken to reduce restrictions so as not to give up hard-won 
gains.</p>
<p>“Let us not squander what we have achieved and risk a setback. It 
would be a shame if premature hope ultimately punishes us all. Let us 
all stay on the path in the next phase of the pandemic: smart and 
careful. It’s a long journey; we can’t run out of stamina and air too 
soon.”</p>
<p>Still, she said she understood the urge for people to end their 
isolation, especially among the elderly and disabled population where 
loneliness can already be a problem.</p>
<p>“In the times of a pandemic, it can be much lonelier without 
visitors. It is cruel when nobody can be there as strength fades and 
life comes to an end, aside from the nurses who are doing their very 
best,” she said. </p>
<p>“Let us never forget these people and the temporary isolation they 
have to live in. These 80- and 90-year-olds built our country; they are 
the foundation of the prosperity in which we now live. They are Germany,
 just like their children and grandchildren, and we also fight the fight
 against this virus for them.”</p>

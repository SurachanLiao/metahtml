<h2>The mayor warned that April would be bad. Now it’s here.</h2>
<p>In March, as the number of coronavirus cases in New York City grew 
and the death toll mounted, Mayor Bill de Blasio warned that April would
 be worse. He repeatedly invoked April 5 as a “demarcation line” after 
which the city could expect a huge surge in virus patients.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, with Mr. de Blasio’s crucial date just four days away 
and city data putting the number of virus-related deaths at 1,374, he 
went into detail about the supplies the city still needed to contend 
with the coming wave:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>3.3 million N95 masks, which protect health care workers from exposure to the virus</p></li>
<li><p>2.1 million surgical masks</p></li>
<li><p>100,000 isolation gowns</p></li>
<li><p>400 additional ventilators</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To help ensure that supplies go where they are needed, Mr. de Blasio 
said that James P. O’Neill, the former police commissioner who is now an
 executive with Visa, was returning to oversee operations and logistics 
related to the virus outbreak.</p>
<p>Mr. de Blasio said New York would continue to have a great need for 
supplies well after Sunday. By the end of April, he estimated, the 
health care system would need 65,000 additional hospital beds to 
accommodate new virus patients, as well as the people to staff them.</p>
<p>To meet the expected demand, the city’s public hospital system plans 
to convert all of its facilities to intensive care units, officials 
said, adding that supplies and personnel were crucial to increasing the 
number of I.C.U. beds.</p>
<p>Patients who do not have the virus will be sent to large-scale 
temporary hospitals, like the one set up at the Javits Convention 
Center, or to hotels that are being converted into temporary medical 
facilities. So far, the city had secured 10,000 beds from 20 hotels, 
officials said.</p>
<p>“This goal is within reach,” Mr. de Blasio said. “It’s going to take a herculean effort, but I’m confident it can be reached.”</p>
<h2>Nearly 400 New York deaths put the region past 2,000.</h2>

 Andrew M. Cuomo said early Wednesday that 391 people in New York State 
had died of the virus since Tuesday, bringing the state total to 1,941 
and the total for New York, New Jersey and Connecticut to 2,381.</p>
<p>As the crisis has grown more dire across the country, Mr. Cuomo’s 
message — delivered at briefings that have become a daily staple of the 
national news and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/nyregion/governor-andrew-cuomo-coronavirus.html">raised his political profile</a> — has broadened in perspective.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the governor again emphasized the regional coordination
 between his state, New Jersey and Connecticut, before noting that the 
virus was spreading more rapidly in other states, including California, 
Michigan and Florida. </p>
<p>And he urged Americans even in states that had not yet been hit hard 
by the virus to take it seriously. He cited projections from a group 
founded by the Gates Foundation that the death toll would reach 16,000 
in New York and 93,000 nationwide.</p>
<p>“This is not just New York,” he said. “If you believe these numbers —
 16,000 deaths in New York — that means you’re going to get tens of 
thousands of deaths outside of New York.”</p>

<li><p>In Connecticut: There were 3,557 cases, up from 3,218, and 85 
deaths, up from 69. Among the newly dead, Gov. Ned Lamont said, was a 
6-week-old infant.</p></li>

<h2>The governor said all city playgrounds would close.</h2>
<p class="rm-manual"><span>Image</span></p>
<figcaption><span>Raoul Wallenberg Playground in Upper Manhattan on Wednesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Andrew Seng for The New York Times</span></span></figcaption><p>At
 his briefing, Mr. Cuomo expressed frustration with those who continued 
to ignore social-distancing guidelines in New York City. </p>
<p>He insisted that the city’s police officers had “to get more 
aggressive” in enforcing the rules. Mr. Cuomo said that he was prepared 
to legally require social distancing if necessary, but that it was 
absurd that even had to consider that.</p>
<p>“How reckless and irresponsible and selfish for people not to do it 
on their own,” he said. “I mean what else do you have to know? What else
 do you have to hear? Who else has to die for you to understand you have
 a responsibility in this?”</p>
<p>As a start, he said, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/01/nyregion/coronavirus-nyc-playgrounds-closed.html">all of the city’s playgrounds would be shut down</a>.</p>
<p>Mr. Cuomo said that he had spoken to Mr. de Blasio and Corey Johnson,
 the City Council speaker, about trying to enforce the social-distancing
 rules with the help of the police, but that the problem had persisted 
and more drastic action was necessary.</p>
<p>The governor’s announcement came a day after the mayor closed 10 city
 playgrounds where people had continued to gather in crowds that 
violated social-distancing rules.</p>
<p>“He really thought it was an abundance of caution issue to go ahead 
and move across the board in terms of playgrounds,” Mr. de Blasio said 
of Mr. Cuomo on Monday. “And I respect that.”</p>
<p>At around 5 p.m. that day, Sammy Frisz was pushing his giggling 
22-month-old son on a swing at Mauro Park in Queens, when a city parks 
employees put a padlock on a nearby gate and told Mr. Frisz he had to 
leave through a different gate because the playground was being closed.</p>
<p>Mr. Frisz, a municipal worker explained that a family friend who had 
died of the virus had already exposed Mr. Frisz, his wife and his son. 
They said they were three days into a 14-day self-quarantine.</p>
<p>Mr. Frisz’s wife, who asked that her name not be used because of her 
job, said in a telephone interview that the closing of the playground 
would make it difficult for her to do her job.</p>
<p>“This is the last thing holding our sanity and our ability to keep 
our jobs together,” she said. “If we’re all cooped up in a little, tiny 
place, those of us with young children will go crazy, go bonkers, how am
 I supposed to work from home?”</p>
<h2>An equipment shortage may soon force hard choices on doctors.</h2>
<p class="rm-manual"><span>Image</span></p>
<figcaption><span>Triage tents outside NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center in Manhattan on Wednesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Andrew Seng for The New York Times</span></span></figcaption><p>One
 patient had lymphoma and heart failure. Another was 85 years old with 
metastatic cancer. A third was 83 and had dementia and lung disease. All
 were critically ill with the coronavirus, and, a doctor said, all were 
hooked up to ventilators in recent weeks at a major Manhattan hospital.</p>
<p>But soon, patients such as those might not receive similar aggressive
 treatment. As people with the virus overwhelm New York City hospitals, 
doctors have stepped up pressure on state health officials to give them a
 rare and unsettling power: the right to withhold care from patients who
 are not likely to recover.</p>
<p>Dwindling supplies <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/business/coronavirus-ventilator-shortage.html?module=inline">mean there might not be enough ventilators</a>
 or other items for everyone, and many doctors say they are growing 
increasingly uneasy with treating every patient equally. They believe 
medical workers soon might need to make difficult choices about 
treatment.</p>
<p>“Usually, the standard is to intubate and do CPR and do all those 
things,” said Dr. Angela Mills, the chief of emergency medicine services
 at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center. “There’s no
 question about it; that will not most likely be sustainable.”</p>
<p>The problem is a grim and wrenching one, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/01/nyregion/coronavirus-doctors-patients.html">the experience of doctors in New York could signal what is to come for their colleagues in other states</a>, which have begun dusting off triage plans.</p>

 another time on Wednesday, President Trump somberly described a 
personal connection to the coronavirus as he discussed the effects of 
the pandemic at his daily briefing with his virus task force.</p>
<p>Sometimes he has referred to a friend who has the coronavirus and 
other times to friends. His aides have repeatedly declined to identify 
whom the president has been talking about.</p>
<p>But three people familiar with the matter said he was describing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/01/us/politics/trump-friend-coronavirus-stanley-chera.html">Stanley Chera, a New York City real-estate developer who has known the president for many years</a> and had decamped to Deal, N.J., a few weeks ago as the coronavirus spread.</p>
<p>But it was unclear whom else Mr. Trump might have been referring to when he said he has other friends who are also ill.</p>
<p>Mr. Chera, 78, became sick at some point in Deal, and was rushed to 
New York-Presbyterian/Columbia hospital, according to two of Mr. Chera’s
 friends. Two of those friends said Mr. Chera was in a medically induced
 coma. But it is unclear whether he has tested positive for the 
coronavirus.</p>

<p>Everyday life in the city has been upended by the coronavirus. To 
help you understand how, here is some data collected from the city’s 
toll-free 311 hotline:</p>
<p>More than 1,000 social-distancing complaints in just two days. Hardly
 anyone had even heard of social distancing until a few weeks ago. On 
Saturday, March 28, the city’s 311 system recorded its first complaints 
about people failing to keep six feet from others. Two days later, daily
 complaints had climbed to 776.</p>
<h1> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/coronavirus">The Coronavirus Outbreak</a> </h1>
<ul> <li> <h2>Frequently Asked Questions and Advice</h2> <p>Updated June 22, 2020</p> <ul> <li> <h4>Is it harder to exercise while wearing a mask?</h4> <p>A <a href="https://blogs.bmj.com/bjsm/2020/06/12/should-people-wear-a-face-mask-during-exercise-what-should-clinicians-advise/">commentary published this month on the website of the British Journal of Sports Medicine</a>
 points out that covering your face during exercise “comes with issues 
of potential breathing restriction and discomfort” and requires 
“balancing benefits versus possible adverse events.” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/17/well/move/exercising-while-wearing-a-mask.html">Masks do alter exercise</a>,
 says Cedric X. Bryant, the president and chief science officer of the 
American Council on Exercise, a nonprofit organization that funds 
exercise research and certifies fitness professionals. “In my personal 
experience,” he says, “heart rates are higher at the same relative 
intensity when you wear a mask.” Some people also could experience 
lightheadedness during familiar workouts while masked, says Len Kravitz,
 a professor of exercise science at the University of New Mexico.</p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <h4>I’ve heard about a treatment called dexamethasone. Does it work?</h4> <p>The steroid, dexamethasone, is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/world/europe/dexamethasone-coronavirus-covid.html">the first </a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/world/europe/dexamethasone-coronavirus-covid.html">treatment shown to reduce mortality in severely ill patients,</a>
 according to scientists in Britain. The drug appears to reduce 
inflammation caused by the immune system, protecting the tissues. In the
 study, dexamethasone reduced deaths of patients on ventilators by 
one-third, and deaths of patients on oxygen by one-fifth.</p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <h4>What is pandemic paid leave?</h4> <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/upshot/coronavirus-paid-leave-guide.html">The coronavirus emergency relief package</a>
 gives many American workers paid leave if they need to take time off 
because of the virus. It gives qualified workers two weeks of paid sick 
leave if they are ill, quarantined or seeking diagnosis or preventive 
care for coronavirus, or if they are caring for sick family members. It 
gives 12 weeks of paid leave to people caring for children whose schools
 are closed or whose child care provider is unavailable because of the 
coronavirus. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/upshot/coronavirus-paid-leave-guide.html">It is the first time the United States has had widespread federally mandated paid leave,</a> and includes people who don’t typically get such benefits, like part-time and gig economy workers. But <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/14/opinion/coronavirus-pelosi-sick-leave.html">the measure excludes</a>
 at least half of private-sector workers, including those at the 
country’s largest employers, and gives small employers significant 
leeway to deny leave.</p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <h4>Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?</h4> <p>So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5">paper</a>
 published in April suggests that people are most infectious about two 
days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that 44 
percent of new infections were a result of transmission from people who 
were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at the World 
Health Organization stated that transmission of the coronavirus by 
people who did not have symptoms was “very rare,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html#link-1f302e21">but she later walked back that statement.</a></p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <h4>What’s the risk of catching coronavirus from a surface?</h4> <p>Touching
 contaminated objects and then infecting ourselves with the germs is not
 typically how the virus spreads. But it can happen. A number <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.905.8444&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">of studies</a>
 of flu, rhinovirus, coronavirus and other microbes have shown that 
respiratory illnesses, including the new coronavirus, can spread by 
touching contaminated surfaces, particularly in places like day care 
centers, offices and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5519164/">hospitals</a>.
 But a long chain of events has to happen for the disease to spread that
 way. The best way to protect yourself from coronavirus — whether it’s 
surface transmission or close human contact — is still social 
distancing, washing your hands, not touching your face and wearing 
masks.</p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <h4>How does blood type influence coronavirus?</h4> <p>A study by European scientists is the first to document a strong statistical link between <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.31.20114991v1">genetic variations and Covid-19</a>, the illness caused by the coronavirus. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/health/coronavirus-blood-type-genetics.html">Having Type A blood</a>
 was linked to a 50 percent increase in the likelihood that a patient 
would need to get oxygen or to go on a ventilator, according to the new 
study.</p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <h4>How many people have lost their jobs due to coronavirus in the U.S.?</h4> <p>The
 unemployment rate fell to 13.3 percent in May, the Labor Department 
said on June 5, an unexpected improvement in the nation’s job market as 
hiring rebounded faster than economists expected. Economists had 
forecast the unemployment rate to increase to as much as 20 percent, 
after it hit 14.7 percent in April, which was the highest since the 
government began keeping official statistics after World War II. But the
 unemployment rate dipped instead, with employers adding 2.5 million 
jobs, after more than 20 million jobs were lost in April.</p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <h4>My state is reopening. Is it safe to go out?</h4> <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/states-reopen-map-coronavirus.html">States are reopening bit by bit</a>.
 This means that more public spaces are available for use and more and 
more businesses are being allowed to open again. The federal government 
is largely leaving the decision up to states, and some state leaders are
 leaving the decision up to local authorities. Even if you aren’t being 
told to stay at home, it’s still a good idea to limit trips outside and 
your interaction with other people.</p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <h4>What are the symptoms of coronavirus?</h4> <p>Common symptoms <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html">include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath.</a>
 Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making detection 
difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html">The C.D.C. has also</a>
 added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss of the 
sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most people fall 
ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms may appear in as few
 as two days or as many as 14 days.</p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <h4>How can I protect myself while flying?</h4> <p>If air travel is unavoidable,<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/03/travel/how-to-clean-your-airplane-seat-and-space.html"> there are some steps you can take to protect yourself.</a> Most important: Wash your hands often, and stop touching your face. If possible, choose a window seat. A <a href="http://emoryhealthdigest.emory.edu/issues/2018/spring/from_the_well/germs-on-a-plane/index.html">study from Emory University</a>
 found that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a
 window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with 
potentially sick people. Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your 
seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard 
surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, 
the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is 
hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. 
(Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading
 of germs rather than killing them.)</p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <h4>What should I do if I feel sick?</h4> <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/well/what-if-i-have-coronavirus.html">If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have,</a>
 and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call
 a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, 
how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially
 infecting or exposing others.</p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <h4>How do I get tested?</h4> <p>If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/well/what-if-i-have-coronavirus.html">the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. </a>They
 will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a 
chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re 
asymptomatic, for instance — you won’t be able to get tested.</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul>
<p>Bikes lanes are clearer. With car traffic way down, complaints about 
blocked bike lanes dropped from 1,259 in January to 838 in March and 
slowed to a trickle in recent days, sometimes fewer than 10 per day.</p>
<p>Complaints about food workers jumped. In the first two months of the 
year, the 311 system logged 251 complaints about food workers, often 
that a worker was sick or touching food with their bare hands. In March,
 the number of such complaints jumped to 358.</p>
<p>More people are home and annoying their neighbors. The number of 
people complaining about “loud music” or a “party” at someone’s home 
jumped from 13,000 in February to nearly 17,000 in March. Complaints 
about loud televisions are also up, from 494 in February to 598 in 
March.</p>
<h2>Officers shot an armed man who said he had the virus and wanted to die, the police said.</h2>
<p>New York City officers shot a man early Wednesday who later told them
 he had tested positive for the coronavirus and wanted them to kill him,
 the police said.</p>
<p>The episode began around 4 a.m., when two officers answered a 911 
call about a man with a knife at the corner of Zerega and Westchester 
Avenues in the Bronx, the police said.</p>
<p>When the officers arrived, they encountered a man with a knife and 
what appeared to be a gun, the police said. The man menaced the officers
 and when he did not comply with their orders to drop the weapons, they 
shot him in the torso, the police said.</p>
<p>The man, 55, was taken to Jacobi Medical Center in stable condition, 
the police said. He was in custody there on Wednesday, the police said. </p>
<p>When officers interviewed the man at the hospital, he told them he 
had tested positive for the virus and hoped that they would kill him, 
Terence Monahan, the chief of department, said.</p>
<p>“He said that he was looking to commit suicide by a police officer,” 
Chief Monahan said, adding that the man said he had learned he had the 
virus Tuesday night.</p>
<p>“He’s overweight, diabetic and he thought that he was going to die 
anyway,” Chief Monahan said the man told officers. “So he wanted the 
police officers to take his life.”</p>
<p>The police have not confirmed that the man tested positive for the virus, officials said. </p>
<h2>How to get masks to the medical workers who need them. </h2>
<p>For people in the New York area who have respirator-type N95 masks or other medical-grade surgical masks at home, there are<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/01/nyregion/donate-masks-coronavirus.html"> several ways to get them</a> to people who really need them right now: local medical workers</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Contact state agencies. In New York, the state Health Department has an<a href="https://apps.health.ny.gov/pubpal/builder/survey/nys-covid19-tracking-offers" rel="noopener noreferrer"> online form</a> that breaks down donated goods by category, including medical supplies. New Jersey residents are encouraged to use<a href="https://covid19.nj.gov/ppedonations" rel="noopener noreferrer"> the state’s official donation portal</a>. Connecticut residents with potential donations can also complete <a href="https://na0.icarol.com/pub/SurveyForm.aspx?org=2385&amp;key=af40a790-20de-4119-b6d8-af0a63368e01" rel="noopener noreferrer">an online form</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Try nonprofit groups. The Afya Foundation in Yonkers, N.Y., for example,<a href="https://afyafoundation.org/covid-19/" rel="noopener noreferrer"> is seeking donations</a> of masks of all kinds.</p></li>
<li><p>Donate directly. If you<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/30/magazine/how-to-donate-n95-masks-coronavirus.html"> know a medical worker</a>
 personally, you can make direct contact to drop off medical masks. 
Priority should be given to emergency room doctors and other medical 
professionals who are likely to make contact with people who have been 
infected.</p></li>
<li><p>Use a website. At least two websites, <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdgEtdv00mF7Q9ve0e5Y4jvTKiWGFTCCCWZlasxnUuhS_-hLA/viewform" rel="noopener noreferrer">NYC Mask Crusaders</a> and<a href="https://www.mask-match.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Mask Match</a>, are geared toward connecting New York residents with medical professionals who need crucial supplies.</p></li>

<h2>New Jersey’s hospital morgues are filling up.</h2>
<p>New Jersey’s health commissioner said on Wednesday that morgues at 
some hospitals were beginning to reach their capacity. The state is 
working on sending refrigerated trucks to some hospitals to hold the 
excess bodies, the commissioner, Judith Persichilli, said. </p>
<p>New Jersey reported at least 89 virus-related deaths in 24 hours, officials said, its biggest one-day increase so far. </p>
<p>More than 22,000 people have tested positive for the virus, and in 
seven hospitals in northern New Jersey had to turn ambulances because of
 overcrowding. </p>
<p>“It looks like the surge is beginning in the northern part of the 
state,” Ms. Persichilli said. “We’re beginning to feel the real stress 
and strain.”</p>
<p>Some of the backup at the morgues is a result of lags in transferring
 bodies to funeral homes, which had been waiting to retrieve the 
deceased until virus test results came back for people who died before 
results were in. State officials have told funeral homes they no longer 
need to wait.</p>
<h2>More people in homeless shelters are getting the virus.</h2>
<p>Coronavirus continues to spread through New York City’s homeless 
shelters, where it has now infected over 120 people and killed five men,
 city officials said Wednesday.</p>
<p>People have tested positive in 68 different shelters. The virus has 
circulated most quickly in shelters for single adults, where 
dormitory-style quarters and shared bathrooms leave little room for 
distancing.</p>
<p>The city has set up four locations to isolate sick people and those 
who have been exposed to them. As of Tuesday, 190 people were at those 
locations and 38 people were in the hospital. Another 13 living on the 
street or in unstable housing had tested positive. </p>
<h2>Grim milestones mark the pandemic’s second month.</h2>
<p>As the second month of the coronavirus outbreak begins and the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/01/us/politics/coronavirus-trump.html">nation braces for the worst of it</a>, the virus’s toll in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut is already devastating.</p>
<p>Thirty-one days after the region <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/01/nyregion/new-york-coronvirus-confirmed.html">recorded its first case</a>
 — a Manhattan woman in her thirties who had traveled to Iran — the 
number of confirmed cases of the virus passed 100,000 on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Deaths in the region attributable to the virus, which have climbed 30
 percent each day on average for the past week, passed 2,000 on 
Wednesday, with another 391 deaths reported in New York State and 91 
reported in New Jersey. The death toll in the region stood at 1,941 in 
New York, 355 in New Jersey and 85 in Connecticut.</p>
<p>In New York, the hardest-hit state in the country, the numbers of 
people hospitalized, on ventilators, testing positive or dead of the 
virus have all begun to increase a little more slowly in recent days. </p>
<p>But they were still increasing every day, and officials expected it would be several weeks before the virus began to ebb. </p>
<p>People in and around New York who have died of the virus include </p>

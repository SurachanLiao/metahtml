<ul class="rm-manual"> <li class="rm-manual"><a href="#"><span><span>Download</span> <span>PDF Copy</span></span></a></li> </ul>
<p class="rm-manual"><span><span>Reviewed by <span>Emily Henderson, B.Sc.</span></span><span>Apr 20 2020</span></span></p>
<p>Food insecurity in Vermont has increased by one-third during the 
coronavirus pandemic, from 18.3% to 24.3%, according to a statewide 
survey conducted by the University of Vermont at the end of March and 
announced in a series of briefs today.</p>
<p>The increase in food insecurity was strongly correlated with 
employment status. Among survey respondents overall, 45% had lost their 
jobs, been furloughed or had their hours reduced during the pandemic. 
Among food insecure Vermonters, two-thirds (66%) had experienced job 
losses or work disruptions since the outbreak of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Our data suggests that the growth of food insecurity is related to 
job layoffs and other employment disruptions. People who had lost their 
jobs or had their work disrupted were far more likely to be food 
insecure compared with those who remained employed."</p>
<p>Meredith Niles, assistant professor in UVM's Department of Nutrition 
and Food Sciences, a fellow in the Gund Institute for Environment and 
the principal investigator on the study</p>
<p>While job losses during the pandemic created many newly food insecure
 people, a sizable number of respondents -- 84% -- who had been food 
insecure before the pandemic remained so, a telling statistic for Niles.</p>
<p>"These are already vulnerable people and households who may be even 
more vulnerable now," she said. "They were experiencing challenges with 
food access before the pandemic, and this event has not helped them."</p>
<p>Surprisingly, less than 30% of respondents experiencing food insecurity participated in food assistance programs, Niles said.</p>
<p>In general, respondents with food insecurity expressed greater worry 
about food access than survey respondents overall. And they were more 
likely to adopt coping strategies to address food access challenges, 
like buying foods that would last longer (77%), buying different and/or 
cheaper foods (66%) or eating less (66%).</p>
<p>The last category is worrisome, said Farryl Bertmann, a lecturer in 
the Department of Nutrition and Food Sciences and a member of the 
research team.</p>
<p>"When people start eating less or disrupting their current eating 
patterns, we become concerned," she said. "When forced to skip or 
stretch meals, people increase their risk for nutrition-related 
diseases, decrease their immune function and may negatively impact their
 mental and emotional health."</p>
<p>For respondents experiencing food insecurity, the most helpful 
assistance strategies included receiving additional money for food and 
bills, achieving greater trust in the safety of stores and seeing 
benefits offered by government programs increased.</p>
<p>The average amount of additional money they said would be helpful for
 food and bills, if they had trouble affording food, was $110 per week.</p>
<p>"That's not a huge number, but it is significantly more than they get
 from public assistance programs like 3SquaresVT," said Emily Morgan, 
assistant professor in the Department of Nutrition and Food Sciences, 
another researcher involved in the survey project. "It shows there is a 
greater need than the current programs allow for."</p>

<p>The coronavirus changed food habits and practices for respondents 
overall, the survey found. Eighty-seven percent said they usually or 
always reduced the number of trips they made to the grocery store to 
avoid exposure to the virus, and 58% said they usually or always spent 
more time cooking.</p>
<p>While respondents experiencing food insecurity expressed greater 
concern and challenges accessing food, most of the respondents in the 
survey were unable to find all the food their households were accustomed
 to.</p>
<p>"We are all feeling the impacts of the coronavirus on the food system," Niles said</p>
<p>In other survey findings:</p>
<p>--Vermonters are helping each other. The percent of people reporting 
that "someone brings me food" doubled from 10% to 20% since the start of
 the outbreak.</p>
<p>--Respondents said that increased trust in the safety of going to 
stores and more food in stores would be the most helpful actions 
--Respondents worried most about food becoming unaffordable and running 
out of food if they were unable to go out.</p>
<p>--Respondents perceive their actions differently than average U.S. 
households. For example, only 49% reported buying many more items in a 
single trip to the grocery store, but 88% of respondents felt that the 
average U.S. household did so.</p>
<p>--Compared to food secure respondents, those who were food insecure 
reported more frequent challenges related to food access after the 'Stay
 home, stay safe' order was put in place. Challenges including buying as
 much of or the types of food needed, food affordability and food pantry
 access.</p>
<p>--Compared to food secure respondents, food insecure households were 
less likely to use a farm CSA, local farmstand or specialty store (a 
coop, health food store or ethnic market, for instance) but were not 
less likely to have used a farmers' market in the past year. With the 
closure of farmers' markets in Vermont, this could indicate that food 
insecure households may have limited ability to access fresh, local 
Vermont products.</p>
<p>--Respondents who reported food insecurity in the year prior to the 
coronavirus outbreak were more likely to be people of color, female, 
live in households with children and live in larger households.</p>
<p>The survey has a margin of error of 2%. A total of 3,251 Vermonters 
responded. The survey launched on March 29th and was concluded on April 
12th. The survey was developed in collaboration with researchers at 
Johns Hopkins University and fielded by the University of Vermont team. 
The research team intends to conduct the survey in other states and 
nationally, and to conduct additional future surveys in Vermont to 
assess changes in the situation.</p>

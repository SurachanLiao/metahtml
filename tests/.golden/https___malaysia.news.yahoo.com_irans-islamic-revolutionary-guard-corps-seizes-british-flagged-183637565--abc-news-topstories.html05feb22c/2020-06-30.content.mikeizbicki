<p>Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps seizes British-flagged, Liberian-flagged tankers in Strait of Hormuz</p>

<p><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/alerts/iran" rel="nofollow noopener">Iran</a>'s
 paramilitary Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps have seized a 
British-flagged and a Liberian-flagged oil tanker traveling through the 
Strait of Hormuz on Thursday, Britain's foreign secretary said, in what 
appeared to be a significant new escalation between Tehran and Western 
countries.</p>
<p>Late Friday, a management company for the Liberian tanker, Mesdar 
announced in a statement that "the armed guards have left and the vessel
 is free to continue the voyage. All crew are safe and well."</p>
<p>Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said in a statement he was "extremely 
concerned by the seizure of two naval vessels by Iranian authorities."</p>

<p>Iran's State TV said on Saturday that the British tanker was seized 
after it collided with a fishing vessel and ignored calls from the 
smaller craft.</p>
<p>Late Friday evening, following meetings in Washington, D.C., with 
more than 60 foreign ambassadors, U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) 
announced a U.S.-led maritime security initiative dubbed Operation 
Sentinel "to increase surveillance of and security in key waterways in 
the Middle East to ensure freedom of navigation in light of recent 
events in the Arabian Gulf region."</p>
<p>The initiative, according to CENTCOM, "will nations to provide escort
 to their flagged vessels while taking advantage of the cooperation of 
participating nations for coordination and enhanced maritime domain 
awareness and surveillance." The statement does not specify the nations 
that have joined the coalition.</p>
<p>The British tanker, the Stena Impero, was crossing through the strait when it abruptly changed course and headed north towards <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/alerts/iran" rel="nofollow noopener">Iran's</a> Qeshm island, ship tracking sites showed.</p>

<p>That tanker's owner and management companies issued a statement that 
the ship was "approached by unidentified small crafts and a helicopter" 
while in international waters. "We are presently unable to contact the 
vessel which is now heading north towards Iran," the companies, Stena 
Bulk and Northern Marine Management, said in the statement.</p>
<p>The Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) said that its forces 
had seized the Stena Impero "due to non-compliance with international 
maritime law and regulations," according to a statement carried by 
Iranian state news agencies. The tanker had been guided to shore and was
 already in port, the statement said.</p>
<p>The U.K. government has convened an emergency session of COBRA, its 
crisis committee, a senior U.K. official told ABC News, speaking on 
condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to comment 
publicly. Hunt confirmed that he was attending the meeting to review 
"what we know and what we can do to swiftly secure the release of the 
two vessels."</p>

<p>There were 23 crew aboard the Stena Impero, according to the 
statement from its owner, and currently there are no reports that any 
have suffered injury. Hunt said both vessels had crews comprised of a 
"range of nationalities," but noted there were no British citizens on 
board either ship.</p>
<p>The seizure comes less than a month after the U.K. seized an Iranian 
oil tanker off the coast of Gibraltar, accusing it of violating European
 Union sanctions by trying to ship oil to Syria.</p>
<p>Iran has repeatedly vowed retaliation since then and last week a 
British warship intervened to chase away Iranian small boats that 
approached another British tanker in the Strait of Hormuz.</p>

<p>Tensions have spiked in the strait again in the past few days after 
Iran said it had seized another Panamanian flagged tanker on Thursday 
accused of oil smuggling and the U.S. said it had destroyed an Iranian 
drone that approached ones of its warships. Iran has denied any of its 
drones were destroyed.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump said Thursday that the U.S. would be speaking 
to British officials about the situation and noted that the U.S. doesn’t
 have many tankers passing through the area.</p>
<p>"We heard that,” Trump told reporters as he departed the White House 
en route to New Jersey. "The United States has very few tankers going in
 because we're using our own energy now. We've made a lot of progress 
over the last two and a half years. So we don't have very many tankers 
going in, but we have a lot of ships there that are warships, and we'll 
talk to the U.K."</p>
<p>The government did say a U.S.-flagged ship, the Maersk Chicago, was 
traveling through the Strait of Hormuz late Friday and was being 
monitored.</p>
<p>"We have patrol aircraft operating in international airspace 
monitoring the situation within the Strait of Hormuz," said Lt. Col. 
Earl Brown, CENTCOM Chief of Media Operations. "U.S. Naval Forces 
Central Command has been in contact with U.S. ships operating in the 
area to ensure their safety."</p>

<p>The president noted multiple times that the U.S. and U.K. don’t have a
 “written agreement,” but that the two countries were strong allies and 
that "they’ll have a new prime minister soon, which is a good thing."</p>
<p>Later, he said that Iran was “trouble, nothing but trouble.”</p>
<p>The White House National Security Council spokesperson Garrett 
Marquis said the council is aware of the reports of the tanker's 
seizure.</p>
<p>"We are aware of reports that Iranian boats seized a British oil 
tanker," he said. "This is the second time in just over a week the U.K. 
has been the target of escalatory violence by the Iranian regime. The 
U.S. will continue to work with our allies and partners to defend our 
security and interests against Iran’s malign behavior."</p>

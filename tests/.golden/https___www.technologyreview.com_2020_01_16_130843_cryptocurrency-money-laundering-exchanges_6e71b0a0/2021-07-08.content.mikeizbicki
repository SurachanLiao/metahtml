<p class="rm-manual"><span>Category: </span></p>

<p class="rm-manual"><span>Posted </span>Jan 16</p>
<p>Criminals appear to be laundering an increasing amount of 
cryptocurrency by moving it to reputable exchanges, according to 
blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis. </p>
<p>The news: Chainalysis, which uses data analysis <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/608763/criminals-thought-bitcoin-was-the-perfect-hiding-place-they-thought-wrong/">to trace cryptocurrency transactions</a> and characterize users, <a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/money-laundering-cryptocurrency-2019">says that in 2019 criminal entities moved $2.8 billion</a> in Bitcoin to exchanges, up from <a href="https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/01/29/cryptocurrency-laundering-chainalysis/">around $1 billion in 2018</a>. More than half of that went to the two most popular ones, Binance and Huobi, it says.</p>
<p>Wait, what’s going on? Criminals have to convert cryptocurrency they 
have acquired illegally into cash. The popular exchanges are subject to 
anti-money-laundering rules that require them to know who their 
customers are. But Chainalysis’s researchers think criminals have found a
 workaround: third-party “over the counter” (OTC) brokers. These brokers
 facilitate trades between buyers and sellers who have chosen to avoid 
transacting via a regulated exchange. “The problem, however, is that 
while most OTC brokers run a legitimate business, some of them 
specialize in providing money laundering services for criminals,” 
according to Chainalysis.</p>
<p>The “Rogue 100”: According to the new analysis, only a small subset 
of OTC brokers are facilitating most of this criminal activity. 
Chainalysis has compiled a list of 100 that appear to provide 
money-laundering services, which it has dubbed the “Rogue 100.” The 
list’s members are “extremely active traders” who have been receiving 
steadily increasing amounts of cryptocurrency each month since 2017, 
according to Chainalysis, which says the activity of these traders 
“skyrocketed” this year.</p>
<p>What is the solution? Exchanges should be stricter in scrutinizing 
OTC desks, says Chainalysis. Conveniently for the company, this process 
may include the greater use of analytics tools like those it has 
developed. Cracking down on rogue OTC brokers could have broad effects, 
the company says: “After all, if there were no way for bad actors to 
cash out … there’d be far less incentive for them to commit crimes in 
the first place.”</p>

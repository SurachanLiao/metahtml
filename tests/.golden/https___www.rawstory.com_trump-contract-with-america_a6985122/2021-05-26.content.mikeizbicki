 Tuesday night that former President Donald Trump is so desperate for 
policy ideas that he's thinking of recycling Newt Gingrich's 1990s 
"Contract with America." </p>
<p>Given so many Americans who would vote in 2022 were too young to 
remember the list of right-wing promises it could see a new life among 
conservatives. The report explained that Trump is looking for the "MAGA 
Doctrine," something he didn't have in 2016. </p>
<p>"In recent weeks, Trump sat down with the former House speaker as 
well as his former chief of staff Mark Meadows and Sen. Lindsey Graham 
(R-SC) at his private Mar-a-Lago club to begin crafting the document, 
according to a source familiar with the meeting," said the report. "The 
group is still just beginning to hammer out the details of what a 
Trumpified Contract might look like. But it is likely to take an 
'America-First' policy approach on everything from trade to immigration.
 The source described it as 'a policy priority for 2022 and beyond.'"</p>

<p class="rm-manual"> <a href="https://www.rawstory.com/u/jessicacorbett-commondreams">Jessica Corbett, Common Dreams</a> </p>
<p class="rm-manual"> <span>May 26, 2021</span> </p>
<p>Sen. Elizabeth Warren on Wednesday publicly shamed JPMorgan Chase CEO
 Jamie Dimon and three other big bank chief executives for raking in a 
collective $4 billion from overdraft fees during the coronavirus 
pandemic.</p>
<p>The Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs held a <a href="https://www.banking.senate.gov/hearings/annual-oversight-of-wall-street-firms">virtual hearing</a>
 Wednesday that featured testimony from Dimon as well as Charles Scharf 
of Wells Fargo, David Solomon of Goldman Sachs, Jane Fraser of 
Citigroup, Brian Thomas Moynihan of Bank of America, and James Gorman of
 Morgan Stanley.</p>
<p>While questioning the Chase CEO, Warren (D-Mass.) also took aim at 
Wells Fargo, Citi, and Bank of America. She contrasted "generous" 
pandemic-era policies of bank regulators with those that banks had for 
their customers, as millions of people struggled with the economic 
consequences of the public health crisis.</p>
<p>Warren highlighted that as regulators delayed compliance for some 
rules and let banks to avoid paying overdraft fees for Federal Reserve 
accounts, they also <a href="https://www.fdic.gov/news/financial-institution-letters/2020/fil20019a.pdf">recommended</a> that banks <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/srletters/SR2004.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer">waive overdraft fees</a> for their customers.</p>
<p>Citing research from Pew Charitable Trusts, the senator noted that 
such fees disproportionately impact "working people making less than 
$50,000 a year, African Americans, Hispanics—people who are struggling 
to get by."</p>
<p>She told Dimon, "You are the star of the Overdraft Show. Your bank, 
JPMorgan, collects more than seven times as much money in overdraft fees
 per account than your competitors."</p>
<p>The big bank CEOs came to the Senate today to talk about how they 
stepped up and took care of customers during the…

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/SenWarren/statuses/1397577973000192007">1622043529.0</a> </p>
<p>Dimon said that his bank's Fed account was never negative and that 
customers who needed relief from overdraft fees could submit a request. 
He also told Warren, "I think your numbers are totally inaccurate, but 
we'll have to sit down privately to go through that."</p>
<p>She responded that "these are public numbers." According to Warren, 
JPMorgan collected $1.463 billion dollars in overdraft fees from its 
customers in 2020.</p>
<p>"Now, do you know how much JPMorgan's profit would have been in 2020 
if you had followed the recommendation of the regulators and waived 
overdraft fees to help struggling consumers? In other words, without 
that overdraft money, would your bank have been in financial trouble?" 
Warren asked.</p>
<p>Dimon replied that "we waived the fees for customers upon request if they were under stress because of Covid."</p>
<p>Warren told him, "I appreciate that you want to duck this question," and asked again; he reiterate his previous answer.</p>
<p>"The answer is your profits would have been $27.6 billion dollars. I 
did the math for you," Warren said. "So here's the thing: you and your 
colleagues come in today to talk about how you stepped up and took care 
of customers during the pandemic, and it's a bunch of baloney. In fact, 
it's about $4 billion dollars worth of baloney."</p>
<p>Bank overdraft fees snatch billions of dollars from struggling 
families. Even during this crisis, Wall Street milke…

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/SenWarren/statuses/1397622704891703299">1622054194.0</a> </p>
<p>"But you could fix that right now," she continued. "Mr. Dimon, will 
you commit right now to refund the one-and-a-half billion dollars you 
took from consumers during the pandemic?"</p>
<p>His response was concise: "No."</p>
<p>Warren then put the question to the other CEOs: "Will any of you agree to refund the overdraft fees that you collected?"</p>
<p>In the face of silence, she said, "I didn't think so." The senator 
concluded by adding that "no matter how you try to spin it, this past 
year has shown that corporate profits are more important to your bank 
than offering just a little help to struggling families—even when we are
 in the middle of a worldwide crisis."</p>
<p>Sens. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) in March 2020 <a href="https://www.banking.senate.gov/newsroom/minority/-coronavirus-brown-booker-file-legislation-to-temporarily-ban-overdraft-fees" rel="noopener noreferrer">unveiled</a> legislation that would temporarily ban bank overdraft fees for the duration of the pandemic—but it <a href="https://prospect.org/economy/big-banks-charged-billions-in-overdraft-fees-during-pandemic/" rel="noopener noreferrer">didn't go anywhere</a>. The following month, the pair <a href="https://www.banking.senate.gov/newsroom/minority/brown-booker-urge-banks-to-temporarily-ban-burdensome-overdraft-fees" rel="noopener noreferrer">sent</a> letters to 15 big bank CEOs, urging them to voluntarily enact such policies.</p>
<p>Brown, who chairs the U.S. Senate on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, <a href="https://www.banking.senate.gov/newsroom/majority/brown-statement-on-big-bank-hearing" rel="noopener noreferrer">declared</a> Wednesday that "Wall Street is on notice. The days of these banks and their allies controlling this committee are over."</p>
<p>Our nation's biggest banks are sending companies a clear message – 
the more you pay employees, the worse you’ll do… https://t.co/NoMb0cNRuP</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/SenateBanking/statuses/1397659061089353737">1622062862.0</a> </p>
<p>"The CEOs that came before us are the most powerful economic actors 
in the country and the signals they send to other companies influence 
workers at companies all over the country, not just their own 
employees," Brown said. "They can't say they value their workers and 
then pledge to fight employees who want to form a union. They can't say 
they are focused on lending to small businesses and growing the economy 
while spending billions on stock buybacks."</p>
<p>"They can't say they put their customers first while charging them 
overdraft and late fees during a global pandemic," he continued. "And 
they can't say climate change is a threat to the entire economy, while 
dragging their feet when it comes to investing in new technology and the
 jobs of the future. We need an economy that reflects our values not 
Wall Street's. These CEOs have a lot of work to do."</p>
<p>After the hearing, Warren <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/05/26/sen-warren-on-jamie-dimons-testimony.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">appeared</a> on CNBC's "Closing Bell."</p>
<p>"To me," Warren explained, "it's partly about overdraft fees and who 
has to pay them, but it's partly about how you think about bank 
regulation. When you give banks help and say to them, 'as your 
regulator, I'm urging you to help your customers in a time of a 
pandemic,' and the banks don't do that, that tells me that the only way 
you're going to get these banks to act is by having aggressive, detailed
 regulation."</p>

<h2 class="rm-manual"> <a href="https://www.rawstory.com/trumps-lawsuit-fail-legal-professor/"> 'A whole new level': Harvard law professor says not even Nixon would have made the legal claims Trump is </a> </h2>
<p class="rm-manual"> <a href="https://www.rawstory.com/u/sarah_k_burris">Sarah K. Burris</a> </p>

<p>In response to a lawsuit from Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA), Donald Trump
 responded that he can't be sued for anything he does as the president. 
MSNBC host Lawrence O'Donnell noted that it sounded a lot like former 
President Richard Nixon, who said, "when the president does it, it's not
 illegal." </p>
<p>But when Harvard law professor Laurence Tribe reviewed the excuse and
 explained that not even Nixon would have made the excuses that Donald 
Trump is. </p>
<p>In a case involving a civil case against Nixon, the Supreme Court 
decided that when a president is exercising his/her official duties as 
president that he/she cannot be liable. It's hard to claim that Trump's 
speech inciting an insurrection because he lost an election is an 
official duty as president. </p>
<p>"The president's claim to stay in after being voted out by the people
 and the Electoral College really, takes chutzpah to a new level," said 
Tribe. "Saying 'I have a duty to you my subjects,' I can just hear 
Richard III from the play 'Hamilton,' 'I have a duty to you my loyal 
subjects!' To remain in office, to prevent Congress from counting the 
electoral votes that would kick me out of office — if a president had an
 official responsibility — if it was part of his job description to hold
 onto that office even after he's voted out of it, and to do it even by 
trying to have his own vice president hung in front of the Capitol by 
storming the Capitol, by killing Capitol Police, if that was part of the
 job description then the job that would be described is dictator, not 
president. So, it's not a claim likely to find favor, to put it mildly, 
with the courts of the United States."</p>
<p>"And impeachment power is in this case, when all those members of the
 Senate voted to acquit him, including Mitch McConnell, they said he 
will be held responsible, the law will follow him," Tribe continued. "To
 use that quotation from the tweet that you began with, the law will 
follow him. He will be held accountable. That's why we don't have to 
convict him. Well, this is the law holding him accountable. And he says,
 not me, I was president of the United States. He just has made a 
fundamental mistake. The president is not sovereign. The president is 
not the king of us, he's not -- he's not George III, he is not even 
George Washington. He is exercising power as an employee of the people 
of the United States. He answers to the people, and one of the ways you 
answer to the people is by being held accountable for the damages that 
you do when you aim an angry mob at members of Congress and others who 
get severely injured as a result."</p>
<p>He noted that Swalwell assumed that he was going to die and even said
 goodbye to his wife and children. Trump is trying to have it both ways 
and it simply won't work under the American legal system. </p>

<p>"Late Night" host Seth Meyers unleashed on the legal systems that 
have held back on indicting Donald Trump. According to Meyers, it 
shouldn't be that hard given Trump's frequent admissions of guilt. </p>
<p>Responding to the news that the New York District Attorney has 
impaneled a grand jury, Meyers said that he was shocked it took DA Cy 
Vance two years to uncover the fraud necessary to launch a grand jury. </p>
<p>"He's arguably confessed to multiple crimes in public, incited a 
violent insurrection, he's been impeached twice, has been an unindicted 
co-conspirator in a hush-money case, paid $750 in federal income taxes 
while president, and did everything possible to hide his taxes from 
public view. At this point I wouldn't be shocked if he tried to claim a 
deduction for a bribe. I mean, what else do we need? Trump to show up to
 a Fox News interview with a shovel in a shirt saying 'I love burying 
bodies?'" Meyers asked. </p>

<p><span>SEOUL, South Korea — </span> </p>
<p>North Korea said Sunday that leader Kim Jong Un supervised the 
test-firing of a “newly developed super-large multiple rocket launcher,”
 another demonstration of the North’s expanding weapons arsenal 
apparently aimed at increasing its leverage ahead of a possible 
resumption of nuclear talks with the U.S.</p>
<p>The North’s official Korean Central News Agency, or KCNA, said that 
Saturday’s weapons test was successful and cited Kim as saying the 
rocket launcher is “indeed a great weapon.”</p>
<p>Kim underscored the need to “continue to step up the development of 
Korean-style strategic and tactical weapons for resolutely frustrating 
the ever-mounting military threats and pressure offensive of the hostile
 forces,” according to KCNA.</p>
<p>The “hostile forces” likely referred to the United States and South 
Korea, whose recently ended regular military drills infuriated North 
Korea. The North has called the drills an invasion rehearsal and 
conducted a slew of missile and rocket tests in response.</p>
<p>Some experts said North Korea aims to show off its weapons to try to 
get an upper hand ahead of a possible restart of nuclear negotiations, 
which have been largely stalemated since the second summit between 
President Donald Trump and Kim in Vietnam in February fell apart due to 
squabbling over U.S.-led sanctions on North Korea. The two leaders met 
again at the inter-Korean border in late June and agreed to resume 
talks.</p>
<p>Trump downplayed the latest launch, saying, “Kim Jong Un has been, 
you know, pretty straight with me. ... He likes testing missiles but we 
never restricted short-range missiles. We’ll see what happens.”</p>
<p>South Korea’s military said North Korea fired two suspected 
short-range ballistic missiles off its east coast on Saturday morning, 
and that they flew about 380 kilometers (236 miles) at a maximum 
altitude of 97 kilometers (60 miles). It was the seventh known weapons 
test by North Korea in about a month.</p>
<p>North Korea has been pushing to develop powerful multiple rocket 
launch systems, whose projectiles resemble short-range missiles, some 
experts said. On Aug. 1, North Korea said it tested a large-caliber 
multiple rocket guided system, a day after South Korea said the North 
fired two short-range ballistic missiles.</p>
<p>Most of the North Korean weapons tested in recent weeks have shown 
short-range flight distances. This suggests that North Korea still 
doesn’t intend to lift its self-imposed moratorium on nuclear and 
long-range missile tests, which would certainly derail the negotiations 
with Washington.</p>
<p>The latest North Korean launches came two days after South Korea said
 it would terminate its intelligence-sharing deal with Japan amid trade 
disputes between the U.S. allies. Washington expressed its 
disappointment at South Korea’s decision.</p>
<p>In a development that could possibly further complicate ties between 
Seoul and Tokyo, South Korea’s navy on Sunday began two-day exercises on
 and around a group of islets controlled by South Korea but also claimed
 by Japan. Japan’s Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying the islets
 belong to Japan and called the drills “unacceptable.”</p>
<p>South Korean navy officers said the drills are the first of two 
regular exercises held every year near the islets, called Dokdo in 
Korean and Takeshima in Japanese. They said the drills involve aircraft 
landing on the islets and warships maneuvering nearby. Local media said 
South Korea originally planned the first drills in June, but delayed 
them in consideration of relations with Japan.</p>

<h1 class="rm-manual">Kim Jong-Un’s Sister Takes Control in North Korea</h1>
<p>Maybe he just had too many people offed and someone tried to take him out.</p>
<p class="rm-manual"><a href="http://thediplomat.com/2014/10/kim-jong-uns-sister-takes-control-in-north-korea/">The Diplomat – by Tae-jun Kang</a></p>
<p>Kim Yo-jong, the younger sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, 
might be leading the hermit kingdom instead of her brother, a recent 
report from Seoul-based think tank, North Korea Intellectuals Solidarity
 (NKIS) <a href="http://www.nkis.kr/board.php?board=nkisb201&amp;config=&amp;command=body&amp;no=543&amp;">revealed</a>.</p>
<p>According to NKIS on October 1, Kim Jong-un — who has <a href="http://thediplomat.com/2014/09/kim-jong-un-and-the-npad-a-tale-of-two-absences/">failed to appear at official events</a>
 since early September — is getting medical treatment at Bonghwa Clinic 
from both domestic and foreign medical teams. Meanwhile, in his absence,
 Kim Yo-jong is charged with handling important government decisions. </p>
<p>An unnamed source told NKIS that a decision to give Kim Jong-un 
extended medical treatment was made at a meeting of the Political Bureau
 of the Central Committee of the Workers’ Party of Korea on September 6.
 The meeting was reportedly held at Kim Yo-jong’s suggestion.</p>
<p>As a result of the meeting, Pyongyang decided four things. First, to 
give special and extended medical treatment to Kim Jong-un in order to 
quickly restore his health. Second, all North Korean high level 
officials and party members should be responsible in following Kim’s 
previous orders. Third, the party and army should be on wartime-like 
alert while Kim Jong-un is out of commission. Lastly, all the important 
matters related to government administration should be reported to Kim 
Yo-jong, so that Kim Jong-un can concentrate on getting better.</p>
<p>Kim Yo-jong is the daughter of the former North Korean leader Kim 
Jong-il and his wife, Kim Yong-hui. She was first spotted at a photo 
session for participants at the 3rd Conference of the Workers’ Party of 
Korea in September 2010, when she stood next to her father’s personal 
secretary.</p>
<p>She was officially mentioned for the first time on March 9, 2014, as 
she accompanied her brother in voting for the Supreme People’s Assembly.
 She was identified as a “senior official” of the Central Committee of 
the Workers’ Party of Korea. She is widely seen as having taken over the
 role of her aunt, Kim Kyong-hui, the wife of the executed Jang 
Song-thaek. Kim Kyong-hui supported her elder brother Kim Jong-il during
 his rule.</p>
<p>“Some say Hwang Byong-so, director of the General Political Bureau of
 the Korean People’s Army, may have assumed new No. 2 status, but given 
what has been confirmed this time, we can say Hwang is just a shadow, 
and Kim Yo-jong is the second-in-command of North Korea,” said Kim 
Heung-gwang, the head of NKIS.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, speculation over Kim Jong-un’s sustained absence continues unabated.</p>
<p>South Korea’s Yonhap News Agency <a href="http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/northkorea/2014/09/26/24/0401000000AEN20140926004851315F.html">reported</a>, citing an unnamed source, that he is suffering from gout.</p>
<p>A Daily Mirror <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/kim-jong-un-loves-cheese-much-4277766">report</a> said that Kim Jong-un is addicted to Swiss cheese, which may have contributed to his health problems.</p>
<p>Curtis Melvin, a researcher with the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University, <a href="http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2014/09/29/where_is_kim_jong_un">told</a>
 Foreign Policy that Kim Jong un spends much of his time at the family 
compounds in Wonsan and Kangdong. The family compound in Kangdong is 
where Kim Jong-il recovered from his stroke.</p>
<p>In addition, Free North Korea Radio (FNK) <a href="http://www.fnkradio.com/board.php?board=newfnkb101&amp;search=%B1%E8%C1%A4%C0%BA&amp;shwhere=subject&amp;command=body&amp;no=10941&amp;command=body&amp;no=10941&amp;body_only=y&amp;button_view=n">reported</a> on September 29 that Kim hadsurgery on his ankle. The surgery was reportedly successful.</p>
<p>However, the South Korean government has refused to confirm that Kim is suffering from any health problem.</p>
<p>“I think it is hard to relate Kim’s absence to his health since there
 used to be a time when Kim disappeared from official events [for] over 
ten days,” said Lim Byeong-chul, a spokesman of the Ministry of 
Unification.</p>

 all you need to hear to never believe anything that’s written in the

because the real Kim Jung-un is dead, and the returning Kim Jong-un is a
 double. </p> <p class="rm-manual">Kim Yo-jong is Kim Jong-un’s sister? 
And only one Kim is female? They must name people this way so no one

 what is comical from an outside perspective, regarding the ludicrous 
nature of the norks political situation, begs an examination of our own.</p> <p class="rm-manual">both are illusions of power, the abuse of which is open for debate.</p> <p class="rm-manual"><a rel="nofollow" href="#comment-752101">Reply</a></p> </article> </li> </ol>

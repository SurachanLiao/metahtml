<h3>KEY POINTS</h3>
<ul>
<li>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is reportedly in "grave danger" following his heart surgery </li>
<li>He has been experiencing significant health problems lately</li>
<li>He recently missed the anniversary of the birthday of North Korea’s founding father and Kim’s grandfather, Kim Il Sung</li>
</ul>
<p>North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un is in serious condition following a
 heart surgery, a CNN report quoting an anonymous U.S. intelligence 
source familiar with the matter has said. </p>
<p>CNN <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/20/politics/kim-jong-un-north-korea/index.html" rel="nofollow">said</a>
 the dictator is in “grave danger” due to complications following the 
procedure. There is no indication from source that his condition is 
related to COVID-19.</p>
<p>Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-politics/north-koreas-kim-getting-treatment-after-cardiovascular-procedure-report-idUSKBN223011" rel="nofollow">reported</a>
 earlier that the leader, who has been plagued with health problems such
 as heart issues, gout and obesity, was receiving treatment after 
undergoing a cardiovascular procedure.</p>
<p>The news comes five days after he failed to show up for the 
anniversary of the birthday of North Korea’s founding father and Kim’s 
grandfather, Kim Il Sung, which is a national holiday in the country. 
U.S. intelligence indicated that he is experiencing health complications
 following his recent procedure, though specific details have not been 
disclosed.</p>
<p>Kim went to a hospital after presiding over a meeting of the ruling 
Workers’ Party Politburo on April 11, where Kim was last seen publicly.

<p> <span> <span> <span>The latest test comes a day before North Korea 
marks the 108th anniversary of the birth of its founder Kim Il Sung, 
grandfather of current leader Kim Jong Un</span> <span>Photo: KCNA VIA KNS / STR</span> </span> </span></p>

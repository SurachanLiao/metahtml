<p>A newer, greener way of thinking about power plants is about to hit 
home for thousands of residents on Maui, Oahu and Hawaii island.</p>
<p>By installing behind-the-meter, solar-powered home batteries, 6,000 
homeowners may provide the real estate for an aggregated virtual power 
plant, which promises to drop Hawaiian Electric Co. bills for 
participants, according to energy officials.</p>
<p><span>“Put simply, a virtual power plant is an an aggregated network 
of distributed solar and energy storage resources that can be centrally 
controlled by a grid operator and an aggregator instead, or in the place
 of, a traditional centralized power plant,”</span> Swell Energy Inc. CEO Suleman Khan said during the keynote speech at Hawaii Energy Conference on Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>Typically held in person on Maui prior to the pandemic, the Hawaii 
Energy Conference, now in its eighth year, gathers regional and national
 experts on energy policy, strategies, leadership and innovation to 
present for hundreds of attendees across various industries. This year’s
 virtual event kicked off Tuesday and continues Thursday.</p>
<p>In January, the state Public Utilities Commission approved the $25 
million contract for Swell Energy, a California-based energy and grid 
services provider, to partner with Hawaiian Electric for the delivery of
 various grid services.</p>
<p>Slated to begin this summer, the program will deliver more than 25 
megawatts of solar power paired with over 80 MW of batteries and 100 
megawatt hours of stored energy, delivering capacity and frequency 
response to the three island grids while also reducing bills for 
participating customers.</p>
<p><span>“The innovative green energy program will augment Hawaiian 
Electric’s energy supply by relieving the grid of excess renewable 
energy as production spikes, reducing peak demand and providing 24/7 
fast frequency response to balance the grid,”</span> according to Swell Energy’s website. <span>“The renewable energy storage systems will collectively respond to grid needs dynamically, moment to moment.”</span></p>
<p>Swell Energy will be the administrator and operator of a virtual 
power plant that belongs to the islands, he said. Hawaiian Electric will
 pay homeowners directly for enrolling in the program and Swell Energy 
will receive a virtual power plant development and management fee.</p>
<p><span>“We love this model,”</span> he said. <span>“We like it a lot 
because you can see a direct benefit to the homeowners that’s very well 
defined from the get-go, and homeowners have a very clear sense of what 
their participation will bring them.”</span></p>
<p>Virtual power plants, which may also be called distributed power 
plants, help in building a decarbonized, decentralized and digitized 
grid in a way that benefits consumers, utilities and financiers at the 
same time, Khan said.</p>
<p>They also allow consumers to participate in a two-way transactive 
process of generating and consuming energy to and from the grid.</p>
<p>Not only do virtual power plants curb the need for centralized power 
plants, they preserve open space and habitat, and provide equitable 
solutions for people of all socioeconomic backgrounds, he added.</p>
<p><span>“If we all agree that the energy circumstance in Hawaii 
requires innovative solutions, then we must acknowledge that these 
distributed energy resources aggregated in the form of virtual power 
plants can help ensure that distributed energy resources work together 
for the greater good of the grid and their various communities and 
service,”</span> Khan said.</p>
<p>With Hawaii’s goal of achieving 100 percent clean energy by 2045, the
 Aloha State is fertile ground for virtual power plants, Khan said. He 
lauded Hawaii as a front-runner in global renewable energy transition 
and praised the state for leading the nation in rooftop solar adoption 
where more than 30 percent of single-family homes have rooftop solar.</p>
<p>Hawaii already has about a dozen pilot and broad-scale launches for 
virtual power plants, Khan said. Swell Energy has five virtual power 
plant programs with more coming in the next several quarters.</p>
<p>Hawaii’s program is slated to begin this summer, according to 
Hawaiian Electric, and homeowners may request updates on future 
announcements on Swell Energy’s website, www.swellenergy.com.</p>
<p>Presented by Maui Economic Development Board and supported by the 
County of Maui Office of Economic Development, the Hawaii Energy 
Conference this year is exploring the <span>“Energy Transition in Hawaii: Focus on investments in people and projects.”</span></p>
<p>The two-day online event features keynotes, panel discussions, interviews, showcases and exhibits.</p>
<p>Thursday will kick off with Mark Toney of The Utility Reform Network (TURN) with his talk, <span>“Stop Overpaying for Solar: And Other Pathways to Affordable Bills.”</span></p>
<p>Participation has grown from 281 participants the first year to 413 
in 2019. In 2020 the conference went virtual due to COVID-19, and 
attendance reached 649.</p>

<p>Lyric of the week:</p>
<p>We’re all skating on the thinnest of ice</p>
<p> Gotta take it as it comes</p>
<p> In a world that isn’t so very nice</p>
<p> Gotta take it as it comes</p>
<p>Any day now the curtain may fall</p>
<p> All the plays end, there’s no curtain call</p>
<p> If you live sad, or it you walk tall</p>
<p> We’re written on wind that’s a long haul</p>
<p>–Steve Winwood, “Take It As It Comes”</p>
<p>Dan Caldwell, my good friend, professor nonpareil at Pepperdine, and the co-founder of <a href="https://www.armscontrolwonk.com/archive/402885/cold-war-secrets/">The Order of the Baby Lenin</a>,
 has compiled two charts encapsulating presidential achievements from 
Eisenhower to Obama that established norms related to weapons of mass 
destruction. Many other statesmen and women contributed (and in some 
cases, took the lead) in reaching these achievements. As a consequence, 
the battlefield use of these weapons — and even their testing — have 
been stigmatized. The number of these weapons has been greatly reduced, 
while new possessors have been limited. In some instances, stockpiles 
have been destroyed.</p>
<p>Norms make us safer, even when outliers disregard them. Deterrence 
alone hasn’t assured the absence of mushroom clouds. Deterrence is 
dangerous; without arms control and norms, deterrence is more likely to 
fail.</p>
<p>Please don’t speed-read Dan’s first chart. Read every line and try to appreciate how much effort went into this body of work.</p>

<p>Dan’s second chart identifies which Presidents deserve credit for 
these achievements. Many are no longer in force. These tear downs — 
mostly of recent vintage — are in bold. As this chart only focuses on 
the United States, it does not list agreements that Vladimir Putin has 
withdrawn from or no longer abides by.</p>

 as people have ignored the writing on the wall! Over the years, the 
demise of democracy, ending by “Money is free speech”, Corporations are

 of the human race as well as the majority of other animals. Therefore,

 actions require an addition, however. Section 5 Disarmament should 
include “Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons 2017”. With 79 
signatories and 33 ratifications, the TPNW is well on its norm-building 
way towards entry-into-force. This is thanks to a global majority of 
states and solid civil society support while nuclear-armed and 
nuclear-enabling states remain parties to deadlock in the NPT and 
elsewhere.</p> <p class="rm-manual">[p.s. Amid all the fine data, item 4.12 JCPOA lists “North Korea”.

 Krepon, the United States will NOT withdraw from the New START treaty. 
The Parties may permit New START to expire — just as they permitted the 
original START treaty to expire (without a replacement ready to 
supersede it I might add), but an agreement expiring under its own 
agreed terms does NOT constitute unilateral withdrawal.</p> <p class="rm-manual">New
 START, as START was before it, was limited in duration by design. Both 
Parties did this for a reason, in order to assess the security 
environment — including technological change — a decade hence, so that a
 proper course correction could be pursued, either with or without a 
formal agreement.</p> <p class="rm-manual">Accordingly, there is nothing
 untoward about allowing New START to run its course under its own 
terms, just like the original START treaty. And there is very good 
reason for the United States to pursue this course, given Russia’s 
actions — a topic I would be more than happy to engage anyone about in 
further detail.</p> </li> </ol>

Chan School of Public Health epidemiologist Michael Mina.","\"Hong Kong is extraordinarily densely populated, but it really didnât have any big outbreaks,\" he says. \"And thatâs probably, I think, more due to mask-wearing than exceptional contact tracing.\"","As more data comes in, Mina and others have been modeling the difference that masks and other measures make in an outbreak.","\"If you ask me my opinion about whatâs the simplest, most effective option? Mask-wearing,\" Mina says. \"I think thereâs no doubt about that.\"","If everyone wore masks, he says â which is unlikely given American culture, but if they did â it would probably keep outbreaks under control. He estimates that if two people are wearing masks, the risk that one will infect the other drops\u003Cstrong\u003EÂ \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003Eby over 90%.","\"So in that sense, I think mask-wearing alone can be a game-changer,\" he says, \"if we as a society collectively decide that we will adhere to those rules.\"","Just four months ago, health authorities were conveying the opposite message, telling the public \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C\u002Fem\u003E to wear masks. But medical historian Dr. Howard Markel from the University of Michigan says that advice came against the backdrop of a mask shortage for health care workers.","And, though masks were recommended for the public as far back as the 1918 flu, scientists haveÂ debated heatedly for decades how well they really work against viruses. Markel says the pandemic sped up that science.","\"A lot of studies were being done, at warp speed,\" he says, \"and the studies were actually quite positive that wearing masks could make a difference. Not the only difference &mdash; we have to do a lot of other things &mdash; but why not?\"","That shift could be compared to the research on condoms that went into overdrive because of AIDS, says Robert Hecht, president of Pharos Global Health Advisors, who has worked on HIV for 30 years. It was long known that condom use offered protection against sexually transmitted diseases, he says, but it wasn't until HIV hit that research into their benefits ramped up and \"that we really understood how good a potent, protective measure it was.\"","Mask-wearing, he says, may not offer perfect protection, \"but the cost of doing it to individuals and society is so low &mdash; it's a travesty, really, not to do it.\"","Thereâs still much to learn about how well masks protect against the coronavirus. Harvard epidemiologist Caroline Buckee, who challenges that recently published paper, says itâs hard to quantify the impact that wearing masks has.","\"However, we believe, based on plausible, logical arguments, that it might be very effective,\" she says, \"so itâs definitely worth doing.\"","It doesn't really matter whether masks are the very best defense, says Dr. Jeremy Faust from Brigham and Womenâs Hospital, who edits a daily summary on COVID-19 research called \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fbrief19.com\u002F\"\u003EBrief19\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.","\"This is not the Olympics,\" he says. \"Itâs not, 'If you didnât win the gold medal, no one will ever remember you.' Itâs: 'You made the podium!' \"","Even with much still unknown, he says, itâs increasingly clear that masks do help protect against the virus, and so wearing them is a patriotic service.","Markel compares the multiple protective measures people can take to layers of Swiss cheese that each have holes.","\"And when you put layers of Swiss cheese over one another, you block some of those holes,\" he says. \"But none of the layers in and of themselves are perfect. We need to accept that.\"","So the best bet, he says, is to use as many of those layers as possible â including masks."],"enhanced":false,"seriesMeta":null,"iframeHero":null,"postType":"post","isBreaking":false,"isDeveloping":false,"relatedLinks":[],"relatedLinksLabel":"Related:","broadcastType":"segment","broadcastDate":"2020-06-30 05:45:00","broadcastTime":"05:45:00","itunesEpType":"","itunesEpNum":0,"itunesTitle":"","itunesSummary":"","itunesExplicit":false,"volume":3,"disqus":null,"googlePick":false,"suppressAudio":false,"amp":true,"audioDatetime":"1593520957","pullquotes":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":61,"type":"category","name":"Boston","description":"","slug":"boston","series":false,"count":46989},{"id":69,"type":"category","name":"Health","description":"","slug":"health","series":false,"count":14904},{"id":73,"type":"category","name":"News","description":"","slug":"news","series":false,"count":54981},{"id":76,"type":"category","name":"Science","description":"","slug":"science","series":false,"count":3257},{"id":200,"type":"tag","name":"WBUR's Morning Edition","description":"Local content from WBUR's Morning Edition broadcasts","slug":"morning-edition","series":false,"count":4373},{"id":5222,"type":"tag","name":"Novel Coronavirus","description":"WBUR's ongoing coverage of the new coronavirus.","slug":"novel-coronavirus","series":false,"count":2075}],"audio":[{"id":89550,"createdAt":"2020-06-30 08:42:37","updatedAt":"2020-06-30 09:02:04","fileName":"commonhealth_0630_face-masks-most-effective-defense-coronavirus","playCount":0,"airDate":"2020-06-30","source":"commonhealth","wordpressTitle":"The Other Face Mask Fight: Are They Our Very Best Defense Against Coronavirus?","wordpressSlug":"face-masks-most-effective-defense-coronavirus","status":"available","subType":"primary","audioLength":249,"nprCDNFilename":null,"description":"Evidence continues to mount that face masks are especially good defenses against coronavirus outbreaks -- if enough people wear them.

The reports may have come from U.S. forces on the ground in Afghanistan and interviews with captured enemies. Now the question is whether spy agencies can learn more about the practices from other sources.","Some officials have said that work may now be disrupted by the press reports and public furor about it.","The Democrats who visited the White House on Tuesday said they considered the evidence that exists today serious enough not only to have merited a presentation to Trump but a public warning by him to Russian President Vladimir Putin not to target American forces.","\"It makes no sense at all for the president and the administration not to call out Putin,\" said Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. \"If that isn't something to go crazy about, I don't know what is. It just makes no sense at all.\"","Hoyer and his colleagues said they want to hear directly from intelligence community leaders, as opposed to the White House officials with whom they met on Tuesday, and for every member of Congress to get a presentation too.","So far the White House only has talked with small groups.

They also faulted what they said have become dysfunctional operations within at the White House.","\"There may be a reluctance to brief the president on things he doesn't want to hear â that may be more true with respect to Putin and Putin's Russia more than any other subject,\" said Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.","But Schiff, who led the House Democrats' impeachment efforts against Trump earlier this year, also implied the intelligence agencies and aides responsible for keeping Trump informed about threats may have not done all they could to get him to digest the bounty allegations.","\"If a president doesn't read briefs it doesn't work to give him the product and not tell him what's in it,\" Schiff said.","He continued: \"I don't want to comment on this particular case but it's not a justification to say that the president should have read whatever materials he has â if he doesn't read, he doesn't read. They should know that by know. If there's something the president needs to know before he talks to Putin, it needs to be shared with him before he talks to Putin.

But it is definitely a concern ... what role is Russia playing in Afghanistan.\"","House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said on Tuesday that he's confident Trump takes national security seriously and observed that Trump had approved the sale of weapons to Ukraine to deter Russian mischief there.","McCarthy complained about what he called the politicking over the Russia story by Democrats and said this issue is too serious to become the subject of partisan attacks.

In May, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a national health advisory on MIS-C and urged pediatric health centers to report cases of it.","Notably, although previous reports suggested that children with underlying medical conditions were most at risk, researchers found the syndrome mostly affected children without existing health issues.","The study found that 73% of the children were reported as being healthy before the onset of the syndrome. So far, it appears that children who fall ill with the rare condition do so weeks after COVID-19 cases peak in their area.","Children's Hospital Dr. Adrienne Randolph, a lead investigator for the study, said although COVID-19 often harms the respiratory system in adults, MIS-C appears to affect children's hearts, with 80% of the children experiencing cardiovascular issues.","\"I think what we clarified the most is about the cardiovascular involvement,\" Randolph said. \"Although respiratory involvement &mdash; there is some &mdash; it is not the major feature for the majority of these patients.\"","Most of the children with MIS-C either tested positive for the coronavirus or were known to have been exposed to COVID-19. The median age was 8. Of the 186 children, 25% were Black, 31% were Hispanic or Latino, 19% were white, 5% were âotherâ and 22% were of unknown race.","Randolph noted that though the syndrome can be deadly, it is rare and there are available treatments. Eighty percent of children with the condition required hospitalized intensive care; 2% died from the syndrome.","The first reports of MIS-C in April compared it to Kawasaki disease, an inflammatory condition of the immune system. However, Randolph said many of the children in the study did not meet all criteria for that diagnosis. Still, many children did respond to immune systems treatments typically used for Kawasaki disease.","\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.nejm.org\u002Fdoi\u002Ffull\u002F10.1056\u002FNEJMoa2021756\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EThe other study\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, separate from the one at Children's,Â looked at data from New York state involving 95 patients with confirmed MIS-C. It found similar rates of mortality and similar cardiovascular effects. Both studies found 80% of the children had gastrointestinal symptoms and persistent fevers.","The first cases of MIS-C were reported in Europe, where doctors said some children with COVID-19 went on to develop a mysterious inflammatory disease. Shortly after, doctors in New York reported a similar condition affecting children. Randolph said the Children's study shows that the syndrome is affecting children around the world.","\"One thing our study adds is that this is not just in Europe or New York, it's across the United States,\" she said. \"This could happen anywhere. We need to be careful and respectful of the virus.\"","The Children's Hospital research was part of the CDC's \"Overcoming COVID-19\"Â  study, and researchers will continue to track children hospitalized with COVID-19.

The 737 Max is the company's best-selling commercial jet ever. Nearly 5,000 of the planes were on back-order at the time the plane was grounded last March.","But the airplane manufacturer was dealt a big setback on Monday, too, as a major European customer, Norwegian Air Shuttle, announced it is canceling orders for 97 Boeing jets, including 92 of the fuel-efficient 737 Max planes. That is renewing questions about whether airlines will still want or need the problem-plagued Max, amid a sharp drop in air travel globally because of the coronavirus pandemic.","Aviation regulators around the world grounded the 737 Max after the March 10, 2019, crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 shortly after takeoff, killing all 157 people on board. It was the second deadly crash of a 737 Max in just over four months, following the crash of Lion Air Flight 610 on October 29, 2018, killing 189 people.","Investigators found that both crashes were primarily caused by a flawed flight control system that repeatedly put the planes into nose dives that the pilots could not pull out of.","In a \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.faa.gov\u002Fnews\u002Fupdates\u002F?newsId=93206\"\u003Estatement\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, the FAA said the agency's pilots and engineers, working with Boeing crew members, will evaluate software changes Boeing has made to that flight control system. Over three days of test flights this week, they will be taking the plane through \"a wide array of flight maneuvers and emergency procedures to assess whether the changes meet FAA certification standards.\"","The FAA said Monday's test flight departed from Boeing Field in Seattle at 9:55 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time and flew east over Washington state. Flight tracking data on the site flightradar24 shows that FAA test pilots conducted a number of high speed maneuvers at various altitudes over several hours. \u003Cbr \u002F\u003E \u003Cbr \u002F\u003EOnce the test flights are completed, the data from the flights will be reviewed and analyzed over a period of weeks. The FAA says there are still a number of additional steps in the certification process that must be completed before the plane can be cleared to fly passengers again, including the development of new pilot training procedures. The process could still take several more months.","\"While the certification flights are an important milestone, a number of key tasks remain,\" the FAA said in its statement. \"The FAA is following a deliberate process and will take the time it needs to thoroughly review Boeing's work. We will lift the grounding order only after we are satisfied that the aircraft meets certification standards.\"","FAA Administrator Stephen Dickson, a former Delta Air Lines pilot, has said he will not sign off on the certification of the 737 Max until he flies the plane himself.","Because the FAA had initially approved the 737 Max with its faulty flight control system, aviation authorities in Canada, Brazil, Europe and elsewhere are no longer willing to take the U.S. regulators' word that the plane is safe, and say they will conduct their own assessments of Boeing's fixes to the 737 Max before they will allow the plane to return to passenger service.","From the time the plane was grounded last year, Boeing often suggested its fixes for the flight control system were nearly complete and the company often predicted that re-certification of the plane was imminent. But Boeing encountered many problems and delays, with the FAA finding additional flaws in the plane that needed to be addressed.","Tensions between Boeing, the nation's largest manufacturing exporter, and its regulator, the FAA, boiled over in December, when Dickson pushed back on the company's aggressive timeline for certifying the plane, calling it \"not realistic.\" He chastised then-Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg for appearing to \"force the FAA into taking quicker action,\" and he reminded the CEO that the \"FAA controls the review process.\" Two weeks later, Boeing's board of directors fired Muilenburg.","The crisis has cost Boeing billions of dollars, as the company eventually had to halt production of the plane, which caused a ripple effect of job cuts and layoffs through the company's massive manufacturing supply chain, even before the the coronavirus pandemic led to even deeper cuts. And there are still criminal and congressional investigations into the Max crashes and the plane's initial design and certification process.","Now, Boeing is taking backseat to the FAA, and did not publicize the certification test flight. In a statement, a company spokesman said only that \"we continue to work diligently on safely returning the 737 MAX to commercial service. We defer to the FAA and global regulators on the process.\"  ","\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.npr.org\u002F2020\u002F06\u002F30\u002F885061978\u002Ffaa-begins-test-flights-for-boeings-troubled-737-max\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ECopyright NPR 2020.\u003Cimg src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.google-analytics.com\u002F__utm.gif?utmac=UA-5828686-4&utmdt=FAA+Begins+Test+Flights+For+Boeing%27s+Troubled+737+Max&utme=8(APIKey)9(MDAyNzUwMDI2MDEyNTA3MTU5NzcyNTQyNA004)\"\u002F\u003E\u003C\u002Fa\u003E"],"nprTranscriptID":0,"audio":[],"relatedLinks":[],"superTitle":null,"bylines":[{"name":"David Schaper","relativeURL":"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.npr.org\u002Fpeople\u002F2101136\u002Fdavid-schaper?ft=nprml&f=882544188,884625852,885061978,885127007,885178533,885191089","id":"2101136"}],"channel":"NPR","fullChannel":null,"channelType":"","channelURL":"","id":885061978,"wordpressSlug":"","wordpressID":null,"guid":"","source":"NPR","headline":"FAA Begins Test Flights For Boeing's Troubled 737 Max","publishDate":"2020-06-30 00:00:00","updatedDate":"","relativeURL":"\u002Fnpr\u002F885061978\u002Ffaa-begins-test-flights-for-boeings-troubled-737-max","apiURL":"http:\u002F\u002Fapi.wbur.org\u002Fstories?id=885061978&org=npr","externalURL":"","shortLink":"","miniExcerpt":"","excerpt":"More than a year after the plane's grounding because of two deadly crashes, the FAA began a series of certification flights Monday, a big step toward allowing the 737 Max to fly passengers again.","nprID":885061978,"nprURL":"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.npr.org\u002F2020\u002F06\u002F30\u002F885061978\u002Ffaa-begins-test-flights-for-boeings-troubled-737-max","dateline":"","superTitleURL":"","postType":"","isBreaking":false,"isDeveloping":false,"relatedLinksLabel":"Related:","broadcastType":null,"broadcastDate":"","broadcastTime":"","itunesEpType":"","itunesEpNum":"","itunesTitle":"","itunesSummary":"","itunesExplicit":false,"volume":3,"disqus":null,"googlePick":false,"suppressAudio":false,"amp":false,"updateDate":"2020-06-30 3:43:00","taxonomy":[{"title":"Home Page Top Stories","link":"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.npr.org\u002F","id":1002},{"title":"Business","link":"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.npr.org\u002Fsections\u002Fbusiness\u002F","id":1006},{"title":"News","link":"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.npr.org\u002Fsections\u002Fnews\u002F","id":1001}],"embedMeta":null,"index":6,"editorCreated":true,"displayAsPullquote":false,"isAd":false,"videos":[]},{"slug":"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.npr.org\u002F2020\u002F06\u002F30\u002F885127007\u002Fchina-enacts-security-law-asserting-control-over-hong-kong","program":"Morning Edition","images":[{"id":"885132639","title":"Pro-mainland supporters in Hong Kong hold Chinese and Hong Kong flags during a rally to celebrate the approval of a national security law on Tuesday.","caption":"Pro-mainland supporters in Hong Kong hold Chinese and Hong Kong flags during a rally to celebrate the approval of a national security law on Tuesday.

'Nonelitist, nonpretentious, open open mic,' Jha states at the beginning of each mic that ran every second Thursday of every month. You bared your soul on this stage because you felt comfortable to do so. You felt free. Iâm truly going to miss this space. The vibes were always lit! I met my now partner at this mic. Itâs incredibly bittersweet.\"","\u003Ch3\u003EMark Merren - Performer and Organizer\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E","\"I first discovered Milky Way around 2001. At that time I would frequent mostly Caribbean\u002FReggae parties. DJ Junior Rodigan played there on Sunday nights. One of my good friends told me to come check out the night. I remember walking down that staircase and feeling like I was entering a new world. I felt like I wasnât in Boston anymore. There were bowling lanes, pool tables, and a noticeably diverse crowd. The bartenders made you feel like you knew them for years! The pizza was incredible! I never missed a Sunday after that. About three years ago, I was looking for a permanent home for my Dancehall Lounge series, aÂ night dedicated to Afro-Caribbean music. They were open to the idea and allowed me the opportunity to grow the event into an institution at the venue. Milky Way has always been a local gem that welcomed everyone! I could always blindly recommend it to someone looking for something to do.Â  I am hopeful that one day weâll be able to reunite and dance together again. Thank you to the ownership team for always staying true to their vision of creating community. I feel like theyâll be back in some form or fashion in the coming years.\"","\u003Ch3\u003EAida Manduley - Therapist, Educator and Activist\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E","\"I'd been going toÂ BellaÂ LunaÂ since before I even lived in Boston proper, so almost 9 nine years. It was one of the few places this side of the river that had vegan pizza, and I was able to take friends of varied dietary needs too. As a Boricua far from home, having music from the island playing at a clubÂ night was amazing.Â BellaÂ LunaÂ became a common weekend haunt, and one of the only places I could reliably go to and find myself reflected through various prisms. I sang along to TaÃ­na Asili y la Banda Rebelde as they performed songs about revolution and resilience, danced salsa so hard it looked like I'd been dunked in a pool, and mooned over sweethearts while we ate bacon-wrapped figs.Â BellaÂ LunaÂ was a place where I knew I could take anyone in my life &mdash; there would always be some event that represented my communities, whether it was queer people, people of color, Latinxs specifically, feminists and more. I could go and I was guaranteed to see a friendly face every time. This loss hurts way more than I expected it to, as I don't usually feel attachments to places, butÂ BellaÂ LunaÂ wasn't just a random building. It was a hotbed of culture and community, and that is the actual grief of it.\"","\u003Ch3\u003EMarlene Boyette - Yoga and Meditation Teacher\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E","\"Receiving word that Bella Luna &amp; The Milky Way would not reopen felt akin to learning that an old dear friend had passed. Immediately I thought of the many Thursday evenings I trekked from Fitchburg State University to this community, hoping to gather enough courage to share my poetry at the open mic nights, hosted by DJ Nomadik. The Milky Way had been a large part of my introduction into Bostonâs music scene. The basement-like venue and restaurant would be bustling on any given night with musicians, poets, dancers and graffiti artists, many who later became regarded as legends.Â It was my experiences at The Milky Way that influenced my love and respect for Boston creatives and also for the neighborhood which I have called home for the last few years. Any time I walk past the original location on Centre Street and see the bowling pins on the door handle, a smile always takes over my face. It is terribly sad to think of Jamaica Plain without The Milky Way. Another historic part of this community, lost.

I was new to the LGBTQ+ scene of Boston and I was searching for spaces that felt safe not only as a queer, but as a Latina and sexual assault survivor. I came across an event that was taking place at The Milky Way and it was promoted as a dance party for queer POC. Most gay clubs I went to in the Boston area were predominantly white spaces that played EDM or techno music which is cool, but it's not really my choice of music. When I arrived at The Milky Way, I was hit with an overdrive of sensations. There were so many beautiful humans dancing, the lighting was soft and perfect, but the music is what really made me melt. The DJ was playing the sounds of the Caribbean, hip-hop, salsa, bachata, R&amp;B and more. I felt safe in this space and I shamelessly danced with whoever I wanted.","Since then, I've met other magical artists and lifelong friends at The Milky Way.

Now, Kamilah has a 5-year-old daughter, a fiancÃ© and a much better relationship with her family. She also finished her first year of college with a 4.0 GPA, and she just got elected student body president. Her plan is to become a therapist and help patients work through trauma.Â ","âI really love people, and I want to help them in their lives the way that I've been helped,â Kamilah said. âI think everybody has a story.

But unless things take yet another jag, the 240-capacity club &mdash; formerly occupiedÂ by Frank Strenk and owned by Oak Hill Properties LLC &mdash; will not reopen.","The club closed May 1, a victim of the COVID-19 pandemic. On May 26, Carl Lavin, Great Scottâs talent buyer since 2005, aligned with crowdfunding company Mainvest and launched the investment drive. (In 2012, he became an employee of the clubâs new booking agency Bowery Boston &mdash; now owned by the giant AEG.) The idea was to build a base of small-scale investors, people who loved the club and\u002For the community.","By June 10, they reached their initial goal of $150,000. Earlier this week, Nick Mathews, Mainvestâs CEO, said that theyâd raised more than $190,000 and they were still only a third of the way through the limited-time campaign. Lavin had an agreement in place to purchase the intellectual property of the brand, the liquor license and the remaining infrastructure and PA system.","There was cause for optimism, but it turned out to be misplaced. The agreement with Strenk was contingent on Lavin, via Mainvest, being able to lease the club from Oak Hill.","âThey were completely unresponsive,â Lavin said Thursday. âThe only thing they ever asked for was a written offer and I sent an offer on June 4 to lease the premises to Red Tree Real Estate, the company tasked with renting out the space for Oak Hill. I was directed to Adam Rotkin, who I spoke with. He said, âOh. they don't want to have a rock club. Send an offer, but they're pretty far down the line with [leasing to] somebody else.â I got no response, no acknowledgment that they received the offer, no additional requests. I followed up and still didnât get a response.â","On Wednesday, Lavin said he and Mainvest got a letter from Oak Hill attorney John Mangones, saying, in part: \u003Cem\u003EâOak Hill has received multiple applications from credit-worthy prospective tenants. Oak Hill is moving forward and has entered an LOI [letter of intent] with one of those applicants, with the expectation that a long-term lease will be executed shortly. â¦ There is still no timeline as to when Massachusetts will lift the shutdown for bars\u002Fmusic venues, therefore Great Scott would have to pay rent for many months without generating any revenue. â¦As part of the LOI it entered, Oak Hill is restricted from negotiating with other parties at this present time. As such, Oak Hill will not have any further communication with you about the premises.â\u003C\u002Fem\u003E","âIt was definitely a surprise to us and one not communicated at all before that moment,â said Mathews.","Reached for further comment Thursday, Mangones, a litigator for the firm Godbout Law PLLC, said everything Oak Hill needed to say was in the letter he sent to Lavin.","âI knew it was an uphill battle, but they did not treat myself or the community with any regard as far as the effort for us to maintain what it was,â Lavin said. âI've always been operating with the knowledge that this isnât what they preferred to do, and with that, there was a certain level of pessimism about being able to change the minds of people who arenât really trying to have their minds changed. My hope in reaching out early was in making my intentions clear and make them aware of the community support for the club, I was always hopeful the combination of factors could work while knowing they would be reluctant.","âI thought âHow about if I jump in and secure investments enough to cover the lease and to upgrade the soundproofing?ââ [The clubâs poor soundproofing had been an issue.] âBut they were on a path. I knew there was another preferred avenue. They had concerns about the economic viability of a venue thatâs been in this place since 1976.â","Mainvestâs Mathews issued a statement Wednesday saying that all the funds raised for saving Great Scott were held in an escrow account and âto the extent that the Great Scott campaign is unable to find a viable path forward, all invested capital will be returned to investors, fee-free.â","As to his further involvement in the rock club scene, Lavin said âIâm absolutely open to exploring other opportunities along those lines,â meaning he could still purchase the liquor license from Strenk and find another location to create a space like Great Scott.","âThis would be a completely different endeavor than what was going before,â Lavin said, âbut tapping into the communityâs hopes and wishes and wants to have Great Scott continue. Buying the license from Frank is still on the table. He hasnât sold it to anybody else.â","Mathews said Mainvest would âabsolutelyâ get on board with Lavin again should he find a new spot. âThe people of Allston have pretty clearly voted with their wallets. Itâs what they want. At the end of the day, that wasnât considered. We support Carl in his continuing work and would be more than ecstatic to bring it to another location.â","If Lavin were to do that, Mathews said Mainvest could do one of two things: Return the investments collected so far to save Great Scott and launch a new fundraiser, or revise the current offering and inform investors of the new direction, giving them the opportunity to opt-in or exit.","âIn theory, Iâd like to purchase and open something,â Lavin said. âWhat Iâve learned in this whirlwind of these two months is the role a venue like Great Scott plays for artists and fans, locally and nationally, to agents and to tour managers. What the loss of a venue like Great Scott means to the live music ecosystem in Boston is huge. I know there's still an important role for a venue of Great Scott's size to play in the music community, especially now. Where thereâs life, thereâs hope.â"],"enhanced":false,"seriesMeta":null,"iframeHero":null,"postType":"post","isBreaking":false,"isDeveloping":false,"relatedLinks":[],"relatedLinksLabel":"Related:","broadcastType":"","broadcastDate":"","broadcastTime":"","itunesEpType":"","itunesEpNum":0,"itunesTitle":"","itunesSummary":"","itunesExplicit":false,"volume":3,"disqus":null,"googlePick":false,"suppressAudio":false,"amp":true,"audioDatetime":null,"pullquotes":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":60,"type":"category","name":"Arts","description":"","slug":"arts","series":false,"count":10363},{"id":61,"type":"category","name":"Boston","description":"","slug":"boston","series":false,"count":46989},{"id":63,"type":"category","name":"Business","description":"","slug":"business","series":false,"count":7305},{"id":72,"type":"category","name":"Music","description":"","slug":"music","series":false,"count":2777},{"id":85,"type":"tag","name":"Music","description":"","slug":"sounds","series":false,"count":1232},{"id":4955,"type":"tag","name":"instagram","description":"What we've featured on our Instagram page, in reverse chronological order.","slug":"instagram","series":false,"count":227}],"audio":[],"embedMeta":null,"images":[{"type":"featured","url":"https:\u002F\u002Fd279m997dpfwgl.cloudfront.net\u002Fwp\u002F2020\u002F06\u002F0612_greatscott-01-1.jpg","width":3000,"height":1904,"title":"Great Scott at 1222 Commonwealth Ave. in Allston.

He will always be on his knees,â he says. âSo for me, I see a white savior helping people who would have never been able to do it on their own.â","It's time to remove the Emancipation Memorial and move it to a museum where itâll be better suited, Bullock argues.

Currently, thereâs no plaque at the monument in which viewers can read about the history of the statue or the real story of Archer Alexander, who helped the Union during the Civil War.","âI think to put it into a space where we can actually acknowledge that history would be 30 times better than actually leaving it up in public right now,â he says.","\u003Cspan data-index=\"1\" data-type=\"caption\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E","\u003Ch2\u003EInterview Highlights\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E","\u003Cstrong\u003EOn his reaction to the memorial as a child\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","â... I remember the first time I saw it downtown, this highly controversial piece of art is nestled right in Park Square in Boston between Maggiano's and Legal Seafood. So I was on my way down there with my family to go get something to eat and I vividly remember seeing this statue, seeing a person that looked just like me on his knees. So that's a journey that started when I was a child and I'm a grown man and it's still sitting with me.","âThere is a physical reaction, I think. Well, it was very jarring when I first saw it as a child, like, âWhoa, what is this?â But being completely honest, now itâs kind of just a numb, dulling, âWhy is it still up?â emotion whenever I see it. Whenever I pass it, it just really reminds me of what people's perception of me is. And it feels less about, hey, you should remember your proud ancestors and your proud history, and it feels more about you should remember your place because you're beneath me.â","\u003Cstrong\u003EOn the dissenting argument that formerly enslaved Black people paid for the statue and that Black Americans should be proud of Alexanderâs story\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","âThat's one of the main arguments I hear people have, is that, âHey, guys, you should be proud of this. This is your story of Archer Alexander.â It really makes me feel like so if he's really one of the most powerful African American figures that we have in our history, why do we have a statue of him naked? No one would ever want to see a statue of President Lincoln without a shirt and pants on.","âAnd in terms of the âwe paid for itâ argument, my favorite response to that is actually a quote, if you don't mind me reading it right now. It says: â$17,000 was raised to fund the memorial â an enormous sum coming from a newly emancipated people. Predictably (and this is important), none of these donors had a say in the monumentâs design. Instead, the all-white commission led by Rev. William G. Eliot set out to find a suitable tribute. Eliot met with Massachusetts-born artist Thomas Ball.â","âThis was \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fmedium.com\u002F@raulspeaks\u002Fa-monument-to-white-supremacy-stands-uncontested-in-our-own-back-yard-672f26db429c\"\u003Ewritten on Medium.com by Raul Fernandez\u003C\u002Fa\u003E. Those Black people who were involved put their money up. They weren't involved in the creative process. So it's not even their vision.â","âI think that there's this fear that by somehow getting rid of this statue that all Black Americans are going to forget that slavery happened. And I can guarantee you that the 400 to 500 years that African Americans spent in slavery left such an imprint that we will remember it if we don't see a statue reminding us of it all the time.â","\u003Cstrong\u003EOn if thereâs a way to keep the original standing and create another Alexander statue nearby\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","âFor me, two things. First, I am a creative. I'm an artist myself. And I think that would actually be pretty disrespectful to kind of put something attached to or around to influence this kind of piece of art. I don't want to touch the art itself at all. And I also think that putting something kind of a standing Archer Alexander fully clothed and putting that next to him, it is still, always remember, that he was a slave. Every movie that comes out about my Black history is about slavery, our images are slavery. I just don't understand. It feels like everyone else is way more obsessed with continuing to carry the image of slavery than actual Black people are.â","\u003Cstrong\u003EOn what next steps heâd like to see taken with the Emancipation Memorial\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","âHonestly, I think there's an amazing opportunity. What I want to see, I don't even want to see this thing destroyed, I don't want to see it melted down. I don't want to see it pulled down violently. A lot of effort and work went into that piece. And I truly respect this piece of artwork. Now, that's not something I can say at the beginning of this, but I do respect this piece of artwork. And because I respect it, I feel like this should be put in a museum somewhere where we can learn about it and have these articulate conversations that we want to have, but we can have it inside of a proper space for it and not next to Legal Seafood out in public.","âAnd the process in which to get there is something that I feel that the entire country can look at and say, âHey, this is how we can do this.â Instead of just ripping down these statues, we can gather the public support, make some noise, and then our city officials are going to have to create a process for us to actually facilitate that.","âIâm telling you, I really feel like putting it in a museum is the ultimate compromise, putting them in an organized space where they can truly be curated. I can walk and see the Emancipation Memorial and see all of the history, all of the love that went into it. All of the money that went into it. Because as awesome as this history is that everyone's bringing up about this memorial now, no one knew this. No one was talking about this.â","\u003Chr \u002F\u003E","\u003Cem\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.wbur.org\u002Finside\u002Fstaff\u002Fkaryn-miller-medzon\"\u003EKaryn Miller-Medzon\u003C\u002Fa\u003EÂ produced and edited this interview for broadcast withÂ \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.wbur.org\u002Finside\u002Fstaff\u002Frobin-young\"\u003ERobin Young\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.Â \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.wbur.org\u002Finside\u002Fstaff\u002Fserena-mcmahon\"\u003ESerena McMahon\u003C\u002Fa\u003EÂ adapted it for the web.Â \u003C\u002Fem\u003E"],"enhanced":false,"seriesMeta":null,"iframeHero":null,"postType":"post","isBreaking":false,"isDeveloping":false,"relatedLinks":[],"relatedLinksLabel":"Related:","broadcastType":"segment","broadcastDate":"2020-06-29 12:20:00","broadcastTime":"12:20:00","itunesEpType":"","itunesEpNum":0,"itunesTitle":"","itunesSummary":"","itunesExplicit":false,"volume":3,"disqus":null,"googlePick":false,"suppressAudio":false,"amp":true,"audioDatetime":"1593459068","pullquotes":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":73,"type":"category","name":"News","description":"","slug":"news","series":false,"count":54981},{"id":5315,"type":"tag","name":"Protests Against Police Brutality","description":"WBUR's coverage of the anti-police brutality protests in America in the wake of the killing of George Floyd.","slug":"protests-george-floyd-police-brutality","series":false,"count":125}],"audio":[{"id":89527,"createdAt":"2020-06-29 15:31:08","updatedAt":"2020-06-29 15:31:09","fileName":"hereandnow_0629_boston-lincoln-statue-enslaved-man","playCount":0,"airDate":"2020-06-29","source":"hereandnow","wordpressTitle":"Boston Artist Doesn't See Freedom In Lincoln Statue Featuring Enslaved Man, Calls For Removal","wordpressSlug":"boston-lincoln-statue-enslaved-man","status":"available","subType":"primary","audioLength":663,"nprCDNFilename":null,"description":"When Boston artist Tory Bullock looks at the Emancipation Memorial in Boston's Park Square, he sees subservience instead of freedom.","megaphoneID":"155ac5c6-ba3f-11ea-83ed-a34d9521e0bb","megaphoneURL":"http:\u002F\u002Ftraffic.megaphone.fm\u002FBUR1664228924.mp3","articleAPIURL":"http:\u002F\u002Fapi.wbur.org\u002Fstories?id=602425&org=wbur","audioAPIURL":"http:\u002F\u002Fapi.wbur.org\u002Faudio\u002F89527","org":"wbur","orgKey":null,"audioMeta":[{"extension":"mp3","sizeInBytes":5302390,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fdts.podtrac.com\u002Fredirect.mp3\u002Ftraffic.megaphone.fm\u002FBUR1664228924.mp3"},{"extension":"mp4","sizeInBytes":5302390,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fdts.podtrac.com\u002Fredirect.mp3\u002Fs3.amazonaws.com\u002Faudio.wbur.org\u002F2020\u002F06\u002Fhereandnow_0629_boston-lincoln-statue-enslaved-man.mp4"}]}],"embedMeta":{"embed-1":{"id":1,"parentID":602425,"type":"caption","attributes":{"id":"attachment_602448","align":"aligncenter","width":"1000","caption":"Artist Tory Bullock and the Emancipation Memorial in Boston.

Now, as the pandemic upends life as we know it, reaching into every corner of society, this vulnerable group behind bars is at risk of falling ill, out of the public eye and at the mercy of a system that has failed many before.","âJails are perhaps the least accountable part of government in the United States,â said David Fathi, director of the ACLU National Prison Project. âWhen you combine that lack of transparency &mdash; that lack of oversight &mdash; with a marginalized, unpopular captive population, it's a recipe for neglect and mistreatment.â","Reporters set out to uncover how many people had died in Massachusetts jails over the past decade, who they were, and what killed them. The information available to the public was extremely limited.","Data compiled by WBUR show that 195 people died in the custody of sheriffs from 2008 to 2018.

In the latest nine-year period available, Massachusetts sheriffs reported to the DOJ that 125 people died from all causes. But WBUR found 37 more deaths.","In jails large and small, there were cases of inmates being denied prompt care. Some were not believed when they called for help, and others were simply ignored in the custody of sheriffs who have a legal obligation to care for them.","Susan Chamberlain lost her husband.

The rest are serving sentences of less than two-and-a-half years.","âA lot of people coming into jails ... are not necessarily hardened criminals,â said Andrew Harris, professor of criminology and justice studies at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell. âAnd in many, many cases they're there because they can't make bail.â","Jails are operated by elected sheriffs and funded by state taxpayers. Under the U.S. Constitution, jails are required to provide health care comparable to what people receive in the community.

She declined to comment on Pendleton.","âOur providers send people out on a regular basis to the hospitals and have the option to do so should that be medically necessary,â she said.","In 2018, NaphCare paid $1,300 for exceeding the cap, the sheriffâs department said, or the equivalent of 13 additional off-site trips.","âIt's hard to imagine a more blatant and inappropriate disincentive to provide care than a financial penalty,â said David Fathi, director of the ACLUâs National Prison Project in Washington, D.C.","These terms can be found in contracts of all three companies that have dominated jail medical care in Massachusetts over the last 10 years.","The Bristol County jail had a cap of 20 off-site trips per month with Correctional Psychiatric Services (CPS) of Braintree.

He and his former wife adopted Sam at eight months.","He grew up in Saugus, played soccer and joined the Cub Scouts. But Sam Dunn had behavioral struggles in school and later started using drugs. He did stints in rehab centers and jail for parole violations.","Dunn had been to the Essex County jail before.

But Dunn wasnât going to stay at Essex; it was a temporary stop en route to Bridgewater.","Corrections officers put him in a group holding cell at about 5 p.m. on Jan. 6, and never entered him into the intake system.","Video of Dunn obtained in a records request shows him banging on the door of the cell to get guardsâ attention. He paces and lurches from one side of the room to the other. He strips off his shirt, and at one point his whole body shudders as he grabs his chest. Later he slouches, in and out of a stupor.","Dunn had swallowed a large amount of opioids before being taken into custody, according to a lawsuit filed by his family.","But corrections officers, as seen on the video, didnât watch Dunn closely or realize he was in distress. Two of them loaded Dunn, unsteady on his feet, into a transport van at 6:30 p.m. As they drove, the guards heard Dunn snoring loudly, the lawsuit states.","Loud snoring can be a sign of suppressed breathing, a symptom of an overdose.","At 9 p.m., the van arrived at the Bridgewater treatment center, which was in lockdown due to a riot. Dunn continued to snore loudly as officers parked in the lot and waited.","âThey are, in fact, talking on their cell phones,â Howard Friedman, the Dunn familyâs lawyer, said. âThey are listening to the radio.â","\u003Cspan data-index=\"6\" data-type=\"caption\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E","A Bridgewater lieutenant asked the officers if anyone needed medical attention; they said no, according to the lawsuit.","At about one in the morning, the officers opened the van door. Dunn had slipped from his seat to the floor and vomited, Friedman said. He wasnât breathing, and his skin had turned blue. It had been six hours since the officers loaded Dunn into the van. The lawsuit said he died of an opioid overdose.","Had Dunn been checked into Essexâs custody, âhe would have gone through an admission process and seen a doctor, and heâd be alive today,â Friedman said.","\u003Cspan data-index=\"7\" data-type=\"keyfigures\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E","The officers in the van, Patrick Barry and John Nguyen, still work at the Essex jail and did not return calls for interviews.

That means his death has never been counted, either locally or nationally.","Tony Dunn, Samâs father, said the sheriff at the time, Frank Cousins Jr., called him when Sam died.","âHe actually gave me a big song and dance about how they tried so hard to save him,â Dunn said. âAnd it was all crap. It was all made up on the spot. They didn't do anything.â","Coppinger has since installed cameras in transport vans. But thatâs no solace for Dunnâs father.

His lawsuit claimed corrections staff threatened to put him in solitary confinement if he didnât stop complaining.","Another man sued after guards allegedly beat and sexually assaulted him while he was shackled. The lawsuit was dismissed after jail surveillance video of the incident apparently went missing.","And a former inmate claimed that guards inappropriately used security dogs to attack and bite him and other inmates.

At the same time, he said he hopes to âchange the culture here â culture of the jail, culture of the staff. Teach them what is professionalism.â","\u003Cstrong\u003EBroken Back, Broken Nose And 15 Stitches\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","In July of 2012, Andrew Nascarella lay in a pool of his own blood at Essexâs Middleton House of Correction, after a guard punched him in the face.","Nascarella, a 28-year-old construction worker with a history of mental illness and serving time for larceny, was being held in the jailâs segregation unit.","At one point, he refused an order to return to his cell, because he wanted to see a supervisor. Corrections officer Travis Mustone walked across the unit to confront Nascarella. Suddenly, Mustone grabbed the handcuffed inmate from behind and hurled him to the ground, according to court records and surveillance video provided to WBUR by Nascarellaâs lawyer.","\u003Cspan data-index=\"9\" data-type=\"youtube\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E","Mustone and another guard struck him. Mustone would later say in a deposition that he feared Nascarella would hit him with his shackled hands and that Nascarella was resisting â yanking his arm away.","Nascarella screamed in pain. He told a nurse, Karen Sindoni, his back was seriously injured, Nascarellaâs lawsuit against the Essex County Sheriffâs Department and the jail medical provider stated.","Yet Sindoni did not take standard measures to stabilize his back, such as putting him on a backboard, said Jesse White, an attorney with Prisonersâ Legal Services who represented Nascarella. Some corrections officers suggested to Sindoni that Nascarella go to the hospital by ambulance, but she told them to take him in a squad car, White said.","\u003Cspan data-index=\"10\" data-type=\"caption\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E","Nascarellaâs back was broken. So was his nose, and his face needed stitches. He stayed at the hospital for 20 days.","âThis incident resulted from a pattern and a culture of violence at the facility,â White said, and âa culture of impunity that resulted from failures in supervision and investigation.â","Sindoni, who worked for NaphCare Inc., a private, for-profit company that provides healthcare in jails, declined to comment. She now works at a nursing home.","Essexâs superintendent at the time, Michael Marks, reviewed the officers' use of force on Nascarella â and found it was justified, according to court depositions.","\u003Cspan data-index=\"11\" data-type=\"pullquote\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E","But White said the investigation was woefully inadequate. The officers were never interviewed, she said, and Nascarellaâs injuries were not photographed, in a breach of standard practice.","The guard who threw Nascarella to the ground, Mustone, had been accused five times before of excessive use-of-force on inmates, and faced no discipline for them, according to the review by Prisonersâ Legal Services. He is still an officer at the jail and did not return calls seeking comment.","Marks, the longtime superintendent who ran unsuccessfully against Coppinger for sheriff, has retired. He did not respond to a request for comment.","In 2015, the sheriffâs department settled Nascarella's lawsuit for $85,000. NaphCare, the medical provider, agreed to a separate &mdash; secret &mdash; settlement, according to White.","But Nascarellaâs experience inside the Essex jail, White said, will never leave him. She said the incident exacerbated his mental illness.","âThat's really awful for the people who are incarcerated and who are traumatized,â she said, âand who then return to our communities struggling with that trauma.â","\u003Cspan data-index=\"12\" data-type=\"caption\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E"],"enhanced":true,"seriesMeta":{"tag":"sheriffs-watch","name":"Dying on the Sheriff's Watch","desc":"A WBUR investigative series that found when people suffered from dire medical conditions in Massachusetts jails, they were often ignored and mistrusted, with fatal consequences."},"iframeHero":"https:\u002F\u002Fs3.amazonaws.com\u002Fmedia.wbur\u002Fembeds\u002F2020\u002Fsheriffs-watch\u002Fday3.html","postType":"post","isBreaking":false,"isDeveloping":false,"relatedLinks":[{"id":159425,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.wbur.org\u002Finvestigations\u002F2020\u002F03\u002F23\u002Fcounty-jail-deaths-sheriffs-watch","prefix":"Part One:","title":"When Inmates Die Of Poor Medical Care, Jails Often Keep It Secret","index":1},{"id":159426,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.wbur.org\u002Finvestigations\u002F2020\u002F03\u002F24\u002Fjail-health-companies-profit-sheriffs-watch","prefix":"Part Two:","title":"Pain And Profits: Sheriffs Hand Off Inmate Care To Private Health Companies","index":2},{"id":159427,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.wbur.org\u002Fnews\u002Finvestigation-alerts","prefix":"In Your Inbox:","title":"Sign Up For Investigation Alerts","index":3},{"id":159428,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.wbur.org\u002Finvestigations\u002Fways-to-listen","prefix":"Ways To Listen:","title":"On-Air, Online And On Your Smart Speaker","index":4}],"relatedLinksLabel":"Related:","broadcastType":"segment","broadcastDate":"2020-03-26 06:45:00","broadcastTime":"06:45:00","itunesEpType":"","itunesEpNum":0,"itunesTitle":"","itunesSummary":"","itunesExplicit":false,"volume":3,"disqus":null,"googlePick":false,"suppressAudio":false,"amp":true,"audioDatetime":"1585222611","pullquotes":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":61,"type":"category","name":"Boston","description":"","slug":"boston","series":false,"count":46989},{"id":64,"type":"category","name":"Crime & Justice","description":"","slug":"crime-justice","series":false,"count":9069},{"id":73,"type":"category","name":"News","description":"","slug":"news","series":false,"count":54981},{"id":200,"type":"tag","name":"WBUR's Morning Edition","description":"Local content from WBUR's Morning Edition broadcasts","slug":"morning-edition","series":false,"count":4373},{"id":4955,"type":"tag","name":"instagram","description":"What we've featured on our Instagram page, in reverse chronological order.","slug":"instagram","series":false,"count":227},{"id":5245,"type":"tag","name":"Dying on the Sheriff's Watch","description":"A WBUR investigative series that found when people suffered from dire medical conditions in Massachusetts jails, they were often ignored and mistrusted, with fatal consequences.","slug":"sheriffs-watch","series":true,"count":4}],"audio":[{"id":85802,"createdAt":"2020-03-26 07:36:51","updatedAt":"2020-03-26 07:36:51","fileName":"investigations_0325_essex-county-jail-sheriffs-watch","playCount":0,"airDate":"2020-03-25","source":"investigations","wordpressTitle":"Inside One Jail's Health Care Problems And âCulture Of Impunityâ","wordpressSlug":"essex-county-jail-sheriffs-watch","status":"available","subType":"primary","audioLength":577,"nprCDNFilename":null,"description":"Corrections officers play a leading role in how medical care is handled at county jails.

Heâs big and beautiful and biracial, and although my wife and I have always known we would need to prepare him to face racism, weâve never talked to him or his little sister about police violence against Black people. Not until now.","He wept when we told him about George Floyd. His voice shaking, he asked whether the same thing would one day happen to him.","My wife and I told him to draw about his feelings, and what he brought back to us broke both our hearts. In pen, heâd drawn a white police officer standing in front of a cruiser, holding up a smoking gun and looking down at an unseen corpse. My son had written the words âKilled Me,â with an arrow pointing down at his own body, lying lifeless just outside the frame of the page.","Thereâs nothing my son can do to prevent this nightmare from becoming a reality. Thereâs nothing he can do to change the way the world will see him when he grows into a tall, broad-shouldered Black man.","To protect my son, and every other Black boy and girl in America, white people must change the way our own eyes see the world. We must do the work of stamping out white supremacy where it lives: in our systems, and in ourselves.","\u003Cspan data-index=\"1\" data-type=\"pullquote\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E","In 2007, less than a year after I moved to Boston, a 22-year-old woman named Chiara Levin was killed by a stray bullet, caught in the crossfire between two gang members at a party in Dorchester. I followed the news on the radio for a week or so, never seeing a photograph of the victimâs face. Unconsciously, I assumed that she was Black. When I finally saw her picture in the paper &mdash; this smiling, pretty white girl with wild, curly hair &mdash; I thought: Oh.","There was a lot to unpack in that \"Oh.\" Beneath my unspoken assumption about her race was another assumption: She was the type of person who attended parties with gang members. And beneath that: On some level, it makes sense that she was killed.","And then, even deeper, in a dark part of my mind that I didnât even know was there: Her life was less valuable than a white personâs.","When I realized what was happening in my own brain, I shuddered. I wasnât what anyone would describe as a racist. I was engaged to a Black woman whom I would marry later that year, and who would become the mother of my two children. But white supremacy had infected me in ways Iâd never realized.","Iâve lived my entire life in a world filled with literal monuments to racism, a world where weÂ regularlyÂ makeÂ unspoken justifications for living on land stolen from indigenous people, for honoring slave owners on our money, for tolerating enormous racial gaps in wealth and education and health outcomes. Even myÂ awareness ofÂ Chiara Levinâs murder is an example of white supremacy in action; if sheâd been Black, I doubt the news media would haveÂ latched onto her story. Journalists saw her white face, and the sameÂ thing that happened in my brain happened in theirs. Of all the murder victims in Boston, this is the one who matters, the white supremacist inside them whispered. This is the tragedy we will talk about for weeks, while the names of murdered Black men and women go unspoken.","I confess that thereâs still a part of me that tries to look for âreasonable explanationsâ when I first hear of a Black person dying in police custody. A part of me looks to explain away the horrible things I donât want to confront. If Iâm going to be a part of the solution, this is the piece of me I need to destroy.","\u003Cspan data-index=\"2\" data-type=\"pullquote\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E","But how?","Itâs a question Iâve asked myself a lot lately, and I think thereâs only one acceptable answer: However I can.","Iâm going to more actively look for ways to get involved, rather than hide in despair when the news makes me afraid for my childrenâs futures. Iâm going to take my cues from Black activists who know what actions will make a difference in their own lives. Perhaps most importantly, Iâm going to recommit to listening to and amplifying Black voices &mdash; and Iâm going to try to sit and stay quiet during my own moments of discomfort, when their stories challenge the things I thought I knew.","Iâm particularly interested to relearn American history from the perspective of the people who lived through it. The version I learned in school was so sanitized, so paternalistic: White people enslaved Black people, but then we saw that it was wrong, and we stopped. We forced Black people to live as second-class citizens in their own country for another century, but then we saw that it was wrong, and we stopped.","My wife is originally from Haiti, and several years ago, I learned the history of her country. Itâs a very different narrative: The French got greedy, enslaving so many Africans that Blacks outnumbered whites in Haiti by 9-to-1. The enslaved people took advantage of their numbers and the machetes theyâd been given to work the fields. They rose up, and they killed their masters, and they took their freedom.","Itâs one of the most glorious, triumphant events in all of human history. And yet, when I read about it for the first time, my hand instinctively floated upward to protect my own throat.","\u003Cem\u003EFollow Cognoscenti on \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.facebook.com\u002Fcogwbur\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EFacebook\u003C\u002Fa\u003E and \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002Fcogwbur\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ETwitter\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.\u003C\u002Fem\u003E"],"enhanced":false,"seriesMeta":null,"iframeHero":null,"postType":"post","isBreaking":false,"isDeveloping":false,"relatedLinks":[{"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.wbur.org\u002Fcognoscenti\u002F2020\u002F06\u002F16\u002Fabraham-lincoln-statue-emancipation-memorial-kevin-m-levin","title":"Black Bostonians Fought For Freedom From Slavery.

The Allan is really where the story weâre going to tell you today all started.","\u003Cstrong\u003EAmory: I mean the weather certainly isnât helping right now but it does look like a prison.Â \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","Ben: Amory and I are making our way down a mountainside toward this group of buildings perched on the eastern slope of Mount Royal Park, an ancient volcanic mountain that gave the city of Montreal its name. You can see why. Mount Royal is this big bump of green that rises up out of the middle of the city. Itâs pretty.","Amory: On a less gloomy day, so is the Allan...sort of. Originally, this was a mansion. It consists of two old stone buildings that make up 53,000 square feet, including the mansion itself and a horse stable. The stable, at one time, had its own special name: the sleep room.","\u003Cstrong\u003EBen: Oh yeah, thereâs the sleep room.Â \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","\u003Cstrong\u003EAmory: Where?Â \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","\u003Cstrong\u003EBen: Itâs right there.Â \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","\u003Cstrong\u003EAmory: Oh youâre right, OK.Â \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","\u003Cstrong\u003EBen: So letâs just keep it chill and...Â \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","\u003Cstrong\u003EAmory: Letâs just hang here.Â \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","Ben: Over the mansionâs main entrance hangs the stone bust of a snarling dog. And a large stone face staring blankly out over the city below, its lips just slightly parted. The shipping magnate who had this compound built in the 1860s, Hugh Allan, called this place Ravenscrag.","\u003Cstrong\u003EBen: Itâs very separate from Montreal, itâs very removed.Â \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","\u003Cstrong\u003EAmory: Yeah like if you were making a horror film about a psychiatric facility...Â \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","\u003Cstrong\u003EBen: A psychiatric wardâ¦Â \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","\u003Cstrong\u003EAmory: This is central casting, building-wise, I would say.\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","Ben: This place \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C\u002Fem\u003E a psychiatric hospital. The mansion was eventually given to McGill University and thatâs how it became the Allan Memorial Institute. And while it might seem like a good movie location, what happened at the Allan decades ago is real and really disturbing.","\u003Cstrong\u003EAmory: This is where people were kept for weeks, months, years sometimes, induced and experimented on.Â \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","\u003Cstrong\u003EBen: Thereâs so much history here and itâs history that at least the victims really would like people to know the story of this place and what happened here.\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","(music starts)","\u003Cstrong\u003EJanice Shaw: Light deprivation, shock treatment, hallucinogenic drugs. And she lost her soul.Â \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","\u003Cstrong\u003EStephen Kinzer: Cameron didn't seem to have the slightest hesitation about destroying the lives of his subjects. He was willing to try the most extreme techniques.\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","\u003Cstrong\u003EShantel Jacob Siddiqui: People have a hard time listening and grasping the reality of this. It shatters their belief system.\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","Ben: During the 1950s and 1960s, the Allan was run by one powerful doctor, a man who was considered an innovator, maybe even a visionary. He was a man who spent his days trying to cure mentally ill patients with cutting edge techniques, and his nights reading science fiction. His name was Dr. Ewen Cameron. And his work at the Allan Memorial Institute was actually part of a huge, secret, government-funded program that stretched its tentacles around the world.","Amory: Weâll get to all of that. But for now hereâs what you should know. In the U.S., this secret government program was run by the CIA. It had a name and a mission. Its name was MK-ULTRA...","\u003Cstrong\u003EStephen Kinzer: MK-ULTRA is almost too unbelievable to believe!\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","Amory: ...and its mission was mind control.","Ben: What is less well-known is the key role that the Allan Memorial Institute and its director played in this weird, dark, chapter in western history. Today we are going to tell you about what happened at the Allan, and who it happened to.","(theme music)","Ben: Iâm Ben Brock Johnson.","Amory: Iâm Amory Sivertson, and youâre listening to Endless Thread.","Ben: The show featuring stories found in the vast ecosystem of online communities called Reddit.","Amory: Weâre coming to you from WBUR, Bostonâs NPR Station.","Ben: And weâre bringing you part one of a special series, \"Madness: The Secret Mission for Mind Control and the People who Paid the Price.\"","(theme music out)","Ben: Back in October of 2019, the day before Amory and I were walking the grounds of Montrealâs Allan Memorial Institute, we sat down to talk with someone who had been âtreatedâ there almost 60 years ago.","\u003Cstrong\u003ENancy Layton: My name is Nancy Layton and I was a victim of treatments up at the Allan Memorial for five to six months.\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","Ben: Nancy was sent to the Allan in September of 1961. She went in at just 18 years old. And by all accounts at the time, Nancy was bright and beautiful and talented.","Amory: Now there are deep dark circles under Nancyâs eyes. Her long hair is completely white. Her skin is like tracing paper. Her speech is slurred. And throughout her conversation with us, she repeats things.","\u003Cstrong\u003ENancy (montage): Iâm healthy, well. And Iâm healthy and well. And I wanna say that...I feel fine...Iâm healthy well. And Iâm free of it. And Iâm healthy and well.\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","Ben: Nancy says she's healthy and well \u003Cem\u003Enow\u003C\u002Fem\u003E. But when she was a teenager, she went through a program designed by the director of the Allan Memorial Institute, Dr. Ewen Cameron. At the time, Dr. Cameron was supposedly doing something exciting &mdash; he was wiping out mental illness in people and rebuilding them.","Amory: Nancy spent just six months at the Allan. She was pulled out in March of 1962. And even though members of her family put Nancy into the Allan, they now say that because of what happened there, sheâs never been the same.","\u003Cstrong\u003EAngela Bardosh: So my name is Angela Bardosh. I'm Nancy Layton's daughter. I'm here to talk about things that happened to my mom a long time ago when she was only 18 at the Allan Memorial.Â \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","Ben: In 1961, Nancy had just recently started her first big job out of school.","\u003Cstrong\u003ENancy: And I worked in National Defense and worked for them for a year or two. And then I became a bit sick.\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","Amory: It was a little more complicated than that. Nancy was working for Canadaâs defense department where there were a lot of men, some of whom started giving her unwanted attention, what would probably qualify today as sexual harassment.","Ben: Nancy, her family, and her doctors all seem to agree on this part of the story. But as Angela reads from her motherâs medical documents, you get the sense that Nancyâs doctors thought she might have been seeing some things that werenât really there.","\u003Cstrong\u003EAngela (reading from documents): âShe soon found herself in difficulty because she felt that men were looking at her and making passes at her. This was quite possibly true as she's quite attractive. She began, however, to build up aggressive beliefs that she was being spied upon and began to see significance in minor actions, the way people move their armsâ¦â\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","Ben: Nancyâs sister also said that she had started to act strange. Thatâs when Nancyâs parents got involved.","\u003Cstrong\u003ENancy: My mother said, \"Weâll talk with Dr. Cameron and see what he can do.\" And he admitted me and thatâs when the whole thing started.\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","Amory: The whole thing that started was that Nancyâs mother, a medical nurse herself, had an idea of how to tackle Nancyâs problems. She knew of a guy named Dr. Cameron. He had been running the Allan since the â40s, but by the early â60s he had become a giant in the field. He brought prestige to McGill Universityâs new psychiatry department.","Ben: And these were heady days for the field of psychiatry. Dr. Cameron was doing some of the most boundary-pushing, exciting work in he western world. People describe Dr. Cameronâs reputation as godlike. He was in magazines. He was an innovator, a disruptor. He was always giving inspiring speeches about the nature of humanity and how to fix some of our greatest mental health challenges.","\u003Cstrong\u003EDr. Ewen Cameron (from the recording of a speech): Many of us repress so much that it is almost as though we had a second person within us, someone who constantly endangers the first by attempting to take over. There arises an aversion to mental illness, an aversion spreading out and covering the whole field of mental health.\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","Amory: Dr. Cameron had a guiding theory &mdash; that you could eliminate someoneâs mental illness by wiping their mind clean. He developed a rigorous regimen of inducing prolonged periods of sleep, giving his patients electroshocks multiple times a day, and giving them intense cocktails of barbiturates, hallucinogens, and so-called \"truth serums.\" He would put patients in chemically-induced comas for days or months at a time, use sensory deprivation techniques, and even play aggressive and insulting messages at them. It was designed to reduce mentally ill patients to a childlike state and remove them entirely from time and space, all so that he could rebuild them. He called this technique \"de-patterning.\"","Ben: Cameron and his colleagues were reportedly eager to have Nancy and other people like her come to the Allan. She was a perfect fit for the kinds of experiments they were doing. Cameron admitted Nancy and got her started on his cutting-edge regimen.","\u003Cstrong\u003ENancy: The doctor suggested shock treatment. And he started giving me these treatments and of course my heart stopped in the beginning.\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","\u003Cstrong\u003EBen: Your heart stopped?\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","\u003Cstrong\u003ENancy: Yeah, heart stopped. I went into cardiac arrest. And they had to bring me out of it.\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","Ben: Electroshock therapy, or what is now called electroconvulsive therapy, wasnât all that unusual in the early 1960s. But what was happening at the Allan under Dr. Cameronâs direction was very unusual. The form of electroshock he was using was 20 to 40 times more intense than the standard dose. And his patients could receive them two or three times a day. This produced violent, uncontrollable convulsions in patients. This was just the beginning of what Nancy went through, that we know. Thereâs just one big problem.","\u003Cstrong\u003EAmory: Nancy, what do you remember about being at the Allan?\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","\u003Cstrong\u003ENancy: Hardly anything in the beginning because I was in a room... I remember waking up in February, waking up near the end. And they said we'll take you back to your room now after I came out of the sleep.Â \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","Amory: Remember the horse stables at the Allan, how that building had another name &mdash; the sleep room? Nancy went into the Allan in September of 1961. And yet all that she remembers is waking up in \u003Cem\u003EFebruary\u003C\u002Fem\u003E of \u003Cem\u003E1962\u003C\u002Fem\u003E.","Ben: Angela spent a long time trying to get more information about her motherâs treatment at The Allan.","\u003Cstrong\u003EAngela: It was a very painful process of just getting the records, reading the records.Â \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","Amory: What she got eventually, itâs shocking to read.","\u003Cstrong\u003EAngela (montage of reading the documents): She had five days of sleep and five ECTsâ¦ She was taken out of the sleep room on October 30th. However, she immediately showed signs of relapse... By the first week of December, the patient had had 87 ECTsâ¦ She was then changed from Largactil 150 milligrams to Trilafonâ¦ By March 23rd she had had 129 ECTs.Â \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","Amory: Nancy had been administered 129 intensive electroconvulsive therapy treatments in six months. And sheâd been heavily sedated with a mix of antipsychotics and barbiturates, things like Pentothal, a sedative. When Angela looked that one up, she found out it was a drug that was used for many years, in higher doses, for lethal injection.","\u003Cstrong\u003EAmory: Do you remember Dr. Cameron himself?\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","\u003Cstrong\u003ENancy: Oh, yeah.Â \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","\u003Cstrong\u003EAmory: What do you remember about him?\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","\u003Cstrong\u003ENancy: I remember being on the stretcher and him giving me my injection before I went in to have the shock treatment. He was the one that gave me the shot in my arm to get me to sleep.Â \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","Ben: The injection Dr. Cameron gave Nancy was some kind of barbiturate, a sedative to put her into that deep sleep. If he was going to wipe her mind, he needed to shut it down first.","\u003Cstrong\u003EAmory: Do you remember anything else aboutâ¦\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","\u003Cstrong\u003EAngela: Maybe what he said to you?\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","\u003Cstrong\u003EAmory: Anything he said to you?Â \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","\u003Cstrong\u003EAngela: How he said it?\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","\u003Cstrong\u003ENancy: He called me Nancy Pantsyâ¦Â (laughter)\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","Ben: You can hear Nancyâs daughter Angela there, trying to jog her memory. Angela says that Nancyâs grip on her own memory is tenuous at best.","Amory: Sometimes Nancy remembers things in the wrong order. Sometimes she doesnât remember anything. Sometimes things come back in bits and pieces.","\u003Cstrong\u003ENancy: I was in the room and I was awake in the morning and I was coming back to life. And then, my mother came a few days later and they took me out.\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","\u003Cstrong\u003EBen: And do you remember anything about how your mother reacted to the treatment you were getting?\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","\u003Cstrong\u003ENancy: She said that Cameron was an old fool.Â \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","Ben: Was he though? Dr. Cameron was treating people all the time. Maybe those treatments just didn't work for everyone.","Amory: But in the time that Nancy was at the Allan, her parents had done a 180 on the treatments she was receiving under the direction of Dr. Cameron. They wanted her out.","Ben: Nancy came out of the Allan almost 20 pounds heavier, her memory impaired, and her independence gone. Sheâs relied on antipsychotic drugs basically ever since she left almost 6 decades ago. And yes, Nancy was having psychological problems when she went into the Allan. But Angela says her mom was never the same after she was treated there. Thatâs echoed in the official diagnosis when she was taken out, and in the observations of her family.","\u003Cstrong\u003EAngela: Six months later, to come out with a lot of memory loss, experiencing further delusions and being diagnosed officially as acute schizophrenic from this, I really believe that she was turned into a schizophrenic. And then after six months of going through hell, how do you regain your life? How do you even go about it?\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","Ben: Originally, doctors at the Allan had suggested they could help Nancy. By the time she was released, Dr. Cameron was saying that she couldnât be made whole again. And in a letter Dr. Cameron wrote to the new doctor who would take care of Nancy after she left the Allan, he describes Nancyâs family in terms that donât feel very empathetic.","\u003Cstrong\u003EAngela (reading from the letter): â...her father was a drug salesman, but is now retired. He's 68 and has always been dominated by his wife. Notice the mother is a driving, assertive, over-talkative woman who tends to misinterpret things...\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","\u003Cstrong\u003EBen: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait. Letâs pause on that graph.\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","Amory: âThe father has always been dominated by his wife. An over-talkative woman who tends to misinterpret things.â This sounds a lot like a doctor trying to undermine the ability of Nancyâs mother, a medical nurse, to be her advocate in care going forward.","Ben: After she left the Allan, Nancy went into another psychiatric facility, where she fell in love with another patient &mdash; Angelaâs father. They had Angela, but Nancy continued to be in and out of treatment. She couldnât work. She couldnât take care of her daughter, let alone herself. Angelaâs father and Nancy got divorced when Angela was four years old. She was raised by her grandparents. She didnât see much of her mom growing up, but eventually she had to step in and take care of her.","\u003Cstrong\u003EAmory: When you first made a choice to become more involved in your mom's life, how was she living? What did things look like?\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","\u003Cstrong\u003EAngela: It was tough to see. It was despicable. There was cockroaches. Things hadn't been washed in many weeks, you know, garbage was everywhere.Â \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","Amory: This was when Angela was just beginning her own life as an adult. Angela says she had to become a mother to her own mother. She had to put parts of her life on pause. She had to teach her mom how to buy groceries, how to do her finances.","Ben: And, as sheâs flipping through the documents that it took months for her to get, sheâs angry. Especially when she reads how doctors at the Allan wrote about their communication with Nancyâs dad during her treatment:","\u003Cstrong\u003EAngela (reading from a document): â...He has been reassured that the present planned treatment is the most appropriate for his daughter's case and that it will not induce any permanent injury to her brain or personality and that she is receiving the best possible nursing care.â\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","Amory: Angela says this line is crucial, that this is how her motherâs family was lied to. According to them, the Allanâs treatment \u003Cem\u003Edid\u003C\u002Fem\u003E cause permanent damage. It was \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C\u002Fem\u003E the best possible treatment plan... at all.","\u003Cstrong\u003EAngela: For me just to read that, it's so disturbing, having the knowledge of everything that she has gone through. It's just incomprehensible how this was done at the time.Â \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","Amory: This is just one thing that happened to one person sixty years ago. One long and lonely story, especially for Angela.","\u003Cstrong\u003EAngela: It's been a wish of mine for many, many years just to not be alone anymore in this process.\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","Ben: But hereâs the thing: Angela and Nancy are not alone.","\u003Cstrong\u003E(An echoing chant plays saying âWe want justice, we want justice, etc...\")\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","Ben: Not even close. Thatâs coming up... in a minute.","\u003Cstrong\u003E(chant fades out)\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","[Sponsor Break]","Ben: Our story about what happened at the Allan is an old one, 60 years old.

So, what did the PBA do?\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","JC: In the late '50s, early '60s, there really was a legitimate question about whether minor league baseball was sustainable, which was a kind of shocking development at the time. Because, you go back right after World War II, pretty much, if you were in a town in the U.S., you probably had a minor league team.Â There were over 400 teams. Millions â 40 million-plus fans going to games.","And then you turn around 10 years later, TV had really kind of taken away that audience. Major League Baseball stepped in and said, \"We're going to support you so that you can have a minimum number of teams, because we need the teams to develop these players.\"","\u003Cstrong\u003EKG: And under that system, minor league players are actually paid by the major league teams that hold their contracts, right?\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","JC: Absolutely. The players themselves, coaching staffs as well, [are paid by Major League Baseball clubs]. But when it comes to putting on the games, when it comes to the travel, when it comes to all those things, that's the responsibility of the minor league team, the minor league owner.","\u003Cstrong\u003EKG: So I don't want to suggest that everything moved along swimmingly from 1963 until now. In fact, the entire system almost fell apart in 1990. So tell me about that.\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","JC: What happened is: minor league baseball started to become actually a viable business. \"Bull Durham,\" the movie, comes out, which actually I think really did play a big part in kind of romanticizing the appeal of going to a minor league park.","\u003Cspan data-index=\"1\" data-type=\"youtube\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E","In 1990, Major League Baseball owners looked at minor league baseball and said, \"Wait a second.

It got bad enough that â every December, there's a winter meetings where everyone in baseball [at the] professional level gets together. And that year, they actually went to their separate cities. They didn't â they couldn't even get together.","Cooler heads prevailed, and a deal was reached. And that kind of led to, I would say, almost 30 years of detente. It really hasn't been a contentious argument until we get to here in 2020.","\u003Cstrong\u003EKG: All right. So let's set the scene for what happened last fall. On the one hand, minor league teams had a pretty good 2019 season. Attendance was up. Spirits were high, right?\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","JC: Yes, absolutely.","\u003Cstrong\u003EKG: On the other hand, a federal appeals court allowed a class action lawsuit that alleges that minor league players are being paid less than minimum wage. And this could cost Major League Baseball quite a lot of money, right?\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","JC: Oh, absolutely. In essence, a minor league player right now has to show up in February or early March. They may only get paid from June to September, even though they're required to be there from February to maybe October.

They have said one of the reasons that they want to cut the number of teams is the idea that that would allow them to pay those remaining players more than they do under the current system.","\u003Cstrong\u003EKG: And that leads to the proposal MLB made in October. In a nutshell, what would that proposal do?\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","JC: Major League Baseball's proposal was: \"Weâre gonna go from 160 [teams] to 120.\" That means that every Major League team would have four ticket-buying clubs: low-A, high-A, AA, AAA. As you might imagine, the reception from minor league baseball upon hearing the proposal to cut one fourth of their membership was, \"We are strongly, vehemently and utterly opposed to such a plan.\"","\u003Cstrong\u003EKG: So both sides met at these winter meetings to talk about this. Describe that scene for me.\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","JC: I've been going to winter meetings for close to 20 years, and I would describe it as probably the frostiest winter meetings that I've ever been a part of. And, to be honest, at the winter meetings, there wasn't a whole lot of progress made. What minor league baseball realized after that was: the best hope of winning this negotiation was to win the battle of public opinion and win the battle of political pressure.","\u003Cspan data-index=\"3\" data-type=\"caption\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E","And so there was a pretty intensive lobbying campaign afterwards, where you saw U.S. representatives from all around the country, mayors, governors, all kind of trying to turn up the temperature, put pressure on Major League Baseball to back away from this 120 plan. Then everything changed.","\u003Cstrong\u003EKG: Right, right. So then, of course, the coronavirus forced teams to send players home from spring training. Opening day was postponed. And, even if Major League Baseball returns without fans in the stands, minor league teams likely won't. So what does that leave these minor league clubs for revenue?\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","JC: Almost nothing. They'd had a normal offseason.

In the offseason, you don't make almost anything. I mean, the minor league teams make their money when people walk through the gates. They bought a ticket. They're going to buy a hat. They're going to buy a beer. They're going to buy a hot dog. All of that money just was turned off right before [the season] started.","\u003Cstrong\u003EKG: So how did that change this conversation?\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","JC: It dramatically upended it, I would say. We went from having public pressure and political pressure being MiLB's strongest weapon in this negotiation â and, on both ends, the air almost immediately went out of the balloon. I mean, there are bigger things going on in the country right now, obviously. Not to diminish this, but there just are.","And on top of that, minor league baseball is a sales-driven business. Well, not having that schedule, not having that certainty when someone says to you, \"Are you really going to be here next year?\" â that adds more difficulty, and really adds more impetus on the minor league side to get to a deal, where there is no similar time pressure for Major League Baseball.","\u003Cstrong\u003EKG: And now it looks like MLB is going to get what it wants â¦\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","JC: Right, I mean, there is no deal yet, but there seems to, now, be much more of an acceptance on the minor league side that it is gonna be 120 full-season, affiliated clubs. But MLB is publicly professing to ensure that these cities that currently have affiliate baseball [would still] have baseball, whether it's gonna be an independent professional league or whether it's a summer wood bat league ...

If you have a stadium, and you have an operator who knows what they're doing, [in] a lot of these cities, baseball will survive. I don't want to discount, though, you are going to lose something. Because Vladimir Guerrero Jr. is now playing for Toronto, but it wasn't that many years ago that he was playing in the Appalachian League. And so, anywhere around that league of really small towns, you had the chance to see a guy who's gonna be one of the biggest stars in baseball. That part's gonna be taken away. And there is something that I romanticize about that, because it's formative of my baseball fandom.","\u003Cstrong\u003EKG: So when Ted Tornow, GM of the Clinton LumberKings, tells The Des Moines Register that MLB is using the COVID-19 crisis to force these changes through.

She says that before her piece was published, she and her family had to wrestle with what it would be like to have the story of her sister's suicide out in the world.","\"Thereâs an aspect to my sister that I didnât really want to get into in the essay,\" Kyleigh says. \"She was going through a lot at the time, she was struggling with mental illness, and a lot of that was degrading the things that made her who she was.\"","\"I was afraid to bring that subject into the world in this essay because it was my first time writing anything for the public,\" she continues.","Now, it's been a year since Kyleigh's essay was published. And she says, \"Iâve learned that itâs not enough to talk about the good. Itâs okay to say that there were really hard times, and sometimes my sister wasnât who she wanted to be. I think the best thing we can do is be honest about both the good and the funny times ... and also that she struggled.\"","Kyleigh says that before her essay was published, she tried to make her sister's Facebook page less public.","\"My sister is a couple years older than me and she was using Facebook in a different way than we use it now,\" Kyleigh says. \"It was casual for her, and maybe not something that she wanted to [be public]. So for me it was trying to protect her and her memory.\"","But Kyleigh wasn't ultimately able to make her sister's Facebook into a memorialized account.","\"Because we didnât have that death certificate, even though we are certain what happened, it wasnât possible,\" she says.","Kyleigh eventually came to terms with the fact that her sisterâs Facebook page is relatively accessible. She still visits the page. And she still takes comfort from it.","\"Thereâs a risk when someone passes away that weâre going to lose aspects of them that made them who they are in these little ways â the way they smiled, or just strange, small details. Now, I look back on my sisterâs Facebook page less as [something I] need to remember her, and more as a comfort. It will be there when I need it, and sheâll always be there with me in different ways now too.","Kyleigh graduated from college last year. Now, sheâs working in journalism in New York City, although sheâs back home in Massachusetts during quarantine. And she recently got a book deal. Sheâs working on a book about her sister, and thinking about her a lot.","\"I have these old text messages Iâve saved from my sister, and a lot of them are really lovely, and are maybe from after we had a fight,\" Kyleigh says. \"Itâs ironic, but we would have a fight and she would message me something so kind. Sometimes I wouldnât answer because I would be mad at her, and now I regret that, obviously.\"","\"But in a few of the text messages she sent, she says she loves me ... and then she says she hopes I write one day. And I try to hold onto knowing she wanted this for me.\"","\"Now that my big break in writing was this essay about her and now this book about her, it makes me feel like we are doing it together in a strange way.

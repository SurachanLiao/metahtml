                      Caspian Sea to the north, Afghanistan and Pakistan to the 
                      east, Iraq to the west, Turkey to the northwest, the Gulf 
                      of Oman, the Persian Gulf and the Arabian Sea to the south. 
                      The country consists of four geographical regions. (1.) 
                      The central interior plateau which is a barren series of 
                      closed basins completely surrounded by mountains. The plateau 
                      is partly covered by salt swamps or kavirs and plains or 
                      dashts. (2.) The Zagros Mountains, which include the fertile 
                      northwestern regions of Azerbaijan and the southern coastal 
                      plain of Turkmenistan (3.) The Elburz and Talish Mountains 
                      and the Caspian Lowlands. (4.) The eastern mountains along 
                      the Pakistani and Afghan borders, which are barren ranges 
                      with fertile valleys. The principal river is the Karun and 
                      the largest body of water is Lake Urmia (formerly Lake Rezaiyeh). 
                      Major Cities (pop. est.); Tehran 6,475,500, Mashhad 1,759,200, 
                      Esfahan 1,127,000, Tabriz 1,089,000, Shiraz 965,100 (1991). 
                      Land Use; forested 7%, pastures 27%, agricultural-cultivated 
                      11%, other 55% (1993).</P>

  <P><B>CLIMATE: </B>Iran has a continental climate, although much of the
  country has a desert climate with an average annual precipitation below
  300 mm (12 inches). Summers are warm to hot with two summer winds, the
  Shamal from the northwest and &quot;The Wind of 120 Days&quot; from the
  southeast. Winters can be extremely cold with cold winds blowing from the
  northeast. Generally, rainfall occurs from October to May with annual average
  precipitation in the coastal areas between 800 and 2,000 mm (31 to 79 inches)
  while high humidity is also common along the coastal areas. Average temperature
  ranges in Tehran are from -3 to 7 degrees Celsius (27 to 45 degrees Fahrenheit)
  in January to 22 to 37 degrees Celsius (72 to 99 degrees Fahrenheit) in
  July.</P>

  <P><B>MODERN HISTORY - WWII TO 1993:</B> In 1950 Ali Razmara became Prime
  Minister and was assassinated less than nine months later. Mohammed Mossadeq
  succeeded him as Prime Minister and in 1951 the Majlis nationalized the
  oil industry which resulted in Britain boycotting the purchase of Iranian
  oil. Following which a power struggle developed between Mossadeq and the
  Shah. With US and British backing, the Shah replaced Mossadeq in 1953 with
  Gen. Fazlollah Zahedi. In 1963 the Shah launched the &quot;White Revolution&quot;
  which was a program of land reform as well as social and economic modernization.
  In 1965 Amir Abbas Hoveyda was elected Prime Minister. During the late
  1960's the Shah became dependent on the Secret Police (SAVAK) for control
  over the opposition parties after there was an Islamic uprising against
  the policies of the White Revolution. Throughout 1978 riots, strikes and
  mass demonstrations resulted in the deaths of a number of people. In 1979
  revolutionaries took control of Iran's government and the Shah was forced
  into exile. In Feb. 1979 Ayatollah Khomeini, an Islamic fundamentalist,
  returned from exile and took power, launching an &quot;Islamic Revolution&quot;.
  In Nov. 1979 Islamic militants stormed the US embassy taking the staff
  hostage. In Jan. 1980 Abolhassan Bani Sadr was elected as the first President
  of the new Islamic Republic and his government embarked on a nationalization
  program. On Sept. 22, 1980 Iraq invaded Iran over the Shatt al Arab waterway,
  although the war soon escalated into larger territorial rights. In June
  1981 Khomeini dismissed Bani Sadr. During the war Iran rejected all peace
  initiatives and demanded that the first condition for a truce was the removal
  of Saddam Hussein from power. In 1985 after the US and Soviet Union had
  cut off arms supplies, the US government attempted to win the release of
  kidnapped hostages by offering secret arms deals, which was later known
  as the Iran-Contra affair. In 1988 after waves of Iraqi military victories,
  Iran accepted a ceasefire negotiated by the UN a year before. In Nov. 1989
  the US released $US567 million dollars of frozen Iranian assets while during
  1990 a number of hostages were also released. In June 1990 a major earthquake
  struck Iran killing around 40,000 people. After Iraq's invasion of Kuwait
  in Aug. 1990, Iraq quickly settled all outstanding hostilities with Iran
  and sent some 140 jet fighters to Iran for safe keeping, although the Iranians
  quickly impounded them. After the death of the Ayatollah Khomeini in June
  1989 and the end of the 8 year Iran-Iraq war, Iraq was seen internationally
  as the regional villain instead of Iran and in early 1991 with the US-led
  armed intervention in Kuwait hard-line radicals used the situation to raise
  anti-US sentiment throughout the country. From July to September 1991 economic
  hardship and food shortages led to a series of arson attacks and violent
  riots across the country. On Sept. 20, 1991 eight members of the Freedom
  Movement were sentenced to prison for authoring and allowing to be published
  a letter to the President calling for human rights in Iran. In the second
  half of 1991 an effort was made to end Iranian involvement in Lebanon's
  civil war through the negotiated release of many Western hostages that
  included John McCarthy, Edward Tracy, Jack Mann, Jesse Turner, Terry Waite,
  Thomas Sutherland, Joseph Cicippio, Alann Steen and Terry Anderson. On
  April 5, 1992 Iran launched air attacks on opposition Mujahedin-e Khalq
  bases in Iraq resulting in the loss of one Iranian jet. In April 1992 general
  elections for the National Assembly (Majlis) resulted in a number of hard-line
  groups losing their seats. In May 1992 riots erupted in urban areas such
  as Meshed, Shiraz, Tabriz and Arak resulting in the direct deaths of several
  people while eight others were later executed for their involvement. During
  1991 and 1992 the government has also focused on the reconstruction of
  its war devastated economy with a number of multilateral trade groupings
  and bilateral trade agreements being initiated with the former USSR Caucasian
  republics and Central Asian republics. In April 1993 Secretary of State,
  Warren Christopher accused Iran of being an &quot;outlaw&quot; nation that
  further distanced US-Iran relations while claims that Iran was supporting
  the Islamic government in The Sudan as well as Islamic revivalists groups
  in Egypt, Algeria, Lebanon and the West Bank added further strains on their
  relations. On May 25, 1993 Iran launched further air attacks on opposition
  bases in Iraq. On June 11, 1993 Presidential elections resulted in Rafsanjani
  being re-elected for another term with 63% of the vote. In Oct. 1993 the
  Iranian deputy foreign minister visited Iraq to discuss prisoner exchanges
  while the conflict between Iran and the United Arab Emirates subsided over
  territorial claims of a number of islands annexed by Iran in 1971.</P>

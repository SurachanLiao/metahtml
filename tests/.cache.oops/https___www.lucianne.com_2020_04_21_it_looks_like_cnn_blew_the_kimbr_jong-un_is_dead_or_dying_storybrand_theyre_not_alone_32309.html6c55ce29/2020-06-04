            Well, it finally happened. North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un reportedly had heart surgery and suffered a severe complication that left him in a dire medical situation. He could also be dead. That’s what CNN and NBC News’ Katy Tur peddled out respectively. Granted, this is a closed society, so be cautious and after China totally botched a science experiment in one of their virology labs in Wuhan which led to the current COVID-19 pandemic—I’m not trusting their sources either. It led to some excellent memes and social media posts.

        President Donald Trump on Tuesday questioned a CNN report that Kim Jong-un’s health is reportedly in “grave danger” following a surgery.

“With CNN, they come out with a report — I don’t put too much credence in it,” Trump said.Trump did not confirm or deny the report but said that he does not know if the reports are true.

The president expressed concerns for Kim’s health after meeting him on three different occasions to negotiate a peace deal with North Korea.

“I wish him well,” Trump said. “If he is in the kind of condition that the reports say, that the news is saying, that’s a very serious condition.”

        Well, it finally happened. North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un reportedly had heart surgery and suffered a severe complication that left him in a dire medical situation. He could also be dead. That’s what CNN and NBC News’ Katy Tur peddled out respectively. Granted, this is a closed society, so be cautious and after China totally botched a science experiment in one of their virology labs in Wuhan which led to the current COVID-19 pandemic—I’m not trusting their sources either. It led to some excellent memes and social media posts.

        The Trump administration released its guidelines Thursday for “Opening Up America Again” after the country’s economy plummeted and businesses closed their doors amid the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak. The plan includes three phases, with instructions for both individuals and employers.

“Based on the latest data, our team of experts agree that we can begin the next front in our war which we are calling ‘Opening Up America Again,’ and that’s what we are doing. We’re opening up our country,” said President Donald Trump at Thursday’s White House press briefing.

        One of the weirdest things about the modern left isn’t how much the activist class despises people who succeed, it’s how many of those activists actually come from money themselves. Not that they want you to know it, they pretend it isn’t true while enjoying the freedoms that come from their family’s accomplishments.

The latest example of this comes from the New York Post, which exposed a guy named Carlos Maza as a hypocrite on Saturday.

Maza, who goes by the name “gay wonk,” is known for whining about people who’ve earned a lot of money and trying to “cancel” conservatives for making fun of him.

        You’ve noticed it right?

The Democratic leadership of 2020 will not tell you the truth about almost anything. They lie to everyone, at nearly every moment, about almost everything, all the time. 

They lie to their opponents, to the voters, and of course, they lie to each other. 

For instance, after clearly naming two associate Supreme Court justices, and pledging that they “would not know what hit” them, the highest-ranking Senate democrat claimed he never said what he in fact said.

From the same event, a congresswoman with a straight face, said to reporters that “abortions are safer than the extraction

        An international prosecutor, Fatou Bensuda, was advised Thursday by a panel at Hague that she should go ahead and investigate alleged war crimes committed by Americans in Afghanistan. It’s a shocking development. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called the International Criminal Court panel’s ruling “a truly breathtaking action by an unaccountable political institution masquerading as a legal body.” It is, but what to do?

        What should be done about Senator Schumer’s threats to two members of the United States Supreme Court? Everyone agrees that the senator’s words were shocking. Mr. Schumer, while addressing an abortion rights rally in front of the Court, issued threats against two justices over a case on abortion. “I want to tell you, Gorsuch, I want to tell you, Kavanaugh, you have released the whirlwind, and you will pay the price,” Mr. Schumer boomed.

The Baltimore Sun, in an editorial today, reckons that Mr. Schumer was merely echoing Justice Kavanaugh’s expression, during his confirmation hearing, of fear of the whirlwind the Democrats had sewed.

        Mayor Bloomberg's decision to quit the presidential race ignited in us the urge to send him a check for $550 million. We barely know him, but we're partly to blame for the fiasco, in that we issued more editorials than any other paper encouraging him to throw his hat into the ring. Imagine, then, our chagrin when we discovered we couldn't quite cover the 550 million sponduluks. So we'll have to make do with simple sentiments.

        There’s too much power vested in nine people in black robes. It only takes five justices, though, to make decisions that impact generations. And they’ve been Supremely wrong, repeatedly. In Dred Scott vs. Sanford, the Supreme Court ruled that slaves were not citizens and, therefore, not afforded constitutional rights. The Civil Rights Act of 1875, both written and passed solely by Republicans, was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. In Plessy v. Ferguson, despite the Reconstruction Amendments (13th, 14th and 15th), an arrogant Supreme Court affirmed codified racial discrimination in what should be called Separate and Unequal. I

        South Carolina mom Debra Harrell worked at McDonald's. She couldn't afford day care for Regina, her 9-year-old daughter, so she took her to work.

But Regina was bored at McDonald's.

One day, she asked if she could just play in the neighborhood park instead. "I felt safe there," tells me in my new video, "because I was with my friends and their parents."

"She had her cellphone, a pocketbook with money in it," says Debra. "She had everything she needed."

Regina was happy. Debra was happy.

But one parent asked Regina where her mom was, and then called the police. Officers went to McDonald's and arrested Debra.

In jail, they berated her.

        In a hypersexualized world, where reality dating shows revolve around sex appeal and dating drama, Netflix’s new show, Love is Blind, has refreshingly changed the focus of relationships to the importance of emotional connection before physical. In doing so, an uncomfortable truth was shown: men are using abortion as a means to escape responsibility, and abortion is hurting women in the process.

Tearfully, one of the contestants named Amber shared her personal experience with abortion.

        Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democrat presidential nominee, said he would undoubtedly select former first lady Michelle Obama to be his running mate, though he admitted she likely does not want to jump back into politics anytime soon. “I’d take her in a heartbeat,” Biden said in a Monday interview with CBS Pittsburgh when asked if he would add Obama to the ticket. “She’s brilliant. She knows the way around. She is a really fine woman. The Obamas are great friends.”

        Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer compared the COVID-19 battle to World War II and asked:
“In World War II, there weren’t people lining up at the capitol to protest the fact that they had to drop everything they were doing and build planes or tanks, or to ration food.”

Does anyone want to tell Whitmer the difference is during the war effort people were working and getting paid; but under her unilateral decrees people are forbidden from working and no-one is earning a living…. Which is the entire reason for the protests, DUH.

        Wednesday, former Secretary of State John Kerry called into question President Donald Trump’s leadership during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

Instead of leading, Kerry suggested on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” that Trump is “playing out an election strategy” and “attacking governors” and members of the media in a way he said he has never seen by a president.

“Look, the truth is, and everybody in America, I think, is beginning to come to understand that this president is not leading now, he’s playing out an election strategy,” Kerry stated. “He’s more focused on getting the economy moving before all the experts say you ought to be putting people back together in close quarters again

        Former President Bill Clinton signed an order preventing the CIA from organizing a kill operation against al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, according to a new documentary.

The revelation is discussed by former CIA station chief Bob Grenier in the new Showtime documentary The Longest War, which was released Tuesday. Grenier, who was based in Islamabad, Pakistan, explained that the agency was permitted to engage in “lethal activity” against the terrorist leader but could not perform a strike with the explicit purpose of killing him.

“We were being asked to remove this threat to the United States essentially with one hand tied behind our backs,”

        A meat-processing company which shut down a South Dakota plant after more than 700 employees became infected with COVID-19 said the outbreak was due to the factory’s ‘large immigrant population’. Smithfield Foods blamed the migrant workers' ‘living circumstances’ that are ‘different than they are with your traditional American family.’ The company said the indefinite closure of the pork plant in Sioux Falls disrupted its supply chain, forcing the closure of a facility in Martin City, Missouri. Smithfield also shuttered a plant in Cudahy, Wisconsin, after employees tested positive for the virus. South Dakota's governor said the temporary closure of the plant

        CNN political commentator Van Jones said Tuesday that the decision by some states to ease stay-at-home restrictions and open businesses is effectively "a death sentence for communities of color," which have been disproportionately affected by the novel coronavirus. His comments follow Republican Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp's announcement that some businesses in the state would be able to reopen as early as Friday, as other state leaders signaled similar plans. "I think it's incredibly reckless. And, you know, signing these orders is signing a death certificate for many, many, many people who do not need to die and who will," Jones

        The United Nations warned the coronavirus pandemic could trigger famine as the worldwide freeze on commerce sent shock waves through financial markets.
The bleak warning came on Tuesday as deaths from the virus surpassed 174,000 worldwide, with governments anxiously trying to chart a path out of the unprecedented global health and economic emergency. One World Food Programme director warned 'widespread famines of biblical proportions' could force millions in already vulnerable countries into starvation due to the global crisis. The economic impact of the pandemic could lead to a 'humanitarian catastrophe,' with the number of people suffering from acute hunger projected to nearly double

        Michael Moore is worried about Earth, although he’s not focused on fossil fuel and cow farts. Instead, he’s worried because he just discovered that green energy is a scam. That’s the point in his new documentary, “Planet of the Humans,” which was released Tuesday for free on YouTube. In a long and poorly written introduction on the YouTube page, the people who made the video explain that the green revolution could have worked out if only the whole movement hadn't sold itself out to the rich and powerful, resulting in a sham and a scam.

        Not since Lazarus has the world heard of such an unbelievable rise.On Monday, CNN posted video of pseudo-newsman Chris Cuomo “finally” emerging from self-quarantine in his Southampton basement — despite Cuomo having been out and about in East Hampton just last week, getting into a fight with a “jackass loser fat-tire biker” who dared to ask why an infected Cuomo was breaking quarantine. Without a face mask.“Who the hell are you?” Cuomo replied. “I can do what I want.”Yes: If we’ve learned anything about Chris Cuomo these past three weeks, it’s that he’s an insecure, self-important, entitled blowhard

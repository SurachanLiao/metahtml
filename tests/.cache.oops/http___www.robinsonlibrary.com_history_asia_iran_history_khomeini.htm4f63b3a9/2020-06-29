        <p>Ruhollah Hendi was born on September 24, 1902, in the
        desert town of Khomein, into a family of strong religious
        traditions. His father was martyred by agents of rich
        landowners when Khomeini was only a few months old. His
        childhood and youth were spent under the care of his
        mother and his aunt, but he lost both in the course of a
        single year when he was fifteen.</p>
        <p>In 1921, he left Khomein to study religious science at
        a theology institute in Arak; he moved to the city of Qom
        a year later. It was at Qom that he attended lectures on
        ethics and Islamic mysticism; he also spent six years
        studying under the Ayatollah Aqamirza Mohammad Ali
        Shahabadi. In 1929, at the age of 27, he began teaching
        Islamic philosophy, theoretical mysticism, jurisprudence,
        and Islamic ethics.</p>
        <p>Khomeini's first political statement was written in
        1941 and published in book form under the title <em>Kahfol-Asrar</em>.
        In this book he revealed what he considered to be the
        crimes of the 20-year monarchy of <a href="pahlavi.htm">Shah
        Mohammad Reza Pahlavi</a>, and detailed his ideas of an
        Islamic government and the need for an uprising to
        establish such a government.</p>
        <p>As his popularity amongst the Iranian people
        increased, so too did his threat to the Pahlavi regime.
        On March 22, 1963, government forces attacked the
        Feyziyeh theological center in Qom. Khomeini's messages
        and speeches condeming the attack stirred and incited his
        followers. On June 5, Khomeini was arrested by goverment
        soldiers and taken to Tehran. His arrest further inflamed
        his followers and led to numerous protests. Ten months
        later, the Iranian government capitulated and freed
        Khomeini.</p>
        <p>Khomeini's freedom did not last long, however, as he
        was again arrested at his home on November 4, 1964.
        According to previously arranged agreements, he was
        immediately taken to the airport and put on a plane to <a
        href="../../../balkan/turkey/index.htm">Turkey</a>. After
        eleven months of closely-observed exile in Turkey,
        Khomeini left for <a href="../../iraq/index.htm">Iraq</a>.
        Throughout his period of exile Khomeini continued his
        campaign for major political reform in Iran. Forced to
        leave Iraq in 1978, he took up residence in a suburb of
        Paris, from whence he continued his campaign against the
        Shah, as well as against the Shah's principal backer, the
        <a href="../../../../america/unitedstates/index.htm">United
        States</a>. He produced tape recordings calling for
        massive disobedience, which were smuggled into Iran and
        broadcast to the people via shortwave radio.</p>
        <p>Khomeini's &quot;long-distance protests&quot;
        eventually forced the Shah to flee Iran on January 16,
        1979. On February 1, 1979, after fourteen years in exile,
        Khomeini was allowed to return to Iran. In November 1979,
        Khomeini's open anger against the United States led to
        the storming of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and the
        seizure of 53 <a
        href="../../../../america/unitedstates/1961/1977/hostage.htm">hostages</a>
        -- a situation that would end up lasting until January
        1981.</p>

        <p>Under a new Constitution adopted in December 1979,
        Khomeini was named supreme leader of the Islamic Republic
        of Iran for life. Under Khomeini, almost every aspect of
        Iranian politics and economics underwent enormous change.
        The legal system of Iran became based on the strict
        ideals and principles of the Koran, and all vestiges of
        the capitalist economic system were essentially
        eradicated.</p>
        <p>Extremely popular with the people, he nonetheless
        faced major challenges. After ten years of political
        instability, economic hardship, and a debilitating war
        with Iraq, Khomeini was finally forced to reconsider the
        course of his country. On April 24, 1989, he called for a
        Council of Experts to be formed and be charged with the
        responsibility of looking into the reforms needed to the
        constitutional law and codifying them in order to both
        improve the lives of Iran's people and to better
        implement Islamic laws. He would not live long enough to
        see those reforms made, however.</p>
        <p>Khomeini died in a Tehran hospital on June 3, 1989,
        ten days after being operated on for a digestive
        disorder.</p>

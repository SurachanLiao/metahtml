				<div class="entry-content">
			<p><strong>(29 November 2018) &#8211;</strong> The globalists have made arrangements for a big assassination show at the G20 Summit tomorrow, so this entry is aimed at exposing their plot and forestalling any effort to go through with it. No magician gets the audience response he seeks when some loudmouth heckler (like me;-) is yelling out the secrets of the trick he&#8217;s attempting. That being the case, allow me to show you the whos, whats, wheres, whens, hows and whys of how the rabbit got in the G20 Summit hat.</p>
<p><em><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Who</span> will conduct the mass assassination?</strong></em> &#8211; It will be the G20 globalists themselves, both East and West, who will stage the assassination attack. Since they have total control over the G20 venue, they have arranged for their intelligence agencies to plan it, and both the Mossad and the MEK will be involved in carrying it out (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Mujahedin_of_Iran" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MEK</a> is a Iranian dissident terror cult trained and supported by the Mossad).</p>
<p>The plan calls for ISIS to take the initial blame for the attack, then for it to be blamed on Iran and Hezbollah. And after the resulting wars are in full swing, they’ll redirect the blame to the Mossad and the MEK.</p>
<p><em><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">What</span> is the nature of the assassination attack?</strong></em> &#8211; It will be part real and part theater, and according to the media narratives (both mainstream and alternative), it will happen because a number of powerful groups and individuals want a number of the G20 leaders dead. These “powerful players” include ISIS, Hezbollah, Iran, Qasem Soleimani, Israel, the Mossad, the MEK, the Pope and the Jesuits, the European Establishment, and the various “deep states” of America, Russia, China, India, Saudi Arabia and Brazil, to name but a few.</p>
<p>The real part of the attack will be the explosions and the deaths of civilians, security personnel, and low-level officials; the fake part will be the deaths of the national leaders, as they will be evacuated through the expanded, renovated and bunkered “Jesuit tunnels” prior to the explosion(s). They’ll then be sequestered until it’s time to “resurrect the dead.”</p>
<p><em><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Where</span> is the attack going to take place?</strong></em> &#8211; In Buenos Aires, which has a history of large terror attacks supposedly carried out by Iran and Hezbollah.</p>
<p><em><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">When</span> will the attack happen?</strong></em> &#8211; On Friday or Saturday, with Friday being the more likely day.</p>
<p><em><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">How</span> will the attack be conducted?</strong></em> &#8211; It will likely involve city-wide distraction attacks and a concurrent cyberattack to throw the G20 security forces into disarray, followed by a main attack carried out with either a swarm of armed/explosive aerial drones or a water-borne nuclear warhead (of a 10-kiloton or so yield). Iran&#8217;s stealthy copy of a captured American aerial spy drone may play a role.</p>
<p><em><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Why</span> are the G20 staging the attack?</strong></em> &#8211; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G20#History" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The G20 was formed by the central bankers and their national finance minister lackeys</a>; national leaders were later added to the mix. So the organization exists to advance the agenda of the central bankers, and staging a grand assassination show at this year’s “Leaders’ Summit” will enable the banksters to make a massive movement towards their goals.</p>
<p>The G20 attack will give rise to a number of interrelated wars that will collectively be known as “World War 3,” and after Israel is finally fingered as being responsible for the G20 attack, World War 3 will transition into a “Gog-Magog” invasion of Israel and a final culminating battle (of &#8220;Armageddon&#8221;). The NWO (a “reformed” and stronger UN) will then rise from the ashes of the wars.</p>
<p>So that is the summary of what’s planned; to understand all the details, you’ll need to read the notes I made during November. You should find them quite interesting.</p>
<p>But let me preface the notes by telling new readers that the globalists control both sides in the current political drama: both the “Establishment” side (Obama, Clinton, Soros, the Bilderbergers, the mainstream media, etc.) and the “Anti-Establishment” side (Trump, Le Pen, Putin, the BRICS, the alternative media, etc.). They are deliberately staging a dialectic conflict between these two controlled fronts in order to implode their existing “Establishment” and erect a new one (the New World Order) in its place. That is the true narrative of what’s going on in our world today.</p>
<p>What I’ll be covering in the writings that follow are the specific events and false narratives they’re attempting to use in moving us into the NWO. Since there are two controlled sides to the staged conflict, there are two false narratives the globalists are spinning: 1) the <strong>mainstream narrative</strong> is the Establishment-side propaganda they sell to the sleepers, and 2) the <strong>alt-media narrative</strong> is the Anti-Establishment-Side propaganda they sell to those who are awakening. They want you to come to see the mainstream narrative as a lie and the alt-media narrative as the truth. That’s because today’s alt-media will be the mainstream media of the New World Order.</p>
<p>That being said, enjoy the notes&#8230;</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The potential for an assassination show at the G20</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(2-4 November 2018)</strong></span></h2>
<p><strong>(2 November 2018) &#8211;</strong> There’s an interesting assassination play shaping up for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_G20_Buenos_Aires_summit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">G20 Summit at the end of the month</a>. Get a load of this&#8230;<br />
<a href="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/brazjudge112.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8023" src="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/brazjudge112.png" alt="" width="642" height="853" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/brazjudge112.png 642w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/brazjudge112-226x300.png 226w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/brazjudge112-624x829.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" /></a><br />
&#8230;from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/01/world/americas/brazil-judge-lula-bolsonaro.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The New York Times</a></p>
<p>This development creates the appearance of a quid-pro-quo arrangement between Bolsonaro and the judge (it can be claimed the judge improperly convicted Lula in exchange for a promised cabinet post in Bolsonaro’s government).</p>
<p>This being the case, should the globalists do their assassination show at the G20 Summit instead of Paris, they can not only script the “Western Satanists’ assassination of the Avatars” (Trump, Putin, Xi, and Modi), but also script a leftist takedown of Bolsonaro (&#8220;Brazil&#8217;s Donald Trump&#8221;) by removing Brazil&#8217;s President Temer from the board.</p>
<p>Under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_presidential_line_of_succession" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brazil’s rules of presidential succession</a>, an assassination of Temer at the G20 would allow Brazil’s National Congress to elect a new president to finish out his term. And that means they could elect Lula (if his second appeal meets with success in November or December) or someone else who could pardon Lula. Either way, a free Lula could be combined with a leftist uprising to demand a new presidential election under threat of civil war.</p>
<p>It’s a clever play, but hopefully this early exposure will nix it. Just to be sure, I&#8217;ll give it a double-tap before the G20 Summit convenes.</p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>(3 November 2018) &#8211;</strong> Now allow me to cover this scenario in more depth by looking at its different components, beginning with&#8230;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>The Replacement President Component</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The setup for the Temer assassination show started with the impeachment and removal of Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff on August 31, 2016. On that day, Vice President Michel Temer rose to the presidency, leaving the office of Vice President vacant. So if Temer gets killed at the G20 this month, there would be a <strong>double vacancy</strong> in the offices of president and vice president, which triggers the following constitutional process in Brazil&#8230;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> Should a President die, resign or be removed from office, a Vice-President succeeds as President.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The other officers in the line of succession do not become President in those cases. Instead, the next available person in line merely becomes Acting President, and <strong>the Constitution dictates that, whenever both the presidency and the vice-presidency become vacant, new elections are to be held. So in the case of an Acting President taking office due to a double vacancy in the presidency and vice-presidency, the Acting President serves only until the special election takes place and the newly elected President and Vice-President are sworn-in.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>If the second vacancy triggering elections takes place in the last two years of the presidential term, the National Congress is empowered and required to elect the President (and his Vice-President).</strong> If the double vacancy of the presidency and vice-presidency takes place in the first half of the four-year presidential term, however, a presidential election by popular vote is held.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">In any event, <strong>the President and Vice-President so elected merely finish what remains of the pending presidential term</strong>, and thereafter a new President and a new Vice-President, chosen in the regular general elections, take office for a normal four-year term. <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong> &#8211; from <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_presidential_line_of_succession" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia</a></span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">So following the “death” of Temer, the President of the Chamber of Deputies (Rodrigo Maia) would become the momentary Acting President until a replacement President can be elected. And since the double vacancy would happen during the last two years of the current presidential term, the National Congress would elect the replacement.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Since the replacement President would have less than a month in office before Bolsonaro is inaugurated on January 1, he or she would only have time to do something simple (like pardoning Lula). So Lula is the next component we’ll look at.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><em>More to come over the course of the weekend, including coverage of the assassination show setup in Paris and the imminent implementation of the US oil export embargo on Iran (which is scripted to provide the Iranians with the motivation to assassinate Trump in Paris or at the G20, even though they won’t be the ones doing it).</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>The Lula Component</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">To acquaint you with the current situation of Luiz Inacio <strong>Lula</strong> da Silva, a popular former President of Brazil who held office from 2003 &#8211; 2010, here is <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luiz_In%C3%A1cio_Lula_da_Silva" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a passage from Wikipedia</a>&#8230;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> On 12 July 2017, he was convicted of money laundering and passive corruption, defined in Brazilian criminal law as the receipt of a bribe by a civil servant or government official. <strong>Lula was sentenced to nine years and six months in prison by judge Sergio Moro</strong>, but he remained free pending an appeal of the sentence. On 24 January 2018, the Regional Federal Court of the 4th Region, which is a panel of three appellate judges, unanimously upheld Moro&#8217;s ruling against Lula and increased the sentence to 12 years. On 5 April 2018, the Supreme Federal Court voted to reject Lula&#8217;s habeas corpus plea and on the same day a warrant was issued for his arrest. He turned himself in and began serving his sentence on 7 April 2018.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Lula announced his candidacy for the 2018 presidential election, but he was disqualified from running under Brazil&#8217;s &#8220;Clean Record&#8221; law</strong> by the Superior Electoral Court on 31 August 2018 and was replaced by Fernando Haddad on 11 September 2018. The United Nations Human Rights Committee requested that the Brazilian government allow Lula to exercise his political rights as a presidential candidate. <strong>Prior to being barred, Lula led all scenarios in polls for the October election</strong>, achieving 39 percent in voter intentions within one month of the first round. <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">So Lula is the leftist candidate who supposedly would have won the recent Brazilian presidential election if he hadn’t been sidelined by a corruption conviction. And now that Bolsonaro has tapped the judge who convicted Lula for a cabinet post in his administration, an appearance of impropriety has been created that could lead to Lula’s conviction being vacated or pardoned&#8230;</span><br />

<span style="color: #333333;">&#8230;from <a style="color: #333333;" href="http://www.cadenagramonte.cu/english/show/articles/28607:lawyers-demand-impartial-and-fair-trial-for-lula-in-brazil" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cadenagramonte.cu</a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">This provides the globalist scriptwriters with two ways of scripting the Brazilian “left’s” attempt to overturn the election of Brazil’s Donald Trump&#8230;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">They can script the overturning of Lula’s conviction before the National Congress holds the post-assassination election of Temer’s replacement, thus allowing them to elect Lula.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">They can script the National Congress electing a replacement President who will pardon Lula in December, before Bolsonaro takes office.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">And as I said yesterday, a free Lula could be combined with a leftist uprising to demand a new presidential election under threat of civil war. Such a strategy was already previewed in the press before Bolsonaro made his questionable appointment of Lula’s judge&#8230;</span><br />

<span style="color: #333333;">&#8230;from the <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://mg.co.za/article/2018-11-01-brazilian-left-reels-as-country-lurches-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mail &amp; Guardian</a>. Here is the relevant excerpt&#8230;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> “Lula-ism is bigger than the PT. <strong>The party has the backing of organised labour and social movements, but Lula has the support of the mass of society, the poorest people in Brazil</strong>,” said Ricardo Musse, a sociologist at the University of Sao Paulo.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">“The PT isn’t a homogeneous party… There will be a sector that will try to ditch Lula, another that <strong>will lead the political opposition (to Bolsonaro)</strong>&#8230; and another that <strong>will drive social resistance with street protests</strong>.” <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Also note the blurb below the photo; they are using the same “resistance” wording the American “left” has used against Trump, and “Not Him” is reminiscent of “Never Trump.” As I&#8217;ve said before, the globalists are using this &#8220;leftist chaos that pushes people to the right&#8221; template all over the place at both the national and global levels.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The next component we’ll look at is the Bolsonaro / National Congress relationship.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>The Bolsonaro / National Congress Relationship Component</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>(4 November 2018) &#8211;</strong> The relationship between President-Elect Bolsonaro and the National Congress has been narrated as being tense. Bolsonaro once said that <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2018/11/election-of-bolsonaro-likely-to-test-democracy-in-brazil-and-beyond/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">if he were ever elected President, he would shut down the National Congress on his first day</a>. And <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-brazilian-candidate-bolsonaro-scolds-son-for-threatening-to-shut-down/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">back in July, his son threatened a shutdown of the Supreme Court</a>. If you add to that <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2018/11/01/president-elect-bolsonaro-to-brazils-bureaucrats-youre-fired/#7f040b726137" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bolsonaro’s expressed intention to fire many of the government’s bureaucrats</a>, you get a situation in which those institutions and their members (the current Brazilian &#8220;Establishment&#8221;) see Bolsonaro as an existential threat.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">On top of that, there is the matter of pervasive corruption in the National Congress. <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/brazils-political-class-is-in-crisis-as-over-100-are-investigated-for-corruption/2017/04/12/d2832a8a-1f7e-11e7-bb59-a74ccaf1d02f_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In last year’s corruption purge, 66 senators and representatives went under the microscope</a>. And Bolsonaro’s appointment of Lula’s convicting judge to the post of justice minister signals a massive corruption purge will occur after the January 1 inauguration.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">That being the case, the corrupt members of the current Congress have less than two months before the new corruption crusade begins and new pro-Bolsonaro congresspersons take office and shift the balance of power. This provides motivation for them to do anything possible to stop Bolsonaro, including assassinating Temer and electing or pardoning Lula.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">It is important to note that Argentina is hosting the G20 Summit this year, and they share a common border with Brazil. This makes the infiltration of a G20 hit team by the Brazilian “Deep State” a simple matter. So in the next section, we’ll look at all the potential G20 targets of the various “Deep States” as well as all the nations and groups that stand to be blamed if an attack happens.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>The Details of a Possible G20 False-Flag</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Here are the likely and possible targets, likely scapegoats, and likely modes of attack for a G20 “terrorist attack” scenario (I’ll flesh out all the details of this section in the coming hours / days / weeks)&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>LIKELY TARGETS</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>&gt; Donald Trump of the US &#8211;</strong> the controlled media, both mainstream and alternative, have cast him as a existential threat to the “US Deep State,” the “Satanic Western globalist” agenda, the trade interests of China, and the regimes of Iran and North Korea. So they all supposedly want him dead.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>&gt; Vladimir Putin of Russia &#8211;</strong> He too has been cast as an existential threat to the “US Deep State,” NATO, the EU, and the “Satanic Western globalist” agenda. So they all supposedly want him dead alongside his “fellow Christian” Trump.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>&gt; </strong><strong>Xi Jinping of China &#8211;</strong> He has been cast as an enemy of the corrupted, Western-friendly element of the Communist Party, and <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/31/world/asia/xi-jinping-internal-dissent.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he is supposedly facing a quiet rebellion against his anti-corruption drive, his consolidation of power and his confrontational stance towards the West</a>. So his domestic rivals would like to see him disappear.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>&gt; Narendra Modi of India &#8211;</strong> As a Hindu nationalist, <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/bigotry-normalised-modi-180411100651759.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he has been cast as an enemy to Indian and Pakistani Muslims</a> <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/modi-government-initiates-steps-to-check-isis-spread-in-india/articleshow/50089249.cms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and ISIS</a>, so <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/associate-of-isis-suspect-discussed-targeting-pm-modi-gujarat-anti-terrorism-squad-chargesheet-1850500" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the jihadis would like to bathe in his blood</a> (or whatever it is they do after a satisfying kill). And since <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://qz.com/india/1080927/did-pakistan-help-north-korea-develop-nuclear-weapons-india-us-japan-want-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pakistan supposedly helped North Korea build their nukes</a>, Modi’s death from a Pakistani / North Korean warhead could trigger the India versus Pakistan element of World War 3.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>&gt; Michel Temer of Brazil &#8211;</strong> His assassination at the G20 would open the door for Brazil’s China-supported Leftist Establishment to bring Lula back to stop or impede President-elect Jair Bolsonaro.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>&gt; Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) and/or King Salman of Saudi Arabia &#8211;</strong> MBS has been cast as an enemy of the “US Deep State” and an existential threat to the petrodollar, so both the Saudi and US “Deep States” supposedly want him out of the way. Killing him at the G20 would directly solve the problem; killing his father would remove his biggest supporter, leading to his fall from power; and killing both him and his father would solve the current problem and prevent any future problems. It would be back to business as usual for the US-Saudi cabal.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>&gt; Moon Jae In of South Korea &#8211;</strong> Killing him at the G20 would throw a monkey wrench in the North-South Korean peace process, and doing it with a nuke or other WMD supposedly sourced from North Korea would flat out kill the peace process and bring on war.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>&gt; Giuseppe Conte of Italy &#8211;</strong> As the new “anti-Establishment, populist” leader of Italy, Conte supposedly poses an existential threat to the European Establishment’s EU and Euro projects, as well as their Islamic invasion plan. So they would supposedly like him to “sleep with the fishes” in the Rio de La Plata.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>POSSIBLE TARGETS</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>&gt; Macron, May and Merkel &#8211;</strong> From the perspective of the European Establishment, all three of these leaders are supposedly damaged goods, so their deaths at the G20 could serve the purpose of generating public sympathy for them and their Establishment parties. And from the perspective of the real globalist agenda, moving them off the board would open the way for populists to surge into power (which is what the globalists actually want at this stage of The Plan).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>&gt; Tusk and Juncker &#8211;</strong> From the perspective of the European Establishment, their deaths would be another sacrifice of damaged goods for public sympathy towards the EU.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>LIKELY SCAPEGOATS</strong> (according to the mainstream narrative)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>&gt;</strong> Iran</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>&gt;</strong> Qasem Soleimani of Iran</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>&gt;</strong> Hezbollah (most likely), Hezbollah posing as ISIS, Al Qaeda and/or ISIS</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>LIKELY MODES OF ATTACK</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">One or more advanced “Iranian” drone aircraft or a sub, mini-sub, or swimmer delivery vehicle carrying one of the following&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>&gt;</strong> conventional explosives and shrapnel (which will actually be theatrical explosives)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>&gt;</strong> chemical, biological, or radiological agents (fake ones)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>&gt;</strong> a “North Korean” nuke supposedly given to Iran (real, but not from North Korea or Iran)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The nuke option is unlikely if Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey shows up to the Summit. It is doubtful that the globalists will remove him from the board this early (he still has much to do in playing his role), so his attendance would likely mean a nuclear attack isn’t planned. But should something happen in Turkey that prevents him from attending, the nuke option is definitely on the table.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Switching subjects a moment to the US oil embargo and the Iranians, have a look at this pictorial standoff between Trump and the globalists&#8217; &#8220;Imam Mahdi&#8221;&#8230;</span><br />

<p><span style="color: #333333;">When you see things like this, it&#8217;s important to remember that nothing is what it appears. What I mean by that will become clear in future writings.</span></p>
<p><strong>(12 November 2018) &#8211;</strong> The Economist got a lot of attention recently for the “blank” cover of their <a href="https://shop.economist.com/products/the-world-in-2019#" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;The World in 2019&#8221; issue</a> (these yearly covers typically tease the public with cryptic images depicting globalist intentions)&#8230;<br />

&#8230;But this 2019 cover is not blank; it simply depicts an all-encompassing darkness. This is because the globalists heartily intend to take us into the “Darkness Before the Dawn” phase of their NWO implementation plan next year (good luck with that, fellas). You can read about this phase in the NWO Schedule of Implementation section further down this page.</p>
<p><strong>One of the main markers of the beginning of “the Darkness Before the Dawn” is the fall of Donald Trump, either by assassination or removal from office.</strong> And the upcoming G20 Summit in Buenos Aires offers the final grand stage they can use to put on the assassination show this year. If the globalists want to take us into the Darkness Before the Dawn in 2019, a big hit at the G20 would do nicely to get it started. We’d be falling right into the abyss as the new year begins. I’ll therefore cover it in a comprehensive manner.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Why the Globalists Chose Buenos Aires for a G20 Summit Bombing</span><br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;">(13 November 2018)</span></h2>
<p>Will history repeat itself in 17 days?&#8230;<br />

&#8230;(the aftermath of the 1992 Israeli embassy bombing in Buenos Aires)</p>
<p>As I’ve previously written, in the first days/weeks after an attack at the G20 Summit, ISIS is likely to be blamed (due to fabricated evidence and a false claim of responsibility supposedly planted by Iran). But the Western intelligence agencies (Argentine intelligence in particular) and the Western mainstream media will soon after identify Iran and Hezbollah as the true culprits. The globalists will script it this way so they can get the whole world angry at Iran and start the wheels of World War 3 in motion. We’ll be seeing “<strong>Target Iran</strong>”&#8230;<br />
<a href="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/targetiraq1113.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8084" src="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/targetiraq1113.png" alt="" width="465" height="332" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/targetiraq1113.png 465w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/targetiraq1113-300x214.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 465px) 100vw, 465px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>That being the case, the globalists could pick no better site than Buenos Aires for a mass casualty “terror” attack “carried out by Iran and Hezbollah.” Why, you ask? Because Buenos Aires has already suffered TWO such attacks in recent memory.</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE FIRST</strong> was the 1992 attack on the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires. Here are some key passages from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_attack_on_Israeli_embassy_in_Buenos_Aires" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its Wikipedia page</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> The attack on the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires was a suicide bombing attack on the building of the Israeli embassy of Argentina, located in Buenos Aires, which was carried out on 17 March 1992. 29 civilians were killed in the attack and 242 additional civilians were injured&#8230;</p>
<p>On 17 March 1992, at 2:42 pm (UTC−3), a pick-up truck driven by a suicide bomber and loaded with explosives smashed into the front of the Israeli Embassy located on the corner of Arroyo and Suipacha, and detonated. The embassy, a Catholic church, and a nearby school building were destroyed&#8230;</p>
<p>A group called Islamic Jihad Organization, which has been linked to <strong>Iran</strong> and possibly <strong>Hezbollah</strong>, claimed responsibility&#8230;</p>
<p>In 1999, the Argentine government issued an arrest warrant for Imad Mughniyah in connection with this attack and the 1994 AMIA bombing in Buenos Aires, which killed 85. It is suspected that the two attacks are linked. <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>THE SECOND</strong> attack was the 1994 AMIA bombing in Buenos Aires. Here are some key passages from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMIA_bombing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its Wikipedia page</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> The AMIA bombing was an attack on the Asociacion Mutual Israelita Argentina (AMIA; Argentine Israelite Mutual Association) building. It occurred in Buenos Aires on 18 July 1994, killing 85 people and injuring hundreds. It was Argentina&#8217;s deadliest bombing ever. Argentina is home to a Jewish community of 230,000, the largest in Latin America and sixth in the world outside Israel (see Demographics of Argentina)&#8230;</p>
<p>On 18 July 1994, a suicide bomber drove a Renault Trafic van bomb loaded with about 275 kilograms (606 lb) of ammonium nitrate fertilizer and fuel oil explosive mixture, into the Jewish Community Center building located in a densely constructed commercial area of Buenos Aires&#8230;</p>
<p>The bombing came two years after the 17 March 1992 bombing of the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires which killed 29 and wounded 242, and was Argentina&#8217;s deadliest attack until the AMIA bombing. The Islamic Jihad Organization, which according to Robert Baer operates under the umbrella of <strong>Hezbollah</strong> and is linked to <strong>Iran</strong>, claimed responsibility for that bombing. Some suspect that the AMIA bombing was connected to the embassy attack. To date, authorities have been unable to locate those responsible for either of the two bombings&#8230;</p>
<p>Shortly after the attack, Ansar Allah a Palestinian Jihadist organization widely held as a front for Hezbollah claimed responsibility for the attack&#8230;</p>
<p>On 6 March 2007, former Congressman Mario Cafiero and former government official Luis D&#8217;Elia provided evidence at a press conference that Abolghasem Mesbahi, along with two other Iranians that gave alleged evidence implicating Iran in the bombing, were members of the People&#8217;s Mujahedin of Iran (MEK), which is an organization that advocates the overthrow of the Islamic Republic of Iran and was designated until 2012 as a terrorist organization by the US&#8230;</p>
<p>In August 2009, BBC News reported that Ahmad Vahidi had become Iran&#8217;s defense minister-designate under the 2009 Mahmoud Ahmadinejad administration, and is on Interpol&#8217;s wanted list over the AMIA bombing. Vahidi led a unit of Iran&#8217;s Revolutionary Guard called Quds Force at the time of the attack, and has been accused of planning the bombings. Iran dismissed this development as a &#8220;Zionist plot&#8221;. <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>So after a mass casualty bombing of the G20 Summit, the talking heads in the mainstream media will point their fingers at these two previous “Iranian/Hezbollah” attacks in Buenos Aires as precedents. And they’ll opine that <em>“Iran returned to its old ways due to the intense pressure their regime is feeling from the Trump sanctions”</em> and <em>“they wanted to strike back at Trump in a way that appeared that Trump wasn’t specifically targeted, and they wanted to avoid blame by making it look like their enemy ISIS did it.”</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Getting back to the Wikipedia entries on the two bombings, here are some things of note&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>&gt;</strong> The entries on both bombings tie them to <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Lebanon_conflict_(1985%E2%80%932000)#Post_Civil_War_conflict" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the 1985 &#8211; 2000 South Lebanon conflict</a>, in which Hezbollah waged war against an Israeli <strong>occupation of Muslim lands</strong>. And wouldn’t you know it, Israel is poised to do another invasion and <strong>occupation of Muslim lands</strong> right before the G20 Summit&#8230;</span><br />

<p><span style="color: #333333;">Such a move will enable the mainstream media’s “expert” commentators to say that <em>“the G20 bombing was another Iranian/Hezbollah reaction to perceived Israeli aggression”</em> and <em>“the Iranians wanted to strike back in a place where they have a long-established terrorist presence, and they wanted to deprive Israel of its greatest ally, Donald Trump.”</em></span></p>

<p><strong>(14 November 2018) &#8211; Well THAT was a quick adjustment on their part.</strong> All of a sudden, the Gaza invasion &#8212; a move which would have helped support the “Iran/Hezbollah attacked the G20&#8243; narrative &#8212; came to a screeching halt&#8230;<br />

<p>For the time being, Netanyahu will take on his duties, and Lieberman&#8217;s eventual replacement will likely be someone whose Chabad connection is not publicly documented.</p>
<p>One would hope these developments are the initial signs that the globalists have canceled the G20 bombing operation. Hope is no substitute for putting in the work, though, so this blog’s G20 coverage will continue. There is much to learn by finishing what was started, and the writings can be reused the next time they try this.</p>
<p><strong>(15 November 2018) &#8211;</strong> In another signal that the globalists might be delaying the big drama till next year, the newest Saudi Coalition offensive on Yemen&#8217;s Port of Hodeidah was abruptly halted yesterday. Take note of these headlines and the dates below them&#8230;<br />

<p>So this new “vast offensive” was suddenly halted just five days after it began. It’s no coincidence that this happened within a day of the Gaza offensive being suddenly halted. The globalists want to hold the “Gaza Invasion” and “Fall of Hodeidah” cards for play the next time they attempt to start the hot phase of the Middle East War &#8212; the next time they want to trigger the “Iranian Cruise Missiles out of Yemen” scenario.</p>
<p>But as the globalists put these two cards back in their hand, they’re pulling out another to be played before the G20 Summit: the “Fall of ISIS in Syria” card. Take a look at these three stories about the sudden resumption of the US/Kurd offensive against “ISIS’ final stronghold” in Hajin, Syria&#8230;<br />

<p><strong>I suspect they’re narrating this new phase of the Hajin offensive so they can narrate the capture of ISIS’ leader and a subsequent collapse of the final ISIS pocket in Syria. This could enable Trump to announce a timetable for a US withdrawal from Syria at the Summit (where he&#8217;ll be meeting Putin to supposedly coordinate planned actions of that sort).</strong></p>
<p>As a fallback play, they could keep the Hajin offensive grinding on till March of next year so Trump can announce the withdrawal then. In that case, <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/413277-john-bolton-says-putin-invited-to-visit-washington-in-early-2019" target="_blank" rel="noopener">don’t be surprised if a Trump-Putin summit is announced for March</a>. March is the next foreseeable assassination timeframe.</p>
<p><strong>(16 November 2018) &#8211;</strong> If you visited the blog last night, you probably saw this&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Wow, I just put something together. It is indeed possible that Erdogan is among those scripted to die in the G20 bombing. And it may in fact be Binali Yildirim, the man who would become Acting President of Turkey after Erdogan’s assassination, who will lead Turkey first against Iran and then against Israel (remember: Iran will be blamed for the bombing first, then the blame will shift to Israel, thus resulting in the Gog-Magog War against Israel and its culminating Battle of Armageddon). I’ll fill in the details of this in the morning.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now that it’s morning, here are the promised details:</p>
<p>In <a href="http://redefininggod.com/2018/11/globalist-outcome-and-scripting-options-for-the-2018-g20-summit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my entry on the G20 bombing scenario</a>, I wrote this about Erdogan&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>The nuke option is unlikely if Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey shows up to the Summit. It is doubtful that the globalists will remove him from the board this early (he still has much to do in playing his role), so his attendance would likely mean a nuclear attack isn’t planned. But should something happen in Turkey that prevents him from attending, the nuke option is definitely on the table.</p></blockquote>
<p>After writing this paragraph, something about it bothered me, so I continued pondering Erdogan’s scripted fate until I remembered something I heard in a prophecy propaganda video months ago. It was part of an interview of Joel Richardson, a Christian Crypto-Jew the globalists have assigned to influence the Christians into accepting the prophecy interpretations they intend to act out for the public&#8230;<br />

He further suggests <strong>there is a possibility that Erdogan will be killed during this war, and a Turkish antichrist will rise out of the ashes of the war to lead Gog-Magog against Israel</strong>.</p>
<p>Now take a moment to overlay Richardson’s prediction onto the G20 bombing scenario I’ve laid out. Turkey and Iran share a common border, and both have positioned their forces in Syria in advance of this predicted war. So what will happen if “Iran and Hezbollah” kill Erdogan by bombing the G20? Turkey will attack Iran and their Hezbollah proxies in Syria, won’t they? And this would give us the preliminary Turkey-Iran War Richardson has suggested.</p>
<p>What will then happen after it is revealed that “Israel and the MEK” are actually to blame for the G20 attack? Both Turkey and Iran <em>“will realize they were duped into destroying each other by the Israelis,”</em> so they will cease fire and join forces (along with all the other Muslim nations in the region) to furiously attack Israel in response. This would give us the First Gog-Magog War and the First Battle of Armageddon.</p>
<p>All of this could transpire over just a few months time &#8212; in time to sync Putin&#8217;s savior moment (when he reenters the stage to save Israel) to the prophecy calendar in March.</p>
<p>That being said, who will be the Turkish antichrist who arises after Erdogan is killed? Upon checking into the Turkish rules of presidential succession, I found this&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> In the event of a temporary absence of the President on account of illness, travel abroad or similar circumstances, the Vice President of Turkey serves as Acting President, and exercises the powers of the President until the Presidents comes back. <strong>If the President</strong> resigns or <strong>dies, the TBMM Speaker serves as Acting President, and exercises the powers of the President until the new election happens in 45 days</strong>. &#8211; from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Turkey#Acting_President" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia</a> <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>And upon googling “<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22tbmm%22+turkey" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TBMM Turkey</a>,” I came across this&#8230;<br />

<p>As it turns out, the Speaker of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey (and Erdogan’s successor) is this man&#8230;<br />

&#8230;from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binali_Y%C4%B1ld%C4%B1r%C4%B1m" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia</a>. Here is a little of what his Wiki says about him [with my comments in brackets]&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> As <strong>a staunch supporter of Erdogan</strong>, Yildirim has been referred to as a &#8216;low-profile&#8217; Prime Minister and is expected to <strong>spearhead a transition from a parliamentary system of government to an executive presidency, which will delegate greater powers to Erdogan and the office of the President</strong>&#8230; [This transition has occurred, so Yildirim worked to strengthen the office he will soon occupy (just like an antichrist would). And since Erdogan’s assassination will lead to an immediate state of war, it would be impractical to hold an election 45 days after. This means Yildirim will be in office indefinitely.]</p>
<p>As the Director of IDO, <strong>Yildirim established a close relationship to Recep Tayyip Erdogan</strong>, who served as Istanbul’s Mayor from 1994 to 1998. When the latter led efforts to establish a new moderate conservative democratic political party in August 2001, <strong>Yildirim joined Erdogan to become a founding member of the Justice and Development Party (AKP)</strong>. [So Yildirim is both Erdogan’s partner in crime and Erdogan’s carbon copy (politically).] <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>But it is the following passage that really cemented Yildirim’s candidacy for “the Turkish antichrist” in my mind&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> His name, Binali, means <strong>son of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ali</a></strong> in Arabic. An Alevi neighbour of his family gave him the name. His surname, Yildirim, means &#8220;<strong>lightning bolt</strong>&#8220;&#8230; <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>So Yildirim’s first name hints at his being a son of “the legitimate successor of the Prophet Muhammed, Ali.” And his family name, which means “lightning bolt,” hints at his being the antichrist&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+10%3A18&amp;version=ESV" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Luke 10:18</a> &#8211; And he said to them, “I saw <strong>Satan</strong> fall like <strong>lightning</strong> from heaven.”</p></blockquote>
<p>His name thus loosely translates to “Muhammed’s Antichrist.” And if the globalists proceed with this 2018 script, it is Yildirim who will go down in the history books as being the “Dajjal.”</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The Globalists&#8217; 2018/2019 Script for the Gog-Magog War and the Battle of Armageddon</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(17 November 2018)</strong></span></h2>
<p>To properly grasp the globalists’ underlying strategy in blowing up the G20 Summit, one must first understand the basics of the “Battle of Armageddon” they’re trying to orchestrate. Here is a quick primer&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> The Battle of Armageddon will take place in Israel, in the prophesied Valley of Megiddo. It will occur after the Great Tribulation Period, at the Second Coming of Jesus Christ, when He returns to set up His Kingdom on earth&#8230;</p>
<p>Revelation chapters 14, 16, 17 and 19 describe Armageddon as a place of great slaughter where troops will be gathered, assembled and pressed together. At Armageddon Christ will come in all of His wrath and glory with His army following Him on white horses. Jesus is pictured here as a man of war, judging in righteousness with the sword of His mouth. <strong>Jesus will deliver Israel from destruction by the Antichrist</strong>. Nations will be punished for their sins. Those who have received the Mark of the Beast will be judged. And Jesus will take authority over the earth and remove the kingdom and reign of the Antichrist. &#8211; from <a href="https://www.endtime.com/armageddon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Endtime.com</a> <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>In some Christian circles, the Battle of Armageddon is viewed as a separate thing from the Gog-Magog War&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> There are a number of considerations that make it clear that this invasion by Gog is not the same as the battle of Armageddon. (1) In the battle of Gog <strong>definite allies</strong> are mentioned, while in Armageddon <strong>all nations are engaged</strong>. (2) Gog comes <strong>from the north</strong>, while at Armageddon the armies come <strong>from the whole earth</strong>. (3) Gog comes to take spoil, while at Armageddon the nations assemble to destroy the people of God. (4) There is protest against Gog’s invasion, but <strong>at Armageddon there is no protest for all nations are joined against Jerusalem</strong>. (5) <strong>Gog</strong> is the head of the armies in his invasion, but at Armageddon <strong>the Beast</strong> is the head of the invasion. &#8211; from <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/commentaries/revelation/related-topics/gog-attacks-israel.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BibleStudyTools.com</a> <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>But the only prophecy interpretations that matter are those the globalists are using to script their End Times stage play, and in their version, Gog = the Beast (Yildirim = the antichrist) so <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBGHblD5q0U&amp;t=2m11s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Battle of Armageddon is the culminating battle of the Gog-Magog War</a>. If you look at Gog-Magog and Armageddon from that perspective (and within the context of the G20 Summit attack), it implies that&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>The Gog-Magog War on Israel will be started by the Turkish antichrist and his allies, who will then be joined by the rest of the world for the final battle.</strong></p>
<p>So after Israel’s hand in the G20 attack is uncovered, Turkey’s Yildirim will rally all the Muslim nations to invade Israel from all directions. And as this invasion gets moving, the UN Security Council will pass a resolution authorizing military action against Israel, thus leading to “all the world’s armies” joining in for the final push. The resolution will not be vetoed because all the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_members_of_the_United_Nations_Security_Council" target="_blank" rel="noopener">P5 nations</a> will have lost their leaders at the G20, leaving Israel completely isolated and without earthly aid.</p>

<p><span style="color: #333333;">Since I’ve identified “a submarine carrying a ‘North Korean’ nuke” as one of the likely modes of attack on the G20 Summit, I’m left wondering if today’s news has a connection to the Summit bombing scenario. Even though a connection seems like a stretch, the timing of this news left me asking myself a few questions&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><em>Was the San Juan actually lost in an accident, or was it disappeared to be used as a weapon against the seaside G20 Summit a year later?</em> [If so, a year would allow time for the vessel to be cosmetically modified, perhaps to resemble an Iranian or Israeli sub.]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><em>Did the possible cancellation on Tuesday of the G20 bombing cause them to scuttle the vessel to give closure to the mystery of its disappearance?</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><em>Was the wreckage found at the bottom of the ocean today actually the hull of some other submarine, possibly even that of San Juan’s abandoned (but 70% complete) sister sub, the <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TR-1700-class_submarine#Boats_in_class" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Santa Fe</a>?</em> [If so, the decoy sub’s discovery would allow the San Juan to carry out the G20 op unsuspected.]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><em>And if the San Juan did sink from an accident a year ago, was its discovery today the result of somebody scouring the waters off Argentina looking for rogue submarines that could be used against the Summit?</em></span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>ALERT (18 November 2018) &#8211; Will Chabad take down Netanyahu tomorrow?</strong><br />
<strong>(+ lessons from the failed coup)</strong></h3>
<p>It looks like the globalists have scripted the fall of Netanyahu at the hands of the Chabad-Lubavitch messianic cult. The cult is basically threatening to take down his government if he doesn’t give them back the defense ministry and let them start the End Times war to bring in their “Jewish Messiah.” So it looks like the globalists are scripting Netanyahu as a &#8220;good guy&#8221; / &#8220;voice of reason&#8221; whose political fall leads to Israel&#8217;s disastrous descent into war. And If he gets taken down before the G20, they might proceed with more takedowns there.</p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Here are the basics of the situation&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Israel’s Chabad-connected defense minister, Avigdor Lieberman, resigned his position because Netanyahu supposedly blocked his invasion of Gaza. And when he resigned, his political party pulled out of Netanyahu’s governing coalition, leaving it within one seat of failing. Now another political party in the coalition is threatening to leave if Netanyahu doesn’t name one of its members, Naftali Bennett, as the new defense minister&#8230;</span><br />

<p><span style="color: #333333;">So far, Netanyahu has refused their demands, so they are threatening to take down his government tomorrow and trigger a snap election. This could potentially lead to a more aggressive government that will start Chabad&#8217;s desired End Times war.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #333333;">Wow, there’s been another sudden reversal in Israel&#8230;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> Benjamin Netanyahu has won a reprieve from the threat of early elections in Israel after a senior member of his cabinet announced he would not resign and break up the coalition government.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #333333;">Tee hee hee&#8230;<br />
<a style="color: #333333;" href="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Newman2.gif"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1263" src="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Newman2.gif" alt="" width="200" height="183" /></a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">It is important to take a moment and realize that this attempted coup by Chabad was very much a contrived, scripted event. And both Chabad and Netanyahu were reading from the same script because they work for the same people, the Kabbalist elite (specifically, the trillionaire bankster families). So let me show you now what the goal of this foiled drama was to be&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>1) The purpose of the coup &#8212; had it been completed &#8212; was to give the public a logical political narrative that would have flowed into the invasion of the Gaza Strip.</strong> And this particular way of scripting it &#8212; with Netanyahu trying to hold back the disastrous invasion but getting overpowered by hotheads &#8212; suggests they&#8217;re trying to preserve Netanyahu&#8217;s reputation so he can be used later in the story, perhaps as Putin&#8217;s viceroy over Israel.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>2) The purpose of the Gaza invasion, which is still in play, is to outrage the Muslim world so the Turks can start organizing the combined Muslim army that will be used to invade Israel in the Gog-Magog War.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>3) The purpose of starting the formation of the Muslim army now is so it will be ready for Gog-Magog by next March.</strong> Organizing it now will allow the globalist scriptwriters to flow seamlessly out of the planned Turkey-Iran War straight into Gog-Magog. If they waited to organize the invasion force till after Turkey-Iran, there would be a drama-killing pause between the two wars.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>4) The scripted, public reason for Chabad-Lubavitch wanting to trigger the invasion of Israel is to force the Moshiach ben David (the Jewish Messiah) to come forward to prevent Israel’s total destruction.</strong> <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHBiT6eJaQQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here is a YouTube video of the Lubavitcher Rebbe exhorting Netanyahu to make the invasion happen</a>&#8230;.</span><br />

<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Even though this whole thing is a scripted stage play, the wars will be quite real.</strong> And there will be lots of real death and real destruction in Israel during Gog-Magog and its culminating Battle of Armageddon. So if you live in Israel, I say this to you&#8230;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #333333;">It’s time to pull your head out of your tuchus and face the reality of what your government, the Mossad, and Chabad are doing to you. It’s also time to spread the word to others and to command your representatives to stop. Even though you don’t have the control over them you think you have, letting them know that you’re onto their con will dissuade them from continuing. You can’t pull off a con if your mark knows exactly what you’re doing.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Your life, and the lives of your children in the IDF, depend on you stopping this thing. If you don’t do it now, you’ll not only see lots of death and destruction in the coming months, but you’ll also see the total destruction of Judaism and all Jews living in Israel seven years after that. The final Jewish pogrom, to be provided by your supposed friends the elite Kabbalists, is already scripted.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>(18 November 2018) &#8211;</strong> All the world is a stage, and this is especially true of summits and the nitwit puppets who strut about at them. Just have a look at Mike Pence hamming it up at the Pacific summits this week&#8230;<br />

<p>According to the globalist script, Pence is playing the Phase 1 “Grey Champion,” an antichrist character who will take America’s reins after Trump is assassinated or removed from office. So he gave Putin and Xi the death stare for two reasons: 1) because they are supposedly “Avatars” (incarnations of the godhead) and the “two strongest pillars of the resistance to the Satanic West’s unilateral NWO,” and 2) because “glaring is caring.”</p>
<p>You gotta admire Pence for not cracking up while he was delivering “the face.” I’ve not seen such showmanship since the days of Barack Obama and Dr. Drake Ramoray&#8230;<br />

<p><strong>(19 November 2018) &#8211;</strong> As if to underscore that the G20 bombing scenario may still be in play, the press have now narrated that <a href="http://news.trust.org/item/20181119123649-vxsmr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) will attend the G20 Summit</a> (and they announced it while the Saudis were also urging action against Iran). I haven’t yet seen clarification if MBS is traveling WITH King Salman or INSTEAD of King Salman, but if both attend, the “evil US and Saudi Deep States” would get a twofer.</p>
<p>And here are the globalists connecting Hezbollah to the Summit location in advance&#8230;<br />

&#8230;from <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/world-news/americas/argentine-citizens-with-suspected-hezbollah-links-arrested-ahead-of-g20-summit-1.6658567" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Haaretz</a></p>
<p><em>So if the Saudis calling for action against Iran get assassinated at the G20, and Hezbollah activity has previously been detected near the summit site, can you guess who will get the blame for killing MBS?</em></p>
<p>Read the sections below this and <a href="http://redefininggod.com/2018/11/globalist-outcome-and-scripting-options-for-the-2018-g20-summit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Globalist Outcome and Scripting Options for the 2018 G20 Summit</a> for more information on the assassination plan.</p>
<p><strong>(20 November 2018) &#8211;</strong> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-khashoggi-royals-exclusive/exclusive-after-khashoggi-murder-some-saudi-royals-turn-against-kings-favorite-son-idUSKCN1NO2KP" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Reuters article</a> came out yesterday that teases how the takedown of MBS is currently scripted. Here is an excerpt [with my additions in brackets]&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> Dozens of princes and cousins from powerful branches of the Al Saud family want to see a change in the line of succession but would not act while King Salman &#8211; the crown prince’s 82-year-old father &#8211; is still alive, the sources said. They recognize that the king is unlikely to turn against his favorite son, known in the West as MbS.</p>
<p>Rather, they are discussing the possibility with other family members that <strong>after the king’s death</strong>, Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz, 76, a younger full brother of King Salman and uncle of the crown prince, could take the throne, according to the sources.</p>
<p>Prince Ahmed, King Salman’s only surviving full brother, would have the support of family members, <strong>the security apparatus [the Saudi “Deep State”]</strong> and <strong>some Western powers [the US “Deep State” in particular]</strong>, one of the Saudi sources said. <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>So all that need happen now is King Salman’s death. And if MBS should die at his side in Buenos Aires, that will make things go all the more smoothly. In the words of Tony Montana and in the context of political assassinations, the G20 Summit is like a <em>&#8220;great big pus*y just waiting to get fu*ked.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">According to the future official narrative of the multilateral NWO, the reported killing of Khashoggi was arranged by the US Deep State, the Saudi Deep State, and Turkey’s Erdogan. They will say, <em>“Like Trump, MBS was a reformer who found himself surrounded by Deep State agents, even in his own protective detail. So the Saudi Deep State had some of their agents in his protective detail participate in the killing in order to frame MBS for ordering it.”</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">With that in mind, it appears that MBS will be one of the multilateral NWO’s future heroes. This is confirmed by the fact that future hero <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2018/11/19/trump-just-cant-quit-mbs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump supports him</a> and future hero <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-23/as-saudi-crisis-grows-kremlin-is-said-to-keep-its-bet-on-mbs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Putin supports him</a> too. And as of the beginning of this month, Netanyahu is also supporting him&#8230;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> Israel is concerned that the international pressure on Saudi Arabia over the killing of Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents will destabilize the Sunni kingdom and the Middle East as whole, Senior Israeli officials tell me.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Why it matters: <strong>Until today </strong>[November 1]<strong>, Israel refrained from commenting about the crisis publicly. This statement by the senior Israeli officials is very rare and shows Israel is nervous over the reaction of Western countries, including the U.S. The reason is that in the last few years, Saudi Arabia, led by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has become a staunch secret ally of the government in Jerusalem against Iran.</strong> &#8212; from <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.axios.com/israel-concerned-khashoggi-killing-saudi-arabia-mbs-9a23cb48-96cc-4251-8ebc-20f7bc37c936.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Axios</a> <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Given Netanyahu&#8217;s support of MBS and the particular scripting of the recent Chabad coup, Netanyahu is apparently being added to the pantheon of NWO heroes, and this means I’ll have to start looking for evidence that they might be substituting him for Trump as the “Moshiach ben Yosef,” while switching Trump to the “Cyrus the Great” role&#8230;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> Cyrus the Great respected the customs and religions of the lands he conquered. This became a very successful model for centralized administration and establishing a government working to the advantage and profit of its subjects. In fact, the administration of the empire through satraps and the vital principle of forming a government at Pasargadae were the works of Cyrus. What is sometimes referred to as the Edict of Restoration (actually two edicts) described in the Bible as being made by Cyrus the Great left a lasting legacy on the Jewish religion, where, because of his policies in Babylonia, <strong>he is referred to by the Jewish Bible as messiah (lit. “His anointed one”) (Isaiah 45:1), and is the only non-Jew figure in the Bible to be called so.</strong> &#8211; from <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrus_the_Great" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia</a> <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">If Netanyahu is to be in the pantheon, that means he is an assassination target too. And given the failure of the staged Chabad coup against him, don&#8217;t be surprised if they send him to the G20 to be assassinated alongside the rest. They could say he&#8217;s going there because he needs to talk to MBS.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Now let’s look at another article that came out recently&#8230;</span><br />
<span style="color: #333333;"><a style="color: #333333;" href="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/3men1120.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8143" src="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/3men1120.png" alt="" width="1151" height="405" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/3men1120.png 1151w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/3men1120-300x106.png 300w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/3men1120-768x270.png 768w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/3men1120-1024x360.png 1024w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/3men1120-624x220.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 1151px) 100vw, 1151px" /></a></span><br />

<p><span style="color: #333333;">This provides yet another scripted reason for a G20 assassination of MBS, Trump, and Putin by the Establishment: <em>&#8220;to regain control over the pricing of oil from the Anti-Establishment renegades.”</em></span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The Mossad Strike Plan for the G20 Summit</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(21 November 2018)</strong></span></h2>
<p>I’ve been looking at the propaganda and security setup for the G20 Summit, and I think I’ve put together the Mossad’s strike plan&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>It will begin with bomb and firearm attacks by leftists/anarchists and “Hezbollah” agents all over Buenos Aires (but outside of the core security zone); these may include one or more offshore boat raids as well. The sheer number of these engagements, as well as a concurrent “Iranian” cyberattack, will distract and confuse the Summit security forces so the main attack can slip through unnoticed. And that main attack will be conducted with&#8230;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>one or more “Iranian” military drones or guided missiles</strong><br />
&#8230;and/or&#8230;<br />
<strong>a submarine or swimmer delivery vehicle sailing a massive bomb or “North Korean” nuke right up to the Buenos Aires shoreline</strong></p>
<p>Why do I say this, you ask? Because I’ve been warning about the sub and drone assassination angles for months, and because of these passages from <a href="https://argentinareports.com/g20-security/2070/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an Argentina Reports article on the Summit security preparations</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> <strong>Argentina bought four patrol boats from Israel</strong> for US$80 million, reported Israel Noticias, which were received in April and July. <strong>They</strong>, along with other marine boats, <strong>will be used to patrol the Buenos Aires coastline to ensure that no unregistered vessels enter the area.</strong> <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>So these brand new Israeli patrol boats will be the main line of defense against a submarine / frogman infiltration. This is a problem because the Mossad has likely added “poison pill” software to the sonar systems on the boats.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> Additionally, <strong>Argentina has paid US$5.2 million for a high-tech cybersecurity system, even though Israel is not in the G20</strong> and other countries who are (such as Russia, the US, the UK and China) are also leaders in the cybersecurity sector.</p>
<p>The cybersecurity system employs <strong>AI and machine learning</strong> to <strong>prevent cyber terrorist attacks or malicious code that could affect the systems and networks of the Armed forces, the Joint Chiefs of Staff (EMCO) and the Ministry of Defense</strong>. <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>This means the Mossad will be staging debilitating “Iranian” (and possibly “North Korean”) cyberattacks to disrupt the systems and networks of the Summit security forces. The attacks will succeed because of the backdoors the Mossad has embedded in the cybersecurity system. And since the system employs machine learning AI, the Israelis will have plausible deniability for the system’s failure. They can say, <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/604087/the-dark-secret-at-the-heart-of-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“The AI malfunctioned for reasons we do not understand,” which is a well-known problem with such AI</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> Argentina also purchased an <strong>anti-drone radar system</strong> from Israel, which was used successfully during the Youth Olympics in October earlier this year. <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>So it will be an Israeli radar watching for drones at the Summit. This is a problem due to “poison pill” software again.</p>
<p>As for what “poison pill” software is, it is a type of hidden malware that activates at a certain time or upon a certain signal to interfere with a system’s normal operation. Once it does what it is programmed to do, it erases itself, leaving no trace. And while I’m sure the IT world has its own term for this type of software, I don’t know what it is, so I call it “poison pill.”</p>
<p>In the case of the sonars on the Israeli patrol boats, the poison pill could <strong>generate a false display</strong> of what’s underwater or simply <strong>prevent the display of objects of a certain size</strong>, like a submarine. This would allow an underwater strike to pass through undetected. And in the case of the Israeli drone radar, the poison pill could do the same for what’s in the air, or it could hold the door open for a cyberattack that will take down the radar and/or its network.</p>
<p><strong>So as you can see, the Mossad holds the keys to all the doors needed for a successful attack on the G20, and that’s why I’m expecting what I’m expecting.</strong></p>

&#8230;from <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-11-23/cia-has-smoking-gun-phone-call-mbs-giving-order-silence-khashoggi-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zero Hedge</a></p>
<p>Now have a look at this section from an article on &#8220;deep fakes&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> Fake videos can now be created using a machine learning technique called a “generative adversarial network”, or a GAN. A graduate student, Ian Goodfellow, invented GANs in 2014 as a way to algorithmically generate new types of data out of existing data sets. For instance, a GAN can look at thousands of photos of Barack Obama, and then produce a new photo that approximates those photos without being an exact copy of any one of them, as if it has come up with an entirely new portrait of the former president not yet taken. <strong>GANs might also be used to generate new audio from existing audio</strong>, or new text from existing text – it is a multi-use technology. &#8212; from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/nov/12/deep-fakes-fake-news-truth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Guardian</a> <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>In the future official narrative of the NWO, it will be said that the CIA &#8220;recording&#8221; of the MBS &#8220;smoking gun&#8221; phone call was a deep fake they produced as part of their campaign to take him down.</p>
<p>(By the way, it appears that the <strong>11</strong>/<strong>22</strong> surprise was <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/22/politics/trump-us-troops-lethal-force-closing-border/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump authorizing the military to use lethal force on the Mexican border</a>. One or more “immigrant” deaths from this will no doubt be scripted, thus leading to the new Democrat-controlled House of Representatives going nuts in January.)</p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>(23 November 2018) &#8211;</strong> Now let me show you how they’re setting up the things I wrote about in the previous portion of this update, starting with a preparatory propaganda article that helps them set up the “sequence of blame” for the G20 attack&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Back in the 19 November update, I showed you an article about two supposed Hezbollah agents who were arrested in Buenos Aires. As I continued searching for more information on the incident, I came across this&#8230;</span><br />
<span style="color: #333333;"><a style="color: #333333;" href="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mosba1123.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8149" src="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mosba1123.png" alt="" width="574" height="280" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mosba1123.png 574w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mosba1123-300x146.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 574px) 100vw, 574px" /></a></span><br />
<span style="color: #333333;">&#8230;from <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.jpost.com/International/Mossad-allegedly-provides-intelligence-to-thwart-Hezbollah-plot-in-Argentina-572284" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Jerusalem Post</a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">So in the case of the Argentine “Hezbollah agents,” the Israelis are taking credit for foiling yet another “terrorist attack,” just like they previously did with this year&#8217;s “Iranian” assassination plots in Paris and Denmark. This raises an obvious question&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong><em>Is the Mossad really so brilliant that they pick up on every little “terrorist” plot around the world, or did they know about these particular plots because they are the ones who set them up?</em></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The alt-media is full of stories about our own FBI agents posing as members of radical groups to recruit unstable, weak-minded individuals. Once they have these patsies-in-training on the hook, they train them, send them on trips to “countries with terrorist ties,” arm them, and have them prepare for a specific mission. Then, at the right time, other FBI agents swoop in on the “cell” and arrest them for plotting a terror attack. Such operations help the government maintain the mainstream narrative of the nation being “full of terrorist cells preparing to hurt us.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The same thing is happening with these “Iranian / Hezbollah” terror operations. The Mossad sets them up and knocks them down, and this helps the globalists establish multiple geopolitical narratives in support of The Plan, such as&#8230;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">“the EU nations shouldn’t bypass US sanctions because Iran is conducting terror operations on European soil,”</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">“Iran is engaged in an active worldwide campaign to assassinate its critics and enemies,” and</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">“Iran&#8217;s proxy Hezbollah is preparing for terror attacks in Buenos Aires.”</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">That being said, why did the globalists plant this story in the press? They did it so the alt-media can point out what I’m pointing out when it comes time to move the blame for the G20 strike from Iran / Hezbollah to Israel / MEK. Remember, the “sequence of blame” will start with ISIS, continue with Iran / Hezbollah, and end with Israel / MEK.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Moving on, here is an article which shows them trying to empty Buenos Aires in preparation for the G20 attack&#8230;</span><br />
<span style="color: #333333;"><a style="color: #333333;" href="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/g20evac1123.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8150" src="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/g20evac1123.png" alt="" width="739" height="535" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/g20evac1123.png 739w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/g20evac1123-300x217.png 300w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/g20evac1123-624x452.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 739px) 100vw, 739px" /></a></span><br />
<span style="color: #333333;">&#8230;from <a style="color: #333333;" href="http://en.mercopress.com/2018/11/20/g20-summit-in-buenos-aires-city-security-minister-suggests-residents-leave-the-city-over-the-long-weekend" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MercoPress</a>. Here is an excerpt&#8230;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> Argentine Security Minister Patricia Bullrich has warned Buenos Aires City residents that the staging of the G20 Leaders Summit at the turn of the month will make things very “complicated” in the City, telling residents they should use the long weekend to leave Buenos Aires for a few days.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Last week, the government ruled that Friday, November 30, would be a national holiday</strong>&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">“Our recommendation is that they use the long weekend to leave [the City and] that they <strong>leave on Thursday</strong>, because the City will be very complicated,”&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">We know that <strong>the G20 can generate spaces of extreme violence</strong> and situations of chaos and overflow,” said the minister. <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">So the ostensible reason for people evacuating the city is to avoid inconvenience and chaos due to the Summit security measures, but the article also foreshadows “spaces of extreme violence” in keeping with the first part of the Mossad strike plan. This evacuation could also be an effort to minimize civilian deaths from a nuclear strike. I don’t think the globalists want the “karma” of unnecessary, un-forewarned deaths hanging over them, at least not in the first phase of The Plan. And let’s not forget that the Summit will start on <strong>Friday</strong>, and it will be <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_G20_Buenos_Aires_summit" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>the 13th</strong> G20 Summit</a>, so it’s got a “Friday the 13th” angle attached to it. This makes Friday the most obvious day for the attack, so it’s a good idea to get out of the city on Thursday as recommended.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Speaking of a potential nuclear strike at the G20, have a look at this&#8230;</span><br />
<span style="color: #333333;"><a style="color: #333333;" href="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/5nukes1123.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8154" src="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/5nukes1123.png" alt="" width="619" height="192" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/5nukes1123.png 619w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/5nukes1123-300x93.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 619px) 100vw, 619px" /></a></span><br />
<span style="color: #333333;">&#8230;from <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://freebeacon.com/national-security/iran-secret-plans-build-five-nuclear-warheads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Washington Free Beacon</a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The article suggests that <em>“the Islamic Republic had concrete plans [back in 2003] to manufacture and build at least five nuclear weapons and that it was much further along in this scheme than previously known by the international community.”</em> It further suggests that the program to build <em>“five nuclear warheads, each with an explosive yield of 10 kilotons and able to be delivered by ballistic missile”</em> may have covertly continued in the <strong>15 YEARS</strong> since then. So it basically suggests that Iran may have nukes right now.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Isn’t it interesting that this article came out just 9 days before the G20 Summit? By putting this information out there, the globalists are expanding their scripting options. They no longer have to narrate that Iran got its nukes from North Korea; they can say that Iran developed its own, with North Korean assistance.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Now let’s have a look at how they’ve narrated Hezbollah’s possession of weapons capable of delivering the nukes&#8230;</span><br />

<span style="color: #333333;">&#8230;from the <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/columns/what-did-hezbollah-get-return-saving-assad-2030482870" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Middle East Eye</a>. Here is an excerpt&#8230;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> In terms of military equipment, Iran has used the war to massively increase Hezbollah’s stockpiles, which now include <strong>guided missiles, unmanned armed drones, short-range ballistic missiles</strong> and anti-tank missiles. In terms of numbers, it now has approximately 130,000 rockets and missiles, compared with 15,000 on the eve of the 2006 war. <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">So Hezbollah has missiles and drones that could potentially be tipped with 10-kiloton nuclear warheads <em>“provided by Qasem Soleimani, <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qasem_Soleimani" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commander of Iran’s Quds Force &#8212; a division primarily responsible for extraterritorial military and clandestine operations</a>.”</em></span></p>

<p>As you can see, the US State Department is narrating that a flood of Hezbollah jihadis have entered Bolivia, <em>and Bolivia shares a border with Argentina&#8230;</em><br />

<p>So the “blame Iran” narrative will say that the Hezbollah cells that attacked the G20 entered Argentina via the Bolivian border. And on top of this, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-photos-reveal-expanding-reach-of-iran-in-venezuela-and-other-parts-of-latin-america" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fox News has narrated the following</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> &#8230;<strong>Iran allegedly helped build a UAV facility</strong> in Maracay, <strong>Venezuela</strong>, with documents reviewed by Fox News suggesting potential dual use technology.</p>
<p>After an unexplained explosion in 2011, Humire says sections of the plant, reinforced with ceramic plates at Tehran &#8216;s insistence, were largely intact.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe the Iranian UAV program is a cover for something that is more illicit,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Perhaps something that&#8217;s sanctioned and mostly likely involves <strong>Iran&#8217;s strategic programs, its nuclear program and ballistic missiles</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Humire found other examples, <strong>in Bolivia, with photos showing a government site, alleged to have received backing from Iran</strong>. Before 2011, it housed a UN Peacekeeping unit, but since it has been replaced by <strong>an air defense command that is heavily secured, with some areas strictly off limits</strong>. <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>So the globalists have placed Iran’s nuclear, ballistic missile, and drone programs in Venezuela, and they’ve hinted at a site in Bolivia that could be used to launch ballistic missiles / drones / cruise missiles.</p>
<p>Given all this, <strong>an “Iran / Hebollah” attack on the G20 can also be used as an excuse for Israel and the US to topple the Venezuelan and Bolivian governments&#8230;</strong><br />

<p><strong>(25 November 2018) &#8211; You may have seen the news about <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/russia-fires-at-ukraine-ships-in-black-sea-11563775" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the naval encounter between Ukraine and Russia</a>.</strong> And seeing it, there is an obvious question to be asked&#8230;</p>
<p><em>Why would Ukraine risk provoking a war against Russia (a major nuclear power) that they can’t possibly win?</em></p>
<p>The reason is that they have NATO backing and they also may have a few nukes (supposedly received from North Korea in exchange for helping them develop their ballistic missiles).</p>
<p>So what are the globalists scripting here?</p>
<p>Possibly a military buildup in preparation for the battle to retake the Crimea. And possibly an attack on Putin using a smuggled Ukrainian/North Korean nuke, either in Russia or Argentina. The confrontation may also be scripted as leverage in blocking a deal between Putin and Trump during their meeting at the G20 Summit.</p>
<p>As I’ve mentioned in previous updates, the World War 3 script calls for NATO to pull Russia into a two-front war by engaging them in Syria while also hitting them in the Crimea. And according to the script, Russia will win the Crimean War, taking all of Ukraine east of the Dnieper River. You can read about the reason why in the very bottom section of this page, titled <em>Vladimir Putin, the Jewish King of Restored Khazaria</em>.</p>

<span style="color: #ff0000;">(25 November 2018)</span></h2>
<p>In the 21 November update on the Mossad strike plan for the Summit, I said&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>It will begin with bomb and firearm attacks by leftists/anarchists and “Hezbollah” agents all over Buenos Aires&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>So let me show you how the globalist propaganda corps have brought the leftists/anarchists into the mix&#8230;<br />

<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> &#8216;ANARCHIST GROUPS&#8217;</p>
<p>Buenos Aires City Security Minister Marcelo D&#8217;Alessandro said Thursday that authorities were confident the suspects &#8220;are tied to anarchist groups.&#8221; <strong>He described the bombs as &#8220;quite sophisticated.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;The explosives department has determined that not only that it was a bomb, but even though it was homemade, it was quite sophisticated, in which three detonations were made. It was a pipe[-bomb] but with greater sophistication and power, according to experts,&#8221; D&#8217;Alessandro told the TN news channel.</p>
<p>He added that the timing was not coincidental&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;<strong>Nothing is coincidence or coincidence. We are on the eve of one of the most important international event, which is the G20 summit.</strong> We have examples of what has happened in other cities and we are working to provide the necessary security, but <strong>without a doubt it has a connection with respect to that</strong>,&#8221; said D&#8217;Alessandro. <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>And here the propagandists are talking about the leftists/anarchists and the “security nightmare” presented by the Summit&#8230;<br />

&#8230;from the <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/world/americas/article/2174316/unrest-and-anarchists-g20-host-argentinas-security-nightmare" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South China Morning Post</a>. Here is an excerpt&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> Argentina has vowed to crack down on any <strong>anarchists</strong> and <strong>anti-capitalist protesters</strong> who try to disrupt next week’s Group of 20 gathering in Buenos Aires, saying it was working with foreign governments to identify and block entry to potential troublemakers&#8230;</p>
<p>Local <strong>leftist</strong> groups are planning marches against the gathering and have invited activists from around the world to join them&#8230;</p>
<p>Protesters have often taken out their fury about fast-rising prices at Christmas-time by burning stores and blocking roads.</p>
<p>Last December police used tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannon to push back rock-throwing protesters angry about the government’s pension reform plan.</p>
<p>Police also clashed with protesters outside parliament in October as lawmakers debated a new budget containing steep spending cuts aimed at erasing the country’s fiscal deficit. <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>As you can see, they’ve already had some leftist patsies blow up some bombs near the Summit site, and the post-attack mainstream narrative will say that Hezbollah trained them in how to build the “quite sophisticated” bombs they used. So <strong>during the Summit, the leftists/anarchists will block roads, set fires to cars and buildings, explode bombs and Molotov cocktails, and engage in sniper and mass shooting activity</strong>. &#8220;Hezbollah&#8221; cells will be out doing the same things, but with even more powerful weaponry. And as the Summit security forces attempt to coordinate a response to all this, their systems and communication networks will be malfunctioning from effective cyberattacks.</p>
<p>“Security nightmare” indeed.</p>
<p><strong>(26 November 2018) &#8211;</strong> Adding to the “security nightmare” aspect of the G20 Summit, they just happened to book a venue &#8212; the Costa Salguero Center &#8212; that is right by the water&#8230;<br />

<p>This makes the Summit an easy target for a water-borne attack / sail-up nuke scenario.</p>
<p>Since the Iranians are big proponents of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MSKI9RmtwU&amp;vl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">small boat swarm tactics</a>, keep an eye out for such a swarm to be part of the distraction attacks. The most effective way for the false-flaggers to employ a swarm would be to man the boats with sign-carrying unarmed protesters. As the protest boats maneuver wildly in their approach to the Summit venue, the security boats will be pulled off of their patrol routes and kept occupied. This, along with the sabotaged Israeli sonars, will allow the attackers to bring a sub within easy striking distance.</p>
<p>In a 10-kiloton nuclear strike scenario, the warhead will need to be brought within a kilometer (1,000 meters) of the Summit venue to ensure effectiveness (click on the image to enlarge it &#8212; the Summit building is the red star)&#8230;<br />

<p>If the nuke explodes at a range of <strong>one-half to one kilometer</strong>, the Summit building will be moderately damaged and many of those inside will be killed. So if the globalists wish to narrate certain leaders dying and others surviving, they’ll choose this distance.</p>
<p>And if exploded <strong>within one-half kilometer</strong> (like the map shows), the Summit building will be totaled and all the leaders will be killed (supposedly).</p>
<p>As for how they’d get the warhead to the desired distance, they could sail close with the sub, then surface and blow the warhead, or they could deploy a conventional or rocket-powered torpedo or an underwater drone from a standoff distance.</p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Speaking of the theatrics of nuking the G20 leaders, it should be noted that some (like Trump and Putin) or all of the leaders will be taken underground and whisked off to safety before the blast. And how will the globalists do that? By using the Jesuit tunnels of course&#8230;</span><br />

<span style="color: #333333;">&#8230;from the <a style="color: #333333;" href="http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20180124-the-mysterious-tunnels-beneath-buenos-aires" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BBC</a>. Here is an excerpt&#8230;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> The idea of a mysterious underground world has long been a subject of interest and imagination in Buenos Aires. <strong>“The old myths about the existence of a great swarm of tunnels under the city come back to life again and again,”</strong> said Ricardo Orsini, coordinator at the city’s Interpretive Centre for Archaeology and Palaeontology&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Even the experts don’t know the extent of the Jesuits’ network.</strong> In 1767, after failing to convert the indigenous population, the Jesuits abandoned their mission in Buenos Aires, heading inland to establish other missions near the border of Paraguay. The Spanish colonists who remained repurposed the mission buildings for their own use, establishing the Royal College of San Carlos and Argentina’s first national library in their place (both establishments are no longer here). And <strong>the Jesuits didn’t leave behind blueprints</strong>. “There is very little written documentation,” Schávelzon told me. <strong>“It was meant to be a secret.”</strong> <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">So before the attack, the leaders will either be in a bunker or at a safe distance from the point of detonation, and <a style="color: #333333;" href="http://www.oilandgasrepublic.com/2018/11/19/buenos-aires-set-to-host-g20-world-leaders-in-november-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the “live stream” of the Summit</a> will be either prerecorded or streamed from a safe location.</span></p>
<p><strong>(27 November 2018) &#8211;</strong> Of course, it will be hard for people to believe that the Iranians would do such a suicidal thing as attacking the G20. <strong>Since the G20 consists of both the “Western” G7 powers and the “Eastern” BRICS powers, killing the leaders of both sides would unite the <span style="color: #ff0000;">world</span> in <span style="color: #ff0000;">war</span> against Iran.</strong> So the globalists have to address the believability factor in their scripting, and that is why they’ll say that Iran set up ISIS to take the fall for the attack. It’s not hard for anyone to believe that ISIS would do it.</p>
<p>For the globalists to initially blame ISIS, though, they have to establish a backstory showing that ISIS has both the ability and the presence in Argentina to conduct the strike. That is why&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong> They’ve narrated ISIS’s possible possession of a nuke purchased from Pakistan or North Korea&#8230;<br />

<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> With some of the harshest sanctions on earth imposed on North Korea, it&#8217;s easy to imagine the nation attempting to raise money through illegal arms sales to the US&#8217;s enemies, which could even include non-state actors like <strong>al Qaeda or <span style="color: #ff0000;">ISIS</span></strong>.</p>

&#8230;from <a href="https://www.afcea.org/content/isis-takes-fight-cyber-battlefield" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AFCEA.org</a>. Here is an excerpt&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> <strong>The United States should not underestimate the ability of terrorist organizations such as ISIS to mount cyber attacks</strong> against the homeland, says John Mulligan, former deputy director of the National Counterterrorism Center. As the nation works to shrink territorial control of the caliphate in Iraq and Syria, the battlefront extends virtually to the cyber domain, and America must be prepared.</p>
<p>“Unless we contest the other domains in which [terror groups] operate, the problem is going to continue to manifest itself in the years ahead,” he warns. <strong>“We need to anticipate that ISIS will move aggressively to develop increased competency in the cybersphere. This is going to occur.”</strong></p>
<p>So far, ISIS has mounted low-level cyber attacks, including doxing-style assaults—stealing and releasing documents with the intent to cause harm &#8212; or gaining personally identifiable information to generate kill lists. <strong>The organization’s proven ability to evolve its capabilities consistently over time, such as its use and armament of <span style="color: #ff0000;">unmanned aerial vehicles</span></strong> or exploitation of social media, warrants attention. “We live in an era in which the free flow of information means that individuals can achieve higher degrees of education, skill and tradecraft fairly easily,” Mulligan says. “They have access to all sorts of information.”</p>
<p>Furthermore, <strong>the United States should not make the mistake of minimizing the ability of ISIS to attract skilled hackers</strong>. <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>At the same time, the propaganda corps have also narrated ISIS’s relative incompetence in the cyber arena&#8230;<br />

&#8230;from <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/isis-cyber-jihadis-are-garbage-hacking-top-researcher-says-670972" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Newsweek</a></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">So as you can see, the press have narrated ISIS as potentially having all the necessities for the core attack: the small nuclear warhead, the amphibious specialists capable of delivering it from underwater, and the hackers to launch the disabling cyberattack. But as you can also see, they’ve expressed doubt about each element (“The capacity of Isis to acquire such a [nuclear] device is <strong>certainly beyond the group at the moment</strong>”; “ISIS Special Forces <strong>Not That Special</strong>”; “ISIS Cyber Jihadis Are <strong>‘Garbage’ at Hacking</strong>”). This element of doubt will be useful to the propagandists in breaking down the “ISIS did it” narrative as they begin to switch the blame to Iran / Hezbollah.</span></p>
<p>With this buildup to the “Blame ISIS” narrative set before us, we begin to see how the narrative will take shape and then collapse&#8230;</p>
<p>During the G20 attack, images of commandos in ISIS garb with ISIS flags may be recorded. And after the attack, a claim of responsibility by ISIS will be made. This claim may be backed up by video posts appearing to show ISIS fighters training for the attack. The worldwide 24/7 news coverage will then run with it, taking the stance that <em>“it appears ISIS is responsible for the attack.”</em> But the official government statements will say, <em>“We are aware of the evidence showing that ISIS may be involved in the attack, but we are not prepared to confirm their culpability until we have investigated further.”</em></p>
<p>After the “Blame ISIS” narrative materializes, the mainstream media will begin interviewing “experts” on the various elements of the attack. And we’ll start hearing things like&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li><em>“The ability to defeat Israel’s world-class, AI-driven cybersecurity system is way beyond the previously-demonstrated capabilities of ISIS hackers. It would take the resources of a nation-state to accomplish such a feat, and the list of nations capable of such an attack is a short one: <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/iran-has-laid-groundwork-extensive-cyberattacks-u-s-say-officials-n893081" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Russia, China, Iran and North Korea</a>, to name the most likely suspects.” </em></li>
<li><em>“The capabilities of ISIS’s amphibious commandos are considered a joke in serious military circles. Furthermore, the method of attack suggests that a submarine may have been involved. Where did ISIS get a submarine? And how did they gain the expertise to operate it and move it all the way to Argentina? It would take the resources of a nation-state to accomplish such a feat &#8212; a nation like Iran for instance: they have submarines, and <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/399569-iranian-fleet-west-atlantic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they’ve been developing the capability to cross the Atlantic with them</a>.”</em></li>
<li><em>“<a style="font-size: 1rem;" href="http://almanac.afpc.org/argentina" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beyond the splashy hack of the Argentine Army’s website, we’ve seen no serious evidence of a significant Islamic State presence in Argentina</a><span style="font-size: 1rem;">, so ISIS’s claim of responsibility rings a bit hollow. What we HAVE seen in Argentina, though, is extensive evidence of the presence and activity of Shia militants supported by Iran, such as Hezbollah.”</span></em></li>
</ul>
<p>So after the “experts” begin to cast doubt on ISIS’s responsibility for the attack, the joint investigation by all the G20 intelligence agencies will break some news&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“We have uncovered evidence that the ‘Islamic State’ chatter, videos and claim of responsibility related to the G20 attack may have been planted by Iranian intelligence.”</em></p>
<p>The “expert” interviews on the media will thereafter focus on everything Iran stood to gain by covertly conducting the attack.</p>
<p>This being said, you may be asking, “What about Russian and China? Won’t they stop the West from pinning the blame on Iran?” No, they won’t. Both Putin and Xi will supposedly die in the G20 attack, and the power vacuums they leave behind will be filled by Dmitry Medvedev and Li Keqiang. Both Medvedev and Li have been framed as “friends of the West,” so they’ll go along with the “Blame Iran” narrative. And with that being the case, <strong>the whole world will mobilize against Iran, Hezbollah, and everyone who helped them (such as the Syrian, Venezuelan, and Bolivian governments)</strong>.</p>

Here is an excerpt&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> A spokesperson for the SBU Security Service of Ukraine says <strong>a statement by Russia&#8217;s FSB Federal Security Service on links between the Ukrainian intelligence services and Islamic State (ISIS)</strong> is a complete fabrication&#8230;</p>
<p>The FSB earlier reported it had allegedly detained an ISIS member who masterminded the <strong>assassination</strong> of a leader of the so-called &#8220;Donetsk People&#8217;s Republic&#8221; (&#8220;DPR&#8221;), which is controlled by Russia.</p>
<p>The man allegedly confessed that <strong>the &#8220;Ukrainian special services are actively assisting ISIS fighters, providing money, weapons and explosives for terrorist attacks</strong> in Russia.&#8221; <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Hmm&#8230; while we&#8217;re on the subject of Ukraine providing ISIS with explosives for terrorist attacks, have a look at something I wrote in a <a href="http://redefininggod.com/2018/07/assassination_watch_helsinki/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous overwatch entry</a>&#8230;</p>

&#8230;from <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/did-ukraine-provide-rocket-engines-north-korea-its-nuclear-missile-program-658147" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Newsweek</a></p>
<p>Another way the globalists can script the Trump-Putin assassination is to blame the Ukranians. After the end of the Cold War, <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/blake-fleetwood/too-bad-ukraine-didnt-kee_b_5235374.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ukraine surrendered its nuclear weapons in exchange for security guarantees from Russia and the US</a>. But in early <strong>2014</strong>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_military_intervention_in_Ukraine_(2014%E2%80%93present)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vladimir Putin took the Crimea from them</a>. <strong>So in the “Blame Ukraine” scenario, the controlled alt-media will narrate that Ukraine provided ICBM rocket engines to North Korea in exchange for a few nukes to use as “a safeguard against future Russian aggression.”</strong></p>
<p>Here is an excerpt from the Wikipedia entry on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hwasong-14#Engine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">North Korea’s Hwasong-14 ICBM</a>&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> Michael Elleman of IISS and the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists both claim that available evidence clearly indicates that the engine is based on the Soviet RD-250 (R-36 (missile)) family of engines, and has been modified to operate as the boosting force for the Hwasong-12 and -14. According to his theory <strong>an unknown number of these engines were probably acquired though illicit channels operating in Russia and/or Ukraine</strong>. North Korea’s need for an alternative to the failing Musudan and <strong>the recent appearance of the RD-250 engine along with other evidence, suggests the transfers occurred in 2015-2017</strong>. <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p>
<p>So the transfers occurred after Russia took the Crimea in 2014, which fits the script perfectly.</p>
<p>This “Blame Ukraine” scenario can also be used in conjunction with the “Blame Medvedev and the Atlantic Integrationists” scenario. Since both Medvedev and the Ukrainian government are supposedly friends/puppets/agents of the Western powers, it can be said that Ukraine provided the “North Korean” nuke, Erdogan provided the ISIS suicide bombers, and Medvedev &amp; Bortnikov provided safe passage to the target zone.</p>
<p>Of course, this event would be used to start the Ukraine-Russia war. And as I’ve said in past entries, that war will result in Russia taking all Ukrainian territory east of the Dnieper River. That part of Ukraine was once part of ancient Khazaria, and the globalists want to reconstitute Khazaria under Putin (who will “miraculously” return later in the prophecy fulfillment show).</p></blockquote>
<p>Fast forwarding to today, it&#8217;s important to remember that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/27/russia-to-charge-ukrainian-sailors-as-kerch-crisis-deepens" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ukraine and Russia are currently on the precipice of war due to the naval incident 2 days ago</a>.</p>
<p>With these things in mind, let’s take a look at the setup that&#8217;s taking shape&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>&gt; North Korea may have passed one or more nukes to Ukraine.</strong><br />
<strong>&gt; According to the Russians, Ukrainian intelligence provides ISIS with money, weapons, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">explosives</span>.</strong><br />
<strong>&gt; Vladimir Putin may be killed in a nuclear attack in a few days that will first be blamed on ISIS.</strong><br />
<strong>&gt; Russia and Ukraine are already on the brink of war.</strong></p>
<p>So what scenario are they setting up? <strong>One in which the Russians blame the Ukrainians for providing ISIS with the North Korean nuke that killed Putin</strong>. Since Russia and Ukraine are already on the precipice, this would start an almost immediate war between the two nations, so that part of World War 3 would already be raging before the blame shifts from ISIS to Iran.</p>
<p>Additionally, since the original source of the nuke will be identified as North Korea, the Indians will rage against Pakistan for <a href="https://qz.com/india/1080927/did-pakistan-help-north-korea-develop-nuclear-weapons-india-us-japan-want-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">helping the North Koreans build the nuke</a> that killed Modi, and Pence will rage against North Korea for releasing the nuke that killed Trump. And as soon as the intermediary blame shifts from Ukraine / ISIS to Iran / Hezbollah, the Turks will rage at Iran for providing the nuke that killed Erdogan.</p>
<p>So by pulling the trigger on the G20 nuke attack, the globalists would be pulling the pins on a number of grenades&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>a war between Russia and Ukraine</li>
<li>a war between India and Pakistan</li>
<li>a war between Turkey and Iran, and</li>
<li>a war between the US and North Korea + Iran</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>And once it finally becomes clear that Israel and the MEK were actually responsible for the G20 attack and for starting all those wars (including other wars that will stem from them), the entire world will be insanely furious at the Israelis (and all Jews in general). This will result in the &#8220;Gog-Magog&#8221; invasion of Israel and the crushing postwar global “anti-Semitism” that will drive the world’s Jews to Israel (the “ingathering of the exiles”) for refuge at the feet of the Moshiach (the “resurrected” Putin)&#8230;</strong><br />

<p>The fact that the globalists staged the naval incident this week tells us that as of two days ago, they were still keeping their options open on the G20 hit. Let’s hope they punt; otherwise, we could be looking at a martial law Christmas courtesy of President Mike Pence.</p>

			<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(The October 31 addition is below in red)</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>(30 October 2018) &#8211;</strong> If you’ve spent any time on (faux) Truther and (controlled) alt-media sites, you’ve undoubtedly seen lots of breathless warnings based on <em>The Protocols</em>. And the obvious questions you’ve asked yourself as you’ve encountered them are&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Who really wrote these “Protocols”?</strong></em><br />
&#8230;and&#8230;<br />
<em><strong>Are they for real?</strong></em></p>
<p>Over the course of this entry, we’ll answer those questions in a conclusive way. We’ll do so by looking at the clues we can glean from the cover, title page, preface, introduction, and main body of the copy I purchased from Amazon, a company run by a (secretly) “Jewish”/Kabbalist neo-oligarch. The fact that Jeff Bezos is selling copies of a reputed Anti-Semitic hoax book is an interesting clue in and of itself, but I’ll get to that later.</p>
<p>What will follow in the coming hours and days are postings of the clues I find as I systematically study the book Jeff sold me. Once I’ve gone through the whole thing, we’ll look at all the clues and draw some rather obvious conclusions based on what ideas are being sold to the reader. Check back each day; this will be an interesting and enlightening journey.</p>
<p>Let’s start by looking at the front cover of the book&#8230;<br />
<a href="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/coverA1030.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8010" src="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/coverA1030-804x1024.jpg" alt="" width="625" height="796" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/coverA1030-804x1024.jpg 804w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/coverA1030-236x300.jpg 236w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/coverA1030-768x978.jpg 768w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/coverA1030-624x794.jpg 624w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/coverA1030.jpg 1143w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" /></a></p>
<p>Aside from the missing “R” in EXPLANATORY, which may have been done to make it appear that the book was produced by “amateur patriots,” not slick globalist disinfo agents, the first two clues slap us right in the face.</p>
<p><strong>Clue 1</strong>, from the text blocked in red, is that the producers of the book want the reader to believe that <strong>“the communists don’t want you to have this information.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>Clue 2</strong>, from the text at the bottom, is that <strong>the producers of the book are targeting “patriotic Americans”</strong> with their information and interpretations. So it is meant to (dis) inform those who are rebelling against the current globalist establishment.</p>
<p>There may also be a clue in the specific Star of David symbol shown on the cover. I’ll look into it.</p>
<p>Now let’s flip the book over and look at the back cover&#8230;<br />
<a href="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/coverB1030.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8012" src="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/coverB1030-785x1024.jpg" alt="" width="625" height="815" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/coverB1030-785x1024.jpg 785w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/coverB1030-230x300.jpg 230w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/coverB1030-768x1002.jpg 768w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/coverB1030-624x814.jpg 624w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/coverB1030.jpg 1110w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" /></a></p>
<p>From the all-caps eyesore of a blurb it offers, we get the next four clues. In the first three, the producers of the book want the reader to believe that&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>the “Elders” have a great dislike of mankind and a hatred of the common man (Clue 3)</strong></li>
<li><strong>the “Elders” have a “rancorous enmity for God and Christ” (Clue 4)</strong></li>
<li><strong>the “Elders” are not really Jews, but they pretend to be (Clue 5)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>From these three clues, it almost sounds like the “Elders” are Satanists, doesn’t it? After all, Satan supposedly hates the human race and has a rancorous enmity for God and Christ, right?</p>
<p>The last clue on the back cover, <strong>Clue 6</strong>, is that the producers of the book suggest that <strong>the Jewish race is being used to achieve “a far more sinister aim than merely the establishment of a One World Government under Jewry.”</strong></p>
<p><em>So what could be “far more sinister” than a One World Jewish Government?</em></p>
<p>To find the answer to this, I decided to look at the final page of the book, page 101. There I found a section titled “King of the Jews,” who is described as the master of humanity. And if you pair that with a word mentioned on the title page of the book, you get Clue 7&#8230;<br />
<a href="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/titlepage1030.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8013" src="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/titlepage1030.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="597" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/titlepage1030.jpg 560w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/titlepage1030-281x300.jpg 281w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></a></p>
<p>So <strong>Clue 7</strong> is that the producers of the book suggest that <strong>the ultimate aim of the “Elders” is to install an Antichrist “King of the Jews” as the master of humanity</strong>.</p>
<p>With these first 7 clues set before them, longtime readers of this blog should already realize exactly why this book was written and how it fits into the globalist plan. In case you aren’t a longtime reader, though, I’ll spell it out in the next addition.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(31 October 2018) &#8211;</strong> Since late-2015, this blog has been dedicated to uncovering, documenting and exposing the globalist scheme to artificially fulfill religious prophecies. And over the course of studying their Plan, I’ve learned that it has two phases:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>In Phase 1</strong>, they have been presenting a decoy Satanic front in the West so they can have Vladimir Putin defeat it and pose as the Jewish and Christian Messiah. As for who will play the decoy Antichrist whom Putin will vanquish, it will most likely be Mike Pence or a &#8220;fallen&#8221; Donald Trump.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>In Phase 2</strong>, they will expose Vladimir Putin as the “real Antichrist” who has &#8220;usurped Jesus’ throne in Jerusalem,&#8221; and they’ll bring in their Kabbalist god-king to defeat Putin and pose as the “real Jesus” who has come to establish his Millennial Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">That being said, how does the Protocols book support their scripting?</span></em></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>By presenting the Protocols as a Satanic blueprint for installing an Antichrist King of the Jews, the book will be used to support claims that Putin is the Antichrist</strong> after he is proclaimed the Jewish Messiah (the &#8220;Moschiach ben David&#8221;). So this book supports the Phase 2 programming that will lead people to accept the “Kabbalah Christ” as the “real second coming of Jesus Christ.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Before I began this entry, I did an initial scan of the Protocols to get a first impression of their true nature. And based on that, I was left thinking that they may actually be “genuine,” but were written by Kabbalists, not Satanists. So as I read through them, I’ll be asking myself the following questions:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Do I see any references to Satan or Satanism?</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Does this sound like something a Satanist would write, or does it sound Kabbalist?</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Were these Protocols written to explain to other members of the &#8220;cabal&#8221; the real Plan for installing a world god-king, or were they written as a disinformation piece to be leaked to the public in support of Phase 2 of the Plan?</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>If the Protocols reflect the real Plan and are Kabbalist, is the Satanic angle suggested by the producers of the book an attempt to take a damaging exposure and spin it into an asset in fulfilling a new two-phase version of the Plan?</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">As I go forward in studying this book, then, I must take care to distinguish between what the Protocols actually say and what the book that surrounds, frames, and interprets the Protocols says about them. <strong>What the Protocols say</strong> and <strong>what the book says about them</strong> must be treated as <strong>two separate things</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Before we start reading the actual Protocols, though, we have a few more clues to glean from the preface and introduction presented by the book. We’ll examine those in the next addition.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And to the Hidden Hand, I say this: EVERYTHING that is based on lies will fall to dust; only those things revealed in full truth and in the light of day have a chance of standing. And so it is.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>ALERT (28 November 2018) &#8211; The (planted) smoking gun that will ignite the Russia-Ukraine War</strong></span></h1>
<p>During this morning’s research, I ran across a very important link in the chain of custody of the “North Korean” nuke that will supposedly be used to blow up the G20 Summit&#8230;<br />
<a href="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ukrISIS.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8204" src="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ukrISIS.png" alt="" width="629" height="172" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ukrISIS.png 629w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ukrISIS-300x82.png 300w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ukrISIS-624x171.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></a><br />
&#8230;from <a href="https://www.unian.info/politics/10256679-sbu-on-russian-fsb-s-statement-on-ukrainian-intel-s-ties-with-isis-fabrication.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UNIAN</a>, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_Independent_Information_Agency" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ukrainian news agency</a>. Here is an excerpt&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> A spokesperson for the SBU Security Service of Ukraine says <strong>a statement by Russia&#8217;s FSB Federal Security Service on links between the Ukrainian intelligence services and Islamic State (ISIS)</strong> is a complete fabrication&#8230;</p>
<p>The FSB earlier reported it had allegedly detained an ISIS member who masterminded the <strong>assassination</strong> of a leader of the so-called &#8220;Donetsk People&#8217;s Republic&#8221; (&#8220;DPR&#8221;), which is controlled by Russia.</p>
<p>The man allegedly confessed that <strong>the &#8220;Ukrainian special services are actively assisting ISIS fighters, providing money, weapons and explosives for terrorist attacks</strong> in Russia.&#8221; <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Hmm&#8230; while we&#8217;re on the subject of Ukraine providing ISIS with explosives for terrorist attacks, have a look at something I wrote in a <a href="http://redefininggod.com/2018/07/assassination_watch_helsinki/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous overwatch entry</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>[Section 2 &#8211; 29 June 2018] &#8211; The &#8220;Blame Ukraine&#8221; assassination scenario</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ukrblame629.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7350" src="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ukrblame629.png" alt="" width="782" height="241" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ukrblame629.png 782w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ukrblame629-300x92.png 300w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ukrblame629-768x237.png 768w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ukrblame629-624x192.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 782px) 100vw, 782px" /></a><br />
&#8230;from <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/did-ukraine-provide-rocket-engines-north-korea-its-nuclear-missile-program-658147" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Newsweek</a></p>
<p>Another way the globalists can script the Trump-Putin assassination is to blame the Ukranians. After the end of the Cold War, <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/blake-fleetwood/too-bad-ukraine-didnt-kee_b_5235374.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ukraine surrendered its nuclear weapons in exchange for security guarantees from Russia and the US</a>. But in early <strong>2014</strong>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_military_intervention_in_Ukraine_(2014%E2%80%93present)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vladimir Putin took the Crimea from them</a>. <strong>So in the “Blame Ukraine” scenario, the controlled alt-media will narrate that Ukraine provided ICBM rocket engines to North Korea in exchange for a few nukes to use as “a safeguard against future Russian aggression.”</strong></p>
<p>Here is an excerpt from the Wikipedia entry on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hwasong-14#Engine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">North Korea’s Hwasong-14 ICBM</a>&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> Michael Elleman of IISS and the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists both claim that available evidence clearly indicates that the engine is based on the Soviet RD-250 (R-36 (missile)) family of engines, and has been modified to operate as the boosting force for the Hwasong-12 and -14. According to his theory <strong>an unknown number of these engines were probably acquired though illicit channels operating in Russia and/or Ukraine</strong>. North Korea’s need for an alternative to the failing Musudan and <strong>the recent appearance of the RD-250 engine along with other evidence, suggests the transfers occurred in 2015-2017</strong>. <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p>
<p>So the transfers occurred after Russia took the Crimea in 2014, which fits the script perfectly.</p>
<p>This “Blame Ukraine” scenario can also be used in conjunction with the “Blame Medvedev and the Atlantic Integrationists” scenario. Since both Medvedev and the Ukrainian government are supposedly friends/puppets/agents of the Western powers, it can be said that Ukraine provided the “North Korean” nuke, Erdogan provided the ISIS suicide bombers, and Medvedev &amp; Bortnikov provided safe passage to the target zone.</p>
<p>Of course, this event would be used to start the Ukraine-Russia war. And as I’ve said in past entries, that war will result in Russia taking all Ukrainian territory east of the Dnieper River. That part of Ukraine was once part of ancient Khazaria, and the globalists want to reconstitute Khazaria under Putin (who will “miraculously” return later in the prophecy fulfillment show).</p></blockquote>
<p>Fast forwarding to today, it&#8217;s important to remember that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/27/russia-to-charge-ukrainian-sailors-as-kerch-crisis-deepens" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ukraine and Russia are currently on the precipice of war due to the naval incident 2 days ago</a>.</p>
<p>With these things in mind, let’s take a look at the setup that&#8217;s taking shape&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>&gt; North Korea may have passed one or more nukes to Ukraine.</strong><br />
<strong>&gt; According to the Russians, Ukrainian intelligence provides ISIS with money, weapons, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">explosives</span>.</strong><br />
<strong>&gt; Vladimir Putin may be killed in a nuclear attack in a few days that will first be blamed on ISIS.</strong><br />
<strong>&gt; Russia and Ukraine are already on the brink of war.</strong></p>
<p>So what scenario are they setting up? <strong>One in which the Russians blame the Ukrainians for providing ISIS with the North Korean nuke that killed Putin</strong>. Since Russia and Ukraine are already on the precipice, this would start an almost immediate war between the two nations, so that part of World War 3 would already be raging before the blame shifts from ISIS to Iran.</p>
<p>Additionally, since the original source of the nuke will be identified as North Korea, the Indians will rage against Pakistan for <a href="https://qz.com/india/1080927/did-pakistan-help-north-korea-develop-nuclear-weapons-india-us-japan-want-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">helping the North Koreans build the nuke</a> that killed Modi, and Pence will rage against North Korea for releasing the nuke that killed Trump. And as soon as the intermediary blame shifts from Ukraine / ISIS to Iran / Hezbollah, the Turks will rage at Iran for providing the nuke that killed Erdogan.</p>
<p>So by pulling the trigger on the G20 nuke attack, the globalists would be pulling the pins on a number of grenades&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>a war between Russia and Ukraine</li>
<li>a war between India and Pakistan</li>
<li>a war between Turkey and Iran, and</li>
<li>a war between the US and North Korea + Iran</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>And once it finally becomes clear that Israel and the MEK were actually responsible for the G20 attack and for starting all those wars (including other wars that will stem from them), the entire world will be insanely furious at the Israelis (and all Jews in general). This will result in the &#8220;Gog-Magog&#8221; invasion of Israel and the crushing postwar global “anti-Semitism” that will drive the world’s Jews to Israel (the “ingathering of the exiles”) for refuge at the feet of the Moshiach (the “resurrected” Putin)&#8230;</strong><br />

<p>The fact that the globalists staged the naval incident this week tells us that as of two days ago, they were still keeping their options open on the G20 hit. Let’s hope they punt; otherwise, we could be looking at a martial law Christmas courtesy of President Mike Pence.</p>
<p><strong>(27 November 2018 &#8211; with an enhanced paragraph <span style="color: #0000ff;">in blue</span>) &#8211;</strong> Of course, it will be hard for people to believe that the Iranians would do such a suicidal thing as attacking the G20. <strong>Since the G20 consists of both the “Western” G7 powers and the “Eastern” BRICS powers, killing the leaders of both sides would unite the <span style="color: #ff0000;">world</span> in <span style="color: #ff0000;">war</span> against Iran.</strong> So the globalists have to address the believability factor in their scripting, and that is why they’ll say that Iran set up ISIS to take the fall for the attack. It’s not hard for anyone to believe that ISIS would do it.</p>
<p>For the globalists to initially blame ISIS, though, they have to establish a backstory showing that ISIS has both the ability and the presence in Argentina to conduct the strike. That is why&#8230;</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> With some of the harshest sanctions on earth imposed on North Korea, it&#8217;s easy to imagine the nation attempting to raise money through illegal arms sales to the US&#8217;s enemies, which could even include non-state actors like <strong>al Qaeda or <span style="color: #ff0000;">ISIS</span></strong>.</p>
<p>While procuring the materials and manufacturing a nuclear weapon would represent an incredible technical and logistical hardships for a non-state actor, <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">a single compact warhead</span> could be in the range of capabilities for a non-state actor like <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hezbollah</span></strong>, said Lamrani. <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>

&#8230;from <a href="https://www.afcea.org/content/isis-takes-fight-cyber-battlefield" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AFCEA.org</a>. Here is an excerpt&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> <strong>The United States should not underestimate the ability of terrorist organizations such as ISIS to mount cyber attacks</strong> against the homeland, says John Mulligan, former deputy director of the National Counterterrorism Center. As the nation works to shrink territorial control of the caliphate in Iraq and Syria, the battlefront extends virtually to the cyber domain, and America must be prepared.</p>
<p>“Unless we contest the other domains in which [terror groups] operate, the problem is going to continue to manifest itself in the years ahead,” he warns. <strong>“We need to anticipate that ISIS will move aggressively to develop increased competency in the cybersphere. This is going to occur.”</strong></p>
<p>So far, ISIS has mounted low-level cyber attacks, including doxing-style assaults—stealing and releasing documents with the intent to cause harm &#8212; or gaining personally identifiable information to generate kill lists. <strong>The organization’s proven ability to evolve its capabilities consistently over time, such as its use and armament of <span style="color: #ff0000;">unmanned aerial vehicles</span></strong> or exploitation of social media, warrants attention. “We live in an era in which the free flow of information means that individuals can achieve higher degrees of education, skill and tradecraft fairly easily,” Mulligan says. “They have access to all sorts of information.”</p>
<p>Furthermore, <strong>the United States should not make the mistake of minimizing the ability of ISIS to attract skilled hackers</strong>. <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>At the same time, the propaganda corps have also narrated ISIS’s relative incompetence in the cyber arena&#8230;<br />

&#8230;from <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/isis-cyber-jihadis-are-garbage-hacking-top-researcher-says-670972" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Newsweek</a></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">So as you can see, the press have narrated ISIS as potentially having all the necessities for the core attack: the small nuclear warhead, the amphibious specialists capable of delivering it from underwater, and the hackers to launch the disabling cyberattack. But as you can also see, they’ve expressed doubt about each element (“The capacity of Isis to acquire such a [nuclear] device is <strong>certainly beyond the group at the moment</strong>”; “ISIS Special Forces <strong>Not That Special</strong>”; “ISIS Cyber Jihadis Are <strong>‘Garbage’ at Hacking</strong>”). This element of doubt will be useful to the propagandists in breaking down the “ISIS did it” narrative as they begin to switch the blame to Iran / Hezbollah.</span></p>
<p>With this buildup to the “Blame ISIS” narrative set before us, we begin to see how the narrative will take shape and then collapse&#8230;</p>
<p>During the G20 attack, images of commandos in ISIS garb with ISIS flags may be recorded. And after the attack, a claim of responsibility by ISIS will be made. This claim may be backed up by video posts appearing to show ISIS fighters training for the attack. The worldwide 24/7 news coverage will then run with it, taking the stance that <em>“it appears ISIS is responsible for the attack.”</em> But the official government statements will say, <em>“We are aware of the evidence showing that ISIS may be involved in the attack, but we are not prepared to confirm their culpability until we have investigated further.”</em></p>
<p>After the “Blame ISIS” narrative materializes, the mainstream media will begin interviewing “experts” on the various elements of the attack. And we’ll start hearing things like&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li><em>“The ability to defeat Israel’s world-class, AI-driven cybersecurity system is way beyond the previously-demonstrated capabilities of ISIS hackers. It would take the resources of a nation-state to accomplish such a feat, and the list of nations capable of such an attack is a short one: <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/iran-has-laid-groundwork-extensive-cyberattacks-u-s-say-officials-n893081" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Russia, China, Iran and North Korea</a>, to name the most likely suspects.” </em></li>
<li><em>“The capabilities of ISIS’s amphibious commandos are considered a joke in serious military circles. Furthermore, the method of attack suggests that a submarine may have been involved. Where did ISIS get a submarine? And how did they gain the expertise to operate it and move it all the way to Argentina? It would take the resources of a nation-state to accomplish such a feat &#8212; a nation like Iran for instance: they have submarines, and <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/399569-iranian-fleet-west-atlantic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they’ve been developing the capability to cross the Atlantic with them</a>.”</em></li>
<li><em>“<a style="font-size: 1rem;" href="http://almanac.afpc.org/argentina" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beyond the splashy hack of the Argentine Army’s website, we’ve seen no serious evidence of a significant Islamic State presence in Argentina</a><span style="font-size: 1rem;">, so ISIS’s claim of responsibility rings a bit hollow. What we HAVE seen in Argentina, though, is extensive evidence of the presence and activity of Shia militants supported by Iran, such as Hezbollah.”</span></em></li>
</ul>
<p>So after the “experts” begin to cast doubt on ISIS’s responsibility for the attack, the joint investigation by all the G20 intelligence agencies will break some news&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“We have uncovered evidence that the ‘Islamic State’ chatter, videos and claim of responsibility related to the G20 attack may have been planted by Iranian intelligence.”</em></p>
<p>The “expert” interviews on the media will thereafter focus on everything Iran stood to gain by covertly conducting the attack.</p>
<p>This being said, you may be asking, “What about Russian and China? Won’t they stop the West from pinning the blame on Iran?” No, they won’t. Both Putin and Xi will supposedly die in the G20 attack, and the power vacuums they leave behind will be filled by Dmitry Medvedev and Li Keqiang. Both Medvedev and Li have been framed as “friends of the West,” so they’ll go along with the “Blame Iran” narrative.

<p><strong>(26 November 2018 &#8211; EXPANDED <span style="color: #ff0000;">IN RED</span>) &#8211;</strong> Adding to the “security nightmare” aspect of the G20 Summit, they just happened to book a venue &#8212; the Costa Salguero Center &#8212; that is right by the water&#8230;<br />

<p>This makes the Summit an easy target for a water-borne attack / sail-up nuke scenario.</p>
<p>Since the Iranians are big proponents of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MSKI9RmtwU&amp;vl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">small boat swarm tactics</a>, keep an eye out for such a swarm to be part of the distraction attacks. The most effective way for the false-flaggers to employ a swarm would be to man the boats with sign-carrying unarmed protesters. As the protest boats maneuver wildly in their approach to the Summit venue, the security boats will be pulled off of their patrol routes and kept occupied. This, along with the sabotaged Israeli sonars, will allow the attackers to bring a sub within easy striking distance.</p>
<p>In a 10-kiloton nuclear strike scenario, the warhead will need to be brought within a kilometer (1,000 meters) of the Summit venue to ensure effectiveness (click on the image to enlarge it &#8212; the Summit building is the red star)&#8230;<br />

<p>If the nuke explodes at a range of <strong>one-half to one kilometer</strong>, the Summit building will be moderately damaged and many of those inside will be killed. So if the globalists wish to narrate certain leaders dying and others surviving, they’ll choose this distance.</p>
<p>And if exploded <strong>within one-half kilometer</strong> (like the map shows), the Summit building will be totaled and all the leaders will be killed (supposedly).</p>
<p>As for how they’d get the warhead to the desired distance, they could sail close with the sub, then surface and blow the warhead, or they could deploy a conventional or rocket-powered torpedo or an underwater drone from a standoff distance.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Speaking of the theatrics of nuking the G20 leaders, it should be noted that some (like Trump and Putin) or all of the leaders will be taken underground and whisked off to safety before the blast. And how will the globalists do that? By using the Jesuit tunnels of course&#8230;</span><br />

<span style="color: #ff0000;">&#8230;from the <a style="color: #ff0000;" href="http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20180124-the-mysterious-tunnels-beneath-buenos-aires" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BBC</a>. Here is an excerpt&#8230;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> The idea of a mysterious underground world has long been a subject of interest and imagination in Buenos Aires. <strong>“The old myths about the existence of a great swarm of tunnels under the city come back to life again and again,”</strong> said Ricardo Orsini, coordinator at the city’s Interpretive Centre for Archaeology and Palaeontology&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Even the experts don’t know the extent of the Jesuits’ network.</strong> In 1767, after failing to convert the indigenous population, the Jesuits abandoned their mission in Buenos Aires, heading inland to establish other missions near the border of Paraguay. The Spanish colonists who remained repurposed the mission buildings for their own use, establishing the Royal College of San Carlos and Argentina’s first national library in their place (both establishments are no longer here). And <strong>the Jesuits didn’t leave behind blueprints</strong>. “There is very little written documentation,” Schávelzon told me. <strong>“It was meant to be a secret.”</strong> <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">So before the attack, the leaders will either be in a bunker or at a safe distance from the point of detonation, and <a style="color: #ff0000;" href="http://www.oilandgasrepublic.com/2018/11/19/buenos-aires-set-to-host-g20-world-leaders-in-november-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the “live stream” of the Summit</a> will be either prerecorded or streamed from a safe location.</span></p>
<p><strong>(25 November 2018) &#8211; You may have seen the news about <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/russia-fires-at-ukraine-ships-in-black-sea-11563775" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the naval encounter between Ukraine and Russia</a>.</strong> And seeing it, there is an obvious question to be asked&#8230;</p>
<p><em>Why would Ukraine risk provoking a war against Russia (a major nuclear power) that they can’t possibly win?</em></p>
<p>The reason is that they have NATO backing and they also may have a few nukes (supposedly received from North Korea in exchange for helping them develop their ballistic missiles).</p>
<p>So what are the globalists scripting here?</p>
<p>Possibly a military buildup in preparation for the battle to retake the Crimea. And possibly an attack on Putin using a smuggled Ukrainian/North Korean nuke, either in Russia or Argentina. The confrontation may also be scripted as leverage in blocking a deal between Putin and Trump during their meeting at the G20 Summit.</p>
<p>As I’ve mentioned in previous updates, the World War 3 script calls for NATO to pull Russia into a two-front war by engaging them in Syria while also hitting them in the Crimea. And according to the script, Russia will win the Crimean War, taking all of Ukraine east of the Dnieper River. You can read about the reason why in the very bottom section of this page, titled <em>Vladimir Putin, the Jewish King of Restored Khazaria</em>.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Role of the Leftists/Anarchists in the G20 Summit Attack</strong></h2>
<p><strong>(25 November 2018) &#8211;</strong> In the 21 November update on the Mossad strike plan for the Summit, I said&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>It will begin with bomb and firearm attacks by leftists/anarchists and “Hezbollah” agents all over Buenos Aires&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>So let me show you how the globalist propaganda corps have brought the leftists/anarchists into the mix&#8230;<br />

<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> &#8216;ANARCHIST GROUPS&#8217;</p>
<p>Buenos Aires City Security Minister Marcelo D&#8217;Alessandro said Thursday that authorities were confident the suspects &#8220;are tied to anarchist groups.&#8221; <strong>He described the bombs as &#8220;quite sophisticated.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;The explosives department has determined that not only that it was a bomb, but even though it was homemade, it was quite sophisticated, in which three detonations were made. It was a pipe[-bomb] but with greater sophistication and power, according to experts,&#8221; D&#8217;Alessandro told the TN news channel.</p>
<p>He added that the timing was not coincidental&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;<strong>Nothing is coincidence or coincidence. We are on the eve of one of the most important international event, which is the G20 summit.</strong> We have examples of what has happened in other cities and we are working to provide the necessary security, but <strong>without a doubt it has a connection with respect to that</strong>,&#8221; said D&#8217;Alessandro. <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>And here the propagandists are talking about the leftists/anarchists and the “security nightmare” presented by the Summit&#8230;<br />

&#8230;from the <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/world/americas/article/2174316/unrest-and-anarchists-g20-host-argentinas-security-nightmare" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South China Morning Post</a>. Here is an excerpt&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> Argentina has vowed to crack down on any <strong>anarchists</strong> and <strong>anti-capitalist protesters</strong> who try to disrupt next week’s Group of 20 gathering in Buenos Aires, saying it was working with foreign governments to identify and block entry to potential troublemakers&#8230;</p>
<p>Local <strong>leftist</strong> groups are planning marches against the gathering and have invited activists from around the world to join them&#8230;</p>
<p>Protesters have often taken out their fury about fast-rising prices at Christmas-time by burning stores and blocking roads.</p>
<p>Last December police used tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannon to push back rock-throwing protesters angry about the government’s pension reform plan.</p>
<p>Police also clashed with protesters outside parliament in October as lawmakers debated a new budget containing steep spending cuts aimed at erasing the country’s fiscal deficit. <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>As you can see, they’ve already had some leftist patsies blow up some bombs near the Summit site, and the post-attack mainstream narrative will say that Hezbollah trained them in how to build the “quite sophisticated” bombs they used. So <strong>during the Summit, the leftists/anarchists will block roads, set fires to cars and buildings, explode bombs and Molotov cocktails, and engage in sniper and mass shooting activity</strong>. &#8220;Hezbollah&#8221; cells will be out doing the same things, but with even more powerful weaponry. And as the Summit security forces attempt to coordinate a response to all this, their systems and communication networks will be malfunctioning from effective cyberattacks.</p>
<p>“Security nightmare” indeed.</p>

<p>So the “blame Iran” narrative will say that the Hezbollah cells that attacked the G20 entered Argentina via the Bolivian border. And on top of this, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-photos-reveal-expanding-reach-of-iran-in-venezuela-and-other-parts-of-latin-america" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fox News has narrated the following</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> &#8230;<strong>Iran allegedly helped build a UAV facility</strong> in Maracay, <strong>Venezuela</strong>, with documents reviewed by Fox News suggesting potential dual use technology.</p>
<p>After an unexplained explosion in 2011, Humire says sections of the plant, reinforced with ceramic plates at Tehran &#8216;s insistence, were largely intact.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe the Iranian UAV program is a cover for something that is more illicit,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Perhaps something that&#8217;s sanctioned and mostly likely involves <strong>Iran&#8217;s strategic programs, its nuclear program and ballistic missiles</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Humire found other examples, <strong>in Bolivia, with photos showing a government site, alleged to have received backing from Iran</strong>. Before 2011, it housed a UN Peacekeeping unit, but since it has been replaced by <strong>an air defense command that is heavily secured, with some areas strictly off limits</strong>. <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>So the globalists have placed Iran’s nuclear, ballistic missile, and drone programs in Venezuela, and they’ve hinted at a site in Bolivia that could be used to launch ballistic missiles / drones / cruise missiles.</p>
<p>Given all this, <strong>an “Iran / Hebollah” attack on the G20 can also be used as an excuse for Israel and the US to topple the Venezuelan and Bolivian governments&#8230;</strong><br />

&#8230;from <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-11-23/cia-has-smoking-gun-phone-call-mbs-giving-order-silence-khashoggi-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zero Hedge</a></p>
<p>Now have a look at this section from an article on &#8220;deep fakes&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> Fake videos can now be created using a machine learning technique called a “generative adversarial network”, or a GAN. A graduate student, Ian Goodfellow, invented GANs in 2014 as a way to algorithmically generate new types of data out of existing data sets. For instance, a GAN can look at thousands of photos of Barack Obama, and then produce a new photo that approximates those photos without being an exact copy of any one of them, as if it has come up with an entirely new portrait of the former president not yet taken. <strong>GANs might also be used to generate new audio from existing audio</strong>, or new text from existing text – it is a multi-use technology. &#8212; from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/nov/12/deep-fakes-fake-news-truth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Guardian</a> <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>In the future official narrative of the NWO, it will be said that the CIA &#8220;recording&#8221; of the MBS &#8220;smoking gun&#8221; phone call was a deep fake they produced as part of their campaign to take him down.</p>
<p>(By the way, it appears that the <strong>11</strong>/<strong>22</strong> surprise was <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/22/politics/trump-us-troops-lethal-force-closing-border/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump authorizing the military to use lethal force on the Mexican border</a>. One or more “immigrant” deaths from this will no doubt be scripted, thus leading to the new Democrat-controlled House of Representatives going nuts in January.)</p>
<h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Mossad Strike Plan for the G20 Summit</strong><br />
<strong>(21 November 2018)</strong></h1>
<p>I’ve been looking at the propaganda and security setup for the G20 Summit, and I think I’ve put together the Mossad’s strike plan&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>It will begin with bomb and firearm attacks by leftists/anarchists and “Hezbollah” agents all over Buenos Aires (but outside of the core security zone); these may include one or more offshore boat raids as well. The sheer number of these engagements, as well as a concurrent “Iranian” cyberattack, will distract and confuse the Summit security forces so the main attack can slip through unnoticed. And that main attack will be conducted with&#8230;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>one or more “Iranian” military drones or guided missiles</strong><br />
&#8230;and/or&#8230;<br />
<strong>a submarine or swimmer delivery vehicle sailing a massive bomb or “North Korean” nuke right up to the Buenos Aires shoreline</strong></p>
<p>Why do I say this, you ask? Because I’ve been warning about the sub and drone assassination angles for months, and because of these passages from <a href="https://argentinareports.com/g20-security/2070/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an Argentina Reports article on the Summit security preparations</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> <strong>Argentina bought four patrol boats from Israel</strong> for US$80 million, reported Israel Noticias, which were received in April and July. <strong>They</strong>, along with other marine boats, <strong>will be used to patrol the Buenos Aires coastline to ensure that no unregistered vessels enter the area.</strong> <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>So these brand new Israeli patrol boats will be the main line of defense against a submarine / frogman infiltration. This is a problem because the Mossad has likely added “poison pill” software to the sonar systems on the boats.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> Additionally, <strong>Argentina has paid US$5.2 million for a high-tech cybersecurity system, even though Israel is not in the G20</strong> and other countries who are (such as Russia, the US, the UK and China) are also leaders in the cybersecurity sector.</p>
<p>The cybersecurity system employs <strong>AI and machine learning</strong> to <strong>prevent cyber terrorist attacks or malicious code that could affect the systems and networks of the Armed forces, the Joint Chiefs of Staff (EMCO) and the Ministry of Defense</strong>. <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>This means the Mossad will be staging debilitating “Iranian” (and possibly “North Korean”) cyberattacks to disrupt the systems and networks of the Summit security forces. The attacks will succeed because of the backdoors the Mossad has embedded in the cybersecurity system. And since the system employs machine learning AI, the Israelis will have plausible deniability for the system’s failure. They can say, <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/604087/the-dark-secret-at-the-heart-of-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“The AI malfunctioned for reasons we do not understand,” which is a well-known problem with such AI</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> Argentina also purchased an <strong>anti-drone radar system</strong> from Israel, which was used successfully during the Youth Olympics in October earlier this year. <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>So it will be an Israeli radar watching for drones at the Summit. This is a problem due to “poison pill” software again.</p>
<p>As for what “poison pill” software is, it is a type of hidden malware that activates at a certain time or upon a certain signal to interfere with a system’s normal operation. Once it does what it is programmed to do, it erases itself, leaving no trace. And while I’m sure the IT world has its own term for this type of software, I don’t know what it is, so I call it “poison pill.”</p>
<p>In the case of the sonars on the Israeli patrol boats, the poison pill could <strong>generate a false display</strong> of what’s underwater or simply <strong>prevent the display of objects of a certain size</strong>, like a submarine. This would allow an underwater strike to pass through undetected. And in the case of the Israeli drone radar, the poison pill could do the same for what’s in the air, or it could hold the door open for a cyberattack that will take down the radar and/or its network.</p>
<p><strong>So as you can see, the Mossad holds the keys to all the doors needed for a successful attack on the G20, and that’s why I’m expecting what I’m expecting.</strong></p>
<p>MORE COMING tomorrow morning or Friday&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>(20 November 2018) &#8211;</strong> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-khashoggi-royals-exclusive/exclusive-after-khashoggi-murder-some-saudi-royals-turn-against-kings-favorite-son-idUSKCN1NO2KP" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Reuters article</a> came out yesterday that teases how the takedown of MBS is currently scripted. Here is an excerpt [with my additions in brackets]&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> Dozens of princes and cousins from powerful branches of the Al Saud family want to see a change in the line of succession but would not act while King Salman &#8211; the crown prince’s 82-year-old father &#8211; is still alive, the sources said. They recognize that the king is unlikely to turn against his favorite son, known in the West as MbS.</p>
<p>Rather, they are discussing the possibility with other family members that <strong>after the king’s death</strong>, Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz, 76, a younger full brother of King Salman and uncle of the crown prince, could take the throne, according to the sources.</p>
<p>Prince Ahmed, King Salman’s only surviving full brother, would have the support of family members, <strong>the security apparatus [the Saudi “Deep State”]</strong> and <strong>some Western powers [the US “Deep State” in particular]</strong>, one of the Saudi sources said. <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>So all that need happen now is King Salman’s death. And if MBS should die at his side in Buenos Aires, that will make things go all the more smoothly. In the words of Tony Montana and in the context of political assassinations, the G20 Summit is like a <em>&#8220;great big pus*y just waiting to get fu*ked.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">According to the future official narrative of the multilateral NWO, the reported killing of Khashoggi was arranged by the US Deep State, the Saudi Deep State, and Turkey’s Erdogan. They will say, <em>“Like Trump, MBS was a reformer who found himself surrounded by Deep State agents, even in his own protective detail. So the Saudi Deep State had some of their agents in his protective detail participate in the killing in order to frame MBS for ordering it.”</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">With that in mind, it appears that MBS will be one of the multilateral NWO’s future heroes. This is confirmed by the fact that future hero <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2018/11/19/trump-just-cant-quit-mbs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump supports him</a> and future hero <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-23/as-saudi-crisis-grows-kremlin-is-said-to-keep-its-bet-on-mbs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Putin supports him</a> too. And as of the beginning of this month, Netanyahu is also supporting him&#8230;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> Israel is concerned that the international pressure on Saudi Arabia over the killing of Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents will destabilize the Sunni kingdom and the Middle East as whole, Senior Israeli officials tell me.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Why it matters: <strong>Until today </strong>[November 1]<strong>, Israel refrained from commenting about the crisis publicly. This statement by the senior Israeli officials is very rare and shows Israel is nervous over the reaction of Western countries, including the U.S. The reason is that in the last few years, Saudi Arabia, led by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has become a staunch secret ally of the government in Jerusalem against Iran.</strong> &#8212; from <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.axios.com/israel-concerned-khashoggi-killing-saudi-arabia-mbs-9a23cb48-96cc-4251-8ebc-20f7bc37c936.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Axios</a> <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Given Netanyahu&#8217;s support of MBS and the particular scripting of the recent Chabad coup, Netanyahu is apparently being added to the pantheon of NWO heroes, and this means I’ll have to start looking for evidence that they might be substituting him for Trump as the “Moshiach ben Yosef,” while switching Trump to the “Cyrus the Great” role&#8230;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> Cyrus the Great respected the customs and religions of the lands he conquered. This became a very successful model for centralized administration and establishing a government working to the advantage and profit of its subjects. In fact, the administration of the empire through satraps and the vital principle of forming a government at Pasargadae were the works of Cyrus. What is sometimes referred to as the Edict of Restoration (actually two edicts) described in the Bible as being made by Cyrus the Great left a lasting legacy on the Jewish religion, where, because of his policies in Babylonia, <strong>he is referred to by the Jewish Bible as messiah (lit. “His anointed one”) (Isaiah 45:1), and is the only non-Jew figure in the Bible to be called so.</strong> &#8211; from <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrus_the_Great" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia</a> <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">If Netanyahu is to be in the pantheon, that means he is an assassination target too. And given the failure of the staged Chabad coup against him, don&#8217;t be surprised if they send him to the G20 to be assassinated alongside the rest. They could say he&#8217;s going there because he needs to talk to MBS.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Now let’s look at another article that came out recently&#8230;</span><br />
<span style="color: #333333;"><a style="color: #333333;" href="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/3men1120.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8143" src="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/3men1120.png" alt="" width="1151" height="405" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/3men1120.png 1151w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/3men1120-300x106.png 300w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/3men1120-768x270.png 768w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/3men1120-1024x360.png 1024w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/3men1120-624x220.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 1151px) 100vw, 1151px" /></a></span><br />

<p><span style="color: #333333;">This provides yet another scripted reason for a G20 assassination of MBS, Trump, and Putin by the Establishment: <em>&#8220;to regain control over the pricing of oil from the Anti-Establishment renegades.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>~ MORE ~</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>(23 November 2018) &#8211;</strong> Now let me show you how they’re setting up the things I wrote about in the previous portion of this update, starting with a preparatory propaganda article that helps them set up the “sequence of blame” for the G20 attack&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Back in the 19 November update, I showed you an article about two supposed Hezbollah agents who were arrested in Buenos Aires. As I continued searching for more information on the incident, I came across this&#8230;</span><br />
<span style="color: #333333;"><a style="color: #333333;" href="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mosba1123.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8149" src="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mosba1123.png" alt="" width="574" height="280" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mosba1123.png 574w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mosba1123-300x146.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 574px) 100vw, 574px" /></a></span><br />
<span style="color: #333333;">&#8230;from <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.jpost.com/International/Mossad-allegedly-provides-intelligence-to-thwart-Hezbollah-plot-in-Argentina-572284" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Jerusalem Post</a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">So in the case of the Argentine “Hezbollah agents,” the Israelis are taking credit for foiling yet another “terrorist attack,” just like they previously did with this year&#8217;s “Iranian” assassination plots in Paris and Denmark. This raises an obvious question&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong><em>Is the Mossad really so brilliant that they pick up on every little “terrorist” plot around the world, or did they know about these particular plots because they are the ones who set them up?</em></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The alt-media is full of stories about our own FBI agents posing as members of radical groups to recruit unstable, weak-minded individuals. Once they have these patsies-in-training on the hook, they train them, send them on trips to “countries with terrorist ties,” arm them, and have them prepare for a specific mission. Then, at the right time, other FBI agents swoop in on the “cell” and arrest them for plotting a terror attack. Such operations help the government maintain the mainstream narrative of the nation being “full of terrorist cells preparing to hurt us.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The same thing is happening with these “Iranian / Hezbollah” terror operations. The Mossad sets them up and knocks them down, and this helps the globalists establish multiple geopolitical narratives in support of The Plan, such as&#8230;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">“the EU nations shouldn’t bypass US sanctions because Iran is conducting terror operations on European soil,”</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">“Iran is engaged in an active worldwide campaign to assassinate its critics and enemies,” and</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">“Iran&#8217;s proxy Hezbollah is preparing for terror attacks in Buenos Aires.”</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">That being said, why did the globalists plant this story in the press? They did it so the alt-media can point out what I’m pointing out when it comes time to move the blame for the G20 strike from Iran / Hezbollah to Israel / MEK. Remember, the “sequence of blame” will start with ISIS, continue with Iran / Hezbollah, and end with Israel / MEK.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Moving on, here is an article which shows them trying to empty Buenos Aires in preparation for the G20 attack&#8230;</span><br />
<span style="color: #333333;"><a style="color: #333333;" href="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/g20evac1123.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8150" src="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/g20evac1123.png" alt="" width="739" height="535" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/g20evac1123.png 739w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/g20evac1123-300x217.png 300w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/g20evac1123-624x452.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 739px) 100vw, 739px" /></a></span><br />
<span style="color: #333333;">&#8230;from <a style="color: #333333;" href="http://en.mercopress.com/2018/11/20/g20-summit-in-buenos-aires-city-security-minister-suggests-residents-leave-the-city-over-the-long-weekend" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MercoPress</a>. Here is an excerpt&#8230;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> Argentine Security Minister Patricia Bullrich has warned Buenos Aires City residents that the staging of the G20 Leaders Summit at the turn of the month will make things very “complicated” in the City, telling residents they should use the long weekend to leave Buenos Aires for a few days.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Last week, the government ruled that Friday, November 30, would be a national holiday</strong>&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">“Our recommendation is that they use the long weekend to leave [the City and] that they <strong>leave on Thursday</strong>, because the City will be very complicated,”&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">We know that <strong>the G20 can generate spaces of extreme violence</strong> and situations of chaos and overflow,” said the minister. <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">So the ostensible reason for people evacuating the city is to avoid inconvenience and chaos due to the Summit security measures, but the article also foreshadows “spaces of extreme violence” in keeping with the first part of the Mossad strike plan. This evacuation could also be an effort to minimize civilian deaths from a nuclear strike. I don’t think the globalists want the “karma” of unnecessary, un-forewarned deaths hanging over them, at least not in the first phase of The Plan. And let’s not forget that the Summit will start on <strong>Friday</strong>, and it will be <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_G20_Buenos_Aires_summit" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>the 13th</strong> G20 Summit</a>, so it’s got a “Friday the 13th” angle attached to it. This makes Friday the most obvious day for the attack, so it’s a good idea to get out of the city on Thursday as recommended.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Speaking of a potential nuclear strike at the G20, have a look at this&#8230;</span><br />
<span style="color: #333333;"><a style="color: #333333;" href="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/5nukes1123.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8154" src="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/5nukes1123.png" alt="" width="619" height="192" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/5nukes1123.png 619w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/5nukes1123-300x93.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 619px) 100vw, 619px" /></a></span><br />
<span style="color: #333333;">&#8230;from <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://freebeacon.com/national-security/iran-secret-plans-build-five-nuclear-warheads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Washington Free Beacon</a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The article suggests that <em>“the Islamic Republic had concrete plans [back in 2003] to manufacture and build at least five nuclear weapons and that it was much further along in this scheme than previously known by the international community.”</em> It further suggests that the program to build <em>“five nuclear warheads, each with an explosive yield of 10 kilotons and able to be delivered by ballistic missile”</em> may have covertly continued in the <strong>15 YEARS</strong> since then. So it basically suggests that Iran may have nukes right now.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Isn’t it interesting that this article came out just 9 days before the G20 Summit? By putting this information out there, the globalists are expanding their scripting options. They no longer have to narrate that Iran got its nukes from North Korea; they can say that Iran developed its own, with North Korean assistance.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Now let’s have a look at how they’ve narrated Hezbollah’s possession of weapons capable of delivering the nukes&#8230;</span><br />

<span style="color: #333333;">&#8230;from the <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/columns/what-did-hezbollah-get-return-saving-assad-2030482870" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Middle East Eye</a>. Here is an excerpt&#8230;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> In terms of military equipment, Iran has used the war to massively increase Hezbollah’s stockpiles, which now include <strong>guided missiles, unmanned armed drones, short-range ballistic missiles</strong> and anti-tank missiles. In terms of numbers, it now has approximately 130,000 rockets and missiles, compared with 15,000 on the eve of the 2006 war. <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">So Hezbollah has missiles and drones that could potentially be tipped with 10-kiloton nuclear warheads <em>“provided by Qasem Soleimani, <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qasem_Soleimani" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commander of Iran’s Quds Force &#8212; a division primarily responsible for extraterritorial military and clandestine operations</a>.”</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Tomorrow morning, we’ll look at Iran’s drones and the globalists’ setup for anarchist / leftist participation in the distraction attacks.</span></p>
<p><strong>(19 November 2018) &#8211;</strong> As if to underscore that the G20 bombing scenario may still be in play, the press have now narrated that <a href="http://news.trust.org/item/20181119123649-vxsmr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) will attend the G20 Summit</a> (and they announced it while the Saudis were also urging action against Iran). I haven’t yet seen clarification if MBS is traveling WITH King Salman or INSTEAD of King Salman, but if both attend, the “evil US and Saudi Deep States” would get a twofer.</p>
<p>And here are the globalists connecting Hezbollah to the Summit location in advance&#8230;<br />

<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span style="color: #333333;">ALERT (18 November 2018) &#8211; Will Chabad take down Netanyahu tomorrow? (+ lessons from the failed coup)</span></strong></span></p>
<p>It looks like the globalists have scripted the fall of Netanyahu at the hands of the Chabad-Lubavitch messianic cult. The cult is basically threatening to take down his government if he doesn’t give them back the defense ministry and let them start the End Times war to bring in their “Jewish Messiah.” So it looks like the globalists are scripting Netanyahu as a &#8220;good guy&#8221; / &#8220;voice of reason&#8221; whose political fall leads to Israel&#8217;s disastrous descent into war. And If he gets taken down before the G20, they might proceed with more takedowns there.</p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Here are the basics of the situation&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Israel’s Chabad-connected defense minister, Avigdor Lieberman, resigned his position because Netanyahu supposedly blocked his invasion of Gaza. And when he resigned, his political party pulled out of Netanyahu’s governing coalition, leaving it within one seat of failing. Now another political party in the coalition is threatening to leave if Netanyahu doesn’t name one of its members, Naftali Bennett, as the new defense minister&#8230;</span><br />

<p><span style="color: #333333;">So far, Netanyahu has refused their demands, so they are threatening to take down his government tomorrow and trigger a snap election. This could potentially lead to a more aggressive government that will start Chabad&#8217;s desired End Times war.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>~ MORE ~</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">It is important to take a moment and realize that this attempted coup by Chabad was very much a contrived, scripted event. And both Chabad and Netanyahu were reading from the same script because they work for the same people, the Kabbalist elite (specifically, the trillionaire bankster families). So let me show you now what the goal of this foiled drama was to be&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>1) The purpose of the coup &#8212; had it been completed &#8212; was to give the public a logical political narrative that would have flowed into the invasion of the Gaza Strip.</strong> And this particular way of scripting it &#8212; with Netanyahu trying to hold back the disastrous invasion but getting overpowered by hotheads &#8212; suggests they&#8217;re trying to preserve Netanyahu&#8217;s reputation so he can be used later in the story, perhaps as Putin&#8217;s viceroy over Israel.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>2) The purpose of the Gaza invasion, which is still in play, is to outrage the Muslim world so the Turks can start organizing the combined Muslim army that will be used to invade Israel in the Gog-Magog War.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>3) The purpose of starting the formation of the Muslim army now is so it will be ready for Gog-Magog by next March.</strong> Organizing it now will allow the globalist scriptwriters to flow seamlessly out of the planned Turkey-Iran War straight into Gog-Magog. If they waited to organize the invasion force till after Turkey-Iran, there would be a drama-killing pause between the two wars.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>4) The scripted, public reason for Chabad-Lubavitch wanting to trigger the invasion of Israel is to force the Moshiach ben David (the Jewish Messiah) to come forward to prevent Israel’s total destruction.</strong> <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHBiT6eJaQQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here is a YouTube video of the Lubavitcher Rebbe exhorting Netanyahu to make the invasion happen</a>&#8230;.</span><br />

<span style="color: #333333;"><a style="color: #333333;" href="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/netreb1.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6981" src="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/netreb1.png" alt="" width="431" height="245" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/netreb1.png 431w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/netreb1-300x171.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 431px) 100vw, 431px" /></a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">&#8230;and the Rebbe instructs Netanyahu to do something to hasten the Moshiach’s arrival (meaning &#8220;trigger the invasion of Israel so it can be redeemed&#8221;)&#8230;</span><br />
<span style="color: #333333;"><a style="color: #333333;" href="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/netreb2.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6982" src="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/netreb2.png" alt="" width="431" height="244" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/netreb2.png 431w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/netreb2-300x170.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 431px) 100vw, 431px" /></a></span><br />
<span style="color: #333333;">&#8230;Netanyahu then agrees.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">What Chabad’s leaders don’t tell their followers it that the Moshiach ben David who will come forward (Vladimir Putin) is someone the leaders have chosen <em>to pose as the Moshiach.</em> They’ve been grooming him for the role&#8230;</span><br />

<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Even though this whole thing is a scripted stage play, the wars will be quite real.</strong> And there will be lots of real death and real destruction in Israel during Gog-Magog and its culminating Battle of Armageddon. So if you live in Israel, I say this to you&#8230;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #333333;">It’s time to pull your head out of your tuchus and face the reality of what your government, the Mossad, and Chabad are doing to you. It’s also time to spread the word to others and to command your representatives to stop. Even though you don’t have the control over them you think you have, letting them know that you’re onto their con will dissuade them from continuing. You can’t pull off a con if your mark knows exactly what you’re doing.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Your life, and the lives of your children in the IDF, depend on you stopping this thing. If you don’t do it now, you’ll not only see lots of death and destruction in the coming months, but you’ll also see the total destruction of Judaism and all Jews living in Israel seven years after that. The final Jewish pogrom, to be provided by your supposed friends the elite Kabbalists, is already scripted.</span></p></blockquote>

<p>According to the globalist script, Pence is playing the Phase 1 “Grey Champion,” an antichrist character who will take America’s reins after Trump is assassinated or removed from office. So he gave Putin and Xi the death stare for two reasons: 1) because they are supposedly “Avatars” (incarnations of the godhead) and the “two strongest pillars of the resistance to the Satanic West’s unilateral NWO,” and 2) because “glaring is caring.”</p>
<p>You gotta admire Pence for not cracking up while he was delivering “the face.” I’ve not seen such showmanship since the days of Barack Obama and Dr. Drake Ramoray&#8230;<br />

<p><strong>(17 November 2018) &#8211; The Globalists&#8217; 2018 Script for the Gog-Magog War and the Battle of Armageddon</strong></p>
<p>To properly grasp the globalists’ underlying strategy in blowing up the G20 Summit, one must first understand the basics of the “Battle of Armageddon” they’re trying to orchestrate. Here is a quick primer&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> The Battle of Armageddon will take place in Israel, in the prophesied Valley of Megiddo. It will occur after the Great Tribulation Period, at the Second Coming of Jesus Christ, when He returns to set up His Kingdom on earth&#8230;</p>
<p>Revelation chapters 14, 16, 17 and 19 describe Armageddon as a place of great slaughter where troops will be gathered, assembled and pressed together. At Armageddon Christ will come in all of His wrath and glory with His army following Him on white horses. Jesus is pictured here as a man of war, judging in righteousness with the sword of His mouth. <strong>Jesus will deliver Israel from destruction by the Antichrist</strong>. Nations will be punished for their sins. Those who have received the Mark of the Beast will be judged. And Jesus will take authority over the earth and remove the kingdom and reign of the Antichrist. &#8211; from <a href="https://www.endtime.com/armageddon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Endtime.com</a> <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>In some Christian circles, the Battle of Armageddon is viewed as a separate thing from the Gog-Magog War&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> There are a number of considerations that make it clear that this invasion by Gog is not the same as the battle of Armageddon. (1) In the battle of Gog <strong>definite allies</strong> are mentioned, while in Armageddon <strong>all nations are engaged</strong>. (2) Gog comes <strong>from the north</strong>, while at Armageddon the armies come <strong>from the whole earth</strong>. (3) Gog comes to take spoil, while at Armageddon the nations assemble to destroy the people of God. (4) There is protest against Gog’s invasion, but <strong>at Armageddon there is no protest for all nations are joined against Jerusalem</strong>. (5) <strong>Gog</strong> is the head of the armies in his invasion, but at Armageddon <strong>the Beast</strong> is the head of the invasion. &#8211; from <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/commentaries/revelation/related-topics/gog-attacks-israel.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BibleStudyTools.com</a> <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>But the only prophecy interpretations that matter are those the globalists are using to script their End Times stage play, and in their version, Gog = the Beast (Yildirim = the antichrist) so <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBGHblD5q0U&amp;t=2m11s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Battle of Armageddon is the culminating battle of the Gog-Magog War</a>. If you look at Gog-Magog and Armageddon from that perspective (and within the context of the G20 Summit attack), it implies that&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>The Gog-Magog War on Israel will be started by the Turkish antichrist and his allies, who will then be joined by the rest of the world for the final battle.</strong></p>
<p>So after Israel’s hand in the G20 attack is uncovered, Turkey’s Yildirim will rally all the Muslim nations to invade Israel from all directions. And as this invasion gets moving, the UN Security Council will pass a resolution authorizing military action against Israel, thus leading to “all the world’s armies” joining in for the final push. The resolution will not be vetoed because all the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_members_of_the_United_Nations_Security_Council" target="_blank" rel="noopener">P5 nations</a> will have lost their leaders at the G20, leaving Israel completely isolated and without earthly aid.</p>

<span style="color: #333333;">&#8230;from <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-11-17/argentina-locates-remains-missing-submarine-no-survivors-among-44-man-crew" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zero Hedge</a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Since I’ve identified “a submarine carrying a ‘North Korean’ nuke” as one of the likely modes of attack on the G20 Summit, I’m left wondering if today’s news has a connection to the Summit bombing scenario. Even though a connection seems like a stretch, the timing of this news left me asking myself a few questions&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><em>Was the San Juan actually lost in an accident, or was it disappeared to be used as a weapon against the seaside G20 Summit a year later?</em> [If so, a year would allow time for the vessel to be cosmetically modified, perhaps to resemble an Iranian or Israeli sub.]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><em>Did the possible cancellation on Tuesday of the G20 bombing cause them to scuttle the vessel to give closure to the mystery of its disappearance?</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><em>Was the wreckage found at the bottom of the ocean today actually the hull of some other submarine, possibly even that of San Juan’s abandoned (but 70% complete) sister sub, the <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TR-1700-class_submarine#Boats_in_class" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Santa Fe</a>?</em> [If so, the decoy sub’s discovery would allow the San Juan to carry out the G20 op unsuspected.]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><em>And if the San Juan did sink from an accident a year ago, was its discovery today the result of somebody scouring the waters off Argentina looking for rogue submarines that could be used against the Summit?</em></span></p>
<p><strong>(16 November 2018) &#8211;</strong> If you visited the blog last night, you probably saw this&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Wow, I just put something together. It is indeed possible that Erdogan is among those scripted to die in the G20 bombing. And it may in fact be Binali Yildirim, the man who would become Acting President of Turkey after Erdogan’s assassination, who will lead Turkey first against Iran and then against Israel (remember: Iran will be blamed for the bombing first, then the blame will shift to Israel, thus resulting in the Gog-Magog War against Israel and its culminating Battle of Armageddon). I’ll fill in the details of this in the morning.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now that it’s morning, here are the promised details:</p>
<p>In <a href="http://redefininggod.com/2018/11/globalist-outcome-and-scripting-options-for-the-2018-g20-summit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my entry on the G20 bombing scenario</a>, I wrote this about Erdogan&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>The nuke option is unlikely if Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey shows up to the Summit. It is doubtful that the globalists will remove him from the board this early (he still has much to do in playing his role), so his attendance would likely mean a nuclear attack isn’t planned. But should something happen in Turkey that prevents him from attending, the nuke option is definitely on the table.</p></blockquote>
<p>After writing this paragraph, something about it bothered me, so I continued pondering Erdogan’s scripted fate until I remembered something I heard in a prophecy propaganda video months ago. It was part of an interview of Joel Richardson, a Christian Crypto-Jew the globalists have assigned to influence the Christians into accepting the prophecy interpretations they intend to act out for the public&#8230;<br />

&#8230;from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBGHblD5q0U" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a></p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBGHblD5q0U&amp;t=23m33s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the final minutes of the interview</a>, Richardson suggests that <strong>there will be a massive regional war between Turkey and Iran before the Gog-Magog War</strong>. He further suggests <strong>there is a possibility that Erdogan will be killed during this war, and a Turkish antichrist will rise out of the ashes of the war to lead Gog-Magog against Israel</strong>.</p>
<p>Now take a moment to overlay Richardson’s prediction onto the G20 bombing scenario I’ve laid out. Turkey and Iran share a common border, and both have positioned their forces in Syria in advance of this predicted war. So what will happen if “Iran and Hezbollah” kill Erdogan by bombing the G20? Turkey will attack Iran and their Hezbollah proxies in Syria, won’t they? And this would give us the preliminary Turkey-Iran War Richardson has suggested.</p>
<p>What will then happen after it is revealed that “Israel and the MEK” are actually to blame for the G20 attack? Both Turkey and Iran <em>“will realize they were duped into destroying each other by the Israelis,”</em> so they will cease fire and join forces (along with all the other Muslim nations in the region) to furiously attack Israel in response. This would give us the First Gog-Magog War and the First Battle of Armageddon.</p>
<p>All of this could transpire over just a few months time &#8212; in time to sync Putin&#8217;s savior moment (when he reenters the stage to save Israel) to the prophecy calendar in March.</p>
<p>That being said, who will be the Turkish antichrist who arises after Erdogan is killed? Upon checking into the Turkish rules of presidential succession, I found this&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> In the event of a temporary absence of the President on account of illness, travel abroad or similar circumstances, the Vice President of Turkey serves as Acting President, and exercises the powers of the President until the Presidents comes back. <strong>If the President</strong> resigns or <strong>dies, the TBMM Speaker serves as Acting President, and exercises the powers of the President until the new election happens in 45 days</strong>. &#8211; from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Turkey#Acting_President" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia</a> <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>And upon googling “<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22tbmm%22+turkey" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TBMM Turkey</a>,” I came across this&#8230;<br />
<a href="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/tbmm1116.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8106" src="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/tbmm1116.png" alt="" width="398" height="95" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/tbmm1116.png 398w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/tbmm1116-300x72.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 398px) 100vw, 398px" /></a></p>
<p>As it turns out, the Speaker of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey (and Erdogan’s successor) is this man&#8230;<br />

&#8230;from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binali_Y%C4%B1ld%C4%B1r%C4%B1m" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia</a>. Here is a little of what his Wiki says about him [with my comments in brackets]&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> As <strong>a staunch supporter of Erdogan</strong>, Yildirim has been referred to as a &#8216;low-profile&#8217; Prime Minister and is expected to <strong>spearhead a transition from a parliamentary system of government to an executive presidency, which will delegate greater powers to Erdogan and the office of the President</strong>&#8230; [This transition has occurred, so Yildirim worked to strengthen the office he will soon occupy (just like an antichrist would). And since Erdogan’s assassination will lead to an immediate state of war, it would be impractical to hold an election 45 days after. This means Yildirim will be in office indefinitely.]</p>
<p>As the Director of IDO, <strong>Yildirim established a close relationship to Recep Tayyip Erdogan</strong>, who served as Istanbul’s Mayor from 1994 to 1998. When the latter led efforts to establish a new moderate conservative democratic political party in August 2001, <strong>Yildirim joined Erdogan to become a founding member of the Justice and Development Party (AKP)</strong>. [So Yildirim is both Erdogan’s partner in crime and Erdogan’s carbon copy (politically).] <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>But it is the following passage that really cemented Yildirim’s candidacy for “the Turkish antichrist” in my mind&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> His name, Binali, means <strong>son of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ali</a></strong> in Arabic. An Alevi neighbour of his family gave him the name. His surname, Yildirim, means &#8220;<strong>lightning bolt</strong>&#8220;&#8230; <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>So Yildirim’s first name hints at his being a son of “the legitimate successor of the Prophet Muhammed, Ali.” And his family name, which means “lightning bolt,” hints at his being the antichrist&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+10%3A18&amp;version=ESV" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Luke 10:18</a> &#8211; And he said to them, “I saw <strong>Satan</strong> fall like <strong>lightning</strong> from heaven.”</p></blockquote>
<p>His name thus loosely translates to “Muhammed’s Antichrist.” And if the globalists proceed with this 2018 script, it is Yildirim who will go down in the history books as being the “Dajjal.”</p>
<p><strong>(15 November 2018) &#8211;</strong> In another signal that the globalists might be delaying the big drama till next year, the newest Saudi Coalition offensive on Yemen&#8217;s Port of Hodeidah was abruptly halted yesterday.

<p>So this new “vast offensive” was suddenly halted just five days after it began. It’s no coincidence that this happened within a day of the Gaza offensive being suddenly halted. The globalists want to hold the “Gaza Invasion” and “Fall of Hodeidah” cards for play the next time they attempt to start the hot phase of the Middle East War &#8212; the next time they want to trigger the “Iranian Cruise Missiles out of Yemen” scenario.</p>
<p>But as the globalists put these two cards back in their hand, they’re pulling out another to be played before the G20 Summit: the “Fall of ISIS in Syria” card. Take a look at these three stories about the sudden resumption of the US/Kurd offensive against “ISIS’ final stronghold” in Hajin, Syria&#8230;<br />

<p><strong>I suspect they’re narrating this new phase of the Hajin offensive so they can narrate the capture of ISIS’ leader and a subsequent collapse of the final ISIS pocket in Syria. This could enable Trump to announce a timetable for a US withdrawal from Syria at the Summit (where he&#8217;ll be meeting Putin to supposedly coordinate planned actions of that sort).</strong></p>
<p>As a fallback play, they could keep the Hajin offensive grinding on till March of next year so Trump can announce the withdrawal then. In that case, <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/413277-john-bolton-says-putin-invited-to-visit-washington-in-early-2019" target="_blank" rel="noopener">don’t be surprised if a Trump-Putin summit is announced for March</a>. March is the next foreseeable assassination timeframe.</p>

<p><strong>(14 November 2018) &#8211; Well THAT was a quick adjustment on their part.</strong> All of a sudden, the Gaza invasion &#8212; a move which would have helped support the “Iran/Hezbollah attacked the G20&#8243; narrative &#8212; came to a screeching halt&#8230;<br />

<p>For the time being, Netanyahu will take on his duties, and Lieberman&#8217;s eventual replacement will likely be someone whose Chabad connection is not publicly documented.</p>
<p>One would hope these developments are the initial signs that the globalists have canceled the G20 bombing operation. Hope is no substitute for putting in the work, though, so this blog’s G20 coverage will continue. There is much to learn by finishing what was started, and the writings can be reused the next time they try this.</p>

&#8230;(the aftermath of the 1992 Israeli embassy bombing in Buenos Aires)</p>
<p><strong>(13 November 2018) &#8211;</strong> As I’ve previously written, in the first days/weeks after an attack at the G20 Summit, ISIS is likely to be blamed (due to fabricated evidence and a false claim of responsibility supposedly planted by Iran). But the Western intelligence agencies (Argentine intelligence in particular) and the Western mainstream media will soon after identify Iran and Hezbollah as the true culprits. The globalists will script it this way so they can get the whole world angry at Iran and start the wheels of World War 3 in motion. We’ll be seeing “<strong>Target Iran</strong>”&#8230;<br />
<a href="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/targetiraq1113.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8084" src="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/targetiraq1113.png" alt="" width="465" height="332" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/targetiraq1113.png 465w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/targetiraq1113-300x214.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 465px) 100vw, 465px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>That being the case, the globalists could pick no better site than Buenos Aires for a mass casualty “terror” attack “carried out by Iran and Hezbollah.” Why, you ask? Because Buenos Aires has already suffered TWO such attacks in recent memory.</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE FIRST</strong> was the 1992 attack on the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires. Here are some key passages from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_attack_on_Israeli_embassy_in_Buenos_Aires" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its Wikipedia page</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> The attack on the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires was a suicide bombing attack on the building of the Israeli embassy of Argentina, located in Buenos Aires, which was carried out on 17 March 1992. 29 civilians were killed in the attack and 242 additional civilians were injured&#8230;</p>
<p>On 17 March 1992, at 2:42 pm (UTC−3), a pick-up truck driven by a suicide bomber and loaded with explosives smashed into the front of the Israeli Embassy located on the corner of Arroyo and Suipacha, and detonated. The embassy, a Catholic church, and a nearby school building were destroyed&#8230;</p>
<p>A group called Islamic Jihad Organization, which has been linked to <strong>Iran</strong> and possibly <strong>Hezbollah</strong>, claimed responsibility&#8230;</p>
<p>In 1999, the Argentine government issued an arrest warrant for Imad Mughniyah in connection with this attack and the 1994 AMIA bombing in Buenos Aires, which killed 85. It is suspected that the two attacks are linked. <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>THE SECOND</strong> attack was the 1994 AMIA bombing in Buenos Aires. Here are some key passages from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMIA_bombing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its Wikipedia page</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> The AMIA bombing was an attack on the Asociacion Mutual Israelita Argentina (AMIA; Argentine Israelite Mutual Association) building. It occurred in Buenos Aires on 18 July 1994, killing 85 people and injuring hundreds. It was Argentina&#8217;s deadliest bombing ever. Argentina is home to a Jewish community of 230,000, the largest in Latin America and sixth in the world outside Israel (see Demographics of Argentina)&#8230;</p>
<p>On 18 July 1994, a suicide bomber drove a Renault Trafic van bomb loaded with about 275 kilograms (606 lb) of ammonium nitrate fertilizer and fuel oil explosive mixture, into the Jewish Community Center building located in a densely constructed commercial area of Buenos Aires&#8230;</p>
<p>The bombing came two years after the 17 March 1992 bombing of the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires which killed 29 and wounded 242, and was Argentina&#8217;s deadliest attack until the AMIA bombing. The Islamic Jihad Organization, which according to Robert Baer operates under the umbrella of <strong>Hezbollah</strong> and is linked to <strong>Iran</strong>, claimed responsibility for that bombing. Some suspect that the AMIA bombing was connected to the embassy attack. To date, authorities have been unable to locate those responsible for either of the two bombings&#8230;</p>
<p>Shortly after the attack, Ansar Allah a Palestinian Jihadist organization widely held as a front for Hezbollah claimed responsibility for the attack&#8230;</p>
<p>On 6 March 2007, former Congressman Mario Cafiero and former government official Luis D&#8217;Elia provided evidence at a press conference that Abolghasem Mesbahi, along with two other Iranians that gave alleged evidence implicating Iran in the bombing, were members of the People&#8217;s Mujahedin of Iran (MEK), which is an organization that advocates the overthrow of the Islamic Republic of Iran and was designated until 2012 as a terrorist organization by the US&#8230;</p>
<p>In August 2009, BBC News reported that Ahmad Vahidi had become Iran&#8217;s defense minister-designate under the 2009 Mahmoud Ahmadinejad administration, and is on Interpol&#8217;s wanted list over the AMIA bombing. Vahidi led a unit of Iran&#8217;s Revolutionary Guard called Quds Force at the time of the attack, and has been accused of planning the bombings. Iran dismissed this development as a &#8220;Zionist plot&#8221;. <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>So after a mass casualty bombing of the G20 Summit, the talking heads in the mainstream media will point their fingers at these two previous “Iranian/Hezbollah” attacks in Buenos Aires as precedents. And they’ll opine that <em>“Iran returned to its old ways due to the intense pressure their regime is feeling from the Trump sanctions”</em> and <em>“they wanted to strike back at Trump in a way that appeared that Trump wasn’t specifically targeted, and they wanted to avoid blame by making it look like their enemy ISIS did it.”</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Getting back to the Wikipedia entries on the two bombings, here are some things of note&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>&gt;</strong> The entries on both bombings tie them to <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Lebanon_conflict_(1985%E2%80%932000)#Post_Civil_War_conflict" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the 1985 &#8211; 2000 South Lebanon conflict</a>, in which Hezbollah waged war against an Israeli <strong>occupation of Muslim lands</strong>. And wouldn’t you know it, Israel is poised to do another invasion and <strong>occupation of Muslim lands</strong> right before the G20 Summit&#8230;</span><br />

&#8230;But this 2019 cover is not blank; it simply depicts an all-encompassing darkness. This is because the globalists heartily intend to take us into the “Darkness Before the Dawn” phase of their NWO implementation plan next year (good luck with that, fellas). You can read about this phase in the NWO Schedule of Implementation section further down this page.</p>
<p><strong>One of the main markers of the beginning of “the Darkness Before the Dawn” is the fall of Donald Trump, either by assassination or removal from office.</strong> And the upcoming G20 Summit in Buenos Aires offers the final grand stage they can use to put on the assassination show this year. I’ll therefore cover it in a comprehensive manner.</p>
<p>At the top of the &#8220;recent posts&#8221; section to your right, you’ll notice a link to a new entry titled “<a href="http://redefininggod.com/2018/11/globalist-outcome-and-scripting-options-for-the-2018-g20-summit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Globalist Outcome and Scripting Options for the 2018 G20 Summit</a>.” It is the place where I’ll gather my notes on the G20 and all the players the globalists have positioned to have a role in any hijinks that may transpire there. These players include ISIS, Hezbollah, the Mossad, the MEK, the Pope and the Jesuits, and the various “deep states” of America, Russia, China, India, and Brazil to name a few. If the globalists want to take us into the Darkness Before the Dawn in 2019, a big hit at the G20 would do nicely to get it started. We’d be falling right into the abyss as the new year begins.</p>

<p><strong>(12 November 2018) &#8211;</strong> This entry is a work in progress. For the next two weeks, I’ll use it as a gathering point for new notes and previous writings on the subject of the Trump assassination show and the G20 Summit at the end of the month. And as the Summit draws near, I’ll edit it all into a coherent entry that offers extensive coverage of what could happen there. The completed entry will then be posted on the home page before the Summit begins.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my most recent note on the subject&#8230;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Why the Globalists Chose Buenos Aires for a G20 Summit Bombing</h3>
<p>Will history repeat itself in 17 days?&#8230;<br />

&#8230;(the aftermath of the 1992 Israeli embassy bombing in Buenos Aires)</p>
<p><strong>(13 November 2018) &#8211;</strong> As I’ve previously written, in the first days/weeks after an attack at the G20 Summit, ISIS is likely to be blamed (due to fabricated evidence and a false claim of responsibility supposedly planted by Iran). But the Western intelligence agencies (Argentine intelligence in particular) and the Western mainstream media will soon after identify Iran and Hezbollah as the true culprits. The globalists will script it this way so they can get the whole world angry at Iran and start the wheels of World War 3 in motion. We’ll be seeing “<strong>Target Iran</strong>”&#8230;<br />
<a href="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/targetiraq1113.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8084" src="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/targetiraq1113.png" alt="" width="465" height="332" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/targetiraq1113.png 465w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/targetiraq1113-300x214.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 465px) 100vw, 465px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>That being the case, the globalists could pick no better site than Buenos Aires for a mass casualty “terror” attack “carried out by Iran and Hezbollah.” Why, you ask? Because Buenos Aires has already suffered TWO such attacks in recent memory.</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE FIRST</strong> was the 1992 attack on the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires. Here are some key passages from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_attack_on_Israeli_embassy_in_Buenos_Aires" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its Wikipedia page</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> The attack on the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires was a suicide bombing attack on the building of the Israeli embassy of Argentina, located in Buenos Aires, which was carried out on 17 March 1992. 29 civilians were killed in the attack and 242 additional civilians were injured&#8230;</p>
<p>On 17 March 1992, at 2:42 pm (UTC−3), a pick-up truck driven by a suicide bomber and loaded with explosives smashed into the front of the Israeli Embassy located on the corner of Arroyo and Suipacha, and detonated. The embassy, a Catholic church, and a nearby school building were destroyed&#8230;</p>
<p>A group called Islamic Jihad Organization, which has been linked to <strong>Iran</strong> and possibly <strong>Hezbollah</strong>, claimed responsibility&#8230;</p>
<p>In 1999, the Argentine government issued an arrest warrant for Imad Mughniyah in connection with this attack and the 1994 AMIA bombing in Buenos Aires, which killed 85. It is suspected that the two attacks are linked. <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>THE SECOND</strong> attack was the 1994 AMIA bombing in Buenos Aires. Here are some key passages from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMIA_bombing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its Wikipedia page</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> The AMIA bombing was an attack on the Asociacion Mutual Israelita Argentina (AMIA; Argentine Israelite Mutual Association) building. It occurred in Buenos Aires on 18 July 1994, killing 85 people and injuring hundreds. It was Argentina&#8217;s deadliest bombing ever. Argentina is home to a Jewish community of 230,000, the largest in Latin America and sixth in the world outside Israel (see Demographics of Argentina)&#8230;</p>
<p>On 18 July 1994, a suicide bomber drove a Renault Trafic van bomb loaded with about 275 kilograms (606 lb) of ammonium nitrate fertilizer and fuel oil explosive mixture, into the Jewish Community Center building located in a densely constructed commercial area of Buenos Aires&#8230;</p>
<p>The bombing came two years after the 17 March 1992 bombing of the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires which killed 29 and wounded 242, and was Argentina&#8217;s deadliest attack until the AMIA bombing. The Islamic Jihad Organization, which according to Robert Baer operates under the umbrella of <strong>Hezbollah</strong> and is linked to <strong>Iran</strong>, claimed responsibility for that bombing. Some suspect that the AMIA bombing was connected to the embassy attack. To date, authorities have been unable to locate those responsible for either of the two bombings&#8230;</p>
<p>Shortly after the attack, Ansar Allah a Palestinian Jihadist organization widely held as a front for Hezbollah claimed responsibility for the attack&#8230;</p>
<p>On 6 March 2007, former Congressman Mario Cafiero and former government official Luis D&#8217;Elia provided evidence at a press conference that Abolghasem Mesbahi, along with two other Iranians that gave alleged evidence implicating Iran in the bombing, were members of the People&#8217;s Mujahedin of Iran (MEK), which is an organization that advocates the overthrow of the Islamic Republic of Iran and was designated until 2012 as a terrorist organization by the US&#8230;</p>
<p>In August 2009, BBC News reported that Ahmad Vahidi had become Iran&#8217;s defense minister-designate under the 2009 Mahmoud Ahmadinejad administration, and is on Interpol&#8217;s wanted list over the AMIA bombing. Vahidi led a unit of Iran&#8217;s Revolutionary Guard called Quds Force at the time of the attack, and has been accused of planning the bombings. Iran dismissed this development as a &#8220;Zionist plot&#8221;. <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>So after a mass casualty bombing of the G20 Summit, the talking heads in the mainstream media will point their fingers at these two previous “Iranian/Hezbollah” attacks in Buenos Aires as precedents. And they’ll opine that <em>“Iran returned to its old ways due to the intense pressure their regime is feeling from the Trump sanctions”</em> and <em>“they wanted to strike back at Trump in a way that appeared that Trump wasn’t specifically targeted, and they wanted to avoid blame by making it look like their enemy ISIS did it.”</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Getting back to the Wikipedia entries on the two bombings, here are some things of note&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>&gt;</strong> The entries on both bombings tie them to <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Lebanon_conflict_(1985%E2%80%932000)#Post_Civil_War_conflict" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the 1985 &#8211; 2000 South Lebanon conflict</a>, in which Hezbollah waged war against an Israeli <strong>occupation of Muslim lands</strong>. And wouldn’t you know it, Israel is poised to do another invasion and <strong>occupation of Muslim lands</strong> right before the G20 Summit&#8230;</span><br />

<p><span style="color: #333333;">Such a move will enable the mainstream media’s “expert” commentators to say that <em>“the G20 bombing was another Iranian/Hezbollah reaction to perceived Israeli aggression”</em> and <em>“the Iranians wanted to strike back in a place where they have a long-established terrorist presence, and they wanted to deprive Israel of its greatest ally, Donald Trump.”</em></span></p>

<h3><strong>(Expanded Note &#8211; 2-4 November 2018) &#8211; The potential of an assassination show at the G20</strong></h3>
<p><strong>(2 November 2018) &#8211;</strong> There’s an interesting assassination play shaping up for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_G20_Buenos_Aires_summit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">G20 Summit at the end of the month</a>. Get a load of this&#8230;<br />

&#8230;from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/01/world/americas/brazil-judge-lula-bolsonaro.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The New York Times</a></p>
<p>This development creates the appearance of a quid-pro-quo arrangement between Bolsonaro and the judge (it can be claimed the judge improperly convicted Lula in exchange for a promised cabinet post in Bolsonaro’s government).</p>
<p>This being the case, should the globalists do their assassination show at the G20 Summit instead of Paris, they can not only script the “Western Satanists’ assassination of the Avatars” (Trump, Putin, Xi, and Modi), but also script a leftist takedown of Bolsonaro (&#8220;Brazil&#8217;s Donald Trump&#8221;) by removing Brazil&#8217;s President Temer from the board.</p>
<p>Under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_presidential_line_of_succession" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brazil’s rules of presidential succession</a>, an assassination of Temer at the G20 would allow Brazil’s National Congress to elect a new president to finish out his term. And that means they could elect Lula (if his second appeal meets with success in November or December) or someone else who could pardon Lula. Either way, a free Lula could be combined with a leftist uprising to demand a new presidential election under threat of civil war.</p>
<p>It’s a clever play, but hopefully this early exposure will nix it. Just to be sure, I&#8217;ll give it a double-tap before the G20 Summit convenes.</p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>(3 November 2018) &#8211;</strong> Now allow me to cover this scenario in more depth by looking at its different components, beginning with&#8230;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>The Replacement President Component</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The setup for the Temer assassination show started with the impeachment and removal of Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff on August 31, 2016. On that day, Vice President Michel Temer rose to the presidency, leaving the office of Vice President vacant. So if Temer gets killed at the G20 this month, there would be a <strong>double vacancy</strong> in the offices of president and vice president, which triggers the following constitutional process in Brazil&#8230;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> Should a President die, resign or be removed from office, a Vice-President succeeds as President.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The other officers in the line of succession do not become President in those cases. Instead, the next available person in line merely becomes Acting President, and <strong>the Constitution dictates that, whenever both the presidency and the vice-presidency become vacant, new elections are to be held. So in the case of an Acting President taking office due to a double vacancy in the presidency and vice-presidency, the Acting President serves only until the special election takes place and the newly elected President and Vice-President are sworn-in.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>If the second vacancy triggering elections takes place in the last two years of the presidential term, the National Congress is empowered and required to elect the President (and his Vice-President).</strong> If the double vacancy of the presidency and vice-presidency takes place in the first half of the four-year presidential term, however, a presidential election by popular vote is held.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">In any event, <strong>the President and Vice-President so elected merely finish what remains of the pending presidential term</strong>, and thereafter a new President and a new Vice-President, chosen in the regular general elections, take office for a normal four-year term. <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong> &#8211; from <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_presidential_line_of_succession" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia</a></span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">So following the “death” of Temer, the President of the Chamber of Deputies (Rodrigo Maia) would become the momentary Acting President until a replacement President can be elected. And since the double vacancy would happen during the last two years of the current presidential term, the National Congress would elect the replacement.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Since the replacement President would have less than a month in office before Bolsonaro is inaugurated on January 1, he or she would only have time to do something simple (like pardoning Lula). So Lula is the next component we’ll look at.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><em>More to come over the course of the weekend, including coverage of the assassination show setup in Paris and the imminent implementation of the US oil export embargo on Iran (which is scripted to provide the Iranians with the motivation to assassinate Trump in Paris or at the G20, even though they won’t be the ones doing it).</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>The Lula Component</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">To acquaint you with the current situation of Luiz Inacio <strong>Lula</strong> da Silva, a popular former President of Brazil who held office from 2003 &#8211; 2010, here is <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luiz_In%C3%A1cio_Lula_da_Silva" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a passage from Wikipedia</a>&#8230;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> On 12 July 2017, he was convicted of money laundering and passive corruption, defined in Brazilian criminal law as the receipt of a bribe by a civil servant or government official. <strong>Lula was sentenced to nine years and six months in prison by judge Sergio Moro</strong>, but he remained free pending an appeal of the sentence. On 24 January 2018, the Regional Federal Court of the 4th Region, which is a panel of three appellate judges, unanimously upheld Moro&#8217;s ruling against Lula and increased the sentence to 12 years. On 5 April 2018, the Supreme Federal Court voted to reject Lula&#8217;s habeas corpus plea and on the same day a warrant was issued for his arrest. He turned himself in and began serving his sentence on 7 April 2018.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Lula announced his candidacy for the 2018 presidential election, but he was disqualified from running under Brazil&#8217;s &#8220;Clean Record&#8221; law</strong> by the Superior Electoral Court on 31 August 2018 and was replaced by Fernando Haddad on 11 September 2018. The United Nations Human Rights Committee requested that the Brazilian government allow Lula to exercise his political rights as a presidential candidate. <strong>Prior to being barred, Lula led all scenarios in polls for the October election</strong>, achieving 39 percent in voter intentions within one month of the first round. <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">So Lula is the leftist candidate who supposedly would have won the recent Brazilian presidential election if he hadn’t been sidelined by a corruption conviction. And now that Bolsonaro has tapped the judge who convicted Lula for a cabinet post in his administration, an appearance of impropriety has been created that could lead to Lula’s conviction being vacated or pardoned&#8230;</span><br />

<span style="color: #333333;">&#8230;from <a style="color: #333333;" href="http://www.cadenagramonte.cu/english/show/articles/28607:lawyers-demand-impartial-and-fair-trial-for-lula-in-brazil" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cadenagramonte.cu</a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">This provides the globalist scriptwriters with two ways of scripting the Brazilian “left’s” attempt to overturn the election of Brazil’s Donald Trump&#8230;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">They can script the overturning of Lula’s conviction before the National Congress holds the post-assassination election of Temer’s replacement, thus allowing them to elect Lula.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">They can script the National Congress electing a replacement President who will pardon Lula in December, before Bolsonaro takes office.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">And as I said yesterday, a free Lula could be combined with a leftist uprising to demand a new presidential election under threat of civil war. Such a strategy was already previewed in the press before Bolsonaro made his questionable appointment of Lula’s judge&#8230;</span><br />

<span style="color: #333333;">&#8230;from the <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://mg.co.za/article/2018-11-01-brazilian-left-reels-as-country-lurches-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mail &amp; Guardian</a>. Here is the relevant excerpt&#8230;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> “Lula-ism is bigger than the PT. <strong>The party has the backing of organised labour and social movements, but Lula has the support of the mass of society, the poorest people in Brazil</strong>,” said Ricardo Musse, a sociologist at the University of Sao Paulo.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">“The PT isn’t a homogeneous party… There will be a sector that will try to ditch Lula, another that <strong>will lead the political opposition (to Bolsonaro)</strong>&#8230; and another that <strong>will drive social resistance with street protests</strong>.” <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Also note the blurb below the photo; they are using the same “resistance” wording the American “left” has used against Trump, and “Not Him” is reminiscent of “Never Trump.” As I&#8217;ve said before, the globalists are using this &#8220;leftist chaos that pushes people to the right&#8221; template all over the place at both the national and global levels.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The next component we’ll look at is the Bolsonaro / National Congress relationship.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>The Bolsonaro / National Congress Relationship Component</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>(4 November 2018) &#8211;</strong> The relationship between President-Elect Bolsonaro and the National Congress has been narrated as being tense. Bolsonaro once said that <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2018/11/election-of-bolsonaro-likely-to-test-democracy-in-brazil-and-beyond/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">if he were ever elected President, he would shut down the National Congress on his first day</a>. And <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-brazilian-candidate-bolsonaro-scolds-son-for-threatening-to-shut-down/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">back in July, his son threatened a shutdown of the Supreme Court</a>. If you add to that <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2018/11/01/president-elect-bolsonaro-to-brazils-bureaucrats-youre-fired/#7f040b726137" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bolsonaro’s expressed intention to fire many of the government’s bureaucrats</a>, you get a situation in which those institutions and their members (the current Brazilian &#8220;Establishment&#8221;) see Bolsonaro as an existential threat.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">On top of that, there is the matter of pervasive corruption in the National Congress. <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/brazils-political-class-is-in-crisis-as-over-100-are-investigated-for-corruption/2017/04/12/d2832a8a-1f7e-11e7-bb59-a74ccaf1d02f_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In last year’s corruption purge, 66 senators and representatives went under the microscope</a>. And Bolsonaro’s appointment of Lula’s convicting judge to the post of justice minister signals a massive corruption purge will occur after the January 1 inauguration.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">That being the case, the corrupt members of the current Congress have less than two months before the new corruption crusade begins and new pro-Bolsonaro congresspersons take office and shift the balance of power. This provides motivation for them to do anything possible to stop Bolsonaro, including assassinating Temer and electing or pardoning Lula.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">It is important to note that Argentina is hosting the G20 Summit this year, and they share a common border with Brazil. This makes the infiltration of a G20 hit team by the Brazilian “Deep State” a simple matter. So in the next section, we’ll look at all the potential G20 targets of the various “Deep States” as well as all the nations and groups that stand to be blamed if an attack happens.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>The Details of a Possible G20 False-Flag</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Here are the likely and possible targets, likely scapegoats, and likely modes of attack for a G20 “terrorist attack” scenario (I’ll flesh out all the details of this section in the coming hours / days / weeks)&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>LIKELY TARGETS</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>&gt; Donald Trump of the US &#8211;</strong> the controlled media, both mainstream and alternative, have cast him as a existential threat to the “US Deep State,” the “Satanic Western globalist” agenda, the trade interests of China, and the regimes of Iran and North Korea. So they all supposedly want him dead.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>&gt; Vladimir Putin of Russia &#8211;</strong> He too has been cast as an existential threat to the “US Deep State,” NATO, the EU, and the “Satanic Western globalist” agenda. So they all supposedly want him dead alongside his “fellow Christian” Trump.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>&gt; Xi Jinping of China &#8211;</strong> He has been cast as an enemy of the corrupted, Western-friendly element of the Communist Party, and he is supposedly facing a quiet rebellion against his anti-corruption drive, his consolidation of power and his confrontational stance towards the West. So his domestic rivals would like to see him disappear. (NYT article) https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/31/world/asia/xi-jinping-internal-dissent.html</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>&gt; Narendra Modi of India &#8211;</strong> As a Hindu nationalist, <a style="color: #ff0000;" href="https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/bigotry-normalised-modi-180411100651759.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he has been cast as an enemy to Indian and Pakistani Muslims</a> <a style="color: #ff0000;" href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/modi-government-initiates-steps-to-check-isis-spread-in-india/articleshow/50089249.cms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and ISIS</a>, so <a style="color: #ff0000;" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/associate-of-isis-suspect-discussed-targeting-pm-modi-gujarat-anti-terrorism-squad-chargesheet-1850500" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the jihadis would like to bathe in his blood</a> (or whatever it is they do after a satisfying kill). And since <a style="color: #ff0000;" href="https://qz.com/india/1080927/did-pakistan-help-north-korea-develop-nuclear-weapons-india-us-japan-want-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pakistan supposedly helped North Korea build their nukes</a>, Modi’s death from a Pakistani / North Korean warhead could trigger the India versus Pakistan element of World War 3.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>&gt; Michel Temer of Brazil &#8211;</strong> His assassination at the G20 would open the door for Brazil’s China-supported Leftist Establishment to bring Lula back to stop or impede President-elect Jair Bolsonaro.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>&gt; Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) and/or King Salman of Saudi Arabia &#8211;</strong> MBS has been cast as an enemy of the “US Deep State” and an existential threat to the petrodollar, so both the Saudi and US “Deep States” supposedly want him out of the way. Killing him at the G20 would directly solve the problem; killing his father would remove his biggest supporter, leading to his fall from power; and killing both him and his father would solve the current problem and prevent any future problems. It would be back to business as usual for the US-Saudi cabal.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>&gt; Moon Jae In of South Korea &#8211;</strong> Killing him at the G20 would throw a monkey wrench in the North-South Korean peace process, and doing it with a nuke or other WMD supposedly sourced from North Korea would flat out kill the peace process and bring on war.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>&gt; Giuseppe Conte of Italy &#8211;</strong> As the new “anti-Establishment, populist” leader of Italy, Conte supposedly poses an existential threat to the European Establishment’s EU and Euro projects, as well as their Islamic invasion plan. So they would supposedly like him to “sleep with the fishes” in the Rio de La Plata.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>POSSIBLE TARGETS</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>&gt; Macron, May and Merkel &#8211;</strong> From the perspective of the European Establishment, all three of these leaders are supposedly damaged goods, so their deaths at the G20 could serve the purpose of generating public sympathy for them and their Establishment parties. And from the perspective of the real globalist agenda, moving them off the board would open the way for populists to surge into power (which is what the globalists actually want at this stage of The Plan).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>&gt; Tusk and Juncker &#8211;</strong> From the perspective of the European Establishment, their deaths would be another sacrifice of damaged goods for public sympathy towards the EU.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>LIKELY SCAPEGOATS</strong> (according to the mainstream narrative)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">&gt; Iran</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">&gt; Qasem Soleimani of Iran</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">&gt; Hezbollah (most likely), Hezbollah posing as ISIS, Al Qaeda and/or ISIS</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>LIKELY MODES OF ATTACK</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">One or more advanced “Iranian” drone aircraft or a sub, mini-sub, or swimmer delivery vehicle carrying one of the following&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">&gt; conventional explosives and shrapnel (which will actually be theatrical explosives)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">&gt; chemical, biological, or radiological agents (fake ones)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">&gt; a “North Korean” nuke supposedly given to Iran (real, but not from North Korea or Iran)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The nuke option is unlikely if Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey shows up to the Summit. It is doubtful that the globalists will remove him from the board this early (he still has much to do in playing his role), so his attendance would likely mean a nuclear attack isn’t planned. But should something happen in Turkey that prevents him from attending, the nuke option is definitely on the table.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Going back a moment to the oil embargo and the Iranians, have a look at this pictorial standoff between Trump and the globalists&#8217; &#8220;Imam Mahdi&#8221;&#8230;</span><br />

<h1 style="text-align: center;">The Setup for the Trump / Putin Assassinations<br />
in Paris and Buenos Aires</h1>
<p><strong>(9 November 2018) &#8211;</strong> Tomorrow, I’ll post the assassination setup for Paris and Buenos Aires. As anticipated, these are the narratives they’ll use if they pull the trigger&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>the mainstream narrative</strong> (which will immediately follow the op): <em>“Iranian intelligence and their Hezbollah terror proxies conducted the assassinations of Trump and Putin to strike back against Trump’s crushing Iran policy and prevent Putin from pushing them out of Syria.”</em></li>
<li><strong>the controlled alt-media / NWO narrative</strong> (which will emerge after the mainstream narrative is released): <em>“It was Netanyahu who ordered the assassinations and the Mossad which carried them out. They did it to prevent unacceptable sacrifices from being forced upon them by the soon-to-be released Trump Middle East peace plan and to move Putin out of the way of their plans for Syria.”</em></li>
</ul>
<p>In the morning, I’ll show you the preparatory work they did to set up these narratives. I&#8217;ll also show you the recent narrative shifts that suggest Buenos Aires is the preferred strike point (although both strike points remain in play).</p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>(10 November 2018) &#8211;</strong> </span>Let me preface my remarks by telling new readers that the globalists control both sides in the current political drama: both the “Establishment” side (Obama, Clinton, Soros, the Bilderbergers, the mainstream media, etc.) and the “Anti-Establishment” side (Trump, Le Pen, Putin, the BRICS, the alternative media, etc.). They are deliberately staging a dialectic conflict between these two controlled fronts in order to implode their existing “Establishment” and erect a new one (the New World Order) in its place. That is the true narrative of what’s going on in our world today.</p>
<p>What I’ll be covering in the writings that follow are the specific events and false narratives they’re attempting to use in moving us into the NWO. Since there are two controlled sides to the staged conflict, there are two false narratives the globalists are spinning: 1) the mainstream narrative is the Establishment-side propaganda they sell to the sleepers, and 2) the alt-media narrative is the Anti-Establishment-side propaganda they sell to those who are awakening. They want you to come to see the mainstream narrative as a lie and the alt-media narrative as the truth. That’s because today’s alt-media will be the mainstream media of the New World Order.</p>
<p>That being said, what we might observe in the assassination of Trump and Putin in Paris is a stage play being put on for the public, and it is being done for 3 major reasons&#8230;</p>
<ol>
<li>to start the “Darkness before the Dawn” phase of the globalist plan, in which it appears that the “evil Western Establishment” will win and complete their “unilateral New World Order,”</li>
<li>to set in motion the “Gog/Magog War” and the first “Battle of Armageddon” in Israel in accordance with the plans of the Chabad-Lubavitch cult, which is managing the “End Times” show for the globalists, and</li>
<li>to fake the deaths of Trump and Putin so they can be “resurrected” as religious icons during the “Dawn of a New Day” phase of the plan.</li>
</ol>
<p>So here is how they&#8217;re setting it up&#8230;</p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">When attempting to blame someone for a crime (whether in court or in the public eye), it is necessary to establish their <strong>means</strong>, <strong>motive</strong>, and <strong>opportunity</strong> (MMO) to commit the offense. And it certainly helps your case if you can point to <strong>previous offenses</strong> of a similar nature perpetrated by the accused. So let’s look at how the globalists have established the MMO and previous offenses for both Iran/Hezbollah and Netanyahu/Mossad in relation to a possible assassination of Trump and Putin in Paris.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Iran and Hezbollah’s MMO for the Paris Assassinations</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>MEANS &#8211;</strong> To commit an assassination, you need one or more weapons and one or more assassins within striking distance of the target. As a nation-state, Iran has access to a broad array of military weapons, including drone aircraft, military-grade explosives, and possibly a few nukes (transferred from their “proliferation partners” North Korea). And when it comes to having assassins within striking distance of the target, the press have narrated their presence in France&#8230;</span><br />
<span style="color: #333333;"><a style="color: #333333;" href="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/zahra1110.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8048" src="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/zahra1110.png" alt="" width="584" height="286" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/zahra1110.png 584w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/zahra1110-300x147.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px" /></a></span><br />
<span style="color: #333333;">&#8230;from the <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/French-police-raid-Shia-Islamic-center-in-counter-terrorism-operation-568461" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jerusalem Post</a>. Here is an excerpt&#8230;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> &#8220;This is a counter-terrorism operation,&#8221; read a statement from the prefect&#8217;s office.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">&#8220;The activities of Centre Zahra France are under particularly close watch given its leaders&#8217; clear support for several terrorist organizations and movements espousing ideas contrary to (French) republican values,&#8221; it added.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The Centre has ties to <strong>Hezbollah and Iranian cells in France</strong>, Le Monde reported, and has been a source of &#8220;virulent anti-Zionist propaganda.&#8221; <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>So Iran and Hezbollah&#8217;s MEANS to assassinate Trump and Putin has been publicly established.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>MOTIVE &#8211;</strong> Iran’s motive to assassinate Trump should be crystal clear to everyone: <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2018/may/08/iran-nuclear-deal-donald-trump-latest-live-updates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he broke the nuclear deal, then restarted economic sanctions on them</a>. And just five days ago, <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46092435" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he started an active attempt to block all Iranian oil sales</a>. So if Trump were to die, Iran can reasonably expect the US to drop the sanctions and go back to the nuclear deal at some point, but only if some group other than Iran takes the blame for killing Trump &#8212; some group like ISIS.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">As for their supposed motive to assassinate Putin, it was established a few months ago&#8230;</span><br />
<span style="color: #333333;"><a style="color: #333333;" href="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/iranout1110.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8050" src="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/iranout1110.png" alt="" width="885" height="324" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/iranout1110.png 885w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/iranout1110-300x110.png 300w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/iranout1110-768x281.png 768w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/iranout1110-624x228.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 885px) 100vw, 885px" /></a></span><br />
<span style="color: #333333;">&#8230;from <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.haaretz.com/world-news/.premium-trump-and-putin-agree-that-iran-needs-to-pull-out-of-syria-1.6387415" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Haaretz</a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The mainstream narrative will say that Iran was worried that with the Syria War all but won, their ally Putin might sell them out to get a deal with the West that is more favorable for Russia. They therefore moved to take Putin down before that could happen. And with Putin dead, Iran can reasonably expect Medvedev to shy away from further conflict in the region, but only if some group other than Iran takes the blame for killing Putin &#8212; some group like ISIS.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>So Iran and Hezbollah’s MOTIVE to assassinate Trump and Putin has been publicly established, as has their motive to have their assassins pose as ISIS to deflect blame away from Tehran.</strong> It is for this reason that ISIS might be the first to be blamed for the attack, but the Western intelligence agencies and mainstream media will soon after identify Iran and Hezbollah as the “true perpetrators.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>OPPORTUNITY &#8211;</strong> France’s President Emmanuel Macron is a Rothschild minion <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron#Investment_banker" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who previously worked as managing director for Rothschild &amp; Cie Banque</a>. As such, he is the quintessential embodiment of the “Western Satanic Establishment” that supposedly opposes the “Anti-Establishment” Trump and the “Traitor to the Western NWO” Putin. According to the globalist script, this makes Establishment-controlled Paris a very dangerous place for the two to visit, since the French need only open a security hole to allow others to strike them down.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">On top of this, <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.garda.com/crisis24/news-alerts/173836/france-anti-trump-demonstration-in-paris-nov-11" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demonstrations are planned for the 11th</a> and there is an <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.garda.com/crisis24/news-alerts/173426/france-further-ambulance-protests-expected-in-paris-update-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ongoing protest by Paris ambulance drivers</a> that can be used to create distracting chaos and gridlock to cover an assassination attempt.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>So Iran and Hezbollah’s OPPORTUNITY to assassinate Trump and Putin has been publicly established.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Beyond Iran and Hezbollah’s MMO, the globalists have also publicly established <strong>PREVIOUS OFFENSES</strong> on their part by staging takedowns of “Iranian assassination attempts” in Paris and Denmark in the last six months&#8230;</span><br />

<p><span style="color: #333333;">And in keeping with the overall assassination script, Iran is blaming the Mossad for these events, claiming they are false-flags meant to defame Iran and sabotage their foreign relations.</span></p>

<span style="color: #333333;">&#8230;from <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.axios.com/trump-pressure-netanyahu-middle-east-peace-deal-50dcb4a8-a8ba-49ab-8541-ffbb5febb125.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Axios</a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Since Trump will demand that Netanyahu give up some things “for peace” that Netanyahu has vowed to never give up, Trump’s trips to Paris and Buenos Aires this month represent &#8220;the last two off-ramps” before Trump goes from being an asset to Israel to being a liability. In other words, <strong>Trump’s peace plan will never see the light of day if he’s dead before December. This is Netanyahu’s motive.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">And Netanyahu’s motive for killing Putin? That is provided by Putin’s blocking of Israel’s plans for Syria, most recently by providing the Syrians with the S-300 air defense system. Should Putin die this month, Netanyahu can count on the “Atlantic Integrationist” Medvedev to let the West (and Israel) have their way in Syria.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Needless to say, Israel’s desire to not be squashed like a bug by America and Russia provides their motive to pin the assassination on Iran, Qasem Soleimani, and Hezbollah. But in the end, the script calls for their culpability to be established, and the “Gog/Magog War” against Israel will be the result.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>OPPORTUNITY &#8211;</strong> Netanyahu/Mossad’s opportunity to assassinate Trump and Putin in Paris is the same as Iran/Hezbollah’s.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>PREVIOUS OFFENSES &#8211;</strong> Israel has a <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Israeli_assassinations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long, well-known history of conducting large numbers of political assassinations</a>. This includes the assassination of Mahmoud Al-Mabhouh, which was supposedly organized by their Paris branch.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Up until a few weeks ago, Paris had everything going for it to be the strike point for the assassinations, including <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/11/09/spooky-skull-shaped-halloween-death-comet-to-speed-past-us-in-october-7986903/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an ominous “death comet” that will passing by the Earth on the 11th</a>. But the globalists have changed the narrative from <em>“Trump and Putin will hold a substantive meeting in Paris”</em> to <em>“Trump and Putin will hold a short meeting in Paris before a more substantive meeting in Buenos Aires”</em> to <em>“Trump and Putin will NOT meet in Paris, but will have a summit in Buenos Aires.”</em> This seems to indicate the globalists moving the focus to Buenos Aires.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">If you pair this change of focus with the fact that Buenos Aires provides the globalists with the opportunity to script the killing of four of the Avatars (Trump, Putin, Xi and Modi) in one attack, you begin to see why Buenos Aires may be the preferred strike point. To understand what I mean by “Avatars,” scroll down this page to the Compendium. It contains a section titled <em>“Xi Jinping’s assassination, the globalist prophecy fulfillment plan for the Indians and the Chinese, and the 5 Avatars”</em> that will satisfy your curiosity.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Now here are some of my previous writings on the Paris assassination scenario, starting with an alternative scripting in which the “Deep State” and Mossad frame Putin as the murderer of Trump&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>(Expanded Note &#8211; 13 September 2018) &#8211;</strong> It looks like the globalists are scripting-in a Russian angle for the 11/11 Trump assassination show in Paris&#8230;</span><br />

<span style="color: #333333;">&#8230;from <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-09-13/us-impose-very-severe-sanctions-russia-over-skripal-case" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zero Hedge</a>. Here’s an excerpt&#8230;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> <strong>The sanctions will kick in some time in November, presumably just after the November midterms</strong>, if Moscow does not take steps in the wake of the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal in the United Kingdom, Assistant Secretary of State Manisha Singh said on Thursday. <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">So if you add these new Russian sanctions that kick in right after the midterms to the Iranian oil embargo that kicks in the day before the election, you have scripted motivations for both Russia and Iran to kill Trump while he&#8217;s exposed in Paris on November 11. That being said, an “Iranian” drone carrying a “Russian” WMD would fit the assassination show objectives quite nicely. In the aftermath of the hit, the WMD will probably be identified as Novichok or polonium-210, both of which have supposedly been used by Russia to assassinate Russian dissidents in the UK.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">[10 September 2018 &#8211; I wrote the above section before I knew that Putin would be coming to Paris too. Since he&#8217;ll be there, the globalists could skip the drone attack and merely have Trump suddenly fall ill. If the doctors announce the illness was caused by Novichok or polonium poisoning, who will get the initial blame? Putin and his entourage, right? But who will ultimately be blamed? <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/netanyahu-heads-to-paris-conference-meeting-with-putin-not-set-up-yet-1.6637380" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Netanyahu and his entourage, who will also be in Paris</a>.]</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">The Globalist Plan for Trump&#8217;s Assassination in Paris</h3>
<p><strong>(29 August 2018) &#8211;</strong> I’ve sussed-out the narratives they&#8217;ve prepared for Trump&#8217;s &#8220;death&#8221; in Paris on 11/11.</p>
<p><strong>In the mainstream narrative</strong>, they’ll blame in on Iranian terror cells in Paris motivated by Trump’s oil embargo.</p>
<p><strong>In the alt-media narrative</strong>, it will be identified as a false-flag operation carried out by the US “Deep State” and Mossad through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Mujahedin_of_Iran" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MEK</a> proxies.</p>
<p><strong>(30-31 August 2018) &#8211;</strong> To show you how I came to the conclusions I mentioned in yesterday’s note, have a look at this Israeli article about the foiled “Iranian” terror bombing in Paris two months ago&#8230;<br />
<a href="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/mossparis830.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7653" src="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/mossparis830.png" alt="" width="504" height="261" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/mossparis830.png 504w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/mossparis830-300x155.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 504px) 100vw, 504px" /></a><br />
&#8230;from <a href="https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5313291,00.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ynet News</a>. Here are some key preparatory propaganda points it features&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> Mossad agents uncovered intelligence about an alleged Iranian plan to bomb the annual National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) rally in the town of Villepinte, a northern suburb of Paris, on June 30.</p>
<p>According to Channel 2 News, the attack was thwarted thanks to <strong>cooperation between Israel, Germany, France and Belgium</strong>&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Iran has said it had nothing to do with the plot, which it called as a “false flag” operation staged by figures within the NCRI</strong>, an umbrella bloc of opposition exiles that seek an end to almost 40 years of Shi’ite Muslim clerical rule in Iran&#8230; <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>So if the bombing attempt was a false-flag as the Iranians claim &#8212; and it was &#8212; the article tells you who carried it out: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Council_of_Resistance_of_Iran" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NCRI</a> / <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Mujahedin_of_Iran" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MEK</a>, the Mossad, German Intelligence, French Intelligence, and Belgian / EU Intelligence.</p>
<p>Moving on to the next point&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> <strong>The People’s Mujahideen Organization of Iran is the main component of NCRI</strong>. The group, also known by its Persian name <strong>M</strong>ujahideen-<strong>e</strong>&#8211;<strong>K</strong>halq, <strong>was once listed as a terrorist organization by the United States and the European Union but not since 2012</strong>&#8230; <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Now can you guess who was responsible for taking the MEK off the Western terror lists?&#8230;<br />

&#8230;from <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-usa-idUSBRE88P0B420120926" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reuters</a></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Hillary removed MEK from the terror lists to facilitate their movement from a US base in Iraq (<a style="color: #333333;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_Liberty" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Camp Liberty</a>) to a new terrorist training base in Europe (Albania)&#8230;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> In 2013, Secretary of State <strong>Hillary Clinton pragmatically removed the MEK from the US terrorism list to allow members to be sent to third countries so that Iraq could be rid of them. European countries would not take them because of their terrorist past. Instead, the Albanian government agreed to take them</strong> only on the promise that a de-radicalization institute be established to reintegrate the extremists back into society.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">This did not happen. The allocated budget, lodged with the American embassy in Tirana, has not been touched. Instead, after Donald Trump became president and set about dismantling every detail of Barack Obama’s legacy, the MEK were “allowed” to regroup.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Regrouping meant that the MEK would continue to call for violent regime change against Iran, backed by US extremists like <strong>Rudi Giuliani</strong> and <strong>John Bolton</strong> <strong>who now occupy influential posts in the Trump administration</strong>. As a result, Albania has become a front-line enemy state in relation to Iran.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Regrouping also meant re-enslaving members, who are not paid and have no human rights. <strong>It also meant building a closed camp in a remote part of the country to which Albanian authorities and security services have no access.</strong> As though Albania wasn’t having a hard time already cracking down on criminal and mafia gangs, <strong>now the MEK are implicated in criminal activity. Among several individuals arrested for money laundering last month, two Israelis were found to be associated with FARA NGO.

<p><span style="color: #333333;">And as an added convenience to the assassination plan, the MEK also have a headquarters in Paris&#8230;</span><br />

<span style="color: #333333;">&#8230;from <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Mujahedin_of_Iran" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia</a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">To further see the covert connections between the MEK and the US “Deep State” and Mossad, have a look at <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/our-men-in-iran" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this 2012 Seymour Hersh article in <em>The New Yorker</em></a>. Here are some key sections&#8230;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> From the air, the terrain of the Department of Energy’s Nevada National Security Site, with its arid high plains and remote mountain peaks, has the look of northwest Iran. The site, some sixty-five miles northwest of Las Vegas, was once used for nuclear testing, and now includes a counterintelligence training facility&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>It was here that the Joint Special Operations Command (jsoc) conducted training, beginning in 2005, for members of the Mujahideen-e-Khalq, a dissident Iranian opposition group known in the West as the M.E.K.</strong>&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Five Iranian nuclear scientists have been assassinated since 2007. M.E.K. spokesmen have denied any involvement in the killings, but early last month NBC News quoted two senior Obama Administration officials as confirming that <strong>the attacks were carried out by M.E.K. units that were financed and trained by Mossad, the Israeli secret service</strong>. NBC further quoted the Administration officials as denying any American involvement in the M.E.K. activities. The former senior intelligence official I spoke with seconded the NBC report that <strong>the Israelis were working with the M.E.K., adding that the operations benefitted from American intelligence</strong>. <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p>The MEK have the fingerprints of the “Western” intelligence agencies, the Mossad, and Hillary Clinton all over them. So after they “assassinate” Trump and are finally identified as the culprits, the trail would lead straight to the scripted “bad guys” in the globalist drama: the US “Deep State” and the Israeli Zionists.</p>
<p>According to the script, the Deep State will want him dead because the Democrats will have failed to retake Congress in the election, thus preventing an impeachment. And the Zionists will want him dead because he will have <a href="http://www.israelhayom.com/2018/08/21/report-trump-to-introduce-mideast-peace-plan-at-%E2%80%8Eun-general-assembly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced his “unacceptable” Middle East peace plan at the UN General Assembly on September 25</a>.</p>
<p>As for the likely mode of a Paris assassination, it will be the same as was planned for the now-cancelled Washington military parade: an Israeli-fashioned, explosives-laden “Iranian” drone attack. A WMD strike is also a possibility, but since the globalists preserved Paris during WWII, I think it unlikely they’ll destroy it now. It is one of their playground cities. I’m sure the croissant are to die for.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;">Globalist Outcome &amp; Scripting Options<br />
for the Midterms Tomorrow</h1>
<p><strong>(5 November 2018) &#8211;</strong> Well the midterm elections are just a day away now, so let’s have a look at the results we might see and the ways the globalists will weaponize those results.</p>
<p>There are three possible outcomes tomorrow: 1) the Republicans keep both the House and the Senate, 2) the Republicans keep the Senate, but lose the House, and 3) the Democrats take both the House and the Senate.</p>
<p><strong>OUTCOME 1, the Republicans keep both the House and the Senate, is the most likely to transpire.</strong> It would lead to profound exasperation and anger among the Democrats, which the globalists could channel into “open warfare” against Trump. <em>“We must stop Trump RIGHT NOW and BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY,”</em> they’ll say, <em>“or there will be 2 to 6 more years of Trump Nazism that our democracy, and all the progress we’ve made, won’t survive.”</em></p>
<p>As part of the “By Any Means Necessary Campaign,&#8221; some or all of the following things will occur&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>the Democratic candidates who lose by small margins in states with Republican election officials will scream “stolen election!”</li>
<li>the Democrats in the Executive Branch and Congress will push hard for impeachment, possibly on charges related to the Khashoggi killing or the Mueller investigation,</li>
<li>the Soros crowd will fund violent protests in Democrat-run cities where local officials will let them run wild, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/oct/14/ted-wheeler-portland-mayor-stands-decision-allow-a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like they have in Portland</a>,</li>
<li>the “Neocon-Neolib Deep State” will go all out to assassinate Trump, starting this month during his trips to Paris and Buenos Aires.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>OUTCOME 2, the Republicans keep the Senate, but lose the House, is the second most likely outcome.</strong> This outcome would lead to Republicans being relieved over retaining the Senate and Democrats being happy over taking the House, and it could indicate that the globalists are delaying the start of the Big Crisis till some time next year.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">As for scripting options, we could see the Congress enter a next-level version of gridlock in which the House and Senate can agree on very little. We would also likely see the House passing articles of impeachment at some point (<a style="color: #333333;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment#United_States" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it takes a simple majority vote</a>, and the Democrats would have that majority).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Should the globalists wish to supersize the drama, though, we could see the Democrats claiming that some Senate races were stolen and/or the Republicans claiming some House races were stolen. In the latter case, Chinese influence operations, illegal campaign contributions, and/or hacking may be blamed, and rank-and-file Democrats would see such allegations as “Trump trying to overturn the election results and consolidate power.” If this option is chosen, we’d be on track for a major sh*tstorm in late December and early January before the new Congress convenes.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>OUTCOME 3, the Democrats take both the House and the Senate, is the least likely election result.</strong> I say this because it would almost certainly require the globalists to play the “Chinese Hack” card, and that card was publicly exposed weeks ago. Since they didn’t use it in Brazil and they scripted a solid Bolsonaro victory, they’ll probably do the same in the midterms for Trump.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">If you are a new reader, you can read about the Chinese Hack by scrolling down this page till you see the <span style="color: #ff0000;">red text</span>.</span></p>
<p>In the next addition, we&#8217;ll look at the new Iran sanctions, the European Special Purpose Vehicle, and how it all connects to Paris and Buenos Aires.</p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>(P.S. &#8211; 6 November 2018 &#8211; 1:54 PM CST) &#8211;</strong> I’ve already seen <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-11-06/chaos-voting-machine-malfunctions-and-staggering-wait-times-plague-midterms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a report of malfunctioning voting machines</a>, and it got me thinking of another way the globalists can play the Chinese Hack card: by sabotaging Democratic candidates instead of Republicans, then claiming the problems were the result of Republican skullduggery, possibly &#8220;with Russian help.&#8221; I’m mentioning it now just in case&#8230;</span></p>
<h3><strong>(Expanded Note &#8211; 2-4 November 2018) &#8211; The potential of an assassination show at the G20</strong></h3>
<p><strong>(2 November 2018) &#8211;</strong> There’s an interesting assassination play shaping up for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_G20_Buenos_Aires_summit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">G20 Summit at the end of the month</a>. Get a load of this&#8230;<br />

&#8230;from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/01/world/americas/brazil-judge-lula-bolsonaro.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The New York Times</a></p>
<p>This development creates the appearance of a quid-pro-quo arrangement between Bolsonaro and the judge (it can be claimed the judge improperly convicted Lula in exchange for a promised cabinet post in Bolsonaro’s government).</p>
<p>This being the case, should the globalists do their assassination show at the G20 Summit instead of Paris, they can not only script the “Western Satanists’ assassination of the Avatars” (Trump, Putin, Xi, and Modi), but also script a leftist takedown of Bolsonaro (&#8220;Brazil&#8217;s Donald Trump&#8221;) by removing Brazil&#8217;s President Temer from the board.</p>
<p>Under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_presidential_line_of_succession" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brazil’s rules of presidential succession</a>, an assassination of Temer at the G20 would allow Brazil’s National Congress to elect a new president to finish out his term. And that means they could elect Lula (if his second appeal meets with success in November or December) or someone else who could pardon Lula. Either way, a free Lula could be combined with a leftist uprising to demand a new presidential election under threat of civil war.</p>
<p>It’s a clever play, but hopefully this early exposure will nix it. Just to be sure, I&#8217;ll give it a double-tap before the G20 Summit convenes.</p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>(3 November 2018) &#8211;</strong> Now allow me to cover this scenario in more depth by looking at its different components, beginning with&#8230;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>The Replacement President Component</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The setup for the Temer assassination show started with the impeachment and removal of Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff on August 31, 2016. On that day, Vice President Michel Temer rose to the presidency, leaving the office of Vice President vacant. So if Temer gets killed at the G20 this month, there would be a <strong>double vacancy</strong> in the offices of president and vice president, which triggers the following constitutional process in Brazil&#8230;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> Should a President die, resign or be removed from office, a Vice-President succeeds as President.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The other officers in the line of succession do not become President in those cases. Instead, the next available person in line merely becomes Acting President, and <strong>the Constitution dictates that, whenever both the presidency and the vice-presidency become vacant, new elections are to be held. So in the case of an Acting President taking office due to a double vacancy in the presidency and vice-presidency, the Acting President serves only until the special election takes place and the newly elected President and Vice-President are sworn-in.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>If the second vacancy triggering elections takes place in the last two years of the presidential term, the National Congress is empowered and required to elect the President (and his Vice-President).</strong> If the double vacancy of the presidency and vice-presidency takes place in the first half of the four-year presidential term, however, a presidential election by popular vote is held.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">In any event, <strong>the President and Vice-President so elected merely finish what remains of the pending presidential term</strong>, and thereafter a new President and a new Vice-President, chosen in the regular general elections, take office for a normal four-year term. <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong> &#8211; from <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_presidential_line_of_succession" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia</a></span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">So following the “death” of Temer, the President of the Chamber of Deputies (Rodrigo Maia) would become the momentary Acting President until a replacement President can be elected. And since the double vacancy would happen during the last two years of the current presidential term, the National Congress would elect the replacement.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Since the replacement President would have less than a month in office before Bolsonaro is inaugurated on January 1, he or she would only have time to do something simple (like pardoning Lula). So Lula is the next component we’ll look at.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><em>More to come over the course of the weekend, including coverage of the assassination show setup in Paris and the imminent implementation of the US oil export embargo on Iran (which is scripted to provide the Iranians with the motivation to assassinate Trump in Paris or at the G20, even though they won’t be the ones doing it).</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>The Lula Component</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">To acquaint you with the current situation of Luiz Inacio <strong>Lula</strong> da Silva, a popular former President of Brazil who held office from 2003 &#8211; 2010, here is <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luiz_In%C3%A1cio_Lula_da_Silva" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a passage from Wikipedia</a>&#8230;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> On 12 July 2017, he was convicted of money laundering and passive corruption, defined in Brazilian criminal law as the receipt of a bribe by a civil servant or government official. <strong>Lula was sentenced to nine years and six months in prison by judge Sergio Moro</strong>, but he remained free pending an appeal of the sentence. On 24 January 2018, the Regional Federal Court of the 4th Region, which is a panel of three appellate judges, unanimously upheld Moro&#8217;s ruling against Lula and increased the sentence to 12 years. On 5 April 2018, the Supreme Federal Court voted to reject Lula&#8217;s habeas corpus plea and on the same day a warrant was issued for his arrest. He turned himself in and began serving his sentence on 7 April 2018.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Lula announced his candidacy for the 2018 presidential election, but he was disqualified from running under Brazil&#8217;s &#8220;Clean Record&#8221; law</strong> by the Superior Electoral Court on 31 August 2018 and was replaced by Fernando Haddad on 11 September 2018. The United Nations Human Rights Committee requested that the Brazilian government allow Lula to exercise his political rights as a presidential candidate. <strong>Prior to being barred, Lula led all scenarios in polls for the October election</strong>, achieving 39 percent in voter intentions within one month of the first round. <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">So Lula is the leftist candidate who supposedly would have won the recent Brazilian presidential election if he hadn’t been sidelined by a corruption conviction. And now that Bolsonaro has tapped the judge who convicted Lula for a cabinet post in his administration, an appearance of impropriety has been created that could lead to Lula’s conviction being vacated or pardoned&#8230;</span><br />

<span style="color: #333333;">&#8230;from <a style="color: #333333;" href="http://www.cadenagramonte.cu/english/show/articles/28607:lawyers-demand-impartial-and-fair-trial-for-lula-in-brazil" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cadenagramonte.cu</a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">This provides the globalist scriptwriters with two ways of scripting the Brazilian “left’s” attempt to overturn the election of Brazil’s Donald Trump&#8230;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">They can script the overturning of Lula’s conviction before the National Congress holds the post-assassination election of Temer’s replacement, thus allowing them to elect Lula.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">They can script the National Congress electing a replacement President who will pardon Lula in December, before Bolsonaro takes office.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">And as I said yesterday, a free Lula could be combined with a leftist uprising to demand a new presidential election under threat of civil war. Such a strategy was already previewed in the press before Bolsonaro made his questionable appointment of Lula’s judge&#8230;</span><br />

<span style="color: #333333;">&#8230;from the <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://mg.co.za/article/2018-11-01-brazilian-left-reels-as-country-lurches-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mail &amp; Guardian</a>. Here is the relevant excerpt&#8230;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> “Lula-ism is bigger than the PT. <strong>The party has the backing of organised labour and social movements, but Lula has the support of the mass of society, the poorest people in Brazil</strong>,” said Ricardo Musse, a sociologist at the University of Sao Paulo.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">“The PT isn’t a homogeneous party… There will be a sector that will try to ditch Lula, another that <strong>will lead the political opposition (to Bolsonaro)</strong>&#8230; and another that <strong>will drive social resistance with street protests</strong>.” <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Also note the blurb below the photo; they are using the same “resistance” wording the American “left” has used against Trump, and “Not Him” is reminiscent of “Never Trump.” As I&#8217;ve said before, the globalists are using this &#8220;leftist chaos that pushes people to the right&#8221; template all over the place at both the national and global levels.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The next component we’ll look at is the Bolsonaro / National Congress relationship.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>The Bolsonaro / National Congress Relationship Component</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>(4 November 2018) &#8211;</strong> The relationship between President-Elect Bolsonaro and the National Congress has been narrated as being tense. Bolsonaro once said that <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2018/11/election-of-bolsonaro-likely-to-test-democracy-in-brazil-and-beyond/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">if he were ever elected President, he would shut down the National Congress on his first day</a>. And <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-brazilian-candidate-bolsonaro-scolds-son-for-threatening-to-shut-down/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">back in July, his son threatened a shutdown of the Supreme Court</a>. If you add to that <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2018/11/01/president-elect-bolsonaro-to-brazils-bureaucrats-youre-fired/#7f040b726137" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bolsonaro’s expressed intention to fire many of the government’s bureaucrats</a>, you get a situation in which those institutions and their members (the current Brazilian &#8220;Establishment&#8221;) see Bolsonaro as an existential threat.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">On top of that, there is the matter of pervasive corruption in the National Congress. <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/brazils-political-class-is-in-crisis-as-over-100-are-investigated-for-corruption/2017/04/12/d2832a8a-1f7e-11e7-bb59-a74ccaf1d02f_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In last year’s corruption purge, 66 senators and representatives went under the microscope</a>. And Bolsonaro’s appointment of Lula’s convicting judge to the post of justice minister signals a massive corruption purge will occur after the January 1 inauguration.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">That being the case, the corrupt members of the current Congress have less than two months before the new corruption crusade begins and new pro-Bolsonaro congresspersons take office and shift the balance of power. This provides motivation for them to do anything possible to stop Bolsonaro, including assassinating Temer and electing or pardoning Lula.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">It is important to note that Argentina is hosting the G20 Summit this year, and they share a common border with Brazil. This makes the infiltration of a G20 hit team by the Brazilian “Deep State” a simple matter. So in the next section, we’ll look at all the potential G20 targets of the various “Deep States” as well as all the nations and groups that stand to be blamed if an attack happens.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>The Details of a Possible G20 False-Flag</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Here are the likely and possible targets, likely scapegoats, and likely modes of attack for a G20 “terrorist attack” scenario (I’ll flesh out all the details of this section in the coming hours / days / weeks)&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>LIKELY TARGETS</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>POSSIBLE TARGETS</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">&gt; Macron, May and Merkel of France, the UK, and Germany</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">&gt; Tusk and Juncker of the European Union</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>LIKELY SCAPEGOATS</strong> (according to the mainstream narrative)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">&gt; Iran</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">&gt; Qasem Soleimani of Iran</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">&gt; Hezbollah (most likely), Hezbollah posing as ISIS, Al Qaeda and/or ISIS</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>LIKELY MODES OF ATTACK</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">One or more advanced “Iranian” drone aircraft or a sub, mini-sub, or swimmer delivery vehicle carrying one of the following&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">&gt; conventional explosives and shrapnel (which will actually be theatrical explosives)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">&gt; chemical, biological, or radiological agents (fake ones)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">&gt; a “North Korean” nuke supposedly given to Iran (real, but not from North Korea or Iran)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The nuke option is unlikely if Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey shows up to the Summit. It is doubtful that the globalists will remove him from the board this early (he still has much to do in playing his role), so his attendance would likely mean a nuclear attack isn’t planned. But should something happen in Turkey that prevents him from attending, the nuke option is definitely on the table.</span></p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;">Notes on the Brazilian Election</h1>
<p><strong>(27 October 2018) &#8211;</strong> The second round of the Brazilian presidential election takes place tomorrow, so let’s look at a couple of things before it begins.</p>
<p>First, the polls are predicting a Bolsonaro victory&#8230;<br />
<a href="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bolsonwin1027.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7986" src="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bolsonwin1027.png" alt="" width="651" height="719" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bolsonwin1027.png 651w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bolsonwin1027-272x300.png 272w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bolsonwin1027-624x689.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 651px) 100vw, 651px" /></a><br />
&#8230;from <a href="https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2018/10/26/brazils-next-president-is-likely-to-be-jair-bolsonaro" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Economist</a></p>
<p>Second, the press are narrating Chinese unease with a Bolsonaro presidency&#8230;<br />
<a href="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bolsonchina1027.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7987" src="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bolsonchina1027.png" alt="" width="644" height="492" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bolsonchina1027.png 644w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bolsonchina1027-300x229.png 300w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bolsonchina1027-624x477.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px" /></a><br />
&#8230;from <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=bolsonaro+china" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google</a></p>
<p>So the stage is set for the scenario I outlined earlier this month: <strong>we’ll see either a Bolsonaro victory or a Chinese hack of the electronic voting machines</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>If Bolsonaro wins</strong>, the Republicans in the US will likely be scripted to sweep the midterms as well. And with the “far right” thus empowered and emboldened by the election results, we can expect the “far left” and the “Deep State” to go into “any means necessary” mode. Violence and assassinations by “desperate leftists” (paid globalist thugs and agents-provocateur) will follow, and a fake Putin-Trump assassination on 11/11 will be more likely.</p>
<p>But <strong>if Bolsonaro loses</strong>, the election hack drama could take a few months to unfold before the military steps in to put Bolsonaro in power. And a similar result and scandal in the US would make the 11/11 assassination show less likely and a big blowup in January (before the new Congress takes office) more likely.</p>
<p>On another note, look closely at the first round results on the Economist graph. Bolsonaro’s result was in keeping with the polls, but the leftist’s result was over 10 points less than predicted. This would seem to indicate that Bolsonaro’s supporters were more motivated to show up and vote than the leftist voters. Should we see a similar motivation disparity in the US midterms, the Democrats will not win the US House like the polls are predicting.</p>
<p>Now we just wait and see if the globalists play the “Chinese Hack” card.</p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>(28 October 2018) &#8211;</strong> Speaking of that, here&#8217;s another part of the setup for it&#8230;</span><br />

<span style="color: #333333;">&#8230;from <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/06/in-a-blow-to-e-voting-critics-brazil-suspends-use-of-all-paper-ballots/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ars Technica</a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">And as for who made the Brazilian voting machines, here is an excerpt from <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.wired.com/2004/01/for-brazil-voters-machines-rule/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Wired article</a> on the subject&#8230;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> Designed by the government, the machines were made by <strong>Unisys</strong> and <strong>ProComp, a Brazilian company since acquired by Diebold Election Systems</strong>. Though computer scientists in the United States have vociferously criticized Diebold&#8217;s machines for being vulnerable to tampering, Brazil&#8217;s urnas have generated mostly laudatory PR buzz.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Printers have been affixed to a small number of the machines, producing an auditable paper trail. That voting-machine model is &#8220;definitely the right idea,&#8221; said Dan Wallach, a computer science professor at Rice University. Wallach co-authored the first expert report criticizing Diebold, which launched the electronic-voting controversy on a wide scale in the United States&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Still, Brazil&#8217;s urnas are not infallible. Human, hardware and software failures led officials to discard results in a handful of cases in last year&#8217;s presidential election. And in what critics call a major setback to the movement for voting transparency, a new law approved in October will do away with printed e-voting receipts. <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Both companies that manufacture Brazil’s voting machines are American-owned, so where are the electronic components &amp; circuit boards inside the machines manufactured? Brazil, the US, or China? I’m betting the answer is China. If it&#8217;s not, they&#8217;ll blame the hack on the Brazilian leftists, &#8220;who received financial and technical support from the Chinese.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Here are some previous election-related updates to give you some background information on what&#8217;s coming&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>(23 September 2018) &#8211;</strong> It looks like they’re ramping up the drama going into this week. There are new, over-the-top allegations being brought against Supreme Court Nominee Kavanaugh, there are leftists protesters reportedly being bussed into Washington, and there’s also this&#8230;<br />

<p>More on all this later&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>(26 September 2018) &#8211; Pushing the Voters to the Right &amp; The “Mass Arrests” Rumor</strong></p>
<p>In past entries, I’ve talked about the globalist effort to shift people to the “political right” in preparation for the launch of the real &#8220;right-wing NWO” (the much publicized and feared “left-wing NWO” is just a decoy used to scare us to the right). And if you look at recent news, you can see some clear examples of this &#8220;push &#8217;em to the right&#8221; effort&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>&gt; The globalists are having the Democrats exhibit “Trump Derangement Syndrome” and conduct their over-the-top, easily disproven smear campaign on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh to push fair-minded people into the Trump camp.</strong> The Democrats’ blatantly unfair and sleazy attacks are meant to energize Trump’s base, push independents towards the Republicans, and disgust ordinary Democrats. So if you&#8217;ve found yourself yelling at your TV or PC over the unfairness of the allegations and press coverage, their strategy is working. Basically, the Democrats are smearing their way to an election loss, and they’re doing it because their bosses told them to.</p>
<p><strong>&gt; The globalists arranged for an ugly group of left-wing extremists to drive Senator Ted Cruz and his wife out of a Washington, DC restaurant yesterday.</strong> Cruz is in a tight race with a more charismatic Democrat, Beto O&#8217;Rourke, but Texans will think twice before voting for the challenger now. <em>“A vote for Beto is a vote for the left-wing thugs,”</em> is what they’ll be thinking.</p>
<p><strong>&gt; The globalists arranged for “Brazil’s Donald Trump,” Jair Bolsonaro, to be stabbed by a leftist</strong> (whether the stabbing was real or done with a theatrical knife, I haven’t examined). Since then, he has surged 10 points in the presidential polls.</p>
<p>Watch for more “left-wing lunacy” and over-the-top outrages as we approach the elections.</p>
<p>In my September 23 update, I mentioned the Kavanaugh news and the “mass arrests” article and said, “More on all this later&#8230;” Well, today is later, and what I’ve written above covers the Kavanaugh stuff. So here’s something I wrote earlier this year about the “mass arrests” scenario&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>To transition us happily into the NWO, the globalists are having their Western minions wear “dark hats” and play the role of the “bad guys,” and they’re having their Eastern minions wear “white hats” and play the role of the “good guys.” After having the “Western bad guys” push humanity to the seeming brink of nuclear destruction, they’ll have the “Eastern good guys,” led by Vladimir Putin, step up to save the day.</p>
<p>That being said, the globalists need to create a believable chain of events that will lead to the removal of the current “evil Western Establishment” and to their replacement by white hat globalist minions like Rand Paul, Nigel Farage, Marine Le Pen, etc. And <strong>there are two ways of getting rid of the old to make way for the new</strong>; I wrote about them last year…</p>
<p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> And come to think of it, <strong>an unexpected nuke strike on Washington</strong> while Congress is in town would be a good way for the globalists to “drain the swamp” of federal officialdom. It would save them all the trouble of <strong>mass-arresting them for pedophilia / corruption / racketeering / treason</strong>, and it would keep their mouths shut (because the bodies to which those mouths are attached would be dead). Look for Mike Pence, Rand Paul, and Elizabeth Warren to survive any such strike; they have roles to play in what happens afterwards. <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p>
<p>So the globalists have two options for “changing the guard” in the West: 1) blow them up, or <strong>2) “Mass Arrest” them and put them through Nuremberg-type show trials</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>(1 October 2018) &#8211; Why the globalists are making history repeat itself</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/wheelopain101.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7882" src="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/wheelopain101.png" alt="" width="468" height="216" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/wheelopain101.png 468w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/wheelopain101-300x138.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px" /></a></p>
<p>I’ve written extensively of the globalists’ plans to bring in the New World Order, make it look like heaven at first, make it look like hell later, and end it in such a way that the public will conclude that “we humans are incapable of ruling themselves; we need God do it.” They are doing this with the intention of providing us a “God” to do the job: THEIR “Jesus Christ,” who will defeat “the Anti-Christ Putin” and bring the world back to the “center,” with no more left-wing or right-wing extremism (because his bosses, the globalists, will no longer be organizing and funding such mischief).</p>
<p>Well in order to get people to come to the “we can’t rule ourselves” conclusion that will open the way for their god-like rule over us, they are deliberately repeating German World War 2 history on a global scale. They are having their “left-wing liberal internationalists / communists” bring chaos so their “right-wing conservative nationalists / capitalists” can restore order. And just like they did with Hitler, they will have their “right-wing” leaders become increasingly tyrannical after the NWO gets established.</p>
<p>Have a look at this bit of history and ask yourself if you see any parallels to today&#8230;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> In 1932, German President Paul von Hindenburg, old, tired, and a bit senile, had won re-election as president, but had lost a considerable portion of his <strong>right/conservative</strong> support to the Nazi Party. Those close to the president wanted a cozier relationship to Hitler and the Nazis&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As Hindenburg’s current chancellor could no longer gain a majority in the Reichstag, and <strong>Hitler could bring together a larger swath of the masses and a unified right / conservative / nationalist coalition</strong>, the president gave in. In January 1933, Hitler was named chancellor of Germany&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But that was not enough for Hitler either. In February 1933, <strong>Hitler blamed a devastating Reichstag fire on the communists</strong>&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Intimidation, and fear of the communists</strong>, brought Hitler a 90 percent majority. He was now, for all intents and purposes, dictator. &#8211; from <a href="https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/adolf-hitler-becomes-president-of-germany" target="_blank" rel="noopener">History.com</a> <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can see, the globalists are having us repeat history, and they’re doing it to convince us that we are perpetually stuck in cycles “that only God can break us out of.” The reality, though, is that these cycles are entirely artificial. They happen because we allow ourselves to be led around in circles by the carrots and sticks we are offered by our current influencers / controllers. The big drama that is unfolding in the world right now isn’t a natural occurrence; it is the result of a plan, as were WWI and WWII.</p>
<p>If you want God to deliver you from all this, you first need to look to “him,” so <strong>look in the mirror</strong>, <strong>look at the people right next to you</strong>, and look to all your hands for action, your mouths for speaking the truth, and your heads, hearts, and intuition for guidance &#8212; <a href="http://redefininggod.com/real-solutions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that’s from where your deliverance will come</a>. But one place to which you shouldn&#8217;t look is the trillion-dollar magic show that’s coming &#8212; that’s from where your continued enslavement will come. Enjoy the show, but don’t get sucked in by it. It&#8217;s just more Hollywood-style bullsh*t.</p>
<p>I almost feel sorry for the globalists. To work on this massive project for hundreds, if not thousands, of years only to have people see through it right before the final show begins &#8212; it must be heartbreaking. A thousand years from now, a free humanity will look back at the colossal folly of the Kabbalists and laugh at the sheer hubris and stupidity of what they tried to do. So laughter will be their only lasting legacy. I guess that’s not so bad after all.</p>
<p><strong>(2 October 2018) &#8211;</strong> A reader brought up an interesting point, so let me share my thoughts on it&#8230;</p>
<p>Currently, the polls in Brazil indicate that <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/28/reuters-america-brazils-left-presidential-candidate-haddad-beats-far-right-bolsonaro-poll.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the leftist Haddad would win over the rightist Bolsonaro in the second round of the presidential election</a>, just like the polls in the US indicate that <a href="https://www.axios.com/signs-of-a-blue-wave-midterms-0742c13a-c11d-4a90-9794-438bea036277.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Democrats will take control of the Congress</a>. But as I’ve said, the globalists are aiming to generate a backlash against the leftists so there will be a surprise conservative victory in both places.</p>
<p><strong>If the globalists go ahead with their plans and script the conservative victories to happen</strong>, the leftists will go bananas and take to the streets flinging feces in all directions. This will enable the domestic crackdowns to begin. It will also help establish the idea in the US that “the only alternative the Deep State and the leftists now have is to assassinate Trump,” which would set the stage for what happens in Paris.</p>
<p><strong>But if the globalists decide to hit the delay button again and script leftist victories</strong>, it means they’ll subject us to months if not years more of “leftist insanity,” which will greatly amplify the public backlash against the left and open the door for public acceptance of military coups to restore order.</p>
<p>The military coup in Brazil would involve expelling the leftists and installing Bolsonaro due to “widespread leftist election fraud.” That’s why we saw this in the news last week&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> Brazil’s far-right presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro said Friday he would only accept the result of next month’s election if he wins, suggesting that <strong>any victory by a rival would be through fraud</strong>. &#8211; from <a href="https://apnews.com/cf7b7e9a9e0f48439f5e49b5ba1ebf1b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AP</a> <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>So as of 4 days ago, the globalists started laying the groundwork for a possible delay in their plans.</p>
<p>As for the military coup / mass arrests in the US, it would save Trump if he’s still alive, or it would install the highest ranking official who isn’t arrested, either Rand Paul or some other conservative caretaker. After the coup, Rand Paul or Tulsi Gabbard would be elected as the first NWO President of the US (I would include Elizabeth Warren in that list, but I think &#8220;Pocahontas&#8221; has lost too much credibility and is too closely tied to the leftists).</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">(7 October 2018) &#8211;</span></strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"> Here are some points worth mentioning today&#8230;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>&gt;</strong> Kavanaugh is now in the Supreme Court, and the “leftists” have a month until the midterms to demonstrate their dissatisfaction. So now we wait and see if the globalists pull the trigger.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>&gt;</strong> The Brazilian election is underway today, and here is an interesting little tidbit about the “right-wing” frontrunner&#8230;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> Bolsonaro, a former army captain, has repeatedly spoken out in favour of Brazil&#8217;s military government, which was in power from 1964-85.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">He has promised to fill his cabinet with military generals and his running mate, retired army general Hamilton Mourao, hinted last year that <strong>he would be in favour of a military takeover of government if corrupt officials were not dealt with by Brazil&#8217;s courts</strong>. &#8212; from <a style="color: #ff0000;" href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/10/brazil-bolsonaro-pulls-eve-presidential-election-181006163216965.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Al Jazeera</a> <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">So the globalist plan for “mass arrests” of leftist officials is in play in Brazil as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>&gt;</strong> <a style="color: #ff0000;" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-10-04/the-big-hack-how-china-used-a-tiny-chip-to-infiltrate-america-s-top-companies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A massive Chinese hardware hack made the news this week</a>. By telling the public about it, the globalists can now blame the Chinese communists for the cyberattacks that will come when the Big Crisis hits. In reality, though, the globalists will be staging the attacks using hardware backdoors like the Intel Management Engine that are built right into the microprocessors. To learn more about this, scroll down to The Compendium and read the section titled &#8220;The Fake EMP Threat, Bitcoin, and the Great Encryption Lie.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>&gt;</strong> With <a style="color: #ff0000;" href="https://sputniknews.com/analysis/201810011068499258-us-navy-aircraft-carrier-deployments-fall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all but a few aircraft carriers laid up for long-delayed maintenance</a> and with a high-tech fighting force that is supposedly compromised by sabotaged Chinese computer boards, the US is ill-prepared to fight a three-front war (1. the Middle East, 2. the South China Sea, 3. Ukraine). These conditions will lead to our humbling defeat if the globalists take the War Path, and to our de facto surrender if they take the Peace Path. When we suddenly find out that Russian missiles can shoot down our stealth planes and that <a style="color: #ff0000;" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/09/24/russia-jam-signals-syria-supply-regime-advanced-anti-missile/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Russian “electronic warfare jamming”</a> and Chinese sleeper chips can deactivate our systems, we won’t have a leg to stand on.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">As I&#8217;ve mentioned in previous entries, Russia&#8217;s &#8220;revolutionary electronic warfare technology&#8221; likely utilizes globalist-supplied kill codes for the microchips in US warfighting systems.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(8 October 2018) &#8211;</strong> I took my son on an outing today, so there&#8217;ll be no update. But tomorrow, we&#8217;ll have a look at how <a style="color: #ff0000;" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-10-04/the-big-hack-how-china-used-a-tiny-chip-to-infiltrate-america-s-top-companies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">China&#8217;s big hardware hack</a> will fit in with the &#8220;Chinese interference in America&#8217;s election&#8221; meme Trump launched at the UN last month. This interference by a foreign communist power may also play into the second round of the Brazilian election. <em><strong>The Democratic Party conspiring with a hated foreign government would make for great treason charges and mass arrests, wouldn&#8217;t it?</strong></em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(Expanded Note &#8211; 9-10 October 2018) &#8211; The hows and whys of the “China interference” script</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">It all started last month when Trump sat as the President of the UN Security Council. Here is a passage from <a style="color: #ff0000;" href="https://www.vox.com/2018/9/26/17905722/trump-china-2018-election-interference-trade-war" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Vox article</a> about what happened&#8230;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> President Donald Trump just publicly accused China of interfering in the 2018 US midterm elections in front of more than a dozen world leaders at a meeting of the United Nations Security Council.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">“Regrettably, <strong>we found that China has been attempting to interfere in our upcoming 2018 election coming up in November against my administration</strong>,” Trump said on Wednesday. “<strong>They do not want me or us to win because I am the first president ever to challenge China on trade.</strong>” <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">When I heard about this at the time, I thought he was preparing to launch a “China interference” investigation as a counterstrike to the Democrats’ “Russian interference” investigation. But I decided to wait for more developments before writing about it. This week, those developments occurred.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">First, there was <a style="color: #ff0000;" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-10-04/the-big-hack-how-china-used-a-tiny-chip-to-infiltrate-america-s-top-companies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the story about China placing spy components on electronic motherboards that are used all over the world</a>. This provided a physical means to interfere with the upcoming election. Then, there was this&#8230;</span><br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;"><a style="color: #ff0000;" href="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/votmach109.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7920" src="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/votmach109.png" alt="" width="1122" height="463" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/votmach109.png 1122w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/votmach109-300x124.png 300w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/votmach109-768x317.png 768w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/votmach109-1024x423.png 1024w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/votmach109-624x257.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 1122px) 100vw, 1122px" /></a></span><br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;">&#8230;from <a style="color: #ff0000;" href="https://qz.com/1416512/bolsonaro-questions-brazils-voting-machines-especially-if-he-loses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quartz</a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">So the globalists’ “Chinese interference” script for the 2018 elections is becoming quite clear. China will use its spy chips and hacking brigades to support leftists in the Brazilian and American elections via the electronic voting machines and the computer networks that transmit the vote count. In fact, they may have already done so. Bolsonaro claims that <a style="color: #ff0000;" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/brazil-election-jair-bolsonaro-winner-no-majority-october-2018-10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he would have won a majority of the vote in the first round of the Brazilian election had it not been for irregularities with the electronic voting machines</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>~ MORE &#8211; 10 October 2018 ~</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Yesterday, the globalists flourished their “China interference” card again by having Bloomberg release <a style="color: #ff0000;" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-09/new-evidence-of-hacked-supermicro-hardware-found-in-u-s-telecom" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another article on “The Big Hack.”</a> The purpose of the new article is to move people towards seeing the ubiquitous nature of the Chinese effort&#8230;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> “<strong>For China, these efforts are all-encompassing</strong>,” said Tony Lawrence, CEO of VOR Technology, a Columbia, Maryland-based contractor to the intelligence community. “<strong>There is no way for us to identify the gravity or the size of these exploits &#8211; we don&#8217;t know until we find some. It could be all over the place &#8211; it could be anything coming out of China. The unknown is what gets you and that&#8217;s where we are now. We don&#8217;t know the level of exploits within our own systems.</strong>” <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Now imagine for a moment that such spy chips are on the motherboards of the electronic voting machines and the PCs used to tabulate the votes. Can you see how the Chinese communists could interfere with the following US vote tabulation process? [My comments are in brackets]&#8230;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> In most places, the voting process looks a little like this: People go to their designated polling place, their name is checked off the voter rolls and they vote, either with a paper ballot that is <strong>optically scanned by a machine</strong>, an <strong>electronic voting machine</strong> or, very rarely, a paper ballot that is hand-read, Foley said. [So for both optical scanning machines and electronic voting machines, which are used in the overwhelming majority of voting places, The Big Hack is in play.]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">In the case of optically scanned ballots, once voting for the day is done, a poll worker pushes a little button on <strong>a computer that automatically tabulates the votes</strong>. Then, the machine will print out a grocery-receipt-like record with the vote tally, which is usually taped to the door of the polling place, Stewart said. Several copies of this printout are generated, and those copies, along with <strong>a computer card that stores the results</strong>, are bundled together and immediately sent to one of the central counting offices, which may be either a dedicated elections department or the county courthouse, Stewart said. (Some counties take uncounted ballots directly from the polling place to have them read by an optical scanner in the county courthouse, Stewart added.) [So the computer that tabulates the votes and the computer card that stores the results are both hackable.]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Once these memory cards from all of the polling places are received by the central office, &#8220;<strong>they&#8217;re popped into a computer</strong> much like you would pop a USB thumb drive into a computer,&#8221; Stewart said. <strong>This computer then tallies all of the results and begins to generate a preliminary vote-count report</strong>, Stewart said. [So after the hackable results come to the central office, they’re processed by another hackable computer.]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Then, this preliminary vote count can be conveyed in a number of ways. In some places, a &#8220;stringer&#8221; for the Associated Press (AP) will sit there and call in the results to the central AP call center, Stewart said. In other places, the results will be pushed via phone or <strong>internet</strong> to state officials, who will report the results. [After the two previous layers of hackable activities, states that report by internet can be hacked a third time.]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">To prevent an election from being &#8220;hacked,&#8221; some states even have their own separate, secure wires for transmitting election results between the county and the state, Foley said. [If one or both of the computers that communicate over the “secure wire” is hacked, either at the hardware or software level, the “secure wire” becomes a farce.] &#8211; from <a style="color: #ff0000;" href="https://www.livescience.com/56787-how-are-votes-counted.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Live Science</a> <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">So as you can see, <strong>if the Chinese have the will to hack the election (which is provided by Trump’s “trade war”), they have the means to carry it out</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The best way for the globalists to play this “China interference” card is to use it within the context of an election that is stolen by the left. Here’s how that effort is shaping up&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Step 1 &#8211; Have the leftist-controlled media band together to bombard Trump and other Republicans with negative press</strong> &#8212; <a style="color: #ff0000;" href="https://dailycaller.com/2018/10/09/trump-tv-coverage-negative-summer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DONE</a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Step 2 &#8211; Have the leftist-controlled internet companies band together to shut down and marginalize right-wing voices</strong> &#8212; <a style="color: #ff0000;" href="https://www.infowars.com/trump-slams-big-tech-censorship-americans-deserve-same-free-speech-rights-as-the-media/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DONE</a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Step 3 &#8211; Have the leftist-controlled polling organizations band together to portray a Democratic lead in the Congressional races</strong> &#8212; IN PROGRESS (news of this will come out during the post-election investigation)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Step 4 &#8211; Play the &#8220;China interference&#8221; card by having the Chicoms manipulate the voting results to falsely show key Democratic victories and Democratic control of the next Congress.</strong> &#8212; COMING</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Step 5 &#8211; Have the leftist-controlled media announce the Democratic victories as a done deal while decrying any effort to investigate election manipulation as “an attempt to steal the election.”</strong> &#8212; COMING</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">In the next addition, I’ll show you their plan for after the stolen election&#8230;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(12 October 2018) &#8211; </strong><strong>The Globalist Script for the Stolen Election and its Aftermath</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">In <a style="color: #ff0000;" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-10-04/the-big-hack-how-china-used-a-tiny-chip-to-infiltrate-america-s-top-companies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the original article on China’s “Big Hack,”</a> it was noted that US intelligence had been tracking the hack for years. And with Trump speaking out about Chinese interference in the midterm election and Bolsonaro complaining about anomalies with Brazil’s electronic voting machines, <strong>the globalist script will reflect that Trump and his “white hat” allies in the US letter agencies have set a surveillance trap to catch China red-handed on election day</strong>. So when the Chinese manipulate the vote and the US mainstream media rush to declare Democratic victories, Trump will blow the whistle on the hack. That’s when the fun begins.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">After announcing the hack, Trump and Congress will order a Mueller-like investigation into Chinese interference in the election, with the aim of thoroughly sorting out what happened prior to the new Congress taking office in January. And unlike the “Russian interference” investigation that dragged on and drilled into a dry hole, the “Chinese interference” investigation will move swiftly and drill into a gusher. Vast evidence of complicity between the Chicoms and the Democratic leaders will be found, and the electronic voting machines will be cracked open and the Chinese spy chips within them will be shown to the public. Trump will then have the Democrats not only on conspiracy and corruption charges, but on <strong>treason</strong> charges as well, and treason is punishable by death (especially when military tribunals are conducting the trials).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Once Trump announces the investigation, the globalist script will portray the Democrats as desperately fighting for their lives, literally. So they will go to any and all lengths to save themselves from the gallows. This means that they’ll rabidly go after Trump either by assassination, impeachment or the 25th Amendment. It also means that they’ll employ explosive rhetoric with their followers. “We won the election and Trump is trying to steal it from us,” they’ll scream, “The fascist Trump is destroying our democracy RIGHT NOW, and we must use ANY MEANS NECESSARY to stop him!” The paid Soros brigades will then hit the streets to violently (and sometimes fatally) attack conservatives, and any attempt by Trump to restore order will be decried as a “dictatorial crackdown on dissent.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">At some point the military will step in to stop the madness, and the people will cheer. &#8220;Mass Arrests&#8221; will clear Washington of pretty much everyone except the globalist-chosen new leaders (like Rand Paul, Tulsi Gabbard, etc.).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Of course, the Brazilians will undergo the same process. It is likely that the globalists will script a Bolsonaro loss on October 28 amidst claims of electronic voting machine manipulation. Bolsonaro’s complaints will be trashed by the mainstream media, but they&#8217;ll nonetheless receive wide coverage. This will help put the idea into people’s minds a week before the US election.</span></p>
<p><strong>(after the election) &#8211;</strong> Well another NWO strongman has been put in place: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/brazilians-go-the-polls-with-far-right-jair-bolsonaro-as-front-runner/2018/10/28/880dd53c-d6dd-11e8-8384-bcc5492fef49_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.5228e85de15b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bolsonaro wins Brazilian presidency</a>. His selection was a great casting choice on the globalists&#8217; part.

<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>EXPANDED ALERT</strong></span><br />
<strong>(21-22 October 2018)</strong><br />
<strong>The Khashoggi Affair: The Globalists’ Dial-a-Yield October Surprise</strong></h1>
<p>In the US nuclear arsenal, there is a “dial-a-yield” nuclear bomb known as the B61. Depending on the settings applied by the technicians arming it, it can explode in a range of yields from 0.3 to 340 kilotons. It is becoming apparent that the globalists’ ongoing Khashoggi October Surprise is structured quite similarly, with three yields I’ve identified so far&#8230;</p>
<ol>
<li>If the they trigger it to blow in the <strong>lowest yield</strong>, we will see the <strong>US Congress force sanctions on Saudi Arabia</strong> (thereby shifting Saudi Arabia’s allegiance over to the BRICS and dealing a fatal blow to the petro-dollar).</li>
<li>If they have it blow in the <strong style="font-size: 1rem;">middle yield</strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;">, </span><strong style="font-size: 1rem;">Trump and Kushner will face allegations that they either withheld intelligence that could have prevented Khashoggi’s death or actively participated in planning it</strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;">.</span></li>
<li>And if they turn the dial all the way up to <strong style="font-size: 1rem;">maximum yield</strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;">, </span><strong style="font-size: 1rem;">Trump will face allegations that he conspired with the Bushes and Saudis to withhold 9/11 Truth from the public</strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;">.</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Over the next 24 hours, I’ll work to restructure this page and expand this alert so we’ll be ready for <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/international/412452-erdogan-turkey-to-announce-findings-of-khashoggi-investigation-on" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Erdogan’s announcement on Tuesday</a>. That’s the day he might turn the dial to medium yield. A following US investigation could then turn it to maximum.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>~ MORE &#8211; 22 October 2018 ~</strong></p>
<p>Let me preface my remarks by telling new readers that the globalists control both sides in the current political drama: both the “Establishment” side (Obama, Clinton, Soros, the Bilderbergers, the mainstream media, etc.) and the “Anti-Establishment” side (Trump, Le Pen, Putin, the BRICS, the alternative media, etc.). They are deliberately staging a dialectic conflict between these two controlled fronts in order to implode their existing “Establishment” and erect a new one (the New World Order) in its place. That is the true narrative of what’s going on in our world today.</p>
<p>What I’ll be covering in the writings that follow are the specific events and false narratives they’re attempting to use in moving us into the NWO. Since there are two controlled sides to the staged conflict, there are two false narratives the globalists are spinning: 1) the mainstream narrative is the Establishment-side propaganda they sell to the sleepers, and 2) the alt-media narrative is the Anti-Establishment-side propaganda they sell to those who are awakening. They want you to come to see the mainstream narrative as a lie and the alt-media narrative as the truth. That’s because today’s alt-media will be the mainstream media of the New World Order.</p>
<p>That being said, what we are observing in the ongoing Khashoggi saga is a stage play being put on for the public. The purpose of the play is to convince people that Saudi Arabia’s coming move away from the US and towards the BRICS is happening as a result of the drama. In reality, though, the drama is meant to obfuscate the true reason for Saudi Arabia switching its allegiance: the globalists are deliberately removing the petroleum pillar from under the US dollar so it will fall and the IMF’s SDR / “phoenix” currency can take its place as the world’s primary reserve currency. And if they can use the drama to facilitate Trump’s scripted fall from power too, that’s just icing on the cake. He’s in on the plan, along with Erdogan, MBS, Kushner, Khashoggi and the rest.</p>
<p>Now here are my previous notes on the Khashoggi affair (in chronological order)&#8230;</p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>(Expanded Note &#8211; 16 October 2018) &#8211;</strong> Have a look at this piece of preparatory propaganda from a year ago&#8230;</span><br />
<span style="color: #333333;"><a style="color: #333333;" href="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/saudiyuan1016.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7942" src="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/saudiyuan1016.png" alt="" width="550" height="382" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/saudiyuan1016.png 550w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/saudiyuan1016-300x208.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></a></span><br />
<span style="color: #333333;">&#8230;from <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/11/china-will-compel-saudi-arabia-to-trade-oil-in-yuan--and-thats-going-to-affect-the-us-dollar.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNBC</a>. Updating it for this year, the headline should read <em>&#8220;<strong>US sanctions</strong> will &#8216;compel&#8217; Saudi Arabia to trade oil in yuan&#8230;&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Since Saudi Arabia is the cornerstone of the petro-dollar, their post-sanctions choice to accept the petro-yuan would break the petro-dollar’s back. It wouldn’t disappear overnight, of course, but we would witness a downward spiral until we hit the Big Crisis.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Watch this drama over the supposed murder of <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Khashoggi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Khashoggi</a> very closely. You may be witnessing a big event in scripted world economic history &#8212; one that rivals Nixon&#8217;s abandonment of the gold standard.</span></p>
<p>Now for a few quick words&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>&gt;</strong> In response to a reader’s question, yes, I’m still aiming to write about The Protocols. Since November looks to be a busy writing time, I’ll get it done this month.</p>
<p><strong>&gt;</strong> Have a look at <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/441270-saudi-retaliation-us-sanctions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this RT story about what the Saudis might do if Trump hits them with sanctions</a> over the murdered journalist. The whole thing is a very clear example of how the globalists are having Trump use sanctions to drive nations away from the “US Empire” and into the welcoming arms of the savior Putin. Trump is playing the role of the “precursor messiah” (the Moshiach ben Yossef) who prepares the way for the “main messiah,” Putin (the Moshiach ben David). And with each new sanction, Trump and his Skull and Bones Treasury Secretary Mnuchin are laying a brick on the NWO pyramid.</p>
<p><strong>&gt;</strong> Keep an eye on <a href="https://globalriskinsights.com/2018/10/special-purpose-vehicle-future-iran-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the “special purpose vehicle” (SPV)</a> that the EU, Russia, and China are setting up to facilitate trade with Iran. It may be a working prototype of the “commodities-backed” NWO financial system, as is the petro-yuan. The new US sanctions on Iran are not about their nuclear program &#8212; that’s the cover story &#8212; they’re actually about the globalists replacing the dollar with the petro-yuan and the special purpose vehicle&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> Chinese oil futures contracts denominated in yuan hit their daily limit with a 5-percent spike on Tuesday as the US kicked off the first round of sanctions against Iran.</p>
<p>Washington’s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal and target the country&#8217;s oil sector with sanctions is expected to significantly boost China&#8217;s leverage to demand crude imports be priced in yuan&#8230;</p>
<p>China, the world’s top oil importer, started its long-anticipated crude oil futures contract that is priced in yuan and convertible into gold. The contract attracted nearly 27 billion yuan ($4 billion) during the first trading session. The step was aimed at diminishing the role of the US dollar in oil trading, strengthening the national currency and at bypassing US sanctions by trading oil in yuan&#8230;</p>
<p>China is expected to become a chief beneficiary of the US unilateral sanctions against the world’s biggest energy producers, including Russia, Iran and Venezuela. &#8211; from <a href="https://www.rt.com/business/435298-iran-sanctions-china-petro-yuan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RT</a> <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> The SPV may prove to be a dangerous precedent, or it may be the boldest move yet in a post-American world that sees China, the EU and others assume greater leadership roles. &#8211; from <a href="https://globalriskinsights.com/2018/10/special-purpose-vehicle-future-iran-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Global Risk Insights</a> <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>It will be interesting to see if the petro-yuan is included in the SPV.</p>
<p>In my yearly <a href="http://redefininggod.com/nwo-schedule-of-implementation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NWO Schedule of Implementation</a> article, I talk about the globalists&#8217; &#8220;running game.&#8221; Well this year, one of their big running plays was the launch of the petro-yuan, and they&#8217;ll get another big gain when the SPV is put in place over the next few weeks. Both of these new mechanisms will continue to grow until the Big Crisis, after which they’ll be merged with the “reformed” UN/NWO and its SDR/“Phoenix” currency for the touchdown.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span style="color: #333333;">(</span>Original ALERT &#8211; </strong></span><strong>17-18 October 2018) &#8211; </strong><em><strong>Will the globalists use the Khashoggi killing and its <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-10-17/jamal-khashoggi-where-road-damascus-path-911-converge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(alt-media) suggested link to “9/11 Truth”</a> to topple Trump and install Pence?</strong></em></p>
<p>If 9/11 Truth comes out, the Bushes will take a beating. And Trump just put a Bush loyalist (Kavanaugh) into the Supreme Court and is reportedly hesitant to confront the Saudis on Khashoggi. Meanwhile, both Establishment Republicans and Establishment Democrats are savaging Saudi Arabia in the media.</p>
<p><strong>Could it be that the globalists are scripting a Bipartisan Establishment takedown of Saudi Arabia, the Bushes, and Trump along with them?</strong> It would be quite a plot twist, but it would get Pence into the presidency to play his “Grey Champion” role like they want.</p>
<p>It’s an angle to watch, and I’ll write more on it over the coming 24 hours.</p>

<span style="color: #333333;">&#8230;from <a style="color: #333333;" href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-bush-administration-trump-20171120-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Chicago Tribune</a>. Here is an excerpt&#8230;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> For all the lingering tensions between President Donald Trump and former President George W. Bush, Trump&#8217;s White House shares one thing in common with his Republican predecessor&#8217;s: People.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Trump has installed more than three dozen veterans of the Bush administration, putting them in charge of running agencies, implementing foreign policy and overseeing his schedule.</strong> While hiring from the last administration controlled by the same party is common, Trump&#8217;s staffing moves are notable given his pledges to change politics-as-usual and the frosty relations between the current and former Republican standard-bearers.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>The Bush influence has only grown stronger recently, as Trump nominated Alex Azar to lead the Health and Human Services Department, where he served under the Bush administration, and tapped Jerome &#8220;Jay&#8221; Powell to be chairman of the Federal Reserve. Powell served in the Treasury Department under President George H.W. Bush.</strong> <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Tomorrow morning, I’ll show you the connections among&#8230;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">the influx of Bush officials into the Trump administration,</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">the passage of Trump’s tax cuts,</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Trump’s nomination of the Carlyle Group’s Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve Chairman,</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">the Bushes&#8217; and Bin Ladens&#8217; connection to the Carlyle Group,</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">and possibly more.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">I’ll also cover how the mainstream media will sell the <strong>Bush-Trump conspiracy narrative</strong> and how the controlled alt-media will try to counter it. By tomorrow night, I should have this operation rolled up. Of course, I’d do all this today, but my roommate is coming back from her trip this evening. And if I don’t straighten up before she gets here, she’ll chew my ass in a way that only Korean ajumas can.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>~ MORE &#8211; 18 October 2018 ~</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Well, I succeeded in forestalling a thermonuclear nag-attack from my former wife / current roommate. So I can now return my attention to a less formidable adversary, the globalist cabal.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">It looks like I’ve hit a nerve with this alert. After I posted the second part of it yesterday, I was on the receiving end of an unusual number of messages that tried to lead me off in different directions. It’s a standard tactic of the globalists’ sidle-up shills to attempt to distract and sap the energy of someone who stumbles onto something important. It’s so obvious what they’re doing that one wonders why they even try.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">That being said, let me get straight to the heart of the matter&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Should the globalists pull the trigger on this Bush-Trump 9/11 collusion operation, we’ll see 9/11 Truth begin to come out in the mainstream media coverage of the Khashoggi disappearance / murder. As for the mechanism they’ll use to introduce it, it could be an information release tied to a dead-man’s trigger set up by Khashoggi or something similar. And once the truth is out and the Saudis and Bushes are in the spotlight, the mainstream media will lump Trump in with them with a narrative that goes something like this&#8230;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #333333;">&#8220;Upon taking office, Trump found himself surrounded by hostile officials on both sides of the political divide, and it began to dawn on him that his lack of allies in Washington would mean his agenda had little chance of getting passed by Congress. So after trying and failing to overturn Obamacare, he looked ahead and saw three and a half more years of frustration that would end in a failed presidency. This caused him to take action and do what he’s known for doing, making a deal.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">He reached out to the core of the Republican Establishment, the Bush family, and asked for their help in passing legislation that could be spun as fulfilling his campaign promises. In return, the Bushes demanded control of key positions in his administration as well as his silence on 9/11 Truth. The deal was made, and with his handshake, Trump became an accessory after the fact to the Bushes’ horrible crimes against the American people.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">After Trump made his first big installment on the deal, nominating the Bushes’ man Jerome Powell as the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, the Bushes made their first big installment by passing Trump’s tax cuts. Trump has toed the Bush line since then, including placing their man Kavanaugh into the Supreme Court.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Now the Saudis, Bushes and Trumps must be brought to justice.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">In the next addition, I’ll show you the narrative the controlled alt-media will spin, then I’ll start adding in all the background information on how I arrived at this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>~ MORE &#8211; 18 October 2018 ~</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">As for the controlled alt-media, they have been teasing Trump’s release of 9/11 Truth as his ultimate trump card in dealing with the “Deep State”&#8230;</span><br />

<span style="color: #333333;">&#8230;from <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.infowars.com/trump-threatens-to-release-9-11-docs-implicating-clintons-bushes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Infowars</a>. Here is an excerpt&#8230;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> President Trump is prepared to go beyond exposing Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s 9/11-Saudi cover-up by releasing new information on how the Bushes and Clintons were also involved, according to high-level government sources.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">In short, Mueller’s role in covering up Saudi Arabia’s ties to 9/11 is just the tip of the iceberg; Trump is set to expose even more collusion by the deep state, according to officials who spoke to Infowars. <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">So when Trump gets hit with the Bush collusion rap, the alt-media will portray it as a case of the “Deep State” weaponizing 9/11 Truth and preemptively using it against him.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">This weekend, I’ll share the narrative they’ll spin and start adding all the supporting material to this alert.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">On another note, let’s not forget that <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-11-10/saudi-deep-state-prince-bandar-bin-sultan-among-those-arrested-purge-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammad Bin Salman (MBS) supposedly arrested Prince Bandar (a.k.a. “Bandar Bush”)</a> during his “crackdown on corruption” last year. So at another level of scripting for the Khashoggi murder, the US and Saudi “Deep States” disappeared Khashoggi as part of a false-flag against MBS. They are aiming to get rid of him, which is why <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/16/lindsey-graham-says-saudi-crown-prince-bin-salman-has-got-to-go.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lindsey Graham said he’s got to go</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">On yet another note, here’s a thought we’ll explore&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><em><strong>Did Nikki Haley resign her UN post so Pence could nominate her as Vice President after the Trump takedown?</strong></em> Maybe that’s why <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.salon.com/2018/04/19/rumors-nikki-haley-mike-pence-presidential-run_partner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Pence/Haley rumors</a> have been circulated.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>(Twice-Expanded Note &#8211; 19-20 October 2018) &#8211;</strong> We saw this one coming, didn’t we?&#8230;</span><br />
<span style="color: #333333;"><a style="color: #333333;" href="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/mbsout1019.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7957" src="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/mbsout1019.png" alt="" width="780" height="219" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/mbsout1019.png 780w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/mbsout1019-300x84.png 300w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/mbsout1019-768x216.png 768w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/mbsout1019-624x175.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /></a></span><br />
<span style="color: #333333;">&#8230;from <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-10-19/saudi-allegiance-council-meeting-secret-consider-mbs-replacement-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zero Hedge</a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The press are narrating that US intelligence officials are increasingly sure that MBS ordered Khashoggi’s killing, just like they were sure of Russian interference in the 2016 US election. So don’t be shocked if Russian or Chinese (or possibly even Turkish) intelligence comes out with information that clears MBS of the killing and saves his position. It would be a nice way to narrate his shift in allegiance to the BRICS, wouldn’t it?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>~ MORE ~</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">It looks like the Saudi King has sided with MBS, because <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.rt.com/news/441785-saudi-intelligence-agency-restructure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he’s having MBS lead a reorganization of Saudi intelligence.</a> This will be sold as a clearance of the Saudi “Deep State.” Meanwhile, the US “Deep State” will push sanctions through Congress in an attempt to force out MBS. And that will alienate him from the US and cause him to turn to the BRICS.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Also, the Saudi government confirmed today that the missing Khashoggi has indeed been killed (supposedly), so now we wait and see if the dead-man’s trigger gets pulled on the 9/11 info.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>~ MORE &#8211; 20 October 2018 ~</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Here’s something I came across this morning&#8230;</span><br />
<span style="color: #333333;"><a style="color: #333333;" href="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/turkssaud1020.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7962" src="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/turkssaud1020.png" alt="" width="960" height="96" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/turkssaud1020.png 960w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/turkssaud1020-300x30.png 300w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/turkssaud1020-768x77.png 768w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/turkssaud1020-624x62.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></a></span><br />
<span style="color: #333333;">&#8230;from <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.apnews.com/086a03cd1b4d44b0a1d06263e353c092" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AP</a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">It will be interesting to see how the globalists script Turkey’s move in this game. In the prophecy fulfillment script, Erdogan is playing the role of the “Dajjal,” the Muslim version of an antichrist. And his character’s motivation is to build an evil Islamist Empire, with him playing both sides of the East -West divide to advance his own agenda. So on the one hand, he is in league with the “Satanist Western Deep States” in conducting the “Islamic invasion” of the West (since both he and the Satanists supposedly want to destroy Christian civilization); on the other hand, he is in league with Putin in building an energy pipeline and joining the BRICS.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">So which play will the globalist scriptwriters have him make? A Western play of blaming MBS for Khashoggi’s killing to help his Western “Deep State” allies get rid of him, or a BRICS play to clear MBS of the killing so he’ll keep his position and switch allegiance to the BRICS?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">At the moment, I’m still thinking-through that question. But I can tell you this: MBS fits the mold of the “strong, nationalist” leader type that will comprise the leadership of the New World Order, so I’d be surprised if he gets removed.</span></p>

<p>In previous updates, I’ve noted that the most likely scenario for a Trump (and now Putin) assassination would involve a “terrorist” attack using an “Iranian” drone. So upon checking in on the preparatory propaganda for such an attack, I found these two things from this month&#8230;<br />

<p>So you have an “ISIS” poster targeting Paris with a <strong>drone</strong> and talking of a surprise, and you have news of a supposedly operational stealth-ish <strong>drone</strong> from Iran that could plausibly penetrate Paris air defenses. If you stick a small “North Korean/Ukrainian” nuke into that “Iranian” drone and pair them with an “ISIS” guy with a laser designator on the ground in Paris, you have a Trump and Putin killer that would open the door to war in all three World War 3 sandboxes.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>EXPANDED ALERT</strong></span><br />
<strong>(21 October 2018)</strong><br />
<strong>The Khashoggi Affair: The Globalists’ Dial-a-Yield October Surprise</strong></h1>
<p>In the US nuclear arsenal, there is a “dial-a-yield” nuclear bomb known as the B61. Depending on the settings applied by the technicians arming it, it can explode in a range of yields from 0.3 to 340 kilotons. And it is becoming apparent that the globalists’ ongoing Khashoggi October Surprise is structured quite similarly, with three yields I’ve identified so far&#8230;</p>
<ol>
<li>If the they trigger it to blow in the <strong>lowest yield</strong>, we will see the <strong>US Congress force sanctions on Saudi Arabia</strong> (thereby shifting Saudi Arabia’s allegiance over to the BRICS and dealing a fatal blow to the petro-dollar).</li>
<li>If they have it blow in the <strong style="font-size: 1rem;">middle yield</strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;">, </span><strong style="font-size: 1rem;">Trump and Kushner will face allegations that they either withheld intelligence that could have prevented Khashoggi’s death or actively participated in planning it</strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;">.</span></li>
<li>And if they turn the dial all the way up to <strong style="font-size: 1rem;">maximum yield</strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;">, </span><strong style="font-size: 1rem;">Trump will face allegations that he conspired with the Bushes and Saudis to withhold 9/11 Truth from the public</strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;">.</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Over the next 24 hours, I’ll work to restructure this page and expand this alert so we’ll be ready for <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/international/412452-erdogan-turkey-to-announce-findings-of-khashoggi-investigation-on" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Erdogan’s announcement on Tuesday</a>. That’s the day he might turn the dial to medium yield. A following US investigation could then turn it to maximum.</p>
<p><strong>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">Expanded</span> Note &#8211; 21 October 2018) &#8211;</strong> We saw this one coming too, didn’t we?&#8230;<br />

<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>ALERT</strong></span><br />
<strong>(17-18 October 2018)</strong></h1>
<p><em><strong>Will the globalists use the Khashoggi killing and its <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-10-17/jamal-khashoggi-where-road-damascus-path-911-converge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(alt-media) suggested link to “9/11 Truth”</a> to topple Trump and install Pence?</strong></em></p>
<p>If 9/11 Truth comes out, the Bushes will take a beating. And Trump just put a Bush loyalist (Kavanaugh) into the Supreme Court and is reportedly hesitant to confront the Saudis on Khashoggi. Meanwhile, both Establishment Republicans and Establishment Democrats are savaging Saudi Arabia in the media.</p>
<p><strong>Could it be that the globalists are scripting a Bipartisan Establishment takedown of Saudi Arabia, the Bushes, and Trump along with them?</strong> It would be quite a plot twist, but it would get Pence into the presidency to play his “Grey Champion” role like they want.</p>
<p>It’s an angle to watch, and I’ll write more on it over the coming 24 hours.</p>

<span style="color: #333333;">&#8230;from <a style="color: #333333;" href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-bush-administration-trump-20171120-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Chicago Tribune</a>. Here is an excerpt&#8230;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> For all the lingering tensions between President Donald Trump and former President George W. Bush, Trump&#8217;s White House shares one thing in common with his Republican predecessor&#8217;s: People.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Trump has installed more than three dozen veterans of the Bush administration, putting them in charge of running agencies, implementing foreign policy and overseeing his schedule.</strong> While hiring from the last administration controlled by the same party is common, Trump&#8217;s staffing moves are notable given his pledges to change politics-as-usual and the frosty relations between the current and former Republican standard-bearers.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>The Bush influence has only grown stronger recently, as Trump nominated Alex Azar to lead the Health and Human Services Department, where he served under the Bush administration, and tapped Jerome &#8220;Jay&#8221; Powell to be chairman of the Federal Reserve. Powell served in the Treasury Department under President George H.W. Bush.</strong> <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Tomorrow morning, I’ll show you the connections among&#8230;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">the influx of Bush officials into the Trump administration,</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">the passage of Trump’s tax cuts,</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Trump’s nomination of the Carlyle Group’s Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve Chairman,</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">the Bushes&#8217; and Bin Ladens&#8217; connection to the Carlyle Group,</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">and possibly more.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">I’ll also cover how the mainstream media will sell the <strong>Bush-Trump conspiracy narrative</strong> and how the controlled alt-media will try to counter it. By tomorrow night, I should have this operation rolled up. Of course, I’d do all this today, but my roommate is coming back from her trip this evening. And if I don’t straighten up before she gets here, she’ll chew my ass in a way that only Korean ajumas can.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>~ MORE &#8211; 18 October 2018 ~</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Well, I succeeded in forestalling a thermonuclear nag-attack from my former wife / current roommate. So I can now return my attention to a less formidable adversary, the globalist cabal.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">It looks like I’ve hit a nerve with this alert. After I posted the second part of it yesterday, I was on the receiving end of an unusual number of messages that tried to lead me off in different directions. It’s a standard tactic of the globalists’ sidle-up shills to attempt to distract and sap the energy of someone who stumbles onto something important. It’s so obvious what they’re doing that one wonders why they even try.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">That being said, let me get straight to the heart of the matter&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Should the globalists pull the trigger on this Bush-Trump 9/11 collusion operation, we’ll see 9/11 Truth begin to come out in the mainstream media coverage of the Khashoggi disappearance / murder. As for the mechanism they’ll use to introduce it, it could be an information release tied to a dead-man’s trigger set up by Khashoggi or something similar. And once the truth is out and the Saudis and Bushes are in the spotlight, the mainstream media will lump Trump in with them with a narrative that goes something like this&#8230;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #333333;">&#8220;Upon taking office, Trump found himself surrounded by hostile officials on both sides of the political divide, and it began to dawn on him that his lack of allies in Washington would mean his agenda had little chance of getting passed by Congress. So after trying and failing to overturn Obamacare, he looked ahead and saw three and a half more years of frustration that would end in a failed presidency. This caused him to take action and do what he’s known for doing, making a deal.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">He reached out to the core of the Republican Establishment, the Bush family, and asked for their help in passing legislation that could be spun as fulfilling his campaign promises. In return, the Bushes demanded control of key positions in his administration as well as his silence on 9/11 Truth. The deal was made, and with his handshake, Trump became an accessory after the fact to the Bushes’ horrible crimes against the American people.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">After Trump made his first big installment on the deal, nominating the Bushes’ man Jerome Powell as the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, the Bushes made their first big installment by passing Trump’s tax cuts. Trump has toed the Bush line since then, including placing their man Kavanaugh into the Supreme Court.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Now the Saudis, Bushes and Trumps must be brought to justice.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">In the next addition, I’ll show you the narrative the controlled alt-media will spin, then I’ll start adding in all the background information on how I arrived at this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>~ MORE &#8211; 18 October 2018 ~</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">As for the controlled alt-media, they have been teasing Trump’s release of 9/11 Truth as his ultimate trump card in dealing with the “Deep State”&#8230;</span><br />

<span style="color: #333333;">&#8230;from <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.infowars.com/trump-threatens-to-release-9-11-docs-implicating-clintons-bushes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Infowars</a>. Here is an excerpt&#8230;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> President Trump is prepared to go beyond exposing Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s 9/11-Saudi cover-up by releasing new information on how the Bushes and Clintons were also involved, according to high-level government sources.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">In short, Mueller’s role in covering up Saudi Arabia’s ties to 9/11 is just the tip of the iceberg; Trump is set to expose even more collusion by the deep state, according to officials who spoke to Infowars. <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">So when Trump gets hit with the Bush collusion rap, the alt-media will portray it as a case of the “Deep State” weaponizing 9/11 Truth and preemptively using it against him.</span></p>

So at another level of scripting for the Khashoggi murder, the US and Saudi “Deep States” disappeared Khashoggi as part of a false-flag against MBS. They are aiming to get rid of him, which is why <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/16/lindsey-graham-says-saudi-crown-prince-bin-salman-has-got-to-go.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lindsey Graham said he’s got to go</a>.</span></p>

<span style="color: #333333;">&#8230;from <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-10-19/saudi-allegiance-council-meeting-secret-consider-mbs-replacement-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zero Hedge</a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The press are narrating that US intelligence officials are increasingly sure that MBS ordered Khashoggi’s killing, just like they were sure of Russian interference in the 2016 US election. So don’t be shocked if Russian or Chinese (or possibly even Turkish) intelligence comes out with information that clears MBS of the killing and saves his position. It would be a nice way to narrate his shift in allegiance to the BRICS, wouldn’t it?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>~ MORE ~</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">It looks like the Saudi King has sided with MBS, because <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.rt.com/news/441785-saudi-intelligence-agency-restructure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he’s having MBS lead a reorganization of Saudi intelligence.</a> This will be sold as a clearance of the Saudi “Deep State.” Meanwhile, the US “Deep State” will push sanctions through Congress in an attempt to force out MBS. And that will alienate him from the US and cause him to turn to the BRICS.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Also, the Saudi government confirmed today that the missing Khashoggi has indeed been killed (supposedly), so now we wait and see if the dead-man’s trigger gets pulled on the 9/11 info.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #333333;">Here’s something I came across this morning&#8230;</span><br />
<span style="color: #333333;"><a style="color: #333333;" href="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/turkssaud1020.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7962" src="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/turkssaud1020.png" alt="" width="960" height="96" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/turkssaud1020.png 960w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/turkssaud1020-300x30.png 300w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/turkssaud1020-768x77.png 768w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/turkssaud1020-624x62.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></a></span><br />
<span style="color: #333333;">&#8230;from <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.apnews.com/086a03cd1b4d44b0a1d06263e353c092" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AP</a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">It will be interesting to see how the globalists script Turkey’s move in this game. In the prophecy fulfillment script, Erdogan is playing the role of the “Dajjal,” the Muslim version of an antichrist. And his character’s motivation is to build an evil Islamist Empire, with him playing both sides of the East -West divide to advance his own agenda. So on the one hand, he is in league with the “Satanist Western Deep States” in conducting the “Islamic invasion” of the West (since both he and the Satanists supposedly want to destroy Christian civilization); on the other hand, he is in league with Putin in building an energy pipeline and joining the BRICS.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">So which play will the globalist scriptwriters have him make? A Western play of blaming MBS for Khashoggi’s killing to help his Western “Deep State” allies get rid of him, or a BRICS play to clear MBS of the killing so he’ll keep his position and switch allegiance to the BRICS?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">At the moment, I’m still thinking-through that question. But I can tell you this: MBS fits the mold of the “strong, nationalist” leader type that will comprise the leadership of the New World Order, so I’d be surprised if he gets removed.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>(Expanded Note &#8211; 16 October 2018) &#8211;</strong> Have a look at this piece of preparatory propaganda from a year ago&#8230;</span><br />

<span style="color: #333333;">&#8230;from <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/11/china-will-compel-saudi-arabia-to-trade-oil-in-yuan--and-thats-going-to-affect-the-us-dollar.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNBC</a>. Updating it for this year, the headline should read <em>&#8220;<strong>US sanctions</strong> will &#8216;compel&#8217; Saudi Arabia to trade oil in yuan&#8230;&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Since Saudi Arabia is the cornerstone of the petro-dollar, their post-sanctions choice to accept the petro-yuan would break the petro-dollar’s back. It wouldn’t disappear overnight, of course, but we would witness a downward spiral until we hit the Big Crisis.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Watch this drama over the supposed murder of <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Khashoggi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Khashoggi</a> very closely. You may be witnessing a big event in scripted world economic history &#8212; one that rivals Nixon&#8217;s abandonment of the gold standard.</span></p>
<p>Now for a few quick words&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>&gt;</strong> In response to a reader’s question, yes, I’m still aiming to write about The Protocols. Since November looks to be a busy writing time, I’ll get it done this month.</p>
<p><strong>&gt;</strong> Have a look at <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/441270-saudi-retaliation-us-sanctions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this RT story about what the Saudis might do if Trump hits them with sanctions</a> over the murdered journalist. The whole thing is a very clear example of how the globalists are having Trump use sanctions to drive nations away from the “US Empire” and into the welcoming arms of the savior Putin. Trump is playing the role of the “precursor messiah” (the Moshiach ben Yossef) who prepares the way for the “main messiah,” Putin (the Moshiach ben David). And with each new sanction, Trump and his Skull and Bones Treasury Secretary Mnuchin are laying a brick on the NWO pyramid.</p>
<p><strong>&gt;</strong> Keep an eye on <a href="https://globalriskinsights.com/2018/10/special-purpose-vehicle-future-iran-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the “special purpose vehicle” (SPV)</a> that the EU, Russia, and China are setting up to facilitate trade with Iran. It may be a working prototype of the “commodities-backed” NWO financial system, as is the petro-yuan. The new US sanctions on Iran are not about their nuclear program &#8212; that’s the cover story &#8212; they’re actually about the globalists replacing the dollar with the petro-yuan and the special purpose vehicle&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> Chinese oil futures contracts denominated in yuan hit their daily limit with a 5-percent spike on Tuesday as the US kicked off the first round of sanctions against Iran.</p>
<p>Washington’s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal and target the country&#8217;s oil sector with sanctions is expected to significantly boost China&#8217;s leverage to demand crude imports be priced in yuan&#8230;</p>
<p>China, the world’s top oil importer, started its long-anticipated crude oil futures contract that is priced in yuan and convertible into gold. The contract attracted nearly 27 billion yuan ($4 billion) during the first trading session. The step was aimed at diminishing the role of the US dollar in oil trading, strengthening the national currency and at bypassing US sanctions by trading oil in yuan&#8230;</p>
<p>China is expected to become a chief beneficiary of the US unilateral sanctions against the world’s biggest energy producers, including Russia, Iran and Venezuela. &#8211; from <a href="https://www.rt.com/business/435298-iran-sanctions-china-petro-yuan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RT</a> <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> The SPV may prove to be a dangerous precedent, or it may be the boldest move yet in a post-American world that sees China, the EU and others assume greater leadership roles. &#8211; from <a href="https://globalriskinsights.com/2018/10/special-purpose-vehicle-future-iran-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Global Risk Insights</a> <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>It will be interesting to see if the petro-yuan is included in the SPV.</p>
<p>In my yearly <a href="http://redefininggod.com/nwo-schedule-of-implementation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NWO Schedule of Implementation</a> article, I talk about the globalists&#8217; &#8220;running game.&#8221; Well this year, one of their big running plays was the launch of the petro-yuan, and they&#8217;ll get another big gain when the SPV is put in place over the next few weeks. Both of these new mechanisms will continue to grow until the Big Crisis, after which they’ll be merged with the “reformed” UN/NWO and its SDR/“Phoenix” currency for the touchdown.</p>
<h1 style="text-align: center;">Answering a couple of reader comments<br />
(<span style="color: #333333;">expanded</span> &#8211; 13-14 October 2018)</h1>
<p><strong>Here’s the first reader comment&#8230;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>I thought China was going to be spun as part of the good NWO gang, how does that play out with all the negative press they’ll get from rigging elections? Also, doesnt a lot of people in America have a negative view on China already?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>This is my response&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>China, specifically Xi, <strong>WILL</strong> be spun as part of the good NWO gang&#8230; after the “Truth Tsunami.” Just like the globalists portray Trump as struggling with the “Zionist Deep State” in America and going along with them on certain things in order to mollify them, stay in power, and work his “subtle and genius strategy” to overcome them, they’ll do the same thing for Putin, Xi, and the other “Avatars.” Immediately following the climax point of the Big Crisis, the world public will hear propaganda of how Putin mollified and defeated the KGB / Russian Mafia Deep State, and how Xi mollified and defeated the Chinese Communist Party / Triad Deep State.</p>
<p>In the <em>&#8220;Xi Jinping’s assassination, the globalist prophecy fulfillment plan for the Indians and the Chinese, and the 5 Avatars&#8221;</em> section of The Compendium further down this page, I’ve already written the gist of the globalist post-Crisis narrative&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>“When the Dark Forces developed and used the first nuclear weapons in 1945, it became clear that they would use them to slaughter most of humanity and irretrievably subjugate the survivors before the End of the Age. So the Avatars incarnated into human form in order to discreetly intervene. <strong>They infiltrated the Dark’s power structure and rose to leadership</strong> within the major nuclear nations to prevent a nuclear holocaust.</p>
<p>Sensing the imminent defeat of their plans, the Dark Forces struck back by assassinating the Avatars and starting World War 3. And as they pushed the world to the very brink of nuclear destruction, the godhead had to intervene more dramatically by resurrecting the Avatars and sending in cosmic reinforcements before the scheduled End of the Age.”</p></blockquote>
<p>So in order to infiltrate the Dark’s “Deep State” power structures, each “Avatar” supposedly had to pretend to be one of them and do things they’d rather not do to climb the ladder (like the election hack, which will actually aid Xi&#8217;s friend Trump in locking up the US &#8220;Deep State&#8221;). But it will be said that the Avatars always tried to go along with the “Dark Forces” in the least destructive ways possible, like when Trump was forced to take action on Syria over a supposed chemical attack back in April. Here is what I wrote about it at the time&#8230;</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>[Special Note &#8211; 14 April 2018] &#8211; The NWO Historical Account of This Week’s Attack on Syria</strong></h3>
<p>Allow me to show you how the New World Order historians will explain what happened this week with the Syria strike. Their future words are italicized and in quotes&#8230;</p>
<p>“Under overwhelming pressure from the Deep State and their media over the Stormy Daniels affair, and in a weakened position due to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/09/us/politics/fbi-raids-office-of-trumps-longtime-lawyer-michael-cohen.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Monday morning (April 9) FBI raid on his lawyer’s office</a>, President Donald Trump had no choice but to give the neocons the Syria strike they wanted. So late in the morning of April 9th, he agreed to make a decision on a strike within 24-48 hours.”&#8230;<br />

<p>“But in an effort to delay the strike and negotiate for the weakest one possible, he dragged his feet on a decision for the full 48 hours.

<p><span style="color: #333333;">For a preliminary example of the coming NWO propaganda about Putin being “surrounded by corruption but remaining untouched by it” while he infiltrated Russia&#8217;s &#8220;evil Deep State,&#8221; read <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.sott.net/article/398158-Is-Vladimir-Putin-Evil-3-3-The-Corruption-Thing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this reposted article on the Putin-worshipping cult aggregator site SOTT.net</a>&#8230;</span><br />

<p><span style="color: #333333;">The article offers a number of accounts suggesting admirable behavior on the part of Putin, and sums them up in this paragraph&#8230;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> When I came across Tennison&#8217;s article I was still inclined to believe that Putin was corrupt, in some way, so her testimony came as a surprise to me. Tennison&#8217;s article painted a portrait of a man who is quite the opposite of a thug: <strong>Putin stood up to schoolyard bullies; Putin went to the KGB for similar reasons why many young Americans joined the US Army after the terror attacks of September 11, 2001; Putin took no bribes; Putin was courteous and helpful as a public official; Putin turned down privileged treatment for his wife after her car accident</strong>&#8230; The way Tennison portrayed Vladimir Putin was at odds with my stereotype of a typical politician. Still, her account seemed credible. Perhaps Vladimir Putin really is a very highly unusual politician. <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">In my research on Putin, I too encountered a specific account of Putin’s “goodness.” I wrote about it in <a style="color: #333333;" href="http://redefininggod.com/2016/02/vladimir-putin-the-mobster-who-would-be-the-globalist-messiah/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vladimir Putin: The mobster who would be the globalist Messiah</a>. In the relevant section from that article, you&#8217;ll see why Putin cultivated his public “good guy” image while in Saint Petersburg&#8230;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>After arriving in Moscow as an unknown in June of 1996, it took Putin only 3 years and 6 months to rise to the Presidency of Russia. Only 3.5 years!</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Needless to say, you can’t achieve such a meteoric rise without powerful forces working in the background to arrange it for you. The globalists obviously had big plans for Vladimir Putin, and that is why the Russian oligarchs elevated him to power so swiftly. An insight into this is offered in <a style="color: #333333;" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/vladimir-putin/9100388/Vladimir-Putin-the-godfather-of-a-mafia-clan.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Masha Gessen’s Putin biography, <em>The Man Without a Face</em></a>&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> <strong>Foremost in the dwindling circle of Yeltsin’s allies and supporters known as &#8216;the family’ was the oligarch Boris Berezovsky; indeed, many believed Berezovsky to be the real power behind Yeltsin’s throne.</strong> Berezovsky knew Putin from the early 1990s in St Petersburg when, in the first flush of buccaneering capitalism, Berezovsky was aiming to expand his car dealership and Putin was a minor city bureaucrat.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Putin arranged for Berezovsky to open a service station in the city, and declined to take a bribe. &#8216;He was the first bureaucrat who did not take bribes,’ Berezovsky told Gessen. &#8216;Seriously. It made a huge impression on me.’</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Berezovsky began to vigorously promote Putin, among &#8216;the family’ and to Yeltsin himself.</strong> He would remember Yeltsin’s reaction on meeting Putin: &#8216;He seems all right,’ the president said of his putative successor, &#8216;but he’s kind of small.’ In August 1999 Yeltsin appointed Putin prime minister. <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">After Putin was installed as the fresh new face of oligarchic rule in Russia, an effort was made to distance him from the scandals of the Yeltsin era and make him look like “change we [Russians] can believe in” (to borrow a phrase from the American version of the trick). It is for this reason that certain oligarchs took on the <strong>public roles</strong> of “opponents of Putin.” And due to his close ties to Yeltsin, Berezovsky himself took on such a role. As <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Berezovsky_%28businessman%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his Wikipedia bio</a> states&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">“Berezovsky was politically opposed to the President of Russia Vladimir Putin, since Putin&#8217;s election in 2000 and remained a vocal critic of Putin for the rest of his life. In late 2000, after the Russian Deputy Prosecutor General demanded that Berezovsky appear for questioning, he did not return from abroad and moved to the UK, which granted him political asylum in 2003.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">So Berezovsky, who played a <strong>behind-the-scenes role</strong> in placing Putin into the Presidency of Russia, took on the <strong>public role</strong> of Putin’s opposition, then ran off to the UK. <strong>In doing this, he effectively served as the scapegoat that took the sins of the Yeltsin Administration far away from Putin (so the public would think that Putin’s Administration was a real change from Yeltsin’s).</strong> As we’ll discover later when looking at Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Berezovsky wasn’t the only oligarch to play the role of fake opposition to make Putin look good.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">So having played the &#8220;knight in shining armor&#8221; role in ending the era of Yeltsin in Russia, Putin will now play the same role in ending the era of Western rule over the world. And to get the public to believe in his goodness, they&#8217;ll take advantage of people&#8217;s naivete and willingness to believe in fairy tales, like that of the &#8220;5 Avatars.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>Here’s the second reader comment&#8230;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Why do you always lie? “Looks like the cabal is postponing its plan” should be your catchphrase. You haven’t been right with any of your bullshit predictions. You are worse than the Q Anon cult.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>This is my response&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Looks like the cabal is postponing its plan&#8221; <strong>IS</strong> my catchphrase. Good catch on your part. You must be a regular reader.</p>
<p>As for my &#8220;bullsh*t predictions,&#8221; I’m not in the prediction business; I’m in the exposure business. A successful exposure and prevention looks like a failed prediction. And a failed exposure and prevention looks like a successful prediction. As frustrating as it is to do this job, I will always choose the successful exposure over the successful prediction. This is not a task for those who seek ego validation, fame or fortune.</p>
<p>That being said, is it possible that I’m some deluded and quixotic figure who’s tilting at globalist windmills? Yes, that’s entirely possible, but I don’t think so. After looking at everything I’ve seen and doing the math, my conclusions check out (at least to my mind). Despite my manifold flaws as a human being, I’m fairly good at getting the right answer on problems, so I’ll stand my ground and continue tilting till I drop dead. And since I refuse to drop dead until I get my son safely through his life, the windmills are doomed. I have decades more in this &#8220;charming&#8221; reality. Oh joy! 😛</p>
<p>&#8220;When in hell, enjoy the barbecue.&#8221; &#8211; that&#8217;s my other catchphrase.</p>
<p><strong>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">Twice-Expanded</span> Note &#8211; 11-12 October 2018) &#8211;</strong> In the next few hours, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/10/11/fate-detained-u-s-pastor-andrew-brunson-could-determined-soon/1606448002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American pastor Andrew Brunson will have his court date in Turkey</a>. Should Erdogan fail to release him, it&#8217;s been suggested that Turkey will get hit with a new round of sanctions. So what happens with this situation starting tomorrow will tell us about the globalists’ pacing for the coming Big Crisis: a Brunson release = slow pacing, and his continued detention = fast pacing. Also, a continued detention + immediate sanctions would mean a continued downward move in the markets as we approach the midterm election. Trump&#8217;s &#8220;impulsiveness&#8221; would be blamed.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>~ MORE &#8211; 12 October 2018 ~</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://news.trust.org//item/20181012133224-ru7ql/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Erdogan has released Brunson</a>. This means that Turkey&#8217;s economic collapse and the migrant invasion of Europe that will follow it have been postponed. So time is now available to do the &#8220;stolen election&#8221; and its <strong>aftermath</strong>, which I&#8217;ll write about today.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>~ MORE &#8211; 12 October 2018 ~</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>The Globalist Script for the Stolen Election and its Aftermath</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">In <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-10-04/the-big-hack-how-china-used-a-tiny-chip-to-infiltrate-america-s-top-companies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the original article on China’s “Big Hack,”</a> it was noted that US intelligence had been tracking the hack for years. And with Trump speaking out about Chinese interference in the midterm election and Bolsonaro complaining about anomalies with Brazil’s electronic voting machines, <strong>the globalist script will reflect that Trump and his “white hat” allies in the US letter agencies have set a surveillance trap to catch China red-handed on election day</strong>. So when the Chinese manipulate the vote and the US mainstream media rush to declare Democratic victories, Trump will blow the whistle on the hack. That’s when the fun begins.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">After announcing the hack, Trump and Congress will order a Mueller-like investigation into Chinese interference in the election, with the aim of thoroughly sorting out what happened prior to the new Congress taking office in January. And unlike the “Russian interference” investigation that dragged on and drilled into a dry hole, the “Chinese interference” investigation will move swiftly and drill into a gusher. Vast evidence of complicity between the Chicoms and the Democratic leaders will be found, and the electronic voting machines will be cracked open and the Chinese spy chips within them will be shown to the public. Trump will then have the Democrats not only on conspiracy and corruption charges, but on <strong>treason</strong> charges as well, and treason is punishable by death (especially when military tribunals are conducting the trials).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Once Trump announces the investigation, the globalist script will portray the Democrats as desperately fighting for their lives, literally. So they will go to any and all lengths to save themselves from the gallows. This means that they’ll rabidly go after Trump either by assassination, impeachment or the 25th Amendment. It also means that they’ll employ explosive rhetoric with their followers. “We won the election and Trump is trying to steal it from us,” they’ll scream, “The fascist Trump is destroying our democracy RIGHT NOW, and we must use ANY MEANS NECESSARY to stop him!” The paid Soros brigades will then hit the streets to violently (and sometimes fatally) attack conservatives, and any attempt by Trump to restore order will be decried as a “dictatorial crackdown on dissent.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">At some point the military will step in to stop the madness, and the people will cheer. &#8220;Mass Arrests&#8221; will clear Washington of pretty much everyone except the globalist-chosen new leaders (like Rand Paul, Tulsi Gabbard, etc.).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Of course, the Brazilians will undergo the same process. It is likely that the globalists will script a Bolsonaro loss on October 28 amidst claims of electronic voting machine manipulation. Bolsonaro’s complaints will be trashed by the mainstream media, but they&#8217;ll nonetheless receive wide coverage. This will help put the idea into people’s minds a week before the US election.</span></p>
<p><strong>(<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #333333;">Expanded Note</span></span> &#8211; 9-10 October 2018) &#8211; The hows and whys of the “China interference” script</strong></p>
<p>It all started last month when Trump sat as the President of the UN Security Council. Here is a passage from <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/9/26/17905722/trump-china-2018-election-interference-trade-war" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Vox article</a> about what happened&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> President Donald Trump just publicly accused China of interfering in the 2018 US midterm elections in front of more than a dozen world leaders at a meeting of the United Nations Security Council.</p>
<p>“Regrettably, <strong>we found that China has been attempting to interfere in our upcoming 2018 election coming up in November against my administration</strong>,” Trump said on Wednesday. “<strong>They do not want me or us to win because I am the first president ever to challenge China on trade.</strong>” <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>When I heard about this at the time, I thought he was preparing to launch a “China interference” investigation as a counterstrike to the Democrats’ “Russian interference” investigation. But I decided to wait for more developments before writing about it. This week, those developments occurred.</p>
<p>First, there was <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-10-04/the-big-hack-how-china-used-a-tiny-chip-to-infiltrate-america-s-top-companies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the story about China placing spy components on electronic motherboards that are used all over the world</a>. This provided a physical means to interfere with the upcoming election. Then, there was this&#8230;<br />

&#8230;from <a href="https://qz.com/1416512/bolsonaro-questions-brazils-voting-machines-especially-if-he-loses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quartz</a></p>
<p>So the globalists’ “Chinese interference” script for the 2018 elections is becoming quite clear. China will use its spy chips and hacking brigades to support leftists in the Brazilian and American elections via the electronic voting machines and the computer networks that transmit the vote count. In fact, they may have already done so. Bolsonaro claims that <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/brazil-election-jair-bolsonaro-winner-no-majority-october-2018-10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he would have won a majority of the vote in the first round of the Brazilian election had it not been for irregularities with the electronic voting machines</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>~ MORE &#8211; 10 October 2018 ~</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Yesterday, the globalists flourished their “China interference” card again by having Bloomberg release <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-09/new-evidence-of-hacked-supermicro-hardware-found-in-u-s-telecom" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another article on “The Big Hack.”</a> The purpose of the new article is to move people towards seeing the ubiquitous nature of the Chinese effort&#8230;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> “<strong>For China, these efforts are all-encompassing</strong>,” said Tony Lawrence, CEO of VOR Technology, a Columbia, Maryland-based contractor to the intelligence community. “<strong>There is no way for us to identify the gravity or the size of these exploits &#8211; we don&#8217;t know until we find some. It could be all over the place &#8211; it could be anything coming out of China. The unknown is what gets you and that&#8217;s where we are now. We don&#8217;t know the level of exploits within our own systems.</strong>” <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Now imagine for a moment that such spy chips are on the motherboards of the electronic voting machines and the PCs used to tabulate the votes. Can you see how the Chinese communists could interfere with the following US vote tabulation process? [My comments are in brackets]&#8230;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> In most places, the voting process looks a little like this: People go to their designated polling place, their name is checked off the voter rolls and they vote, either with a paper ballot that is <strong>optically scanned by a machine</strong>, an <strong>electronic voting machine</strong> or, very rarely, a paper ballot that is hand-read, Foley said. [So for both optical scanning machines and electronic voting machines, which are used in the overwhelming majority of voting places, The Big Hack is in play.]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">In the case of optically scanned ballots, once voting for the day is done, a poll worker pushes a little button on <strong>a computer that automatically tabulates the votes</strong>. Then, the machine will print out a grocery-receipt-like record with the vote tally, which is usually taped to the door of the polling place, Stewart said. Several copies of this printout are generated, and those copies, along with <strong>a computer card that stores the results</strong>, are bundled together and immediately sent to one of the central counting offices, which may be either a dedicated elections department or the county courthouse, Stewart said. (Some counties take uncounted ballots directly from the polling place to have them read by an optical scanner in the county courthouse, Stewart added.) [So the computer that tabulates the votes and the computer card that stores the results are both hackable.]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Once these memory cards from all of the polling places are received by the central office, &#8220;<strong>they&#8217;re popped into a computer</strong> much like you would pop a USB thumb drive into a computer,&#8221; Stewart said. <strong>This computer then tallies all of the results and begins to generate a preliminary vote-count report</strong>, Stewart said. [So after the hackable results come to the central office, they’re processed by another hackable computer.]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Then, this preliminary vote count can be conveyed in a number of ways. In some places, a &#8220;stringer&#8221; for the Associated Press (AP) will sit there and call in the results to the central AP call center, Stewart said. In other places, the results will be pushed via phone or <strong>internet</strong> to state officials, who will report the results. [After the two previous layers of hackable activities, states that report by internet can be hacked a third time.]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">To prevent an election from being &#8220;hacked,&#8221; some states even have their own separate, secure wires for transmitting election results between the county and the state, Foley said. [If one or both of the computers that communicate over the “secure wire” is hacked, either at the hardware or software level, the “secure wire” becomes a farce.] &#8211; from <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.livescience.com/56787-how-are-votes-counted.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Live Science</a> <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">So as you can see, <strong>if the Chinese have the will to hack the election (which is provided by Trump’s “trade war”), they have the means to carry it out</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The best way for the globalists to play this “China interference” card is to use it within the context of an election that is stolen by the left. Here’s how that effort is shaping up&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Step 1 &#8211; Have the leftist-controlled media band together to bombard Trump and other Republicans with negative press</strong> &#8212; <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://dailycaller.com/2018/10/09/trump-tv-coverage-negative-summer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DONE</a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Step 2 &#8211; Have the leftist-controlled internet companies band together to shut down and marginalize right-wing voices</strong> &#8212; <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.infowars.com/trump-slams-big-tech-censorship-americans-deserve-same-free-speech-rights-as-the-media/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DONE</a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Step 3 &#8211; Have the leftist-controlled polling organizations band together to portray a Democratic lead in the Congressional races</strong> &#8212; IN PROGRESS (news of this will come out during the post-election investigation)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Step 4 &#8211; Play the &#8220;China interference&#8221; card by having the Chicoms manipulate the voting results to falsely show key Democratic victories and Democratic control of the next Congress.</strong> &#8212; COMING</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Step 5 &#8211; Have the leftist-controlled media announce the Democratic victories as a done deal while decrying any effort to investigate election manipulation as “an attempt to steal the election.”</strong> &#8212; COMING</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">In the next addition, I’ll show you their plan for after the stolen election&#8230;</span></p>
<p><strong>(8 October 2018) &#8211;</strong> I took my son on an outing today, so there&#8217;ll be no update. But tomorrow, we&#8217;ll have a look at how <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-10-04/the-big-hack-how-china-used-a-tiny-chip-to-infiltrate-america-s-top-companies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">China&#8217;s big hardware hack</a> will fit in with the &#8220;Chinese interference in America&#8217;s election&#8221; meme Trump launched at the UN last month. This interference by a foreign communist power may also play into the second round of the Brazilian election. <em><strong>The Democratic Party conspiring with a hated foreign government would make for great treason charges and mass arrests, wouldn&#8217;t it?</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>(7 October 2018) &#8211;</strong> Here are some points worth mentioning today&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>&gt;</strong> Kavanaugh is now in the Supreme Court, and the “leftists” have a month until the midterms to demonstrate their dissatisfaction. So now we wait and see if the globalists pull the trigger.</p>
<p><strong>&gt;</strong> The Brazilian election is underway today, and here is an interesting little tidbit about the “right-wing” frontrunner&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> Bolsonaro, a former army captain, has repeatedly spoken out in favour of Brazil&#8217;s military government, which was in power from 1964-85.</p>
<p>He has promised to fill his cabinet with military generals and his running mate, retired army general Hamilton Mourao, hinted last year that <strong>he would be in favour of a military takeover of government if corrupt officials were not dealt with by Brazil&#8217;s courts</strong>. &#8212; from <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/10/brazil-bolsonaro-pulls-eve-presidential-election-181006163216965.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Al Jazeera</a> <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>So the globalist plan for “mass arrests” of leftist officials is in play in Brazil as well.</p>
<p><strong>&gt;</strong> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-10-04/the-big-hack-how-china-used-a-tiny-chip-to-infiltrate-america-s-top-companies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A massive Chinese hardware hack made the news this week</a>. By telling the public about it, the globalists can now blame the Chinese communists for the cyberattacks that will come when the Big Crisis hits. In reality, though, the globalists will be staging the attacks using hardware backdoors like the Intel Management Engine that are built right into the microprocessors. To learn more about this, scroll down to The Compendium and read the section titled &#8220;The Fake EMP Threat, Bitcoin, and the Great Encryption Lie.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>&gt;</strong> With <a href="https://sputniknews.com/analysis/201810011068499258-us-navy-aircraft-carrier-deployments-fall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all but a few aircraft carriers laid up for long-delayed maintenance</a> and with a high-tech fighting force that is supposedly compromised by sabotaged Chinese computer boards, the US is ill-prepared to fight a three-front war (1. the Middle East, 2. the South China Sea, 3. Ukraine). These conditions will lead to our humbling defeat if the globalists take the War Path, and to our de facto surrender if they take the Peace Path. When we suddenly find out that Russian missiles can shoot down our stealth planes and that <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/09/24/russia-jam-signals-syria-supply-regime-advanced-anti-missile/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Russian “electronic warfare jamming”</a> and Chinese sleeper chips can deactivate our systems, we won’t have a leg to stand on.</p>
<p>As I&#8217;ve mentioned in previous entries, Russia&#8217;s &#8220;revolutionary electronic warfare technology&#8221; likely utilizes globalist-supplied kill codes for the microchips in US warfighting systems.</p>

So between now and the vote tomorrow is the ideal timing for a “leftist” attack on at least two Republican senators (or Kavanaugh / his family). The “leftists” could stop the nomination by doing so. Of course, they could also stage the attacks as “retribution” after Kavanaugh is confirmed. Either way, we’ve entered the October Surprise Danger Zone.</span></p>

<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> “<strong>Senator Susan Collins is the mother &amp; grandmother of white women in America who gave us a Donald Trump presidency.</strong> The 53%,” tweeted <strong>Linda Sarsour</strong>, a far-left activist and a leader of the Women’s March that branded Collins a “rape apologist” after the speech. “She is a disgrace &amp; her legacy will be that she was a traitor to women and marginalized communities. History will not treat her kindly.”</p>
<p>“<strong>A white woman Senator</strong> is talking about presumption of innocence that is never offered to Black men in America. You are watching <strong>white supremacy</strong> live on the Senate Floor,” Sarsour said even before Collins finished her speech.</p>
<p><strong>Kat Calvin</strong>, the founder of anti-voter ID group “Spread the Vote” that claims to be non-partisan, urges people to publicly harass Collins over her voting decision.</p>
<p><strong>“Never let Collins have a moment of peace in public again,”</strong> she wrote. <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>As you can see, the “leftist” mouthpieces are spitting venom to piss off white women and trigger a strong rightward backlash once the blood starts flowing. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Sarsour" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Linda Sarsour is a leftist Muslim</a>, and Kat Calvin’s funding can be traced back to George Soros and his ilk (<a href="https://www.spreadthevote.org/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spread the Vote</a> &gt; <a href="https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/2018/7/16/means-to-an-end-how-a-venture-funding-group-backs-progressive-tech" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Media Ventures</a> &gt; <a href="https://capitalresearch.org/article/democracy-alliances-new-project/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democracy Alliance / Soros</a>).</p>

<p>The Israelis are confident in attempting new strikes because of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-israel-greece/israel-trained-against-russian-made-air-defense-system-in-greece-sources-idUSKBN0TN10G20151204" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the knowledge they’ve gained by training against Greece’s S-300 system</a>. But as press reports have indicated, the Syrian S-300 will slot-in to <a href="http://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/13836/its-official-russia-and-syria-have-linked-their-air-defense-networks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the existing Russian-Syrian integrated air defense system</a> that includes S-400 anti-stealth radars. So the globalist script will reflect that the F-35s were shot down with S-300 missiles guided by S-400 eyes. And the event is scripted to shock the military confidence of Israel and the West.</p>

<p>As I’ve covered in previous writings, he is the globalists’ top candidate for the post-crisis US presidency. Adding another “Commie-Crat” assault against him would give him another purple heart to wear during his campaign. But in the unlikely event they decide to remove him from the script, look for Tulsi Gabbard to start getting more media attention.</p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">To keep her clean for what they want to do with her after the Big Crisis, Gabbard&#8217;s handlers have had her steer clear of the Kavanaugh / Ford minefield. Here&#8217;s her comment on the subject&#8230;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Rep. Tulsi Gabbard</strong> (D-Hawaii): “For the good of the country, the Senate needs to put aside partisan politics. ALL Americans need to have faith in the Supreme Court and process. Solution is FBI objectively gather whatever evidence exists and present it to Senate without delay before vote.” &#8211; from <a style="color: #333333;" href="http://www.rafu.com/2018/09/capac-members-comment-on-ford-kavanaugh-hearing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Rafu Shimpo</a></span></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>(<span style="color: #333333;">Enhanced</span> Note &#8211; 3-4 October 2018) &#8211; </strong>Senator Cruz may be one of the &#8220;#MeToo murder&#8221; targets for the October Surprise. I&#8217;ll tell you why later today (or by Thursday morning at the latest).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>~ MORE &#8211; 4 October ~</strong></p>
<p>While I wait to hear the motive ascribed to the former Navy sailor who created the ricin scare, I’ll simply note that Senator Cruz has been targeted twice in as many weeks: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/local/wp/2018/09/25/ted-cruz-and-wife-shouted-out-of-d-c-restaurant-over-his-support-for-kavanaugh/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.869c7def4c08" target="_blank" rel="noopener">once at the DC restaurant by &#8220;crazed leftists&#8221;</a> and <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/envelope-white-powder-sent-ted-cruz-office-1149425" target="_blank" rel="noopener">once at his Houston campaign headquarters by a powder-filled letter</a>. These incidents could be the setup for a more damaging attack on him in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Cruz, who has the charisma of a wet smallpox blanket, is facing off against a Democratic challenger (<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/409224-texas-governor-describes-beto-orourke-as-cult-like-figure" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beto</a>) who looks like a Kennedy, and there&#8217;s a good chance he&#8217;ll lose the election. So making him the target of the October Surprise would serve two purposes: 1) it would hold his seat in the Senate for the right, and 2) it would help generate the backlash that would hold the rest of the Congress for the right too. On top of that, his death or disability could be used to place George P. Bush into the US Senate.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/EL/htm/EL.204.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Texas election law</a>, a US Senate vacancy created this month would get filled by an appointee of the (Republican) Texas governor until a special election can be held. And if it is a Democrat or Beto supporter who kills or disables Cruz, Beto wouldn’t have a snowball’s chance in hell of being elected. They could put literally ANY Republican up against him and the Republican would win. That’s where George P. Bush comes in. The crazy-eyed <a href="http://www.thesmokinggun.com/buster/george-p-bush/george-p-bush-stalking-758409" target="_blank" rel="noopener">alleged stalker</a> and Bush scion probably couldn’t get elected to the Senate on his own, but this Cruz gambit could get him through the door. And with incumbency thus bestowed upon him, he might be able to stay.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also worth mentioning that both Kavanaugh and Cruz are very close to the Bush family, and that <a href="https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/politics/George-P-Was-Only-Bush-to-Campaign-for-Trump-400658121.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Bushes had George P. come out in support of Trump</a>. And let&#8217;s not forget that George H.W. Bush was a Director of the CIA.</p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">To also bring a little Hollywood weirdness into this, it should be noted that <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Horror_Story:_Cult" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>American Horror Story: Cult</em></a> just recently came out of Netflix streaming.

&#8230;from <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/439996-iran-missiles-syria-ahvaz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RT</a></p>
<p>So the globalist script now reflects that the Iranians have done their counterstrike for the Ahvaz “terror attack,” which means we’ll probably have to wait for another provocation against Iran before we see the “missiles out of Yemen / Iraq” false-flag.</p>
<p>That being the case, we turn our attention to Israel. Back in April of this year, they stated that if Russia provides Syria with the S-300 air defense system (<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/09/russian-fm-lavrov-delivery-300-syria-regime-begun-180929054212640.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which the Russians are now doing</a>), <a href="https://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/244454" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Russia would be crossing a red line with Israel</a>. They also stated that <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liberman-israel-would-destroy-syrian-s-300-if-it-attacked-our-jets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">if the S-300 attacks an Israeli aircraft, they would destroy it</a>. So now we wait for the Israelis to start testing the S-300.</p>
<p>They might start with a standoff attack using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delilah_(missile)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Delilah missiles</a>, which have a 250 km range (<a href="https://www.rt.com/news/439243-s300-missiles-syria-israel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the same range as the S-300</a>). We can expect these missiles to be shot down. They might then attempt a strike with F-35 stealth planes. We can expect that attack to fail as well. And after the F-35s are shot down, they might attempt another chemical false flag in order to unleash a massive Israel + US coalition air assault upon the system. An interesting question is &#8220;would the Turks join in?&#8221;</p>
<p>So the drama football is now in the hands of Avigdor Lieberman, the Israeli Defense Minister and Chabad-Lubavitcher.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>~ MORE ~</strong></p>
<p>A reader brought up an interesting point, so let me share my thoughts on it&#8230;</p>
<p>Currently, the polls in Brazil indicate that <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/28/reuters-america-brazils-left-presidential-candidate-haddad-beats-far-right-bolsonaro-poll.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the leftist Haddad would win over the rightist Bolsonaro in the second round of the presidential election</a>, just like the polls in the US indicate that <a href="https://www.axios.com/signs-of-a-blue-wave-midterms-0742c13a-c11d-4a90-9794-438bea036277.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Democrats will take control of the Congress</a>. But as I’ve said, the globalists are aiming to generate a backlash against the leftists so there will be a surprise conservative victory in both places.</p>
<p><strong>If the globalists go ahead with their plans and script the conservative victories to happen</strong>, the leftists will go bananas and take to the streets flinging feces in all directions. This will enable the domestic crackdowns to begin. It will also help establish the idea in the US that “the only alternative the Deep State and the leftists now have is to assassinate Trump,” which would set the stage for what happens in Paris.</p>
<p><strong>But if the globalists decide to hit the delay button again and script leftist victories</strong>, it means they’ll subject us to months if not years more of “leftist insanity,” which will greatly amplify the public backlash against the left and open the door for public acceptance of military coups to restore order.</p>
<p>The military coup in Brazil would involve expelling the leftists and installing Bolsonaro due to “widespread leftist election fraud.” That’s why we saw this in the news last week&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> Brazil’s far-right presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro said Friday he would only accept the result of next month’s election if he wins, suggesting that <strong>any victory by a rival would be through fraud</strong>. &#8211; from <a href="https://apnews.com/cf7b7e9a9e0f48439f5e49b5ba1ebf1b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AP</a> <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>So as of 4 days ago, the globalists started laying the groundwork for a possible delay in their plans.</p>
<p>As for the military coup / mass arrests in the US, it would save Trump if he’s still alive, or it would install the highest ranking official who isn’t arrested, either Rand Paul or some other conservative caretaker. After the coup, Rand Paul or Tulsi Gabbard would be elected as the first NWO President of the US (I would include Elizabeth Warren in that list, but I think &#8220;Pocahontas&#8221; has lost too much credibility and is too closely tied to the leftists).</p>
<p><strong>(1 October 2018) &#8211; Why the globalists are making history repeat itself</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/wheelopain101.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7882" src="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/wheelopain101.png" alt="" width="468" height="216" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/wheelopain101.png 468w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/wheelopain101-300x138.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px" /></a></p>
<p>I’ve written extensively of the globalists’ plans to bring in the New World Order, make it look like heaven at first, make it look like hell later, and end it in such a way that the public will conclude that “we humans are incapable of ruling themselves; we need God do it.” They are doing this with the intention of providing us a “God” to do the job: THEIR “Jesus Christ,” who will defeat “the Anti-Christ Putin” and bring the world back to the “center,” with no more left-wing or right-wing extremism (because his bosses, the globalists, will no longer be organizing and funding such mischief).</p>
<p>Well in order to get people to come to the “we can’t rule ourselves” conclusion that will open the way for their god-like rule over us, they are deliberately repeating German World War 2 history on a global scale. They are having their “left-wing liberal internationalists / communists” bring chaos so their “right-wing conservative nationalists / capitalists” can restore order. And just like they did with Hitler, they will have their “right-wing” leaders become increasingly tyrannical after the NWO gets established.</p>
<p>Have a look at this bit of history and ask yourself if you see any parallels to today&#8230;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> In 1932, German President Paul von Hindenburg, old, tired, and a bit senile, had won re-election as president, but had lost a considerable portion of his <strong>right/conservative</strong> support to the Nazi Party. Those close to the president wanted a cozier relationship to Hitler and the Nazis&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As Hindenburg’s current chancellor could no longer gain a majority in the Reichstag, and <strong>Hitler could bring together a larger swath of the masses and a unified right / conservative / nationalist coalition</strong>, the president gave in. In January 1933, Hitler was named chancellor of Germany&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But that was not enough for Hitler either. In February 1933, <strong>Hitler blamed a devastating Reichstag fire on the communists</strong>&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Intimidation, and fear of the communists</strong>, brought Hitler a 90 percent majority. He was now, for all intents and purposes, dictator. &#8211; from <a href="https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/adolf-hitler-becomes-president-of-germany" target="_blank" rel="noopener">History.com</a> <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can see, the globalists are having us repeat history, and they’re doing it to convince us that we are perpetually stuck in cycles “that only God can break us out of.” The reality, though, is that these cycles are entirely artificial. They happen because we allow ourselves to be led around in circles by the carrots and sticks we are offered by our current influencers / controllers. The big drama that is unfolding in the world right now isn’t a natural occurrence; it is the result of a plan, as were WWI and WWII.</p>
<p>If you want God to deliver you from all this, you first need to look to “him,” so <strong>look in the mirror</strong>, <strong>look at the people right next to you</strong>, and look to all your hands for action, your mouths for speaking the truth, and your heads, hearts, and intuition for guidance &#8212; <a href="http://redefininggod.com/real-solutions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that’s from where your deliverance will come</a>. But one place to which you shouldn&#8217;t look is the trillion-dollar magic show that’s coming &#8212; that’s from where your continued enslavement will come. Enjoy the show, but don’t get sucked in by it. It&#8217;s just more Hollywood-style bullsh*t.</p>
<p>I almost feel sorry for the globalists. To work on this massive project for hundreds, if not thousands, of years only to have people see through it right before the final show begins &#8212; it must be heartbreaking. A thousand years from now, a free humanity will look back at the colossal folly of the Kabbalists and laugh at the sheer hubris and stupidity of what they tried to do. So laughter will be their only lasting legacy. I guess that’s not so bad after all.</p>
<p><strong>(Expanded and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Enhanced</span> Note &#8211; 30 September 2018) &#8211;</strong> Switching our gaze back to the Middle East for a moment, the UN is narrating that <a href="https://www.portstrategy.com/news101/world/middle-east/hodeidah-fighting-is-choking-port" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the fight over the Port of Hodeidah is choking off supplies to the Houthis and the rest of Yemen’s people</a>. This is important because it helps set up the cover story for the “cruise missiles out of Yemen” false flag.</p>
<p>The globalists will have the Israel-US-Saudi Arabia Cabal launch a false-flag missile attack on Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. They will then point the finger of blame at the Houthis and the Iranians, saying&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>“the Houthis were desperate over the pending loss of Hodeidah, so they wanted to strike out against their foes to bring more international attention to the situation in Yemen,” and</li>
<li>“the Iranians wanted payback against the nations they blame for the military parade massacre in Ahvaz,” so</li>
<li>“they jointly agreed to launch a large salvo of cruise and ballistic missiles on their mutual enemies.”</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE, watch for targeting of the US garrison in Al Tanf, Syria and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/28/politics/us-consulate-basra-evacuation/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the US diplomatic compounds in Iraq</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>~ MORE ~</strong></p>
<p>Some of the missiles for the false-flag will likely be fired from positions inside Iraq also, so the “<a href="https://iranprimer.usip.org/blog/2018/apr/26/part-2-pro-iran-militias-iraq" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Iran-allied Shiite militias in Iraq</a>” will get some blame as well. The alt-media narrative will say that the Israeli-US-Saudi Arabia Cabal did this so they could attack Iranian influence in Iraq and disrupt ground shipments of Iranian supplies to Syria via Iraq.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The Iraq angle could potentially be used to justify a ground incursion into Iraq by a Saudi-led military coalition (+ the US). This could put substantial coalition ground forces on the borders of Iran and Syria for the Big Showdown.</strong></span></p>
<p>For more information on the setup for this event, scroll down to <em>The Compendium</em> and read the section titled &#8220;The false-flag &#8216;Houthi&#8217; cruise missile attack.&#8221;</p>
<h1 style="text-align: center;">Election Watch 2018<br />
(+ an Iran False-Flag Watch)</h1>
<p>I’ll be using the home page to monitor events as we go through October into the November 6 election and the November 11 Trump trip to Paris. If the globalists follow through with their plans, we’ll see an October Surprise, a Republican victory, a leftist hissy fit, and a possible assassination in Paris. If we see none of that, we will have won again. In a separate section below the Election Watch is information on the pending false-flag attack to be blamed on Iran.</p>
<p>Let me preface my remarks by telling new readers that the globalists control both sides in the current political drama: both the “Establishment” side (Obama, Clinton, Soros, the Bilderbergers, the mainstream media, etc.) and the “Anti-Establishment” side (Trump, Le Pen, Putin, the BRICS, the alternative media, etc.). They are deliberately staging a dialectic conflict between these two controlled fronts in order to implode their existing “Establishment” and erect a new one (the New World Order) in its place. That is the true narrative of what’s going on in our world today.</p>
<p>What I’ll be covering in the writings that follow are the specific events and false narratives they’re attempting to use in moving us into the NWO. Since there are two controlled sides to the staged conflict, there are two false narratives the globalists are spinning: <strong>1) the mainstream narrative is the Establishment-side propaganda they sell to the sleepers</strong>, and <strong>2) the alt-media narrative is the Anti-Establishment-Side propaganda they sell to those who are awakening</strong>. They want you to come to see the mainstream narrative as a lie and the alt-media narrative as the truth. That’s because today’s alt-media will be the mainstream media of the New World Order.</p>
<p>So here’s what they’re trying to do to bring in the NWO&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>(Expanded Note &#8211; 28 September 2018) &#8211;</strong> Well here’s the new number one candidate for the October Surprise: a leftist assault on Kavanaugh and/or his family that results in serious injury or death&#8230;<br />

<p><strong>(26 September 2018) &#8211; Pushing the Voters to the Right &amp; The “Mass Arrests” Rumor</strong></p>
<p>In past entries, I’ve talked about the globalist effort to shift people to the “political right” in preparation for the launch of the real &#8220;right-wing NWO” (the much publicized and feared “left-wing NWO” is just a decoy used to scare us to the right). And if you look at recent news, you can see some clear examples of this &#8220;push &#8217;em to the right&#8221; effort&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>&gt; The globalists are having the Democrats exhibit “Trump Derangement Syndrome” and conduct their over-the-top, easily disproven smear campaign on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh to push fair-minded people into the Trump camp.</strong> The Democrats’ blatantly unfair and sleazy attacks are meant to energize Trump’s base, push independents towards the Republicans, and disgust ordinary Democrats. So if you&#8217;ve found yourself yelling at your TV or PC over the unfairness of the allegations and press coverage, their strategy is working. Basically, the Democrats are smearing their way to an election loss, and they’re doing it because their bosses told them to.</p>
<p><strong>&gt; The globalists arranged for an ugly group of left-wing extremists to drive Senator Ted Cruz and his wife out of a Washington, DC restaurant yesterday.</strong> Cruz is in a tight race with a more charismatic Democrat, Beto O&#8217;Rourke, but Texans will think twice before voting for the challenger now. <em>“A vote for Beto is a vote for the left-wing thugs,”</em> is what they’ll be thinking.</p>
<p><strong>&gt; The globalists arranged for “Brazil’s Donald Trump,” Jair Bolsonaro, to be stabbed by a leftist</strong> (whether the stabbing was real or done with a theatrical knife, I haven’t examined). Since then, he has surged 10 points in the presidential polls.</p>
<p>Watch for more “left-wing lunacy” and over-the-top outrages as we approach the elections.</p>
<p>In my September 23 update, I mentioned the Kavanaugh news and the “mass arrests” article and said, “More on all this later&#8230;” Well, today is later, and what I’ve written above covers the Kavanaugh stuff. So here’s something I wrote earlier this year about the “mass arrests” scenario&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>To transition us happily into the NWO, the globalists are having their Western minions wear “dark hats” and play the role of the “bad guys,” and they’re having their Eastern minions wear “white hats” and play the role of the “good guys.” After having the “Western bad guys” push humanity to the seeming brink of nuclear destruction, they’ll have the “Eastern good guys,” led by Vladimir Putin, step up to save the day.</p>
<p>That being said, the globalists need to create a believable chain of events that will lead to the removal of the current “evil Western Establishment” and to their replacement by white hat globalist minions like Rand Paul, Nigel Farage, Marine Le Pen, etc. And <strong>there are two ways of getting rid of the old to make way for the new</strong>; I wrote about them last year…</p>
<p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> And come to think of it, <strong>an unexpected nuke strike on Washington</strong> while Congress is in town would be a good way for the globalists to “drain the swamp” of federal officialdom. It would save them all the trouble of <strong>mass-arresting them for pedophilia / corruption / racketeering / treason</strong>, and it would keep their mouths shut (because the bodies to which those mouths are attached would be dead). Look for Mike Pence, Rand Paul, and Elizabeth Warren to survive any such strike; they have roles to play in what happens afterwards. <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p>
<p>So the globalists have two options for “changing the guard” in the West: 1) blow them up, or <strong>2) “Mass Arrest” them and put them through Nuremberg-type show trials</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>(23 September 2018) &#8211;</strong> It looks like they’re ramping up the drama going into this week. There are new, over-the-top allegations being brought against Supreme Court Nominee Kavanaugh, there are leftists protesters reportedly being bussed into Washington, and there’s also this&#8230;<br />

<p><strong>Now here are some sections about the coming Iran false-flag&#8230;</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>(22 September 2018) &#8211;</strong> The first part of the false-flag to be blamed on Iran was carried out today. Gunmen attacked a military parade in Iran, reportedly killing two dozen people and injuring about sixty more. And the Iranians are pointing the finger of blame at the usual suspects&#8230;</span><br />

<p><span style="color: #333333;">Now the Israel-US-Saudi Arabia cabal can fire missiles at themselves from positions inside Yemen and/or Iraq and people will think it was the Iranians retaliating for the parade attack and previous offenses.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #333333;">According to the globalist script, if Iran responds, they fall into the trap for the US-Israeli ambush at the UN next week. And if they don’t respond, the Israel-US-Saudi Arabia cabal (IUSSAC) will respond for them (with the false-flag). Keep in mind that the Iranian leadership work for the globalists too. Their role is to play the victim to the IUSSAC villain.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">One wonders if the parade attack was real or just crisis-acted like they do in the US.</span></p>

<p>The video is a good setup for the “cruise / ballistic missiles out of Yemen / Iraq” op, so watch for it after Rouhani speaks at the UN today. And if Israel gets hit, be on the lookout for a &#8220;retaliatory&#8221; IDF strike on Tehran (via Jordan and Saudi Arabia) and the fake Soleimani assassination. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar may also be a target, but I don&#8217;t expect them to hit that until the full-out Middle East war is triggered.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Let me preface my remarks by telling new readers that the globalists control both sides in the current political drama &#8212; both the “Establishment” side (Obama, Clinton, Soros, the Bilderbergers, the mainstream media, etc.) and the “Anti-Establishment” side (Trump, Le Pen, Putin, the BRICS, the alternative media, etc.). They are deliberately staging this dialectic conflict in order to implode their existing “Establishment” and erect a new one (the New World Order) in its place.</p>
<p>That being said, my entries about exposing globalist plans for the Trump assassination show are not about saving him from some real danger (he isn&#8217;t in danger); they&#8217;re about deterring a hoax that will advance the globalist agenda. So here we go&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>(18 September 2018) &#8211;</strong> <a href="http://sdg.iisd.org/events/73rd-session-of-the-un-general-assembly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The 73rd UN General Assembly convened today</a>, and the General Debate in which the world leaders give their speeches kicks off next week. That being said, here are two things that come to mind&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Will the downing of the Russian aircraft in Syria lead to a surprise appearance by Vladimir Putin?</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In 2015, he gave a speech at the General Debate just two days before he intervened in Syria. Will he decide to come and give another speech this year before implementing a no-fly zone over Syria? As of late last month, <a href="http://tass.com/politics/1018501" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has been scheduled to be the Russian representative</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.aa.com.tr/en/americas/trump-to-address-wmd-proliferation-at-security-council/1249475" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump is scheduled to chair a Security Council meeting on the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) on the 26th</a>, <a href="http://digitalarchaeology.org.uk/events/2018/9/26/the-triumphal-arch-of-palmyra-in-washington-dc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the same day a replica of the Triumphal Arch of Palmyra will be erected in Washington, D.C.</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monumental_Arch_of_Palmyra#History" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The original arch was erected to celebrate a Roman victory, and it stood over the road that led to the Temple of Baal</a>. So&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Will the erection of the Triumphal Arch in Washington, D.C. commemorate the “evil Deep State’s” victory over Trump (through his assassination at the UN by a WMD earlier in the day)?</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;ll start looking into all this tomorrow&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>(19 September 2018) &#8211;</strong> I’m about to start writing today’s addition to the new entry, but I wanted to issue this warning right away: <strong>be on the lookout for an “Iranian” provocation between now and Trump’s Security Council meeting on the 26th</strong>. It would likely be an Israel-targeting false-flag like the “cruise missiles out of Yemen / ballistic missiles out of Iraq” op. The most likely day for it would be Saturday the <strong>22</strong>nd. In tomorrow’s addition, I’ll tell you why I say this.</p>
<p><strong>~ LATER ~</strong> Russia has just established a de facto no-fly zone over the eastern Mediterranean between Cyprus and the Syria-Lebanon coastline&#8230;<br />

&#8230;from <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Cyprus/@33.942637,33.3788081,7.25z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x14de1767ca494d55:0x324c3c807fc4146e!8m2!3d35.126413!4d33.429859" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Maps</a></p>
<p>Now take note of this excerpt from the in-cyprus article&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> Russia issued 15 Notams and 7 Navtexs, which bind large areas in Cypriot air space, land and waters, for Russian military operations, from today until <strong>next Wednesday</strong>. <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>And <strong>next Wednesday</strong> is what day? It’s <strong>September 26</strong>, the day of Trump’s Security Council meeting, of course.</p>
<p>So is this de facto no-fly zone a prelude to something more permanent to be announced during a surprise Putin trip to the UN? And did the Israeli jets that attacked Latakia fly out of Cyprus? <a href="https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Israel-Cyprus-begin-joint-drill-on-Mediterranean-island-515882" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The IDF have held a number of joint drills there</a>.</p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>(20 September 2018) &#8211;</strong> <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.passblue.com/2018/09/19/the-un-shudders-as-trump-week-closes-in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump will be at the UN for three days next week</a>. On September 24, he’ll hold a meeting on narcotics and opoids; on September 25, he’ll give a speech before the General Assembly; and on September 26, he’ll sit as President of the UN Security Council for a meeting that’s ostensibly about WMD proliferation, but that’s actually about bashing Iran. This third day would be the most likely day for an assassination, for reasons you&#8217;ll soon understand.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Given that Trump’s primary focus at the UN will be on attacking Iran, wouldn’t it be nice if the Iranians served up a big, juicy provocation before the meeting to underscore the points he’ll be making? Yes, it would, and that&#8217;s one reason why a false-flag blamed on Iran may be in the cards over the next few days. And since <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://warontherocks.com/2018/09/trump-continues-his-two-front-war-on-iran-with-planned-u-n-address/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Netanyahu is also expected to attend the meeting</a>, the target of the false-flag would most likely be Israel. That way, both Trump and Netanyahu can lay out their case against Iran together.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Since a pre-meeting false-flag would increase the chance for the outbreak of conflict following the meeting, it would also serve nicely to lure Vladimir Putin to New York. He would come to “stand in the way of the steamroller bearing down on Iran” and to “attempt to talk Trump out of bending to the will of the neocon warmongers.” It would also allow him to talk to Netanyahu face-to-face about the downing of the Russian plane, perhaps even announcing an official Syrian no-fly zone afterwards.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">If the globalist drama directors do indeed send Putin to New York on September 26, they could get three assassinations for the price of one. Trump’s faked death would put “Deep Stater” Pence in charge of the US, Netanyahu’s faked death would likely put Avigdor Lieberman (the defense minster who is also a Chabad-Lubavitcher) in charge of Israel (<a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.jpost.com/Diplomacy-and-Politics/Liberman-to-be-acting-prime-minister-this-week-332047" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he’s done it before</a>), and Putin’s faked death would put “Atlantic Integrationist” Dmitry Medvedev in charge of Russia. It would also get rid of the current UN so the “reformed” UN can rise from the ashes.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">As for how the assassination would be carried out, it would most likely be a nuclear explosion attributed to Iranians using a nuke they were given by <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.unitedagainstnucleariran.com/north-korea-iran" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their &#8220;proliferation partners,&#8221; North Korea</a> (Trump, Putin, and Netanyahu would be evacuated before the blast). What method would be more poetic on a day like this?&#8230;</span><br />
<span style="color: #333333;"><a style="color: #333333;" href="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/nukeday920.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7799" src="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/nukeday920.png" alt="" width="840" height="107" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/nukeday920.png 840w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/nukeday920-300x38.png 300w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/nukeday920-768x98.png 768w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/nukeday920-624x79.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" /></a></span><br />
<span style="color: #333333;">&#8230;from the <a style="color: #333333;" href="http://www.un.org/en/events/nuclearweaponelimination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UN website</a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Destroying UN Headquarters with a nuke on the “International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons” would highlight the failure of the “current weak form of the UN.” It would then be reformed and rebuilt with more “inclusion, power, and teeth” to “enforce the peace.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">After the mainstream media blame the Iranians and the North Koreans for the UN&#8217;s destruction, the controlled alt-media would attribute the explosion to the “evil Deep State.” They’ll say that it was done to&#8230;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">get Trump and Putin out of the way of the “unilateral New World Order,”</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">get their war with Syria, Iran, and North Korea,</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">stop Trump’s Supreme Court nominee (&#8220;who is being delayed with sex assault allegations to make time for the assassination&#8221;),</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">stop Trump from announcing his Middle East Peace Plan (&#8220;which contains elements that are utterly unacceptable to the Zionists&#8221;),</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">and so on.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">So that&#8217;s how the assassination show would unfold next week. If Putin doesn&#8217;t show on the 26th, they can still take Trump and Netanyahu off the stage and get their war. And if they don&#8217;t opt to do the assassination show this month, they still have the setup in Paris on 11/11.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">You can read more about the specifics of the UN attack scenario by scrolling down this page to the Compendium (the section titled <em>North Korean Submarines and Nuclear 9/11</em>, except the submarines / swimmer delivery vehicles would be Iranian in this case).</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>The Three Endgames</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>(21 September 2018) &#8211;</strong> While we’re on the subject of Putin’s fake assassination, it’s worth noting that the globalists’ final script for him will determine which of the three endgames we’ll see for the current &#8220;world crisis.&#8221; There are two War Path endgames and one Peace Path endgame&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Under the War Path&#8230;</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Endgame 1</strong> will involve a fake assassination of Putin that takes him off the stage temporarily. While he’s “dead,” Syria will fall, likely due to an assassination of Assad, and Iran will also fall, likely due to a staged “coup / revolution.” Just like the most recent Turkish coup, the Iranian coup will be staged by the current leadership, but unlike the Turkish coup, it will be scripted to succeed.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">With the final resistance to the “evil West” gone, the “Atlantic Integrationist” Medvedev will join with his Western buddies to launch the Western-version New World Order. And it is at the NWO’s founding meeting that the globalists will likely script “divine intervention” and Putin’s “miraculous return.” This is where the globalists’ fake ETs make the scene.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">In a final bid to steal victory from the jaws of defeat, the “Western Satanists” will declare, “If we can’t rule the world, no one will.” And they’ll launch the nuclear ICBMs to take the world out with them. The “ETs” will stop the missiles, though, thus establishing themselves as the “saviors of mankind.” Thus begins the “Age of the Antichrist.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Endgame 2</strong> will happen if the globalists opt to leave Putin on the stage all the way to the big climax. It would begin with Trump losing the presidency, either through assassination, impeachment, removal under the 25th amendment, loss of the 2020 election, or simply folding to the &#8220;Deep State&#8221; and becoming a puppet. A “Deep Stater” would then take his place, get the regional wars going, and lock horns with Putin. But Russia and its allies would start to prevail in the wars, and the Deep State president would grow increasingly desperate to the point of launching America&#8217;s nukes. This is where the fake ETs would intervene to save humanity and teach the human race about &#8220;what was really going on behind the scenes.&#8221; Putin, Xi and the other Avatars would be hailed as incarnations of the Godhead. Thus begins the “Age of the Antichrist.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Under the Peace Path&#8230;</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Endgame 3</strong> will involve a populist wave sweeping over the West and bringing with it the Truth Tsunami I talk about in <a style="color: #333333;" href="http://redefininggod.com/understanding-the-nwo-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Understanding the NWO Strategy</a>. The new Western leaders will join with the Eastern leaders in “reforming” the UN into the NWO, and because “Putin kept his cool and prevented World War 3 from happening,” everyone will proclaim him as the obvious choice to lead it. Thus begins the “Age of the Antichrist.” A few years later, the globalists will add the “supernatural element” to it by having the “new” UN disclose the existence of “alien visitors.” The fake ETs will then come down and begin indoctrinating people for the big showdown that will happen in the seventh year of the NWO.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">So that’s what we have to look forward to (unless we can expose it so thoroughly that they give up and plan something entirely new). I may extend and enhance this section in the hours/days ahead. I’ll also try to post more information on the UN nuke scenario in the Compendium before next week.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>(22 September 2018) &#8211;</strong> The first part of the false-flag to be blamed on Iran was carried out today. Gunmen attacked a military parade in Iran, reportedly killing two dozen people and injuring about sixty more. And the Iranians are pointing the finger of blame at the usual suspects&#8230;</span><br />

<p><span style="color: #333333;">Now the Israel-US-Saudi Arabia cabal can fire missiles at themselves from positions inside Yemen and/or Iraq and people will think it was the Iranians retaliating for the parade attack and previous offenses.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Here’s another part of the setup&#8230;</span><br />
<span style="color: #333333;"><a style="color: #333333;" href="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/swift922.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7813" src="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/swift922.png" alt="" width="570" height="486" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/swift922.png 570w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/swift922-300x256.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px" /></a></span><br />
<span style="color: #333333;">&#8230;from the <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1021254/iran-news-military-parade-attacked-middle-east-crisis-WW3-warning" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Express</a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">According to the globalist script, if Iran responds, they fall into the trap for the US-Israeli ambush at the UN next week. And if they don’t respond, the Israel-US-Saudi Arabia cabal (IUSSAC) will respond for them (with the false-flag). Keep in mind that the Iranian leadership work for the globalists too. Their role is to play the victim to the IUSSAC villain.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">One wonders if the parade attack was real or just crisis-acted like they do in the US.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Also, let’s not forget that the parade attack could be leading up to the ultimate false-flag: “Iran blowing up the UN with a North Korean nuke in order to kill Trump &amp; Netanyahu and financially devastate America like America has devastated Iran.”</span></p>

<li><span style="color: #333333;">Iran has publicly declared that “Trump is a threat” to them,</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Trump’s oil sanctions are already ripping into Iran’s economy,</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Trump formed the “Iran Action Group” last month to facilitate the fall of the Iranian government,</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Trump and Netanyahu will be undermining Iran in the UN Security Council meeting next week &#8212; a meeting Iran won’t be allowed to attend, and</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Iran has publicly vowed a “swift response” to the parade attack today.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">All this publicly establishes a life-or-death motivation for Iran to attack Trump, Netanyahu and America &#8211; a motivation to which the false-flaggers will point when they blame the UN’s destruction on Iran and North Korea.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">As for why the Iranians would be willing to destroy the UN to get at Trump, Netanyahu and America, <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctions_against_Iran#UN_sanctions_against_Iran" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they were previously sanctioned by the UN</a>, then there’s this&#8230;</span><br />

<p><span style="color: #333333;">And North Korea is technically still at war with the UN and is currently being strangled by UN (and US) sanctions.</span></p>
<p><strong>(23 September 2018) &#8211;</strong> While we&#8217;re on the subject of the old UN being blown up by a nuke, it&#8217;s important to note that the destruction of the existing UN by fire is depicted by the mural in the Security Council Chamber. Have a look at the part of it I&#8217;ve boxed in red, taking careful note of the bird and what it&#8217;s standing on&#8230;<br />
<a href="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/mural923.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7832" src="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/mural923.jpg" alt="" width="850" height="565" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/mural923.jpg 850w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/mural923-300x199.jpg 300w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/mural923-768x510.jpg 768w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/mural923-624x415.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /></a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I wrote about it in <a href="http://redefininggod.com/2017/04/alert-possible-attack-on-the-un-complex-in-new-york-between-now-and-may-9/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a previous alert on the Nuclear 9/11 scenario</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>The globalist “elite” are obsessed with the symbolism of the phoenix, the bird which explodes into flames and is then reborn from its own ashes. Now look again at the mural located in the UN’s Security Council Chamber&#8230;<br />
<a href="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/muralscc.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4475" src="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/muralscc.png" alt="" width="730" height="554" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/muralscc.png 730w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/muralscc-300x228.png 300w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/muralscc-624x474.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>The mural actually depicts the Security Council Chamber itself.</strong> Look at the color of the wall depicted in the mural, then look at the color of the Security Council Chamber wall surrounding the mural. It&#8217;s the same. Also look at the shape and color of the object on which the phoenix is standing in the mural, then look at the semi-circular desk at which the Security Council members sit. You’ll see that the phoenix is actually standing on its ashes which lie on the desk of the Security Council. But in the mural, the desk has a disfigured appearance, as if it’s been melted, and the ashes of the old phoenix lie on the burnt table.</p>
<p><strong>So the mural depicts the New World Order phoenix standing in the ashes of the old UN on the burnt Security Council desk. It portrays the destruction of the Security Council Chamber by fire. Blowing up the UN complex thus becomes the fulfillment of the mural.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The overarching goal of all the current geopolitical drama is to “reform” the UN into the NWO, so I ask you this&#8230;</p>
<p><strong><em>What better way is there to bring in a &#8220;new, reformed&#8221; UN than to blow up the existing one? After it&#8217;s destroyed, the nations will rebuild it in a new place (likely on the Eurasian Continent) and reform it to be &#8220;more fair and more strong so such a disaster will never happen again.&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p>As you can see in this picture, the current UN is located right next to a navigable tidal estuary (the “East River”)&#8230;<br />

<p>And as you can see in this picture, sizable boats pass by it each day&#8230;<br />
<a href="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/unship.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4484" src="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/unship.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/unship.jpg 640w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/unship-300x169.jpg 300w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/unship-624x351.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>This means the UN is vulnerable to a &#8220;sail-up demolition.&#8221; If you think of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Nangarhar_airstrike" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the MOAB attack that happened in Afghanistan back in 2017</a>, its explosive yield was the equivalent of 11 tons of TNT, and a boat or sub could carry much more than 11 tons of high explosive (it would be the Mother Of All Boats). Radioactive material could also be added to turn the conventional bomb into a dirty bomb. A boat, sub or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diver_propulsion_vehicle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">swimmer delivery vehicle</a> could also carry one of &#8220;North Korea’s&#8221; nukes, which have estimated yields between 10 kilotons and 100+ kilotons.</p>
<p>Another attack option would be to have an &#8220;Iranian&#8221; submarine surface off the Atlantic coast and fire a nuke-tipped cruise missile on New York&#8230;<br />

<p>Since Iran would later be absolved of the attack, this would not affect Suleimani’s ascension to Mahdi status in phase 2 of the prophecy fulfillment operation. Halfway into his 7 year reign as Mahdi, he is scripted to turn nasty, just like Putin’s moschiach character.</p>
<p><strong>(23 September 2018) &#8211;</strong> It looks like they’re ramping up the drama going into this week. There are new, over-the-top allegations being brought against Supreme Court Nominee Kavanaugh, there are leftists protesters reportedly being bussed into Washington, and there’s also this&#8230;<br />

<p>The video is a good setup for the “cruise / ballistic missiles out of Yemen / Iraq” op, so watch for it after Rouhani speaks at the UN today. And if Israel gets hit, be on the lookout for a &#8220;retaliatory&#8221; IDF strike on Tehran (via Jordan and Saudi Arabia) and the fake Soleimani assassination. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar may also be a target, but I don&#8217;t expect them to hit that until the full-out Middle East war is triggered.</p>
<p><strong>(26 September 2018) &#8211; Pushing the Voters to the Right &amp; The &#8220;Mass Arrests&#8221; Rumor</strong></p>
<p>In past entries, I’ve talked about the globalist effort to shift people to the “political right” in preparation for the launch of the real &#8220;right-wing NWO” (the much publicized and feared “left-wing NWO” is just a decoy used to scare us to the right). And if you look at recent news, you can see some clear examples of this &#8220;push &#8217;em to the right&#8221; effort&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>&gt; The globalists are having the Democrats exhibit “Trump Derangement Syndrome” and conduct their over-the-top, easily disproven smear campaign on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh to push fair-minded people into the Trump camp.</strong> The Democrats’ blatantly unfair and sleazy attacks are meant to energize Trump’s base, push independents towards the Republicans, and disgust ordinary Democrats. So if you&#8217;ve found yourself yelling at your TV or PC over the unfairness of the allegations and press coverage, their strategy is working. Basically, the Democrats are smearing their way to an election loss, and they’re doing it because their bosses told them to.</p>
<p><strong>&gt; The globalists arranged for an ugly group of left-wing extremists to drive Senator Ted Cruz and his wife out of a Washington, DC restaurant yesterday.</strong> Cruz is in a tight race with a more charismatic Democrat, Beto O&#8217;Rourke, but Texans will think twice before voting for the challenger now. <em>“A vote for Beto is a vote for the left-wing thugs,”</em> is what they’ll be thinking.</p>
<p><strong>&gt; The globalists arranged for “Brazil’s Donald Trump,” Jair Bolsonaro, to be stabbed by a leftist</strong> (whether the stabbing was real or done with a theatrical knife, I haven’t examined). Since then, he has surged 10 points in the presidential polls.</p>
<p>Watch for more “left-wing lunacy” and over-the-top outrages as we approach the elections.</p>
<p>In my September 23 update, I mentioned the Kavanaugh news and the “mass arrests” article and said, “More on all this later&#8230;” Well, today is later, and what I’ve written above covers the Kavanaugh stuff. So here’s something I wrote earlier this year about the “mass arrests” scenario&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>To transition us happily into the NWO, the globalists are having their Western minions wear “dark hats” and play the role of the “bad guys,” and they’re having their Eastern minions wear “white hats” and play the role of the “good guys.” After having the “Western bad guys” push humanity to the seeming brink of nuclear destruction, they’ll have the “Eastern good guys,” led by Vladimir Putin, step up to save the day.</p>
<p>That being said, the globalists need to create a believable chain of events that will lead to the removal of the current “evil Western Establishment” and to their replacement by white hat globalist minions like Rand Paul, Nigel Farage, Marine Le Pen, etc. And <strong>there are two ways of getting rid of the old to make way for the new</strong>; I wrote about them last year…</p>
<p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> And come to think of it, <strong>an unexpected nuke strike on Washington</strong> while Congress is in town would be a good way for the globalists to “drain the swamp” of federal officialdom. It would save them all the trouble of <strong>mass-arresting them for pedophilia / corruption / racketeering / treason</strong>, and it would keep their mouths shut (because the bodies to which those mouths are attached would be dead). Look for Mike Pence, Rand Paul, and Elizabeth Warren to survive any such strike; they have roles to play in what happens afterwards. <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p>
<p>So the globalists have two options for “changing the guard” in the West: 1) blow them up, or <strong>2) “Mass Arrest” them and put them through Nuremberg-type show trials</strong>.</p></blockquote>

<h1 style="text-align: center;">The Idlib Offensive &amp; Putin and Trump&#8217;s Big Surprise</h1>
<p><strong>(14 September 2018) &#8211;</strong> The Idlib offensive looks to be on pause until sometime after Monday (<a href="https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Turkey-reinforces-its-army-in-Syria-before-13229684.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Putin and Erdogan will be meeting on that day</a>). And some things are happening in Syria that are opening the door for the “Putin and Trump’s Big Surprise” scenario to unfold.</p>
<p><strong>(15 September 2018) &#8211;</strong> “<a href="http://redefininggod.com/2017/04/globalist-agenda-watch-2017-update-10-putin-and-trumps-big-trick-will-us-forces-actually-be-joining-assad-putin-and-khamenei-in-a-joint-holy-war-against-the-dajjal-erdogan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Putin and Trump’s Big Surprise</a>” is something I wrote about last April, and this is how the globalists would script its implementation in the coming days/weeks&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>When the Idlib ground offensive begins and the “rebels” do their chemical false-flag propaganda release, the “Deep State Neocons” and the mainstream media will be screaming for Trump to launch massive air strikes on Syrian government forces. That’s when the Syrian/Russian hidden camera videos of the “rebels” faking the chemical attack will make the Eastern and alternative news. The Western media will respond with weak claims that the videos are “deepfakes,” but the public won’t buy it, and this will give Trump the political cover needed to spring the big surprise he supposedly planned with Putin during their summit meeting.</p>
<p><strong>Instead of ordering strikes on the Syrian government target packages prepared for him by the Neocons, he’ll order strikes on Al-Qaeda positions in Idlib.</strong> And these strikes will be accompanied by a ground attack carried out by the Kurds in conjunction with Syrian, Russian, and Iranian forces. This move will leave Erdogan in a showdown with the United States, Russia, Syria, and Iran &#8212; a combination he cannot possibly defeat &#8212; and he will face two basic choices: 1) go to war against all four nations and lose, or 2) pretend to cooperate with the clearance operation while he withdraws his forces step-by-step.</p>
<p>Under this scenario, Trump (the “precursor messiah”), Putin (the “Jewish and Christian main messiah”), Soleimani (the “Muslim messiah”), and Assad will triumph over Erdogan (the “Dajjal” / Muslim antichrist). It will be a joint Christian-Muslim victory. Of course, the “Deep State” will be deeply butt-hurt by Trump’s move, and that’s what will drive them to assassinate him in the November 2018 to March 2019 timeframe.</p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">As for how the globalists would keep the door open for the planned “Battle of Armageddon,” they have two ways:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">1) keep the fighting in Idlib going until after the assassination, and/or</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">2) do one or both of the false-flags I’ve outlined below.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">If they stretch out the fighting in Idlib for 60 days, they can do the “Russian airstrike on Turkish forces” false-flag after Pence takes office. Erdogan would respond by launching a full invasion of Syria, since he would then know that the US “Deep State” once again holds the presidency and would back him up. And if they do the al Tanf false-flag, they can redirect US airstrikes away from Idlib and towards Iranian forces in Syria and Iraq.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Now let me show you how they&#8217;re doing the propaganda rollout and positioning the pieces to open the door for this scenario&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>EXHIBIT 1:</strong> After at least half a year of dragging their feet, the US has suddenly &#8212; <strong>on the week of 9/11</strong> &#8212; launched the final offensive on ISIS forces in Hajin, Syria. Have a look at what <a href="http://www.rudaw.net/english/middleeast/syria/05092018" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this Rudaw (Kurdish) article</a> says about it&#8230;<br />
<a href="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hajinmap915.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7752" src="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hajinmap915.png" alt="" width="468" height="249" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hajinmap915.png 468w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hajinmap915-300x160.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px" /></a></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> The US-led international anti-ISIS coalition&#8217;s partnered ground force, the SDF, conducted artillery strikes on four towns — Hajin, al-Susah, al-Shafa and al-Baghuz — near Al Boukamal in the <strong>Middle Euphrates River Valley (MERV)</strong> on Tuesday, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported.</p>
<p><strong>The Pentagon says the SDF now control 98 percent of the territory ISIS once held in their areas. US Defense Secretary James Mattis has called the MERV &#8220;ISIS&#8217;s last stand.&#8221;</strong> <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>According to multiple reports, there are only a little over a thousand ISIS fighters in Hajin, so the clearance doesn’t require massive forces. And once the MERV falls, the US coalition area will be 100% clear of ISIS, by the Secretary of Defense’s own admission. This means that <strong>Trump can either withdraw US forces OR REDIRECT THEM TOWARDS FIGHTING ANOTHER TERROR GROUP. And since it’s been just a few days since 9/11, Al-Qaeda would be the obvious choice</strong>, wouldn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>EXHIBITS 2 &amp; 3:</strong> The mainstream narrative is placing Al-Qaeda in Idlib. Have a look at this section &#8212; especially the part that’s double-underlined &#8212; from <a href="https://www.usip.org/blog/2018/09/idlib-last-major-battle-syrian-civil-war" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an article about Idlib posted by the United States Institute of Peace</a>&#8230;<br />
<a href="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/idlibalqae915.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7754" src="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/idlibalqae915.png" alt="" width="867" height="722" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/idlibalqae915.png 867w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/idlibalqae915-300x250.png 300w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/idlibalqae915-768x640.png 768w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/idlibalqae915-624x520.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 867px) 100vw, 867px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>So with American forces nearing 100% victory over ISIS in the days following the anniversary of 9/11, the propagandists are saying <em>“Idlib province is the largest al-Qaida safe haven since 9/11.”</em></strong></p>
<p>And then there’s <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-09-13/tulsi-gabbard-house-floor-slams-betrayal-american-people-after-911-over-syria" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this, which showed up on Zero Hedge yesterday</a>&#8230;<br />
<a href="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/turlsi914.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7755" src="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/turlsi914.png" alt="" width="779" height="218" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/turlsi914.png 779w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/turlsi914-300x84.png 300w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/turlsi914-768x215.png 768w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/turlsi914-624x175.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 779px) 100vw, 779px" /></a></p>
<p>As I’ve mentioned in earlier entries, Tulsi Gabbard is a congressperson the globalists are positioning to be one of the NWO leaders of the Democratic Party, if not the first female President of the US. So look at her quote from the article&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>“Two days ago, President Trump and Vice President Pence delivered solemn speeches about the attacks on 9/11, talking about how much they care about the victims of al-Qaeda’s attack on our country. But, <strong>they are now standing up to protect the 20,000 to 40,000 al-Qaeda and other jihadist forces in Syria, and threatening Russia, Syria, and Iran, with military force if they dare attack these terrorists</strong>.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>With this, they’re having Gabbard provide Trump with left-wing political cover for what’s planned. Quite a setup, isn’t it?</p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>EXHIBIT 4:</strong> The mainstream narrative is adding the Kurds to the Idlib order of battle (and the Kurds typically operate with US air support)&#8230;</span><br />
<span style="color: #333333;"><a style="color: #333333;" href="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/kuridlib915.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7758" src="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/kuridlib915.png" alt="" width="659" height="203" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/kuridlib915.png 659w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/kuridlib915-300x92.png 300w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/kuridlib915-624x192.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 659px) 100vw, 659px" /></a></span><br />
<span style="color: #333333;">&#8230;from <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-turkey-minister/kurdish-ypg-militia-may-aid-syrian-government-in-idlib-operation-turkish-foreign-minister-idUSKCN1LT3F3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reuters</a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">By having the Kurds negotiate with the Syrian government to take part in the battle, the script protects Trump against allegations of “collusion.” He can say&#8230;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #333333;">“Our loyal Kurdish partners have been hard-pressed by the terrorist groups in Idlib, so they made their own choice to join in the offensive. And since they will be battling Al-Qaeda &#8212; the people who murdered thousands of Americans on 9/11&#8212; I’ve decided to provide them with full American air support for their efforts.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>EXHIBIT 5:</strong> The “deepfakes” propaganda wave is now linking the idea to potential national security ramifications&#8230;</span><br />
<span style="color: #333333;"><a style="color: #333333;" href="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/deepfakes915.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7759" src="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/deepfakes915.png" alt="" width="781" height="193" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/deepfakes915.png 781w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/deepfakes915-300x74.png 300w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/deepfakes915-768x190.png 768w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/deepfakes915-624x154.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 781px) 100vw, 781px" /></a></span><br />
<span style="color: #333333;">&#8230;from <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-09-14/politicians-warn-spy-chief-there-new-threat-called-deep-fakes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zero Hedge</a>. Here is an excerpt&#8230;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> US lawmakers are so worried about these faked videos that they now claim they can be “used by the enemy to harm national security”&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Lawmakers think that deep fakes could be used as part of wider disinformation campaigns in an effort to sway elections or spread false news.</strong> <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">So now the stage is set for the Western politicians and mainstream media to claim that the Russians faked the hidden camera videos of the chemical attack hoax as part of a “<a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/09/02/russian-disinformation-campaign-syria-threatened-spark-new-war/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wider disinformation campaign</a>.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">All this being said, the globalists have the “Putin and Trump’s Big Surprise” option available to them now. And they still have the “false flag attacks push Trump into attacking Syria” option we’ve already examined. Hopefully, they’ll end up choosing neither, and we’ll see Putin and Erdogan reach a ceasefire agreement on Monday. That would mean the globalists have pushed the pause button yet again, and we can start looking ahead to any October Surprises they may be preparing for the US budget and US election.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>(P.S. &#8211; 15 September 2018) &#8211;</strong> <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.rt.com/news/438537-syria-false-flag-chlorine-bsanqul/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RT is now narrating that canisters of chlorine gas have been delivered to the town to be struck with the false-flag</a>. Can you guess who delivered them?&#8230;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> Militants in Syria’s Idlib have transported several canisters containing chlorine to the village of Bsanqul, apparently preparing to stage a false flag chemical attack, the Russian Defense Ministry has said.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>The chlorine-filled canisters were delivered by the Al-Qaeda-affiliated militants of Tahrir al Sham</strong>&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">This is the latest warning from the Russian military on what it says is a chemical “provocation” in the making. <strong>On Wednesday, it said the White Helmets group has shot videos intended to be used in framing the Syrian government.</strong> <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">If you combine this with a previous story from Sputnik, <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://sputniknews.com/analysis/201809091067883528-syrian-idlib-operation-provocations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Journo Says Damascus Has Moles in White Helmets, Info on Future Provocations</a>, you get a picture of how things will play out. It is the moles in the White Helmets who will provide the hidden camera video of fake victims of the chemical attack, and it is those intelligence operatives who supposedly saw Al-Qaeda deliver the chlorine canisters who will provide video proof of that point. Once those videos hit the internet, Trump will have ample justification to overrule the Neocons and strike Al-Qaeda in Idlib.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>(P.S. &#8211; 16 September 2018) &#8211;</strong> It’s also worth noting that <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security/fighting-resumes-in-yemens-hodeidah-as-peace-talks-stall-idUSKCN1LS24A" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the battle for the Yemeni port of Hodeidah has flared up again</a>. The globalists paused this conflict earlier this year with a UN “peace process,” but like the battle for Hajin, it has gone hot just in time for the week of 9/11. The fall of Hodeidah, which would block Houthi access to food, is the scripted trigger for the “cruise missiles out of Yemen” false-flag the globalists have been keeping in their pocket. That operation would have the US+Israel+Saudi Arabia cabal launch “Iranian” cruise missiles out of Yemen at targets in Israel and other places, with the Houthis and Iran taking the blame.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>(P.S. &#8211; 16 September 2018) &#8211;</strong> If you’re wondering why I put down “November 2018 &#8211; March 2019&#8243; as the next time window for the Trump assassination show, it’s because of this&#8230;</span><br />

<span style="color: #333333;">&#8230;from <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.infowars.com/pentagon-intel-globalists-want-trump-dead-by-march-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Infowars</a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">March is always pregnant with ill possibilities for two reasons&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>1)</strong> It is six months away from September, and globalist prophecy cycles operate on a 3 years + 6 months basis. So if they do something big towards artificially fulfilling prophecy in September, the cycle will end 3.5 years later on a March (and vice versa). Septembers and Marches are always months to watch. Just look at everything they stirred up this past week &#8212; the week of the Jewish New Year.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>2)</strong> March brings with it the symbolism of the <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ides_of_March" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ides of March</a> and the ideas of political assassination and Rome. Trump is playing the Roman role of <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaius_Julius_Vindex" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vindex</a> in the globalist play.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">As for why I put November as the start of the window, it’s because of the Paris setup I cover further down this page. Technically speaking, though, the assassination could also come before the election. The leftists’ elation following Trump’s “death” would so piss off the “silent majority” that a strong Republican wave would sweep into Congress, thus empowering Pence as he begins his reign of terror.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>(P.S. &#8211; 16 September 2018) &#8211; </strong>Earlier today, the Kurds came out with a denial that they&#8217;ll be participating in the Idlib offensive&#8230;</span><br />

<p><span style="color: #333333;">It looks like the pressing of the delay button began right before the weekend. Sweet. Now let&#8217;s watch for the ceasefire announcement after the Putin-Erdogan meeting tomorrow.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>(P.S. &#8211; 17 September 2018) &#8211;</strong> <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://sputniknews.com/russia/201809171068089390-putin-erdogan-syria-sochi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Putin and Erdogan have agreed to establish a demilitarized zone in Idlib</a> (which is a ceasefire agreement without calling it that), and <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.rferl.org/a/putin-erdogan-to-meet-in-sochi-to-discuss-syria-s-idlib/29493691.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the press are already attributing it to Erdogan’s reinforcement of his positions in northern Syria</a> &#8212; a plausible cover story.

<p><span style="color: #333333;"><em>Putin promised Assad that all foreign forces would leave Syria, and since a moshiach is only as good as his word, the Turks will indeed be withdrawing at some point.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Under a Peace Path scenario, Trump and Putin will tag-team Erdogan:</strong> Trump will hit Turkey with more sanctions over their continued detention of a US pastor, thus putting the Turkish economy into another nosedive. This will force Erdogan to seek Putin’s help in joining the BRICS and getting a BRICS Bank bailout. The price will be a Turkish withdrawal from Syria.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Under a War Path scenario, the pieces are already in place and all that’s needed now is a false-flag to get things going.</strong> We know of four candidate false-flags so far: <strong>1)</strong> the Idlib chlorine attack, <strong>2)</strong> the Idlib airstrike on Turkish forces, <strong>3)</strong> the al Tanf missile strike on US forces, and <strong>4)</strong> the large-salvo cruise missile and/or ballistic missile strike on Israel (out of Yemen / Iraq). I’ll continue looking for other angles they might exploit, such as a fake assassination of Benjamin Netanyahu&#8230;</span><br />

<p><strong>(17 September 2018) &#8211;</strong> Well that victory didn&#8217;t last long. You may have heard about <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/syria/.premium-blasts-heard-in-syrian-port-city-lattakia-1.6489630" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the new missile strike on Syria, which has so far been attributed to Israel</a>. In an entry earlier this year, I talked about a Turkish cruise missile false-flag that would come from the sea and kill Assad and/or Suleimani in a way that makes it look like Israel did it. But it&#8217;s too early to tell if this strike was a variation of that. More as details come out&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>~ later ~</strong> <a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201809181068115950-russia-registered-missile-launches/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Russia is attributing the strike to the French and Israelis, and a Russian aircraft is missing</a>. <a href="https://www.goldcoastbulletin.com.au/news/world/fears-israel-has-shotdown-russian-spy-plane-during-raid-on-syria/news-story/137795732772ab4e772be5594c216c51" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Russian plane was a surveillance plane</a>, so did the Israelis or the French shoot it down? <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2018/09/17/politics/syrian-regime-shoots-down-russian-plane/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Or the Syrians</a>?

<p><strong>(Expanded Note &#8211; 13 September 2018) &#8211;</strong> It looks like the globalists are scripting-in a Russian angle for the 11/11 Trump assassination show in Paris&#8230;<br />
<a href="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/ruswmd913.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7744" src="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/ruswmd913.png" alt="" width="783" height="197" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/ruswmd913.png 783w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/ruswmd913-300x75.png 300w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/ruswmd913-768x193.png 768w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/ruswmd913-624x157.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 783px) 100vw, 783px" /></a><br />
&#8230;from <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-09-13/us-impose-very-severe-sanctions-russia-over-skripal-case" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zero Hedge</a>. Here’s an excerpt&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> <strong>The sanctions will kick in some time in November, presumably just after the November midterms</strong>, if Moscow does not take steps in the wake of the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal in the United Kingdom, Assistant Secretary of State Manisha Singh said on Thursday. <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>So if you add these new Russian sanctions that kick in right after the midterms to the Iranian oil embargo that kicks in the day before the election, you have scripted motivations for both Russia and Iran to kill Trump while he&#8217;s exposed in Paris on November 11. That being said, an “Iranian” drone carrying a “Russian” WMD would fit the assassination show objectives quite nicely. In the aftermath of the hit, the WMD will probably be identified as Novichok or polonium-210, both of which have supposedly been used by Russia to assassinate Russian dissidents in the UK.</p>
<p>Moving on to a different subject&#8230;</p>
<p>Back in the September 11 note, I said that the Eastern media would bring out hidden camera videos of the Syrian “rebels” stage-managing propaganda shots of the fake victims of the chemical false flag. It looks like I was on to something. Have a gander at the spate of articles about “deepfake” videos that came out on September 11&#8230;<br />

&#8230;from <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=deepfakes&amp;tbm=nws" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google News</a></p>
<p>The globalist propaganda masters timed the release of these articles to give the West a counter to the Syrian/Russian video release. By design, though, it would have been a weak and failing counter. Since the Syrian/Russian hidden camera videos would have been longer than the Western propaganda videos, would have been filmed from a different perspective, and would have shown what happened before and after the Western versions, people would have concluded that the Eastern videos couldn’t be deepfakes. The West’s lies would have been apparent (in keeping with the globalist script).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>(Notes &#8211; 10-12 September 2018)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">(<strong>Sept 10 &#8211;</strong> Tomorrow is September 11, and it’s also the final day of Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year. From the perspective of the globalists, it would be a good day to start something in Syria and/or stage the Trump assassination show. <a href="https://www.infowars.com/breaking-live-globalists-assassinate-trump-ahead-of-world-war-iii" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex Jones is running his mouth about an assassination</a>, Congress is out of session, and Rand Paul is out of town. I’ll be keeping an eye on Trump and Pence’s locations tomorrow.)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">(<strong>Sept 11 &#8211;</strong> It looks like the anniversary of the false-flag that started the War on Terror <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/438158-staged-chemical-attack-idlib/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will be celebrated with a chemical false flag that will start WWIII</a>. And let&#8217;s see if they aim any drones at Trump today. By the way, if you watch the first few minutes of the Alex Jones video linked above, you&#8217;ll hear him talking about the Left Hand Path and the Right Hand Path &#8212; leaving out the key understanding of course. Cheeky bastard. <strong>~ MORE ~</strong> Once the Western mainstream media start showing the propaganda pictures and videos of people affected by the &#8220;chemical attack,&#8221; watch for the Eastern media to start showing hidden camera video of those very same people being stage-managed for the cameras. This will help the globalists establish two key plot points: 1. that &#8220;the West started WWIII under false pretenses,&#8221; and 2. that &#8220;the Western leaders are evil liars and the Eastern leaders are credible statesmen just trying to bring peace.&#8221; The hidden camera videos can also be used to delay or stop the war should the globalists opt for that.)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">(<strong>Sep 12 &#8211;</strong> Well the chemical false-flag multimedia package didn&#8217;t show up Tuesday evening like the Russians said it would. Hmmm&#8230; I wonder what happened&#8230; No matter, we&#8217;ll go ahead and have a look at what they&#8217;re up to in Hajin.)</p>

<p>It’s not hard to stage a fake Russian or Syrian airstrike against Turkish forces in the crowded and chaotic skies over Syria. You just need one of these aircraft and some missiles or bombs provided by Ukraine&#8230;<br />

<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> Turkey regards the presence of its troops inside Idlib as a deterrent against a large-scale assault by forces of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his allies. <strong>“The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Russian jet fighters</span> and the regime ground forces cannot afford attacks while Turkish soldiers are there,” Ibrahim Kalin, spokesman for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, wrote in a newspaper column at the weekend.</strong> <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>With the Turkish forces acting as trip wires for a direct Turkey vs. Russia + Syria + Iran conflict, all the “evil Deep State” has to do is trigger the trap with a well-aimed Russian missile or bomb. Once there are dead Turks on the ground, Erdogan will order the closing of Russian air and sea access to Syria, thereby leaving Russian forces exposed.</p>
<p>I suspect this is all tied to the movement of Russian coalition ground troops. Once they start rolling into Idlib, we could see&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>the widely expected chemical false-flag by the &#8220;rebels&#8221; in Idlib,</li>
<li>the US false-flag against Turkish troops in Idlib, and/or</li>
<li>the US false-flag against US troops in al Tanf.</li>
</ul>
<p>The US false-flag in Idlib would lead to Syria becoming isolated from Russian help due to a Turkish air and sea blockade, and the US false-flag in al Tanf would lead to Syria becoming isolated from Iranian help due to an American air and sea blockade. Government forces and Iranian militias in Syria would also undergo heavy attack by Turkey, the US coalition, and Israel. We could also see Israeli ground troops push into southern Syria under the cover of a Israeli missile false-flag blamed on Iran.</p>
<p>The globalist scriptwriters have really outdone themselves, haven&#8217;t they?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>~ MORE ~</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Once Turkey denies the Russians eastern access to the Mediterranean through the <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Straits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Turkish Straits</a>, don&#8217;t be shocked if the UK and US block western access through the <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strait_of_Gibraltar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Strait of Gibraltar</a>. The Brits, who have supposedly suffered chemical attacks (Novichok) from Russia, could bar Russian access to the Mediterranean due to their alleged use of chemical and/or biological weapons in Syria. &#8220;Enough is enough,&#8221; the old witch (May) would say.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">We also need to look into what’s going on in Hajin, “ISIS’ Final Stronghold.” After months of delay, it finally came under attack today by Kurdish forces with US air support. Did Trump order the quick clearance of this area so he could declare ISIS defeated and pull US troops out of Syria? Or is this part of an effort to narrate a “resurgent ISIS” in Syria and Iraq, which will provide the excuse to keep US troops on the ground in those areas to conduct a land blockade against Iranian help for Assad. More on this later.</span></p>

<p>This news followed <a href="http://en.farsnews.com/newstext.aspx?nn=13970617001091" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a report from Iran&#8217;s FARS News Agency</a> that detailed Turkish convoy movement along the Syrian border.</p>
<p>If the globalists still intend for Erdogan to play the role of the Dajjal, he must act now to save the new Ottoman Empire he&#8217;s building. Once Russia, Syria and Iran crush his remaining proxy forces in northern Syria, he&#8217;ll be effectively blocked from expanding his empire to the south. So if the globalists are following the war path, this may be the time he finally betrays Putin.</p>
<p>The betrayal would play out something like this&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>The Turkish Army will move to block the clearance of Idlib.</li>
<li>Turkey will close its airspace and sea straits to Russian aircraft and ships, thus making the Russian position in Syria untenable.</li>
<li>Turkey will assassinate Assad and Soleimani in a way that makes it look like the Israel-US-Saudi Arabia cabal did it.</li>
<li>Turkey will move south through a leaderless Syria towards Israel, vowing revenge for Israel&#8217;s treachery.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also be on the lookout for the planned Putin assassination show.</p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Now let’s have a look at what will happen if Erdogan has been recast as the Mahdi and we’re on the Peace Path&#8230;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">The Turkish Army will assist the Russians, Syrians and Iranians in separating the terrorists from the regular Idlib population, thereby minimizing the humanitarian impact of the clearing operation. They would also assist in the rebuilding of Syria after it’s done.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">As I’ve written in past entries, if Erdogan was recast as the Mahdi back when he did <a style="color: #333333;" href="http://www.russia-direct.org/opinion/turkeys-u-turn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his U-turn towards Russia</a>, then the globalists have recast <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Bakr_al-Baghdadi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (the leader of ISIS)</a> as the Dajjal. So isn’t it interesting that he resurfaced just recently (on August <strong>22</strong>), just in time to suffer his final defeat in Syria?&#8230;</span><br />

<span style="color: #333333;">&#8230;from <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=al+baghdadi&amp;tbm=nws" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google News</a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">If the Russian coalition begins clearing ISIS and other US proxy forces from along the Syrian border with Iraq (in places like Al Tanf), it is the “Satanic” US that will rise up to stop their total loss of territory and influence in Syria. <strong>Under a Peace Path scenario, Trump will restrain the military from stopping the clearance operation. Under a War Path scenario, the “evil Deep State” will pull the Al Tanf false-flag to get Trump to order massive airstrikes.</strong> Preparatory propaganda for this has already been laid out&#8230;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> The tiny outpost at Tanf, surrounded by vast desert, was established during the battle against the Islamic State. But its purpose changed last year when <strong>Iranian-backed forces began bearing down on the isolated garrison</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">U.S. officials feared that a small, exposed force of special operators there could be overrun as Iran, fighting in support of the Syrian government, sought to lock down a land route to Damascus and the Mediterranean Sea. <strong>U.S. strikes on the encroaching forces risked pulling the Pentagon further into Syria’s civil war.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>But for some senior aides, the tense encounters around Tanf were an opportunity: a chance to bolster an operation that had become an accidental bulwark against Iran, and launch a larger campaign against Tehran’s military reach in the region.</strong> &#8212; from <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/in-syria-an-accidental-bulwark-against-iran-shows-confusion-of-trump-policy/2018/05/12/458ed726-4ed7-11e8-af46-b1d6dc0d9bfe_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Washington Post</a> <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Conducting the false-flag I’ve warned about below would be a nice way to <em>“launch a larger campaign against Tehran’s military reach in the region,”</em> wouldn’t it?</span></p>

<p>As Syrian, Iranian and Russian forces begin their clearing operations in the Al Tanf area, look for the US or its proxies in Iraq to fire old Iraqi ballistic missiles or old Soviet cruise missiles on US positions in Al Tanf. The attack will then be blamed on Iran’s proxies and missiles in Iraq. Such a false-flag would enable Israel and the US coalition to begin airstrikes against Iranian forces throughout Syria and Iraq.</p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">There has been ample warning given by the controlled alt-media of a chemical false flag in Syria, but what if this time the attack is attributed to Iran, not the Syrian government? According to the globalist script, Trump has shown hesitance in meaningfully attacking Russian and Syrian government forces, but has shown far less resistance in acting against Iran. So if the “evil Deep State” supposedly dupes Trump into believing Iran used chemical and/or biological weapons in Syria, the door will be opened not only to airstrikes in Syria and Iraq, BUT IN IRAN ALSO. And the fact that the attack would be on US military forces will further trigger a quick and robust knee jerk reaction from Trump.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Also be on alert for claims that one or more of the missiles carried an anthrax warhead; that is how they would ensnare North Korea in the false-flag too. Do you remember this little bit of preparatory propaganda?&#8230;</span><br />

<p><span style="color: #333333;">There are longstanding claims that Iran and North Korea have been collaborating on the development of missiles and chemical &amp; biological weapons (CBW)&#8230;</span><br />

<span style="color: #333333;">&#8230;from <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.nti.org/media/pdfs/iran_biological.pdf?_=1316555685?_=1316555685" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NTI.org</a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">These claims can be used to support a narrative that Iran acquired the CBWs for the Al Tanf attack from North Korea. And the motive for the attack would be ascribed to payback for the destruction of the Iranian consulate in Basra by proxies of the US-Israel-Saudi Arabian cabal.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">So with this one false-flag, the “evil Deep State” could simultaneously derail the Syrian, Iranian, and North Korean peace processes, thus opening the door for airstrikes and war on all three nations.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">It’s also worth noting that some weapons of mass destruction predictive programming just showed up in the form of <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Ryan_(TV_series)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Jack Ryan television series</a> on Amazon Prime Video. In the show, the Bin Laden-level terrorist villain&#8230;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>is named “Suleiman”</strong> (Qasem Soleimani’s name is also commonly spelled “Suleimani”),</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>reaches out to people from all sects of Islam to push out foreign forces and form an Islamic Empire</strong> (<a style="color: #333333;" href="http://www.irna.ir/en/News/82672911" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like Suleimani is trying to do</a>), and</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>uses chemical and biological weapons in his attacks on Europe and the US</strong> (like Suleimani will be framed for doing, starting with Al Tanf).</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">So if you fold this predictive programming into the coming “Iranian” (actually MEK) terror cell attacks in Europe and the US, it looks like we have some coughing ahead of us (or at least the crisis actors do).</span></p>
<p><strong>(Note &#8211; 7 September 2018) &#8211;</strong> They held the trilateral Turkey-Russia-Iran meeting on Syria today. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/07/iran-russia-turkey-leaders-meet-talks-syria-idlib-putin-rouhani-erdogan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Turkey pushed for a ceasefire in Idlib, but Russia and Iran declined</a>, so the Idlib offensive should kick off within the next week. And the press are narrating <a href="http://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/23419/russia-threatens-to-attack-key-u-s-outpost-in-southern-syria" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a showdown between Russia and the US over the US base in Al Tanf</a>. Here&#8217;s what to watch for&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>If the War Path is being followed</strong>, watch for Russia to be forced to fire on the Al Tanf base. This may be accompanied by the Russians activating their Syria-based air defense systems and clearing the sky of American planes, including standoff assets like AWACS.</p>
<p><strong>If the Peace Path is being followed</strong>, watch for Trump to publicly order the military to immediately redeploy all American servicemen in Al Tanf to bases outside Syrian territory.</p>
<p>Also, <a href="https://apnews.com/7bf62e4259464e90818cc8cf27915e69" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Iranian consulate in Basra, Iraq was blown up today by Sunni groups</a> funded by the Saudi Arabia-US-Israel terror complex. So that definitely spices things up a bit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>(Undated) &#8211;</strong> It looks like we’ll get through the weekend okay, so we probably won’t see the Idlib offensive until after <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-08/31/c_137434162.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the September 7 Russia-Turkey-Iran meeting on Syria</a>. What we need to watch for in the meantime is a preemptive strike (by the US, Israel or Turkey) to derail the peace process and the offensive.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The alt-media have made sure to point out that a chemical false-flag is coming there, but don&#8217;t forget the real curveballs the globalists have in store: false-flag assassinations (conducted by Turkey but blamed on Israel) of Assad and Soleimani and false-flag missile firings (conducted by the US but blamed on Iran) against Israel from Yemen and/or <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-iraq-missiles-exclusive/exclusive-iran-moves-missiles-to-iraq-in-warning-to-enemies-idUSKCN1LG0WB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Iraq</a>.</p>

&#8230;from <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-individuals-charged-acting-illegal-agents-government-iran" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Justice.gov</a></p>
<p>And what are the specific charges against these supposed Iranian agents?&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> On or about July 21, 2017, Doostdar is alleged to have conducted surveillance of the Rohr <strong>Chabad</strong> House, a Jewish institution located in Chicago, including photographing the security features surrounding the facility&#8230;</p>
<p>On or about Sept. 20, 2017, Ghorbani is alleged to have attended a <strong>MEK</strong> rally in New York City, during which he photographed individuals participating in the protest against the current Iranian regime. <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>So these two Iranians were gathering information on <strong>Chabad</strong> (the Kabbalist “Jewish” group that is orchestrating the End Times Show in the Middle East) and <strong>MEK</strong> (the US terror proxy group that will be doing false-flags in Europe and America to be blamed on Iran). Are they FBI assets who were directed to make it look like Iran is stalking Chabadniks and MEKers? Or were they gathering information on behalf of some rebels in Iranian intel who aren’t part of The Plan?</p>
<p>Khamenei and Soleimani are definitely in on The Plan, and they’re going to permanently destroy Islam and Muslim civilization if they’re allowed to continue.</p>
<p><strong>Speaking of the MEK, look at who they blamed for driving them out of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_Ashraf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Camp Ashraf</a> in Iraq: the globalists&#8217; chosen Imam Mahdi&#8230;</strong><br />

<p>After Saddam fell, the globalists started pushing Iraq closer to Iran, so the Iraqi government started getting hostile towards the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Council_of_Resistance_of_Iran" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NCRI/MEK</a> and allowed the Iranians to go into their home base (Camp Ashraf) to kill a number of them. The US then moved the MEK to Camp Liberty, had Hillary remove their terrorist label, and shipped them off to Europe for future operations.</p>
<p><strong>The MEK’s current role is to conduct false-flag attacks in Europe and the US that are to be blamed on Iran, so all the reports you’re seeing in the news about Iranian sleeper cells preparing to strike are preparatory propaganda for the coming MEK attacks&#8230;</strong><br />

<p>Since the globalists will be portraying Khamenei and Soleimani as “good guys” in the next phase of their plan, they will keep their hands clean by having the “bad guys” (the “Western” governments and intelligence agencies) do the dirty work of terrorizing the populations of Europe and the US.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">The Globalist Plan for Trump&#8217;s Assassination in Paris</h3>
<p><strong>(29 August 2018) &#8211;</strong> I’ve sussed-out the narratives they&#8217;ve prepared for Trump&#8217;s &#8220;death&#8221; in Paris on 11/11.</p>
<p><strong>In the mainstream narrative</strong>, they’ll blame in on Iranian terror cells in Paris motivated by Trump’s oil embargo.</p>
<p><strong>In the alt-media narrative</strong>, it will be identified as a false-flag operation carried out by the US “Deep State” and Mossad through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Mujahedin_of_Iran" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MEK</a> proxies.</p>
<p>More details after I get my air conditioning situation resolved.</p>
<p><strong>(30-31 August 2018) &#8211;</strong> To show you how I came to the conclusions I mentioned in yesterday’s note, have a look at this Israeli article about the foiled “Iranian” terror bombing in Paris two months ago&#8230;<br />
<a href="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/mossparis830.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7653" src="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/mossparis830.png" alt="" width="504" height="261" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/mossparis830.png 504w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/mossparis830-300x155.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 504px) 100vw, 504px" /></a><br />
&#8230;from <a href="https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5313291,00.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ynet News</a>. Here are some key preparatory propaganda points it features&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> Mossad agents uncovered intelligence about an alleged Iranian plan to bomb the annual National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) rally in the town of Villepinte, a northern suburb of Paris, on June 30.</p>
<p>According to Channel 2 News, the attack was thwarted thanks to <strong>cooperation between Israel, Germany, France and Belgium</strong>&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Iran has said it had nothing to do with the plot, which it called as a “false flag” operation staged by figures within the NCRI</strong>, an umbrella bloc of opposition exiles that seek an end to almost 40 years of Shi’ite Muslim clerical rule in Iran&#8230; <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>So if the bombing attempt was a false-flag as the Iranians claim &#8212; and it was &#8212; the article tells you who carried it out: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Council_of_Resistance_of_Iran" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NCRI</a> / <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Mujahedin_of_Iran" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MEK</a>, the Mossad, German Intelligence, French Intelligence, and Belgian / EU Intelligence.</p>
<p>Moving on to the next point&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> <strong>The People’s Mujahideen Organization of Iran is the main component of NCRI</strong>. The group, also known by its Persian name <strong>M</strong>ujahideen-<strong>e</strong>&#8211;<strong>K</strong>halq, <strong>was once listed as a terrorist organization by the United States and the European Union but not since 2012</strong>&#8230; <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Now can you guess who was responsible for taking the MEK off the Western terror lists?&#8230;<br />

&#8230;from <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-usa-idUSBRE88P0B420120926" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reuters</a></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Hillary removed MEK from the terror lists to facilitate their movement from a US base in Iraq (<a style="color: #333333;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_Liberty" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Camp Liberty</a>) to a new terrorist training base in Europe (Albania)&#8230;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> In 2013, Secretary of State <strong>Hillary Clinton pragmatically removed the MEK from the US terrorism list to allow members to be sent to third countries so that Iraq could be rid of them. European countries would not take them because of their terrorist past. Instead, the Albanian government agreed to take them</strong> only on the promise that a de-radicalization institute be established to reintegrate the extremists back into society.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">This did not happen. The allocated budget, lodged with the American embassy in Tirana, has not been touched. Instead, after Donald Trump became president and set about dismantling every detail of Barack Obama’s legacy, the MEK were “allowed” to regroup.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Regrouping meant that the MEK would continue to call for violent regime change against Iran, backed by US extremists like <strong>Rudi Giuliani</strong> and <strong>John Bolton</strong> <strong>who now occupy influential posts in the Trump administration</strong>. As a result, Albania has become a front-line enemy state in relation to Iran.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Regrouping also meant re-enslaving members, who are not paid and have no human rights. <strong>It also meant building a closed camp in a remote part of the country to which Albanian authorities and security services have no access.</strong> As though Albania wasn’t having a hard time already cracking down on criminal and mafia gangs, <strong>now the MEK are implicated in criminal activity. Among several individuals arrested for money laundering last month, two Israelis were found to be associated with FARA NGO. This is the same company involved in building the closed military training base in Manez to which rank-and-file MEK fighters were moved last autumn.</strong> &#8212; from <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://lobelog.com/trump-forces-albania-to-host-islamic-state/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LobeLog.com</a> <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">And as an added convenience to the assassination plan, the MEK also have a headquarters in Paris&#8230;</span><br />

<span style="color: #333333;">&#8230;from <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Mujahedin_of_Iran" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia</a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">To further see the covert connections between the MEK and the US “Deep State” and Mossad, have a look at <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/our-men-in-iran" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this 2012 Seymour Hersh article in <em>The New Yorker</em></a>. Here are some key sections&#8230;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> From the air, the terrain of the Department of Energy’s Nevada National Security Site, with its arid high plains and remote mountain peaks, has the look of northwest Iran. The site, some sixty-five miles northwest of Las Vegas, was once used for nuclear testing, and now includes a counterintelligence training facility&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>It was here that the Joint Special Operations Command (jsoc) conducted training, beginning in 2005, for members of the Mujahideen-e-Khalq, a dissident Iranian opposition group known in the West as the M.E.K.</strong>&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Five Iranian nuclear scientists have been assassinated since 2007. M.E.K. spokesmen have denied any involvement in the killings, but early last month NBC News quoted two senior Obama Administration officials as confirming that <strong>the attacks were carried out by M.E.K. units that were financed and trained by Mossad, the Israeli secret service</strong>. NBC further quoted the Administration officials as denying any American involvement in the M.E.K. activities. The former senior intelligence official I spoke with seconded the NBC report that <strong>the Israelis were working with the M.E.K., adding that the operations benefitted from American intelligence</strong>. <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p>The MEK have the fingerprints of the “Western” intelligence agencies, the Mossad, and Hillary Clinton all over them. So after they “assassinate” Trump and are finally identified as the culprits, the trail would lead straight to the scripted “bad guys” in the globalist drama: the US “Deep State” and the Israeli Zionists.</p>
<p>According to the script, the Deep State will want him dead because the Democrats will have failed to retake Congress in the election, thus preventing an impeachment. And the Zionists will want him dead because he will have <a href="http://www.israelhayom.com/2018/08/21/report-trump-to-introduce-mideast-peace-plan-at-%E2%80%8Eun-general-assembly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced his “unacceptable” Middle East peace plan at the UN General Assembly on September 25</a>.</p>
<p>As for the likely mode of a Paris assassination, it will be the same as was planned for the now-cancelled Washington military parade: an Israeli-fashioned, explosives-laden “Iranian” drone attack. A WMD strike is also a possibility, but since the globalists preserved Paris during WWII, I think it unlikely they’ll destroy it now. It is one of their playground cities. I’m sure the croissant are to die for.</p>
<p>So now that their scripting is exposed, will they go through with a Paris assassination? Probably not. They’ll likely try to surprise us by moving the assassination show forward to another date of opportunity, and that would most likely be <strong>September 25 at the UN General Assembly</strong>. Employing a nuke against the UN that day could take out Trump, Putin, Xi, Modi, and other such “avatars,” as well as open the way for the “new” UN to be built. Pence, Medvedev, and Li Keqiang would be somewhere else that day.</p>
<p><strong>(Note &#8211; 17-18 August 2018) &#8211;</strong> In recent entries, I’ve written about Erdogan and Soleimani showing up in a blue turban (in keeping with the globalist effort to artificially fulfill all End Times prophecies, including Nostradamus’ prediction of a Muslim Antichrist showing up in Europe wearing a blue turban). Well look at this propaganda graphic of Soleimani that showed up today&#8230;<br />

<p>Over the weekend, I’ll be posting all the major War Path scenarios and trigger dates to watch through the end of the year, including&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>September and October Surprises going into the November election,</li>
<li>a “Russian interference” propaganda ramp-up as we approach the election and an explosion of Antifa violence following a Republican victory,</li>
<li>the assassination potential of Trump in Paris on 11/11,</li>
<li>a false-flag &#8220;Iranian&#8221; attack after the November oil embargo goes into effect, and</li>
<li>the three mischief plays Erodogan can run over the next 90 days (the Cyprus EEZ raid, the Incirlik seizure, and an EU refugee flood following an engineered Turkish economic collapse).</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>&#8212;&#8212;MORE &#8211; 18 August 2018&#8212;&#8212;</strong></p>
<p>It looks like the big September/October Surprise ahead of the midterm elections will be Mueller subpoenaing Trump as part of his “Russian election interference” investigation&#8230;<br />
<a href="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/subp818.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7645" src="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/subp818.png" alt="" width="651" height="360" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/subp818.png 651w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/subp818-300x166.png 300w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/subp818-624x345.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 651px) 100vw, 651px" /></a><br />
&#8230;from <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=mueller+subpoena+trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google</a></p>
<p>Trump’s efforts to fight off said subpoena will then be cast by the mainstream media (MSM) as <em>“an attempt to hide the truth so Russia can interfere again in the midterms.”</em> And the subpoena will help focus public attention on “Russian interference” as the MSM roll out the idea that it will be even more severe this November&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> With the U.S. midterm elections coming up in November and the 2020 presidential election on the horizon, most politicians are not disillusioned about <strong>the threat of an even more aggressive election hacking</strong>. <strong>These fears are founded in truth</strong>: Microsoft shared earlier this month that hackers tied to the Russian military have already targeted at least three candidates running for election in 2018. &#8212; from <a href="http://fortune.com/2018/07/23/russia-hack-midterm-elections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fortune</a> <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> This is not a drill. Nor, alas, is it the fever dream of a Cold War hack novelist, as much as it sounds like one. In 2017, Russian hackers gained control of the U.S. power grid to the point where they could cause blackouts. And the U.S. government doesn’t know if they’re still able to do it.</p>
<p>Worse yet, <strong>there’s reason to believe this is part of an attack on the 2018 election &#8211; one that could make Russia’s pivotal 2016 shenanigans</strong> (its fake news machine, DNC email hacking, voter registration hacking and Facebook meme-making) <strong>look like child’s play</strong>. &#8212; from <a href="https://mashable.com/2018/07/25/2018-election-electric-grid-putin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mashable</a> <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, with “conservative and alternative voices” muzzled by the ongoing social media crackdown on free speech, the “good guys” will have trouble countering this Russian interference narrative of the “bad guys.” And once election day comes and the Democrats’ expected “Blue Wave” doesn’t materialize, the “bad guys” will scream that Russia hacked the election and they’ll organize mass protests for the weekend following the election (November 10th &amp; 11th). A combination of paid Antifa violence, deliberate police stand-downs, and opportunistic thugs + “Iranian” terror cells joining the party could result in remarkable riots in a number of major cities over that weekend.</p>
<p>Given that Trump will be attending the World War I centennial ceremony in France on Sunday, November 11, he’ll likely leave Washington on Friday evening, November 9. So he’d be out of the country when the riots hit, and he’d be a prime target for assassination in Paris on <strong>11/11</strong> due to his oil sales embargo on Iran that kicks in on November 4th.</p>
<p>Paris is a city that has seen lots of terrorist activity in the past few years, and look at what just recently happened&#8230;<br />

<p>So the whole setup is in place, and this is how the War Path would unfold&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>SEPT/OCT &#8211;</strong> Trump gets subpoenaed.<br />
<strong>NOV 4 &#8211;</strong> Trump&#8217;s Iran oil sales embargo kicks in, enraging Iranians and giving them an assassination motive.<br />
<strong>NOV 6 &#8211;</strong> The election. Republicans hold the Congress.<br />
<strong>NOV 7 &#8211;</strong> Democrats scream “Russian hacking,” call for protests.<br />
<strong>NOV 9 &#8211;</strong> Trump departs for France.<br />
<strong>NOV 10 &#8211;</strong> Protests begin; several US cities burn.<br />
<strong>NOV 11 &#8211;</strong> Trump is “killed” in Paris, supposedly at the hands of the Iranians, but actually at the hands of the globalist intelligence agencies; Pence is sworn in. Domestic crackdowns begin. Movement towards war with Iran begins.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, I’ll show you the parallel War Path Erdogan could follow.</p>

&#8230;from <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/technology/400526-anonymous-vows-to-take-down-expose-qanon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Hill</a>. Let&#8217;s have a look at a couple of things it mentions:</p>
<p>In this first excerpt, the propagandists are establishing context, which you’ll read more about shortly&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> The wide-ranging and vague “QAnon” touches on a number of popular conspiracy theories: <strong>Democrats and prominent Hollywood figures are orchestrating underground pedophile rings; special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe is a front for investigating 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and former President Obama for their ties to said rings; and hundreds of sealed indictments may have already been handed down in the Clinton case.</strong> <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>In this second excerpt, they’re establishing Anonymous’ anti-Trump credentials&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> <strong>Anonymous has been adamantly opposed to Trump since he announced his candidacy in 2015. The group declared &#8220;cyber war&#8221; on Trump in March 2016</strong>, directing its followers to take down the then-candidate&#8217;s websites. <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s important to realize that both QAnon and Anonymous work for the same people, but they have been assigned to opposing roles in the globalist stage play. According to the NWO script, Anonymous will eventually be identified as a disinformation front that did limited hangout operations for the anti-Trump “bad guys,” and QAnon will be identified as a front the pro-Trump “good guys” used to inform the public on “what was really going on behind the scenes.” Of course, this supposed good guy vs. bad guy conflict is being staged purely for public consumption; it’s all about bringing in the real NWO. You&#8217;ll see that very clearly if you read through the whole of this page.</p>
<p>This sudden outbreak of information warfare is happening within the context of this QAnon narrative (which makes reference to <em>Alice in Wonderland</em> as its template)&#8230;<br />

&#8230;from <a href="http://c7.b4in.net/v3/tea-party/2018/2611731.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Before It’s News (BIN)</a></p>
<p>If you read the article, it is basically a Peace Path narrative that speaks of an October surprise the Trump team has prepared for the Democrats. It also hints that the November 10 military parade in Washington may be a way to get the military into town for “mass arrests” of the “bad guys.”</p>
<p>Now if we think about how they’re scripting this, the BIN article revealed the QAnon game plan to the “bad guys,” so the “bad guys” are supposedly ramping up their counter-efforts (such as the Anonymous attack on QAnon and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/06/technology/infowars-alex-jones-apple-facebook-spotify.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the social media shutdown of faux-truther Alex Jones</a>) as we enter the big showdown. And while it’s theoretically possible that the globalists will proceed with the Peace Path scenario, I’ve observed things that suggest they can also use this setup for starting the civil war and Trump assassination psyops.</p>
<p>To see why I say this, have a look at <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/tanks-but-no-tanks-dc-officials-pan-trumps-proposed-grand-military-parade/2018/02/07/5e09c558-0c1b-11e8-8890-372e2047c935_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this article from the Washington Post</a>&#8230;<br />

&#8230;Here are three key hints they drop&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> Council member David Grosso (I-At Large) said that <strong>if Trump holds a military parade, he would organize “an equally large parade and march for peace and for nonviolence” to take place simultaneously</strong>.</p>
<p>“<strong>Maybe this can be a rallying cry</strong> for people to come to the nation’s capital and have a demonstration for peace,” he said. <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>So the first hint is <em>“a large counter-demonstration will be organized.”</em></strong></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> Mark Plotkin, a D.C. political activist and commentator, said the parade presents an unusual opportunity for the District’s mayor and council to grab the president’s attention.</p>
<p>“If they had the chutzpah and guts to say, ‘We’re not participating, you can’t use public works, <strong>the police are not going to be available</strong>’ — maybe that would provoke some indignation,” he said. <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>So the second hint is <em>&#8220;D.C. police won&#8217;t be available (or, to be more precise, D.C. police will be given a &#8216;do not intervene&#8217; order <a href="http://www.wweek.com/news/courts/2018/07/30/ice-agents-say-portland-mayor-violated-the-u-s-constitution-by-barring-police-from-responding-to-the-feds-calls-for-help/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like the Democrats have done in other cities</a>).&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> Lacy MacAuley, a D.C. activist and self-described <strong>anti-fascist</strong> who was involved in protests on the day of Trump’s inauguration, was skeptical a parade will take place but said demonstrators would show up to decry what she called a “preposterous” display of military might.</p>
<p>“<strong>If it became something that had a time and date, I believe that absolutely you could expect to see counterprotesting there</strong>,” MacAuley said. <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>So the third hint is <em>“Antifa will show up.&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p>Now if we put all this together, we get a scenario in which both “non-violent” counter-protesters and Antifa thugs will be bused-in to create chaos. The counter-protesters will “non-violently” block the roads on which the military units are marching, Antifa thugs will attack the troops (who won’t have ammunition for their weapons), and the police will stand by and twiddle their thumbs. Such tumult could be used as cover for an assassination of Trump while he’s in the viewing stands for the parade. This event could then be billed as &#8220;the Fort Sumter of the Second Civil War.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for how they’ll hit Trump, here’s one method they’re telegraphing&#8230;<br />

&#8230;from <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/maduro-venezuela-apparent-drone-attack-highlights-growing-concern-in-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBS News</a>. The non-intervening D.C. police would open up a security gap for such an attack, which would have a remarkable similarity to Fort Sumter&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> &#8230;Confederate leaders ordered an attack. Just before sunrise on April 12, 1861, <strong>a shell exploded above Fort Sumter</strong>. It was the first shot fired in the American Civil War. &#8211; from <a href="https://learningenglish.voanews.com/a/first-shot-civil-war-fort-sumter/2441338.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VOA</a> <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>So will <strong>a drone exploding above Donald Trump</strong> be the first shot fired in the Second American Civil War? Will he &#8220;die&#8221; the next day, leaving Pence to be sworn-in on <strong>11/11</strong>?</p>

&#8230;Note the well-selected variety of anti-Jones videos &#8212; all showing unflattering photos &#8212; that showed up in place of his channel.</p>
<p>Since Alex Jones is portrayed as steadfastly pro-Trump and the social media giants are portrayed as steadfastly Democrat, this bit of theater is meant to show the public that <em>“the evil Neocon-Neolib-Zionist Deep State is pulling out all the stops in their last-ditch effort to stop Trump’s victory and erect their police state NWO.”</em> And the police state would begin with President Pence cracking down to stop the civil war. The 2018 &#8220;Christian victory&#8221; promoted by the QAnon narrative would instead become the &#8220;Satanist victory&#8221; that would leave Putin as &#8220;the last (&#8216;Christian&#8217;) man standing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Iran has the expertise to fashion effective armed drones for an assassination at the parade, whether they strap C4 and a guidance mechanism to a run-of-the-mill quadcopter or build a fast, stealthy, model-sized suicide plane. <strong>So when it comes to an assassination on November 10, Iran has&#8230;</strong></p>

<p>Of course, Iran’s Soleimani would never actually kill Trump because they’re both friends of Putin, but the “evil Deep State” would certainly do it and blame him for it. All they’d have to do is provide Antifa with an “Iranian” drone or have a fake “D.C. area-based Iranian terror cell” launch it; <em>&#8220;we&#8217;re close to you where you can&#8217;t even imagine&#8221;</em> would come back to haunt Soleimani in that case. And with a successful hit, the &#8220;Deep State&#8221; would have Trump “dead” AND an excuse to attack Iran.</p>

<p>Should the globalists opt for the Peace Path, it will likely mean they’re abandoning their double fulfillment strategy and aiming for a single fulfillment, and that would include (in chronological order)&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>the release of damning information about current Western leaders, followed by snap elections that will put Putin-friendly leaders in place</strong>;</li>
<li><strong>reform of the UN once France and the UK are under Putin-friendly leaders</strong> (this will make all <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_members_of_the_United_Nations_Security_Council" target="_blank" rel="noopener">P5 nations</a> Putin-friendly);</li>
<li><strong>Putin’s ascension to de facto or de jure leadership of the “new, reformed” UN / NWO</strong>;</li>
<li><strong>“disclosure” of a (fake) alien presence prior to Putin, Xi and others being presented as “Avatars sent by God”</strong>; and</li>
<li><strong>a big war and final climactic battle with the NWO + “Putin’s aliens” on one side and “hostile incoming aliens” on the other. These (fake) incoming aliens will be proclaimed as the “Second Coming of Jesus and his angels,” and this would happen at the 7-year mark of Putin&#8217;s global reign.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>[Addendum 3 &#8211; 9 August 2018] &#8211;</strong> Let’s start looking a bit deeper into the coming “prophecy fulfillment” by starting with the first and second points: <strong>1) the release of damning information about current Western leaders, followed by snap elections that will put Putin-friendly leaders in place</strong> and <strong>2) reform of the UN once France and the UK are under Putin-friendly leaders</strong>.</p>
<p>It all begins with Hillary Clinton’s email server&#8230;<br />

&#8230;from the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-31806907" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BBC</a></p>
<p>According to the NWO script, Hillary traveled the world during her time as US Secretary of State, interacting and communicating with the entire global “Satanist network” in the process. So her email server supposedly contains information on pretty much all high-level “Satanist” agents and activities worldwide (including those in Western Europe). And this is where the globalists bring in the QAnon psyop.</p>
<p>First, they had Clinton’s Secret Service agents set a small fire on her Chappaqua compound and then extinguish it&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> The Secret Service said an agency employee called the fire department at around 2:40 p.m. &#8220;to report a small fire in the ceiling of the second floor in a detached structure located behind the Clintons’ residence,&#8221; and said fire extinguishers were used.</p>
<p>The fire department inspected the area to ensure the fire was out, the Secret Service said. &#8211; from <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/fire-breaks-out-bill-hillary-clintons-chappaqua-n-y-home-n834456" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NBC News</a> <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Afterwards, they had their QAnon disinformation front suggest that the fire was due to a covert operation to seize the server. And just like that, their narrative has placed the server into the hands of Trump and Co., thereby creating the setup for the coming limited-hangout exposures they’re going to do on “Satanic leaders” in the US, the British Commonwealth, and Western Europe. These revelations will lead to political upheaval and new elections in all those nations, and the thusfar suppressed and ridiculed “right-wing populist parties” will surge into power.</p>
<p><em>And why do the globalists want Putin-friendly populists (like Farage in the UK and Le Pen in France) to take power in Western Europe?</em></p>
<p>To turn this board all green&#8230;<br />

<p>As for why they want the board all green, it’s because of this article of the United Nations Charter&#8230;<br />

<p><strong>Under the current rules of the UN, any one of the five permanent members of the Security Council can stop any change to the UN Charter. And the UN Charter must be changed in order to transform it into the NWO. So the globalists are engineering the fall of their old Western Establishment to enable new leaders to rise and UN reform to move forward.</strong></p>
<p>Of course, they could order their UN minions to make the changes tomorrow if they really wanted to. But that would leave the public scratching their heads and asking why. They’re therefore staging the current political conflict and “good guy” victory to make the change seem logical and natural to the public.</p>
<p><strong>[Addendum 4 &#8211; 11 August 2018] &#8211;</strong> Now let’s look at the third point of a Peace Path single fulfillment: <strong>Putin’s ascension to de facto or de jure leadership of the “new, reformed” UN / NWO</strong>.</p>
<p>In a single fulfillment scenario, it is likely that Putin will take on the role of world leader by 1 January 2022 at the latest. That is when the current UN Secretary-General’s 5-year term expires. And such timing would allow another three and a half years for Europe to vote in pro-Putin populists, for the UN to debate and pass changes to their charter, and for 2/3 of the UN member states to ratify the changes. This process could be expedited and Putin’s ascension moved forward if they throw in a global economic collapse or a serious regional war to motivate quick action.</p>
<p><strong>One regional conflict that is already baked into the cake is the one that will occur when Al-Aqsa Mosque is destroyed. But in a Peace Path fulfillment, Putin will either prevent or end the resulting war with his “masterful diplomacy.” It is at that point he will make his prophetically-required “7-year covenant with Israel and the many,” and this diplomatic coup (along with a friendly P5) will make him “the obvious choice” for the next UN Secretary-General.</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Addendum 5 &#8211; 13 August 2018] &#8211;</strong> Finally, let’s look at the fourth and fifth points of a Peace Path single fulfillment: <strong>“disclosure” of a (fake) alien presence prior to Putin, Xi and others being presented as “Avatars sent by God,”</strong> and <strong>a big war and final climactic battle with the NWO + “Putin’s aliens” on one side and “hostile incoming aliens” (“Jesus and his angels”) on the other</strong>.</p>
<p>In a single fulfillment scenario, the globalists would skip the first fulfillment and go straight to the second. You can read about the details of what the second fulfillment entails by scrolling down this page to these sections:</p>
<p><strong>SUBJECT: Xi Jinping’s assassination, the globalist prophecy fulfillment plan for the Indians and the Chinese, and the 5 Avatars</strong></p>
<p><strong>SUBJECT: The Globalists’ Prophecy Fulfillment Plan</strong></p>
<p>That being said, there is one curveball they can throw our way. It involves the recasting of Erdogan, and I mentioned it earlier this year&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;it’s also possible that the roles were recast after the globalists cancelled the 2016 fulfillment show and Erdogan made <a href="http://www.russia-direct.org/opinion/turkeys-u-turn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his U-turn towards Russia</a>. In that case, they may have recast Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of ISIS, as the Act 1 Islamic Antichrist [the &#8220;Dajjal&#8221;] and Erdogan as the Act 2 Islamic Antichrist [the &#8220;Mahdi&#8221;].</p></blockquote>
<p>If the globalists opt for a pure Peace Path in which Putin prevents the regional war that will be threatened after Al-Aqsa’s destruction, there will be no mechanism to remove Erdogan from the stage. So in that case, they might just keep him on to play the “Mahdi” character instead of the “Dajjal” character to which he was originally assigned. They can then point back to the leader of ISIS as having been the “Dajjal.”</p>
<p>And with that forewarning given, I consider the Peace Path sufficiently covered for now. I still think it more likely that the globalists will stage some sort of war, go for the double fulfillment, and keep Erdogan as the Dajjal&#8230;<br />

&#8230;Just look at the “Red Devil Horns of the Dajjal” Erdogan is sporting in this picture <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-08-13/speculators-and-economic-terrorists-will-pay-lira-plunges-after-latest-erdogan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zero Hedge</a> frequently uses in articles about him. Zero Hedge is a Putin-promoting New World Order propaganda site, so seeing them portray Erdogan as a devil suggests that he&#8217;s still on track to be the Dajjal.</p>
<p><strong>[Addendum 6 &#8211; 16 August 2018] &#8211;</strong> After Turkey called Russia for help with its currency crisis on Friday, Russia’s Foreign Minister Lavrov went to Turkey for meetings on Monday and Tuesday&#8230;<br />

&#8230;from <a href="http://tass.com/politics/1016978" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TASS</a></p>
<p>According to the globalist narrative, it will someday be said that this is what Lavrov told the Turks during his visit&#8230;</p>
<p><em>“To receive BRICS help with your economic crisis, you must withdraw your forces from Syria and constructively participate in the political settlement to end the war. If you do so, BRICS assistance will be forthcoming and <a href="https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2018/08/turkey-syria-ankara-wants-its-share-in-reconstruction.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Turkish companies will be allowed to participate in Syria’s reconstruction</a>.”</em></p>
<p>That being said, keep an eye on September 7. That is the day a minister-level meeting on Syria by Russia, Turkey, France, and Germany will take place. It would set the stage for a peace summit to follow. This is the Peace Path.</p>
<p>As for the War Path, keep an eye on this&#8230;<br />

&#8230;from <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/oil/080618-turkish-president-erdogan-launches-100-day-energy-program" target="_blank" rel="noopener">S&amp;P Global</a>. Here is an excerpt&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> Turkish president Tayyip Erdogan Saturday announced plans for Turkey to conduct shallow water and deep water drilling in the Mediterranean, and to lease a second deepwater drill ship, in addition to the Deepsea Metro 2, which Turkey&#8217;s state upstream operator Turkish Petroleum (TP) took delivery of in December last year.</p>
<p>Erdogan did not say where the two vessels would begin drilling&#8230;</p>
<p>TP has on two occasions in the past three years conducted seismic surveys inside the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) claimed by the Republic of Cyprus&#8230; <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>This blog has been watching the Cyprus EEZ conflict trigger for a while now, and the globalists have now timed it so it can be pulled at any time between now and mid-November. By trying to drill in Cyprus’ EEZ, Erdogan would start a confrontation with the EU, of which Cyprus is a member. And this would sabotage the four-party peace deal by supposedly antagonizing France and Germany. In a War Path scenario like this, an Erdogan betrayal of Putin and a deeper push into Syria would be likely follow-up moves.</p>
<p>So will it be the Peace Path, the War Path, or another retreat? Only the globalists know what they&#8217;ll choose. My choice for them is, as always, retreat.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>&#8212;&#8212;MORE&#8212;&#8212;</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pentagon-says-trumps-proposed-military-parade-on-hold-until-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">November 10 military parade</a> has now joined <a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-white-house-delays-putin-visit-to-2019-1532544160-htmlstory.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Putin’s Washington visit</a> in being delayed until next year. These reschedulings are hopeful early signs for a full 2018 retreat by the globalists. But we still have to get through the November elections. I&#8217;m starting to get thirsty for New Year&#8217;s champagne&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>(Note &#8211; 10 August 2018) &#8211;</strong> Given the developing &#8220;Turkey Crisis,&#8221; keep an eye on Incirlik Air Base and the nukes the press say are still there.

<p><strong>(Note &#8211; 12 August 2018) &#8211;</strong> As we head into this week with the Turkish currency crisis gaining steam, don’t forget this little bit of news that came out&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/erdogan-calls-vladimir-putin-as-turkish-lira-currency-tumbles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Erdogan calls Putin as Turkish currency tumbles: Amid worsening relations with US, Turkish president turns to Russia</a></p>
<p>Back in 2015, the globalists had a plan to push Greece’s banks to the brink, then have them run to the BRICS Bank for a bailout. It was part of the “people’s revolution in Europe” scenario they were trying to get rolling back then. They may now be replaying the same strategy with Turkey. Erdogan is making statements that sound awfully New World Orderish after all&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;<strong>Unilateral actions</strong> against Turkey by the United States will undermine American interests and <strong>force Turkey to look for other friends and allies</strong>.” &#8211; from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/10/opinion/turkey-erdogan-trump-crisis-sanctions.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The New York Times</a></p></blockquote>
<p>In 2015, they were using this strategy to break up the EU; now they’re trying to use it to lure countries that are afflicted by American sanctions and dollar-denominated debt away from the “unilateral” US and towards the “multilateral” NWO. New World Order historians will later say that <em>Trump was deliberately pushing nations away</em> from the “US-UK-EU Empire” so his partner Putin could bring them into a “fair, sovereignty-respecting” BRICS New World Order. Basically, Trump is beating the bushes with sanctions and tariffs, and Putin is providing a safe-looking escape route into the NWO.</p>
<p>If we do see Erdogan joining the BRICS, it may mean that they’ve changed his role in the prophecy fulfillment script as was described in Addendum 5.</p>
<p><strong>(Note &#8211; 13 August 2018) &#8211;</strong> As I suspected (and wrote about in yesterday&#8217;s note), the current Turkish currency crisis is part of a globalist “run to the BRICS” setup. Look who attended the BRICS Summit late last month&#8230;<br />

&#8230;Here is an excerpt&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> Erdogan lost no opportunity for reiterating Turkey’s interest in establishing closer linkages with the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa), which is <strong>hoped to evolve into full membership for Turkey in the grouping</strong>. He even proposed a new name for the grouping that could be used if and when Turkey joined: <strong>BRICST</strong>&#8230;</p>
<p>Yet it [the BRICS] is a grouping of like-minded countries that represent not only a substantial economic potential, but also, and perhaps more important, <strong>a shared critique of the established balance of power and the current shape of global governance, which are seen to be biased in favor of the Western world</strong> and not reflecting the interests and expectations of the rising powers of the 21st century&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>The second reason Turkey wants to improve its ties with BRICS countries relates to the shared criticism of the Western-centric world order of the day</strong>. <strong>Erdogan’s slogan of “the world is greater than five” refers to resentment that the world’s affairs are entrusted to the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council</strong>, and this is a dictum that could resound well with the BRICS members. <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>So the globalists clearly do intend for Turkey to set the example for other American-sanctioned countries to run to Putin’s New World Order. We can expect Syria and Iran to follow their lead. Then all the other emerging market countries suffering under sanctions and/or an onerous dollar-denominated debt load will hop on the bandwagon.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>&#8212;&#8212;MORE&#8212;&#8212;</strong></p>
<p>IT LOOKS LIKE ERDOGAN IS ABOUT TO EXPAND HIS INVASION OF SYRIA: <a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201808131067148060-turkey-prepares-syria-operations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Erdogan: Turkey Hits Final Stage of Preparations for New Operations in Syria</a>. It&#8217;ll be interesting to see how Putin will react to this. Is it being done with Moscow&#8217;s blessing?</p>
<p>This brings to mind something I was thinking about a few hours ago: that NWO historians might someday narrate that Trump and Putin kept Erdogan in check by having the US hit him with sanctions so he&#8217;d be forced to play nice with Putin to get BRICS membership. So if the Russians talk him out of furthering his invasion of Syria and conducting his planned migrant assault on Europe, it will be someday be attributed to the Trump-Putin tag team strategy. They&#8217;ll say, <em>&#8220;Erdogan was put into a vulnerable position by Trump and had to listen to Putin to avoid an economic collapse and the end of his rule.&#8221;</em></p>

			<p>There is a reason the press are pushing the Catholic pedophilia reports so hard now&#8230;<br />

&#8230;from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180903235955/http://www.drudgereport.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Drudge Report</a></p>
<p>During my September 3rd infoscan, I ran across indications that the globalists may be using the Catholic pedophilia scandal to create a schism in the Church between the “progressives” under Pope Francis and the “traditionalists” under Vatican Secretary of State Pietro Parolin. My preliminary read on their strategy is as follows&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>1) They’ll have Parolin’s “traditionalist” half of the Catholic Church heal the longstanding schism with the “traditionalist” Eastern Orthodox Church, and that reunited Church will back Putin in creating the real, multilateral New World Order and becoming the “real Antichrist.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>2) They’ll have Francis’ “progressive/communist” half of the Church go down in flames with the </strong><strong>decoy, unilateral New World Order and the decoy Antichrist(s) of the West.</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">It appears that the mechanism they&#8217;ll use to cause the schism will be an attempt to remove Pope Francis from office against his will, possibly by convening an Ecumenical Council without his consent. Since the Church has no standing procedure for the forced removal of a Pope, any effort to do so will be of questionable legality, and it will therefore divide the Church between Francis loyalists who will still see him as Pope and &#8220;traditionalist rebels&#8221; who will follow Pietro Parolin in reuniting with the Eastern Orthodox Church.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Once this is done, the prophecy propagandists will say that Pope Francis was the &#8220;Final Pope&#8221; who permanently wrecked the Roman Catholic Church and Pietro Parolin was the &#8220;False Prophet&#8221; who gave rise to the &#8220;Antichrist&#8221;&#8230;</span><br />

<span style="color: #333333;">&#8230;from the <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.skywatchtv.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SkywatchTV “About” page</a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">And following the links offered in the article, I found this reference to a script change from something he published last year&#8230;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> It’s not hard to read between the lines above to find the insinuation that <strong>Pope Francis</strong> is &#8211; or <strong>is paving the way &#8211; for the False Prophet that guides the world’s religious faithful into supporting a political figure called Antichrist</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">With all this in mind, and given mine and Cris Putnam’s personal exhaustive investigation into the Vatican, our extensive research into the Prophecy of the Popes, the correct predictions we made regarding the resignation of Benedict before the fact, and our follow-up probe into the conclave that elected Francis, <strong>I have a bombshell announcement to make. I am reaching out to those concealed friends in Rome that assisted me in the past to confirm my belief that Pope Francis will either retire soon or be taken out of the way</strong>, and that this really is tied to something strange that unfolded in bringing him temporarily to the pontificate. I believe, as they suggested, Francis was not “canonically elected,” as his namesake originally predicted. And the church members that helped me before and the ones already cited above are only the tip of the iceberg of those who will eventually voice how “illegitimate” activity went on behind closed doors during the last papal election,[xvi] and that, for reasons we do not yet understand, Francis was put in as a temporary “placeholder” until the real Pope #112 (Petrus Romanus) could be installed. The mysterious reasons surrounding this “placeholder” false pope may never fully be known, but was foreseen by such mystics as Father Herman Bernard Kramer in his work, The Book of Destiny. During an unusual interpretation he made of the twelfth chapter of the book of Revelation concerning “the great wonder” mentioned in verse 1, Father Kramer wrote:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">&gt;&gt; The “sign” in heaven is that of a woman with child crying out in her travail and anguish of delivery. In that travail, she gives birth to some definite “person” who is to RULE the Church with a rod of iron (verse 5). It then points to a conflict waged within the Church to elect one who was to “rule all nations” in the manner clearly stated. In accord with the text this is unmistakably a PAPAL ELECTION, for only Christ and his Vicar have the divine right to rule ALL NATIONS.… But at this time the great powers may take a menacing attitude to hinder the election of the logical and expected candidate by threats of a general apostasy, assassination or imprisonment of this candidate if elected. (capitalized emphasis in original)[xvii] &lt;&lt;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Although I disagree with Kramer’s interpretation of the book of Revelation, his fear that “great powers may take a menacing attitude to hinder the election of the logical and expected candidate” echoes the sentiment of priests mentioned elsewhere in Petrus Romanus, who saw a crisis for the Church coming, and the False Prophet and Antichrist rising as a result.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">This, too, was in the news recently when a report was published by Sébastien Maillard, Vatican correspondent for La Croix, in Rome. He noted how <strong>a large array of conservative bishops fear that Francis is bypassing critical Church doctrine and fear he has already gone too far. Even those cardinals who voted for Francis now want him to step down so that the Holy See’s secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, can be elected the real pope</strong>.[xviii] And these electors understand something else, too. Parolin’s name means “Peter the Roman” from the final line of the Prophecy of the Popes. <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Seeing Horn’s writeup on this script change, I decided to see if the globalists had planted other such preparatory propaganda in other outlets. They had indeed.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Here is <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.cnsnews.com/blog/michael-w-chapman/report-some-cardinals-want-pope-franics-resign-fear-schism-worse-reformation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one example from CNS News</a>&#8230;</span><br />
<span style="color: #333333;"><a style="color: #333333;" href="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/schismE.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7682" src="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/schismE.png" alt="" width="711" height="766" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/schismE.png 711w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/schismE-278x300.png 278w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/schismE-624x672.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 711px) 100vw, 711px" /></a></span><br />
<span style="color: #333333;">&#8230;Also take note of this excerpt&#8230;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> The London Times quoted a Vatican expert as saying, “A good number of the majority that voted for Bergoglio in 2013 have come to regret their decision, but <strong>I don’t think it’s plausible that members of the hierarchy will pressure the Pope to resign</strong>.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>&#8220;Those who know him know it would be useless,&#8221; said the expert. &#8220;[Pope Francis] has a very authoritarian streak. He won’t resign until he has completed his revolutionary reforms, which are causing enormous harm.”</strong> <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Now if you take a minute to think about Pope Francis playing the globalist-scripted role of “the Final Satanic Pope who brings about the end of the Roman Church,” would such a character resign or retire so the Church can heal itself? Certainly not, right? He would cling to power and force the traditionalists to tear the Church apart, because that’s his scripted mission. This is why the globalists will script his removal as resulting from either a coup or an assassination, not a resignation or retirement.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">And what could cause so many Catholics to become so outraged that they’d turn their backs on a sitting Pope? It would take systematic clerical abuse of their children organized and covered-up by Jesuits like Pope Francis. If you put that on top of Francis’ flamboyant “apostasy,” you have ample motivation for a schism.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">So as talk of “a schism worse than the Reformation” was flying around last year, can you guess where the planned replacement Pope, Pietro Parolin, went for a visit?&#8230;</span><br />

<span style="color: #333333;">&#8230;from <a style="color: #333333;" href="http://www.lastampa.it/2017/08/18/vaticaninsider/parolin-to-russia-from-to-august-meeting-with-putin-in-sochi-YIR25N9S4tsKV3R6SkiXDI/pagina.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">La Stampa</a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">During the trip, he touched base with the major figures of Russia&#8217;s political and religious power structure&#8230;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">On August 21, he met the “foreign minister” of the Russian Orthodox Church, <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilarion_(Alfeyev)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metropolitan Hilarion</a></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">On August 22, he met Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and <a style="font-size: 1rem; color: #333333;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriarch_Kirill_of_Moscow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Patriarch Kirill</a><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> of the Russian Orthodox Church</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">On August 23, he met Vladimir Putin at Putin’s country house in Sochi.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Now just imagine what a boost Putin would receive on the world stage if a major portion of the Roman Catholic Church broke away from the control of the “Satanist Jesuits” and the “Western pedophile elite” and joined forces with “the Christian Champion Putin” and the Russian Orthodox Church. Such a move would be in keeping with <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.skywatchtv.com/2017/10/05/will-real-petrus-romanus-please-step/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the preparatory propaganda Tom Horn has offered on the subject</a>&#8230;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> This could give rise to <strong>the False Prophet, who, according to the book of Revelation, leads the world’s religious communities into embracing a political leader known as the Antichrist. This marriage of Church and secular government would give unprecedented global influence to the Man of Sin during the period known as the Great Tribulation</strong>. <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">So Parolin would be cast as “the False Prophet” and Putin as “the Man of Sin.” In light of this, have a look at the theme of another meeting the Man of Sin attended in Sochi less than two months after he met with Parolin&#8230;</span><br />

<p><span style="color: #333333;">The term “creative destruction” refers to the globalist concept and practice of using their Left Hand Path (Dark) minions to create chaos and destroy existing order so their Right Hand Path (Light) minions can step in and construct new order. The concept is symbolized by the phoenix, which bursts into flames, falls to ash, and is reborn.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">In this particular iteration of their creative destruction process, we are in the “burst into flames” phase. And the globalists&#8217; Western minions are playing the role of the Left Handers who create chaos and destruction so the globalists&#8217; Eastern minions (Putin and his BRICS cohorts) can play the role of the Right Handers who save the day and construct the real New World Order.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Given this strategy the globalists are employing, their efforts to bring about a schism in the Roman Catholic Church is about purging the Church of the Left Hand Pathers</strong> (the “socialists, communists, leftists, Luciferians, Satanists, Jesuits, ‘Synagogue of Satan’ Crypto-Jews, etc.&#8221;) <strong>so the Right Hand Pathers can rebuild the Church in partnership with the Russian Orthodox Church.</strong> They are also employing this strategy in broader society by having the “leftists” run wild and outrage everyone so the populace will react by shifting to the “right.” The real New World Order will be ruled by right-wingers and Austrian Economics, not left-wingers and socialism/communism.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Now that we see the goal they’re trying to reach through their actions, it should be noted that the schism plan I’ve outlined, which I’ll call the “Vatican Wedgie,” is not the only way for them to get what they want. There are two other contingencies we need to watch: 1) the &#8220;Immaculate Abortion&#8221; and 2) the &#8220;Papal Whack-a-Mole.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>The Immaculate Abortion</strong> is the strategy Tom Horn outlines in <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.skywatchtv.com/2017/10/05/will-real-petrus-romanus-please-step/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his article</a>&#8230;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> With all this in mind, and given mine and Cris Putnam’s personal exhaustive investigation into the Vatican, our extensive research into the Prophecy of the Popes, the correct predictions we made regarding the resignation of Benedict before the fact, and our follow-up probe into the conclave that elected Francis, I have a bombshell announcement to make. I am reaching out to those concealed friends in Rome that assisted me in the past to confirm my belief that Pope Francis will either retire soon or be taken out of the way, and that <strong>this really is tied to something strange that unfolded in bringing him temporarily to the pontificate. I believe, as they suggested, Francis was not “canonically elected,” as his namesake originally predicted. And the church members that helped me before and the ones already cited above are only the tip of the iceberg of those who will eventually voice how “illegitimate” activity went on behind closed doors during the last papal election,[xvi] and that, for reasons we do not yet understand, Francis was put in as a temporary “placeholder” until the real Pope #112 (Petrus Romanus) could be installed.</strong> <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">So what they would do under an Immaculate Abortion scenario is present irrefutable evidence that Pope Francis’ election was null and void, thus aborting his papacy and removing his name from the official list of Popes. This would allow the globalists to substitute-in Pietro Parolin as the “real” Pope #112, thus making him “Petrus Romanus” and fulfilling the “Prophecy of the Popes.” Presumably, all the Left Hand Pathers would be exposed and purged as part of this process.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>The Papal Whack-a-Mole</strong> is a strategy based on an assassination prophecy about the Pope that Tom Horn has promoted in the past&#8230;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #333333;">“Well now you’ve got the Pope saying that it could be that now Fatima, the Third Secret of Fatima, is gonna be fulfilled. What’s the third secret of Fatima? <strong>It describes the Pope, the bishop in white, walking in a great city &#8212; most people believe this to be the Vatican, right? And something has happened. Dead people are everywhere, and the Pope is walking along &#8212; there’s dead Christians, dead bishops, dead people all over the city &#8212; and as he’s making his way towards a cross, these ISIS-like people run into the city and shoot him and kill him.</strong>” &#8211; from the 15:13 mark of <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://jimbakkershow.com/video/never-submit-day-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this interview with Jim Bakker</a></span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">So under this scenario, Pope Francis would be assassinated during the climactic phase of the coming war &#8212; killed by the very “Muslim refugees” <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/23/world/pope-francis-syrian-refugees-bill-weir/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">whose cause he championed</a> &#8212; and Pietro Parolin would survive to lead the Church in the aftermath. He would then “clean house” and join with the Orthodox Church and the real New World Order. No new Pope would be elected because too many of the electors will have died in the attack.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">And with these other possibilities laid out, I’ll call this entry complete.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>(This post was published on the Home Page from July 30 through July 31)</strong></p>
<p><strong>[30 July 2018] &#8211;</strong> In order for Vladimir Putin to start his 7-year reign as “Antichrist” (“the one who substitutes himself for Christ”), he must defeat a decoy Antichrist at the 7-year mark of the decoy’s reign. Originally, it was planned that Putin would defeat Obama in September of 2016; you can read all about it in <a href="http://redefininggod.com/obama-and-the-2nd-coming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;End Times&#8221; Programming</a>. And ever since they had to abort that plan, they’ve been trying to cobble something together that will passably fulfill the prophecies.</p>
<p>It now appears that they’ll substitute Erdogan into Obama’s role, with his 7-year mark being reached in late August of 2021, thus placing Putin’s ascension to “world leader” on or about September 15, 2021.</p>
<p>So what does this mean for us? If we continue to hold off their “passing plays” (the Trump-Putin “assassination” attempts), the globalists might grind things out on the ground for another 3 years, during which we’d continue experiencing the decoy “Great Tribulation”: a long economic downturn filled with war tension and chaos that would leave Trump finishing out his presidential term weakened and unwilling or unable to run again. A “Satanic” figure would then ascend to the presidency in January of 2021, and we’d see the climactic battle that August.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>&#8212;&#8212;MORE &#8211; 31 July 2018&#8212;&#8212;</strong></p>
<p>I stumbled upon all this while visiting one the major Christian prophecy propaganda sites earlier this month. As I looked through the fanciful bullsh*t on offer, this caught my eye&#8230;<br />
<a href="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/hilarion731.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7554" src="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/hilarion731.png" alt="" width="633" height="577" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/hilarion731.png 633w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/hilarion731-300x273.png 300w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/hilarion731-624x569.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 633px) 100vw, 633px" /></a><br />
&#8230;from <a href="https://www.skywatchtv.com/2018/07/10/is-the-hilarion-secretly-planning-to-complete-the-babalon-working-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Skywatch TV</a></p>
<p>So here we have a globalist mouthpiece site suggesting that Hillary Clinton might run in the next presidential election and help the “Antichrist” take his throne. Here is a bit of <a href="https://www.skywatchtv.com/2017/09/05/saboteurs-part-10-high-strangeness-hilarion-babalon-working/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what they say about her</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> On October 31, 1948, a full sixty-nine years ago when the female child would have been only around one year of age, Parsons wrote that her spirit contacted him, calling itself “Hilarion,” who, he said, would become <strong>an international public figure dedicated to bringing the work of the Antichrist to fruition</strong>. Why is that important? Because the etymology of Hilarion is the arcane “Hillary.”</p>
<p>I asked myself: 1) how many internationally influential feminists were 2) born in 1947 who are 3) named “Hillary” and that 4) have the potential to become the leader or vice president of the most powerful nation on earth, which 5) was dedicated from its inception to the enthronement of Osiris-Apollo, who 6) the Bible recognizes as Antichrist and 7) a spirit calling itself “Hillary” made clear to Jack Parsons sixty-nine years ago it was dedicated to helping the rise of the Man of Sin?&#8230; <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The article doesn’t seem to say that Hillary will win the election, but it does suggest that her involvement in the race will “bring the work of the Antichrist to fruition.” So the presidential election could go one of three ways&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>1) “Satanist” Hillary Clinton could win</strong> with clear signs of election fraud: illegal aliens voting, felons voting, and Soros fixing the vote count. This is the least likely outcome of the election.</p>
<p><strong>2) “Communist” Bernie Sanders could win</strong> with the same signs of election fraud. His candidacy would result from a revolt against Hillary by the “progressives” in the Democratic Party. And the fact that he is a stereotypical Jew who won under shady circumstances would help generate virulent “anti-Semitism” in America after he leads us to ruin, which would in turn assist the Kabbalists’ effort to drive American Jews to Israel for the final pogrom. This is the more likely outcome of the election.</p>
<p><strong>3) “Antichrist” Mike Pence could win</strong> as a result of mainstream America revolting against a Clinton or communist presidency. Getting Pence into the presidency has been one of the core objectives of the Trump assassination attempts the globalists have been setting up, and his job is to bring us to the brink of full-out nuclear war with Russia before he is defeated (along with his fellow &#8220;Antichrist&#8221;/&#8221;Dajjal&#8221; Erdogan). So this is how they make him President if they&#8217;re unable to do the assassination show, and it is the most likely outcome of the election&#8230;<br />

<p>With all this in mind, the task before us is to continue guarding against the pass play (a Trump “assassination”) while also beginning to block their running game (the election play). If we can push them past August 2021, they’ll be fresh out of Antichrist candidates with 7-year cycles behind them. And that would put them in a world of hurt. They’d have to wait until the new US President (presumably Pence) reaches his 7-year mark in 2024 or <strong>2028</strong> (depending on whether or not they count his years as Vice President). Keeping the world situation as it is for 6-10 more years would be a real challenge.</p>
<p>Next, I’ll show you what they’ve done / are doing to extend Erdogan and Putin’s presidential terms <strong>through 2028</strong>.</p>
<p>TO BE CONTINUED&#8230;</p>

&#8230;from <a href="https://sputniknews.com/military/201807181066451127-israel-gaza-offensive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sputnik</a></p>
<p>Why would an Israeli invasion of Gaza be viewed as a tragic mistake, you ask? Because in the current climate, it will likely be used as a rallying cry to begin the physical formation of Erdogan’s Muslim army for the invasion of Israel. It could also be used by the Israeli false-flaggers as cover for their “cruise missiles out of Yemen” attack on Israel, which they&#8217;d narrate as <em>&#8220;a proxy attack on Israel by Iran in response to the Gaza invasion.&#8221;</em> You can read more about this long-planned operation by scrolling down this page till you see <em>SUBJECT: The false-flag “Houthi” cruise missile attack.</em></p>
<p>All this is coming at a time when <a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201807181066450516-knesset-israel-right-declare-war/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Israel’s lawmakers have stripped Prime Minister Netanyahu and Defense Minister Lieberman of their ability to declare war without the approval of a larger body</a>, which raises the question of why it was done. Did they do it because elements of the government who aren’t in on The Plan want to constrain Netanyahu and Lieberman? Or did they do it so the globalists can write the following into future history books: <em>“most Israelis wanted to prevent the war, but the evil Zionists and Lubavitchers could not be stopped.”</em></p>
<p>It is also conceivable that Netanyahu could start the invasion of southern Syria under the pretext of some action by the Syrian military or Iranian proxy forces. But this will be the deeper narrative offered for his actions&#8230;</p>
<p><em>&#8220;After the Trump-Putin Summit, Netanyahu feared that Israel would be left exposed to an Iranian threat from the north by America’s imminent withdrawal from Syria and Russia’s lack of real resolve to expel Iranian forces from Syria. So he decided to push past the Golan Heights and seize a sizable buffer zone in southern Syria before the Trump-Putin deal was finalized. He knew that neither Trump nor Putin would take any action to stop him.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>Once the buses arrive to evacuate the rebels to Idlib, the Syrian Army will occupy the area with embedded Russian military police. So the stage managers of the engineered Middle East conflict have set up a situation in which Netanyahu has only a few days to invade southern Syria. To do it, he’ll have to arrange a false-flag attack against Israel or produce evidence that Iranians or their proxies are also embedded in the Syrian Army units. Perhaps he’ll do one of his speeches with the silly props or videos.</p>
<p>Given the situation, I consider the Gaza invasion more likely than the southern Syria invasion. But if the globalists want to progress towards the “First Battle of Armageddon” sooner rather than later, we could see both.</p>

This could mean one of two things: <strong>1)</strong> the globalists are backing-off on the Tisha B&#8217;Av op, or <strong>2)</strong> they are stopping the premature fighting so they can have an explosion of violence once Tisha B&#8217;Av begins Saturday evening or it&#8217;s the <strong>22</strong>nd.

<p><strong>[Closing Remarks &#8211; 23 July 2018] &#8211;</strong> The 22nd has now passed, so the Tisha B’Av operation is officially dead – at least for this year.

<p>So this is what we’ve observed over the last few days&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>On the 18th, we looked forward at what they had planned for the Golan Heights and Gaza.</li>
<li>On the 19th, they did their first U-turn by suddenly announcing a Golan Heights ceasefire.</li>
<li>And on the 21st, they did their second U-turn by suddenly announcing a Gaza ceasefire.</li>
</ul>
<p>I guess the quantum theorists are right: you do change the outcome by looking at it. But just because the globalists backed off from Tisha B’Av doesn’t mean the Golan Heights and Gaza are out of the woods quite yet.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/22/israel-evacuates-800-white-helmets-in-face-of-syria-advance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">There is still fighting going on near the Golan Heights between Syria/Russia and “ISIS” holdouts who didn’t sign on to the ceasefire</a>. And Gaza can be reignited at any time for any reason. So although it appears that the globalists have pressed the delay button for a few weeks or months, they could still fan the smoldering flames in those two areas on July 27, <a href="https://www.space.com/41007-blood-moon-2018-longest-lunar-eclipse-guide.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">when a “Blood Moon” will appear over the Middle East</a>. If we get through the 27th okay, though, we can rest a little easier.</p>
<p>After pondering all this, I’m left wondering if the now-postponed Gaza invasion on Tisha B’Av was meant to be a lead-in to an “Iranian response” during the Blood Moon (in the form of the “cruise missiles out of Yemen” op). That would have been a nice one-two “prophetic” punch.</p>

<p>Here is a key excerpt&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>“Israeli jets reportedly carried out a strike Sunday on a missile production facility in northwest Syria that observers say was supervised by Iranians. In the past, the site was allegedly used to produce and store chemical weapons&#8230;</p>
<p>In September, Syria accused Israel of carrying out a strike on the facility that left two dead. The bombing came after opposition sources claimed that <strong>Iranian and Syrian specialists were working there to develop chemical weapons capability for missiles</strong>.”</p></blockquote>
<p>So both the strike and the press coverage of it were done to create public awareness of a chemical missile threat to Israel. Awareness of this threat was further increased by something they did the next day&#8230;<br />

<p><strong>So this is what they have planned according to the geopolitical narrative&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>Israel will conduct the false-flag to demonstrate that it’s unsafe for Iran or Hezbollah to be anywhere in Syria, and they will use it as an excuse to invade a chunk of southern Syria. Beyond the stated security issues, the supposed realpolitik of the invasion will be to gain leverage for pushing Iran out of Syria: <em>“We’ll give the land back to Syria only after they remove all Iranian and Hezbollah forces from their country.”</em> In fact, <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-rejects-russian-offer-to-keep-iran-100-km-from-israels-border/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the article about the rejected 100-kilometer exclusion zone</a> spells out everything Israel will demand before returning the land&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Israel is sticking to its demand that <strong>Iran not be allowed any military foothold in Syria</strong>, the official stressed. Israel is furthermore demanding that <strong>all long-range missiles be removed from the war-torn country and that any factories producing precision-guided missiles there be shut</strong>, the official said.</p>
<p>Additionally, Jerusalem has asked Moscow to guarantee that <strong>all air-defense systems that protect the aforementioned arms be taken out of Syria</strong>. Lastly, Israel requested <strong>the closing of border crossings between Syria and Lebanon and between Syria and Iraq</strong>, to prevent Iranian weapons being smuggled into Syria.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, this geopolitical reasoning is merely the cover story hiding the real reason for all this: the play-out of the “First Battle of Armageddon” part of the globalist prophecy fulfillment script.</p>
<p>It’s also worth mentioning that <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-jets-said-to-strike-chemical-weapons-site-in-syria/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Times of Israel article on the Sunday missile strike</a> included this: <em>“Al-Mayadeen, a television channel associated with Lebanon’s Hezbollah terror group&#8230; reported <strong>the airstrike was carried out from Lebanese airspace</strong>.”</em> And <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-07-23/israel-rejects-russian-plan-keep-iranian-forces-100km-golan-border" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an article from Zero Hedge</a> mentioned this&#8230;<br />

<p>On a hunch, I decided to google Soleimani to see how the search results are structured. And as it turned out, the top three news article results <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/.premium-who-is-qasem-soleimani-the-head-of-iran-s-quds-force-that-attacked-israel-1.6075565" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blame him for a previous missile attack against Israel</a>, <a href="https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5301988,00.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">portray him as Israel’s most dangerous enemy</a>, and <a href="https://www.thenational.ae/world/mena/qassem-soleimani-iran-s-shadowy-general-and-spymaster-1.748982" target="_blank" rel="noopener">point out how he killed Americans in Iraq and is now “running the [Syrian] war himself</a>.”</p>
<p>So they’ve sculpted the search results to finger him for the coming chemical missile attack and give the reasons the US and Israel want him dead. And with Netanyahu vowing to hold Assad responsible for whatever Iran does from Syria against Israel, the stage is beautifully set for the follow-on assassination of both men.</p>
<p>As I’ve written before, Assad and Soleimani will probably be meeting when the hit occurs, and everyone will think the Israelis and Americans did it. But eventually it will be Erdogan who is identified as the culprit. The globalist-scripted Dajjal (Erdogan) must kill the globalist-scripted Mahdi (Soleimani); how could it happen any other way?</p>

<p>Upon seeing this, I dug a little deeper and ran across <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium-israel-must-get-god-out-of-the-army-1.5258588" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Haaretz article</a> that offered this bit of background on the man&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> Col. Ofer Winter, the commander of the Givati Brigade, is a thorough officer. Before going into Gaza <strong>he asked Kabbalists</strong> and yeshiva heads to pray for the operation’s success&#8230;</p>
<p>Winter added that before going into combat he reads his soldiers the words “Hear, O Israel, ye draw nigh this day unto battle,” from Deuteronomy 20:3. According to the colonel, “When a person’s life is in danger, he gets connected to his deepest inner truth, and when that happens, even the greatest unbeliever meets God.”</p>
<p><strong>That is missionary terminology of Gog and Magog heralding the end of days.</strong> The written message Winter sent his soldiers — he declared a religious war on the Gaza enemy who blasphemes against the Lord of Hosts&#8230; <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>So Israeli Defense Minister Lieberman, who is a Kabbalist with close ties to the Chabad-Lubavitch End Times cult, has brought in another Kabbalist crazy to assist him in launching the first Gog-Magog War. You can read about Lieberman and Netanyahu’s connection to Chabad a little further down this page; scroll down till you see <em>SUBJECT: How and why the Chabad-Lubavitch cult is steering the Middle East towards war</em>.</p>
<p>The Gog-Magog War and Battle of Armageddon the Kabbalists are currently fomenting is just the first of two. And between the first and the second, they will fan global “anti-Semitism” into a raging fire that will drive almost all the Jews to Israel. Once this “ingathering of the exiles” is complete, they will burn all the non-Kabbalist, non-elite Jews in a nuclear fire.</p>
<p>I warn Jews of this not because I am a fan of the Jewish religion &#8212; I find all Abrahamic religions intolerably backwards. So do the Kabbalists. That’s why they’re trying to destroy all obsolete forms of religion and unite the world under a Kabbalized Christianity that they control. The old religions are filled with scientifically implausible beliefs and centered around the worship of invisible sky gods that cannot speak. The new Christianity will be based on scientifically plausible beliefs and a GMO “god” everyone can see and talk to. But even though the new religion will be better than what we have now, it will still be a system of lies and manipulation, so I will not abide its formation. That’s why I warn.</p>

<p>Tomorrow, we’ll look at the easiest way for the globalists to orchestrate the chemical missile attack on Israel: by ordering the Iranians to launch a one-off missile salvo on Israel, and ordering the Israelis to dispatch chemical decontamination teams to some of the landing sites. This would create the illusion that some of the Iranian missiles bore chemical weapons, much like the chemical weapons fakery they’ve used in Syria.</p>

<p>There is so much information to convey that I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed this morning. So let me start with the basics and build from there&#8230;</p>
<p>In the coming days/weeks &#8212; and possibly tonight during the “Blood Moon” over Israel &#8212; I’m expecting the globalists to have their Iranian minion Qasem Soleimani launch a large, one-off salvo of conventionally armed missiles and rockets at IDF targets in Israel (and possibly American ships and bases too). This attack would be done through Iranian proxies: the Houthis in Yemen, Hamas in the Gaza Strip, and Hezbollah in Lebanon and Syria. “Soleimani’s” goal in doing this will be to raise Muslim morale and deter Israel and America by shattering their sense of invulnerability.</p>
<p>I’m also expecting the globalists to order their Israeli minions to turn the attack to their advantage by claiming that some of the missiles fired from Syria were carrying chemical warheads. This claim would be bolstered by frightful footage of IDF teams in chemical suits treating “casualties” and decontaminating land and equipment. It would be like the UK’s Skripal false-flag on steroids&#8230;<br />

<p>This fabricated chemical attack would be used to justify an immediate Israeli incursion into southern Syria.</p>
<p>Should the globalists schedule the event during the total lunar eclipse tonight, it would not only shatter the Israelis’ sense of invulnerability, but also get them thinking fearful thoughts about the “apocalypse”&#8230;<br />

&#8230;from <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/centurys-longest-blood-moon-stokes-doomsday-fears/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Times of Israel</a>. Here is a notable excerpt&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> According to popular American evangelical pastor <strong>John Hagee</strong>, the blood moons are historically linked with a time period “that <strong>begins with a tragedy</strong> and ends with a triumph” for the Jewish people&#8230;</p>
<p>In May, <strong>Hagee delivered the closing benediction at the ceremony marking the US embassy’s historic move to the Israeli capital</strong>. <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Isn’t it interesting that the US and Israeli governments had a <strong>Blood Moon apocalyptic preacher</strong> close the embassy ceremony a few months ago? And he was introduced by the <strong>Chabad-connected</strong> US Ambassador to Israel, David Friedman&#8230;<br />

<p>Things like this show you why this stuff must be taken seriously.</p>
<p>Here is another notable excerpt from the Times of Israel article&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>“In Israel the partial eclipse will begin at 9:24 p.m., with <strong>the full eclipse visible from 10:30 p.m. and reaching its maximum at 11:21 p.m.</strong>”</p></blockquote>
<p>If I were a betting man and had to pick a specific time for the attack, it would be 11:11 PM as the eclipse approaches its maximum (that&#8217;s 3:11 PM Texas Time). As I post this, it&#8217;s just a little over three hours away.</p>
<p>Should we get through the eclipse unscathed, I’ll show you another timing indicator they’ve given the public.</p>
<p><strong>[Closing Remarks &#8211; 27 July 2018] &#8211;</strong> Now that we’re past the Blood Moon, the chemical missile false-flag scenario becomes a standing contingency that can be executed at any time, with the highest risk period being the coming days and weeks. <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/syria-says-response-to-fighter-jets-downing-will-come-soon-enough-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This article from The Times of Israel</a> offers a clue on the next time window for trying it&#8230;<br />

<p>Here is a key excerpt&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> The official claimed Israel supports “terrorist centers” in southern Syria and shot down the jet to stop the regime’s operations against them.</p>
<p><strong>The first step of the Syrian response would be to complete operations against those centers</strong>, he said. <strong>Afterwards “the direct response to the Israeli forces will come at the appropriate time.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>The third part of the response would be to “foil any attempt to push Syria’s allies away from the (border) area.”</strong> <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>And wouldn’t you know it, Syrian media are reporting TODAY that the southern ISIS pocket (where the last of the terrorist centers are presumably located) has fallen to Syrian forces&#8230;<br />

<p>So now we’re just waiting on the “appropriate time” for the “direct response.” We also have to watch for a new precipitating event &#8212; some new outrage committed by the Israelis &#8212; to make Soleimani decide it’s time to respond.

<p>At first glance, you might not think the two stories are related, but Assange’s imminent expulsion from the Ecuadoran embassy will at some point lead to the release of his “insurance files.” And if that happens before Putin’s visit to Washington, it could set up a kill-or-be-killed situation between the “<a href="http://redefininggod.com/2017/03/alex-jones-the-kabbalist-banksters-and-the-deep-state-con/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deep State</a>” and their supposed foes, Trump and Putin (Trumputin).</p>
<p>The possibility of upcoming bombshell information releases is also supported by preparatory propaganda from disinfodorks Alex Jones and Hal Turner&#8230;<br />

<p>Such releases would likely occur in the August &#8211; October timeframe, before the US election. And if they happen before the next Trump-Putin Summit, they would provide a great setup for the Washington, D.C. / New York City Nuclear 9/11 the globalists have planned. The &#8220;evil Deep State&#8221; would do it while Putin is on their home turf (Washington), and since Medvedev is supposedly allied with the West, he’d go along with the false-flag cover story.</p>
<p>To be clear, Assange is merely a front for the globalist intelligence agencies, and his “insurance files” are nothing more than a <a href="https://wikispooks.com/wiki/Limited_hangout" target="_blank" rel="noopener">limited hangout</a> mechanism through which those agencies will release carefully selected information to support the globalists’ East vs. West NWO conflict. The &#8220;Deep State vs. Trumputin&#8221; drama is entirely fake, but the consequences for Washington and New York would be quite real.</p>
<p>By the way, they are scheduling Putin’s visit for the fall, and autumn begins on September <strong>22</strong> this year. So if they opt to schedule Putin’s visit on that day, they’d have “the energy of the master number 22&#8243; and the symbolism of “the first day of <em>the fall</em>” going for them. We’ll just have to wait and see if they want to be that obvious about it.</p>

<p><strong>[Closing Remarks &#8211; 16 July 2018] &#8211;</strong> The Helsinki Summit is now over and Trump is on his way back home. The globalists held back on any big events or announcements, but that doesn’t mean the Syria withdrawal deal isn’t happening. Here is a Trump quote <a href="http://tass.com/world/1013489" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from TASS</a>: <em>&#8220;Our national security councils will meet <strong>to follow up all the agreements we made today</strong>. We have made the first steps towards a brighter future, grounded on cooperation and peace.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>And here is a Putin quote <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/07/16/629523704/putin-invites-trump-to-help-end-syrian-war-as-russia-bombs-civilian-targets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from NPR</a>: <em>&#8220;<strong>As far as Syria is concerned</strong>,&#8221; Putin said, standing next to President Trump at the Helsinki summit, &#8220;<strong>the task of establishing peace and reconciliation in this country could be the first showcase example of this successful joint work</strong>.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Look for them to announce the full withdrawal of all foreign forces from Syria after the fall of the last major ISIS stronghold of Hajin and/or when a crisis point is reached between Syria and Israel at the Golan Heights.</p>
<p>Now for some chips and salsa&#8230;</p>
<hr />
<p>The aim of this entry is to expose the globalists&#8217; plans and objectives for the Trump-Putin Assassination Show with such clarity and detail that it would be foolish for them to proceed with it. So immediately below this paragraph, you&#8217;ll find all the sections of this entry in chronological order. And below that is a crash course in understanding the true globalist agenda. So here goes&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>[Section 1 &#8211; 27-28 June 2018] &#8211; The globalists activate the Medvedev / “Atlantic Integrationists” assassination option for Putin and Trump</strong></p>
<p>When I first heard that the Trump-Putin Summit may be held in Helsinki instead of Vienna, I thought they might be backing off on the assassination show. They are announcing the Summit date and location on Thursday after &#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_(mythology)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an auspicious sign</a>&#8221; appears in the sky over Finland Wednesday night&#8230;<br />

<p>Like Singapore, Helsinki is a compact city surrounded by the sea, which makes it relatively easy to sneak in a nuke. So also like Singapore, the most likely assassination method is “ISIS” detonating a 100-300 kiloton “North Korean” thermonuclear weapon within 1-1.5 km of the summit site. By using this scenario, the globalists can lock down the West “because ISIS has nukes and is using them,” and they can also reverse the supposed Korean peace process.</p>
<p><strong>In the globalists’ mainstream media narrative</strong>, <a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/europe-central-asia/caucasus/chechnya-russia/isis-returnees-bring-both-hope-and-fear-chechnya" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ISIS suicide bombers from Chechnya</a> will be blamed for the attack, and it will be said that they smuggled a nuke they purchased from North Korea into Helsinki via the Russia-Finland border or the Baltic Sea.</p>
<p><strong>In the globalists’ controlled alt-media narrative</strong>, it will later be said that Erdogan and Medvedev worked together on the assassination, with Erdogan supplying the ISIS suicide bombers and Medvedev supplying a Russian nuke and safe passage to Helsinki. If the narrative says the nuke was smuggled across the land border, it will be claimed that it was done by FSB elements who are loyal to the “Atlantic Integrationists.” If by sea, it will be attributed to naval officers loyal to the same. Russian subs regularly probe the territorial waters of Finland and Sweden, and <a href="https://www.the-american-interest.com/2015/04/28/finland-goes-after-russian-sub-with-depth-charges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in one particular incident in the waters <strong>near Helsinki</strong>, the Finns dropped small depth charges on a sub</a>.</p>
<p>As we approach the summit date, I’ll go into intricate detail on all this.</p>

<p>After Putin and Trump are “assassinated” at the Helsinki Summit, this is the man to whom the controlled alt-media will point their fingers&#8230;<br />

<p>Here is an excerpt from the Moscow Times article&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> President Dmitry Medvedev has replaced the Federal Security Service&#8217;s longtime director with a veteran security agent who, analysts said, could tackle economic crimes with gusto and strengthen Medvedev&#8217;s hand over the law enforcement agencies&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Bortnikov — like Patrushev, Putin and Medvedev — comes from St. Petersburg but is believed to be closer to Medvedev than the Kremlin&#8217;s siloviki clan, which includes Patrushev and Putin&#8217;s longtime deputy chief of staff, Igor Sechin</strong>&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;<strong>He is Medvedev&#8217;s man</strong>, not Sechin&#8217;s,&#8221; Andrei Soldatov, an analyst who tracks the security services, said of Bortnikov. <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>So according to the controlled alt-media script, “Medvedev’s man” can get the ISIS guys and their nuke across the Finnish border. And since <a href="https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/59qjad/us-sanctions-russian-company-made-a-spy-submarine-for-fsb-russias-spy-agency" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the FSB apparently has its own submarines</a>, they can handle a sea infiltration too. There is no need to involve the Russian Navy.</p>
<p>By the way, Helsinki (marked by the red pin) is less than 165 miles away from Russia’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltic_Fleet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kronstadt, Saint Petersburg naval base</a> (where some of the FSB&#8217;s subs may be based)&#8230;<br />

&#8230;from <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/did-ukraine-provide-rocket-engines-north-korea-its-nuclear-missile-program-658147" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Newsweek</a></p>
<p>Another way the globalists can script the Trump-Putin assassination is to blame the Ukranians. After the end of the Cold War, <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/blake-fleetwood/too-bad-ukraine-didnt-kee_b_5235374.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ukraine surrendered its nuclear weapons in exchange for security guarantees from Russia and the US</a>. But in early <strong>2014</strong>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_military_intervention_in_Ukraine_(2014%E2%80%93present)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vladimir Putin took the Crimea from them</a>. <strong>So in the “Blame Ukraine” scenario, the controlled alt-media will narrate that Ukraine provided ICBM rocket engines to North Korea in exchange for a few nukes to use as “a safeguard against future Russian aggression.”</strong></p>
<p>Here is an excerpt from the Wikipedia entry on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hwasong-14#Engine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">North Korea’s Hwasong-14 ICBM</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> Michael Elleman of IISS and the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists both claim that available evidence clearly indicates that the engine is based on the Soviet RD-250 (R-36 (missile)) family of engines, and has been modified to operate as the boosting force for the Hwasong-12 and -14. According to his theory <strong>an unknown number of these engines were probably acquired though illicit channels operating in Russia and/or Ukraine</strong>. North Korea’s need for an alternative to the failing Musudan and <strong>the recent appearance of the RD-250 engine along with other evidence, suggests the transfers occurred in 2015-2017</strong>. <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>So the transfers occurred after Russia took the Crimea in 2014, which fits the script perfectly.</p>
<p><strong>This “Blame Ukraine” scenario can also be used in conjunction with the “Blame Medvedev and the Atlantic Integrationists” scenario. Since both Medvedev and the Ukrainian government are supposedly friends/puppets/agents of the Western powers, it can be said that Ukraine provided the “North Korean” nuke, Erdogan provided the ISIS suicide bombers, and Medvedev &amp; Bortnikov provided safe passage to the target zone.</strong></p>
<p>Of course, this event would be used to start the Ukraine-Russia war. And as I’ve said in past entries, that war will result in Russia taking all Ukrainian territory east of the Dnieper River. That part of Ukraine was once part of ancient Khazaria, and the globalists want to reconstitute Khazaria under Putin (who will “miraculously” return later in the prophecy fulfillment show).</p>
<p><strong>On a related note</strong>, if the globalists opt to proceed with the assassination show despite its thorough exposure, it is highly likely that the “ISIS” suicide bombers will live-stream the attack over social media. I’ll tell you why and how as we get closer to the 16th.</p>
<p><strong>[Section 3 &#8211; 30 June 2018] &#8211; Where Putin and Trump will be when the bomb goes off</strong></p>
<p>As I’ve continued exploring the mechanics of the assassination show, I stumbled upon the place they’ll take Putin and Trump before the bomb goes off&#8230;<br />
<a href="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/helsinkibunk630.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7356" src="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/helsinkibunk630.png" alt="" width="480" height="599" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/helsinkibunk630.png 480w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/helsinkibunk630-240x300.png 240w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></a><br />

<p>They’ll most likely use two synchronized video feeds to ensure the public buys the assassination. There will be one live social media feed from the bombers, and one prerecorded “live” press pool feed from the hotel. The hotel feed will show the two leaders (and possibly some carefully selected members of the press / intelligence services) in the meeting room. But in reality, the leaders and others will have long since exited through the back doors and into Helsinki’s underground complex.</p>
<p>Since the bomb will be detonated from a kilometer or so away from the meeting site, the shelters need only protect them from the shockwave sweeping along the surface of the city. There is no need for them to be in a bunker hardened for a direct nuclear hit. They’ll then exit at a safe, distant point of the complex and go into hiding until the script calls for their “miraculous return.”</p>
<p><strong>[Section 4 &#8211; 2 July 2018] &#8211; The summit venue and infiltration methods</strong></p>
<p>Upon searching for the particular Helsinki venue for the assassination show, I found this on a Finnish website&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>“Details have yet to emerge on the summit venue. A veteran diplomat who requested to remain anonymous told Svenska Yle that Helsinki is an ideal location for the meeting &#8211; logistically and in terms of security.</p>
<p><strong>The diplomat said there are two likely locations in Helsinki for the meeting.</strong> The first is the <strong>Hilton Kalastajatorppa hotel</strong> in Helsinki&#8217;s Munkkiniemi neighbourhood, a secluded seaside location where many high-level international diplomatic meetings have been held.</p>
<p>The second alternative, according to the diplomat, is the <strong>Presidential Palace</strong>, located by the city&#8217;s bustling South Harbour and Market Square.” &#8211; from <a href="https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/fox_news_trump_and_putin_to_meet_at_helsinki_summit/10278005" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yle.fi</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Based on this information, I prepared a map that shows a one kilometer radius around each site&#8230;<br />
<a href="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/strikecircles71.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7367" src="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/strikecircles71.png" alt="" width="842" height="557" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/strikecircles71.png 842w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/strikecircles71-300x198.png 300w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/strikecircles71-768x508.png 768w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/strikecircles71-624x413.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 842px) 100vw, 842px" /></a><br />

<p>Since a 100 kiloton nuclear explosion would have a one kilometer “certain kill” radius, the assassination nuke could be placed anywhere inside the blue circles. As you can see, there is plenty of room to play with. They could bring the nuke&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>&gt; into the waters near the venue using a boat, ship or FERRY; or</strong></p>
<p><strong>&gt; into an FSB safe house near the venue using a van or SUV.</strong></p>
<p>Since the FSB will be part of the summit security team, it will be easy for them to smuggle the suicide bombers and nuke into the kill zone. They might even provide the “ISIS” guys with security credentials and a security vehicle. And since the ISIS guys will likely be Chechen, they might be Russian-speaking Caucasians who will blend in with all the other Russians in town.</p>
<p>While the assassination show can be made to work from either of the candidate locations, the Presidential Palace offers some key advantages over the hotel&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Advantage 1 &#8211; The Presidential Palace has built-in entrances to Helsinki’s underground bunker complex.</strong> If they didn’t exist before, they were almost certainly added during the recent renovation&#8230;<br />

<p>This will make it very easy for “those in the know” to sneak underground before the blast.</p>
<p><strong>Advantage 2 &#8211; The Presidential Palace is a secure building with limited access. This means there will be no civilian hotel staff to manage.</strong> The only people in the compound will be those insiders who have been preselected to survive and those outsiders who have been preselected to die (like the ordinary Secret Service guys who will be doing their patrols and standing their posts while the top guys bug out).</p>
<p><strong>Advantage 3 &#8211; The Presidential Palace offers more options for the infiltration script.</strong> It is located a stone’s throw away from the Port of Helsinki, which is the busiest passenger port in Europe. Just look at all the ferry routes (the dashed lines cutting through the water) that unload right near the Palace (which is marked with a red star)&#8230;<br />

<p>There is even a ferry arriving from Saint Petersburg at 7AM on the day of the summit.</p>
<p>Do you think they’ll be stopping and searching all the ferries and ships coming into port for nuclear weapons? Not likely – at least not before they’re within a kilometer from the dock. With the leaders of the two top nuclear powers in the world meeting there, no one will be expecting a nuke (or so they’ll say in the aftermath).</p>
<p>With these advantages in its favor, the Presidential Palace is the obvious choice for the op.</p>
<p><strong>[Section 5 &#8211; 3-5 July 2018] &#8211; Putin’s assassination and the Israeli invasion of southern Syria</strong></p>
<p>The globalists seem to be timing the Syrian offensive in the south to bring them near the Golan Heights around the time of the summit. So once Putin is taken out and Medvedev orders Russian forces into a force protection posture back at their Syrian bases, the way will be open for Israel’s move into southern Syria. Also, with their “great protector” Putin gone, both Assad and Soleimani will be left exposed for assassination by Israel and/or Turkey (according to the script). I’ll explain the hows and whys of this by tomorrow morning.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>~ MORE ~</strong></p>
<p>The current Syrian government offensive in the southwest is aimed at collapsing two pockets of resistance: the (green) pocket east of Dara’a, which borders Jordan; and the (green) pocket west of Dara’a, which borders Jordan and the Israeli-held Golan Heights&#8230;<br />
<a href="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/pocketsmap73.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7380" src="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/pocketsmap73.png" alt="" width="228" height="238" /></a><br />
&#8230;from <a href="https://gulfnews.com/news/mena/syria/syria-rebels-dig-in-for-daraa-fight-1.2211479" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gulf News</a></p>
<p>Right now, the Syrian Army seems to be primarily focused on the eastern pocket. And according to <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/07/syria-government-takes-deraa-two-week-offensive-180702145851016.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a July 2 Aljazeera report</a>, they have taken 60% of that area in about two weeks. So if they continue at that pace, they’ll likely take the other 40% of the area in less than two weeks. <strong>This means that right before the Helsinki Summit, the eastern pocket may fall and the Syrians and Russians would start focusing the whole of their attention on the western pocket near the Golan Heights.</strong></p>
<p>What happens then is hinted-at in the globalists’ preparatory propaganda&#8230;<br />

&#8230;from <a href="https://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/248236" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Israel National News</a>. Here is a key excerpt&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>“The coalition is now advancing towards the Israeli border in the south of the Golan Heights and on Wednesday bombed the city of Nawa, only 12 kilometers from Israel.</p>
<p><strong>The situation has been further complicated by the fact that the Russian Air Force is participating in the bombing of rebel positions in southern Syria.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Israel has an agreement with Russia to prevent confrontations between the IAF and the Russian Air Force in Syrian airspace.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Russia&#8217;s participation in the offensive in southern Syria will probably mean Israel will not be able to intervene militarily in southern Syria so as to keep the pro-Assad coalition away from the border on the Golan Heights.</strong>”</p></blockquote>
<p>So to proceed with their planned invasion of southern Syria, the Israelis need to get Russia to withdraw its air support, and that’s where the assassination comes in. Back when Medvedev was President of Russia, the globalists instructed him to stand idly by while the West took down Libya. And once Putin came back as president, they instructed him to “stand up to the West and stop them in Syria.” This bit of scripting helped establish Medvedev as an &#8220;extension of the West&#8221; and Putin as an &#8220;opponent of the West.&#8221;</p>
<p>So when Medvedev assumes the Russian presidency after the assassination, look for him to order Russian forces in Syria to stay at their bases and <em>“avoid getting involved in war escalations while the nation mourns.”</em> This withdrawal of air support would open the door for the Israeli invasion.</p>
<p>That being said, exposure of their plan may be forcing them to alter the script. After yesterday morning’s short update, <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-israel-russia-netanyahu/israels-netanyahu-to-meet-putin-in-moscow-next-week-israel-idUKKBN1JT2DH" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Israelis suddenly came out with a brief statement that Netanyahu will be meeting Putin in Moscow on the 11th</a>. <em><strong>So is this part of the lead-up to the assassination, or is it an adjustment to their plans?</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>On the one hand</strong>, the meeting is happening on the <strong>11</strong>th, a day favored by the globalists for mischief. It could be the day that Netanyahu asks Putin to withdraw air support from the Syrian offensive, gets rebuffed, then decides to proceed with the assassination (forensic analysis of the post-explosion nuclear residue will point to Israel as the actual builders of the assassination bomb).</p>
<p><strong>On the other hand</strong>, the meeting could be reported as the day that Netanyahu persuades Putin to withhold Russian air support from the Golan Heights part of the Syrian offensive. It would be said that Putin agreed in order to avoid any accidental engagements between Russian and Israel forces and to avoid any accidental deaths of civilians at Russian hands. Such an agreement would cause Netanyahu to call off the assassination&#8230; for now.</p>
<p>As for Israel’s ambitions in southern Syria, they were laid out in <a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/01/23/israel-syria-safe-buffer-zone-golan-heights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a January 23, 2018 article from The Intercept</a>. Here is the map they offered&#8230;<br />

<p>We can expect to see Israeli forces advance to the &#8220;Safe Zone Goal&#8221; line before stopping. They&#8217;ll try to sell it to the world as both a &#8220;humanitarian intervention&#8221; and a righteous effort to defend their borders from Iranian proxy forces. Just look at how hard the mainstream media are flogging the humanitarian angle in advance of the operation&#8230;<br />

<p>So after the invasion, what comes next?</p>
<p>I’ve already written about the aftermath of the attack in Update 19, so I&#8217;ll give just a brief summary&#8230;</p>
<p>The globalist script calls for the invasion to infuriate the entire Muslim world and be the straw that broke the camel’s back. It will drive many Organisation of Islamic Cooperation nations to join Erdogan’s “Palestinian protection force” / Muslim army. And to ensure that the Turkish Army can invade Israel from Syria, Erdogan will assassinate Syria’s Assad and Iran’s Soleimani in a way that makes it look like Israel did it.</p>

The blue circle marks a 250 km radius around Damascus. Since the SOM has a 250 km range, it can hit Damascus from any firing point inside the circle (which includes a part of the Mediterranean). And the closer they are to Damascus when they fire it, the more indirect they can make the missile’s flight path. To ensure that an Israeli standoff munition is blamed for the assassination, they’ll want the SOM to approach Damascus from due West.</p>

<p>On a related note, <a href="https://www.airforcetimes.com/news/your-military/2018/07/02/no-decision-on-turkeys-future-f-35-program-pentagon-says/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an article in the Air Force Times</a> states that the Turkish pilots training to fly Turkey’s two newly-delivered F-35s will take their first flight in the planes around the end of this month / early next month. What’s interesting is that the training is taking place at Luke Air Force Base, which is roughly 120 miles from the Mexican border. So don’t be shocked if the Turkish pilots turn south and make a dash for the border. They could link up with a Turkish Air Force tanker outside US airspace and fly the jets straight home.</p>
<p>Of course, the Pentagon has probably a dozen different ways of remotely disabling key systems of the F-35s to make them unusable, but don’t expect them to do so. The government doesn’t want the public to know that they can remotely disable all high-end military systems whenever they wish. The globalists plan on using that technology during the War Climax Show to simulate “revolutionary electronic warfare technology” supposedly possessed by Russia, China and/or “ETs.”</p>
<p>The article also mentions this about the US government’s attempt to freeze Erdogan out of the F-35 program&#8230;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">“<strong>If the F-35 transfer is blocked, it could agitate the NATO ally to the point that use of Turkey’s Incirlik Air Base is restricted.</strong> The U.S. has depended on Incirlik to conduct its air campaign against the Islamic State in Syria.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This blog has long tracked a scenario in which Turkey would seize American personnel, planes and nukes based at Incirlik, so this row over the F-35s may be the way they get that ball rolling.</p>

<p>Given that the Romanov assassination occurred during the night that spanned June 16/17, this raises the specter of the strike occurring after dark. In that case, we need to watch for 2 things&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>1) for the summit to either be scheduled for two days (the 16th and 17th) or extended for a day</strong>, and<br />
<strong>2) for Trump and Putin to either have a late dinner together or sleep in accommodations that are near each other</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>[Section 6 &#8211; 8-10 July 2018] &#8211; The Week of the Dajjal</strong></p>
<p>We’re mere hours away from the globalist-selected <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Masih_ad-Dajjal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dajjal</a>, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, taking his oath of office to become the de facto Sultan of Turkey. After the ceremony on the 9th, <a href="http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/erdogan-to-pay-first-trips-abroad-as-president-to-northern-cyprus-azerbaijan-134120" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he’ll depart for Turkish-occupied Cyprus on the 10th and the NATO Summit on the 11th and 12th</a>. At some point this week or next, look for him to dispatch the Turkish drilling ship Fatih (<a href="https://translate.google.com/?hl=en#auto/en/fatih" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which translates to “conqueror”</a>) to Cypriot waters to get the war provocations started&#8230;<br />

<p>Since this is the first time Erdogan will be entering Europe as the “Sultan of the Restored Ottoman Empire,” keep an eye out for blue turban symbolism. It may appear at his swearing in or at his attendance of the NATO summit, where he’ll either don a blue turban or be depicted wearing one in a notable press report.</p>
<p>To understand why I bring up blue turban symbolism, let me show you a section I wrote back on May 8&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>As I’ve explained previously, the globalists are aiming to fulfill pretty much every prophecy known to man in an effort to sell as many people as possible on the idea that we’re in the “End Times.” And Nostradamus’ “prophecies” are among those they’re trying to manifest. You’ll therefore find the following video of particular interest. It is part of an old movie on Nostradamus that tells of an Antichrist Muslim leader who will enter Europe wearing a blue turban&#8230;<br />

&#8230;from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eW24s94Svxg&amp;t=18s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a></p>
<p><strong>Iran’s Qasem Soleimani has been scripted to play this leader, <em>but why would he enter Europe wearing a blue turban?</em></strong></p>
<p>Because of the coming 3 million migrant invasion of Europe.</p>
<p>This invasion, which will be triggered by the Dajjal character played by Turkey’s Erdogan, will unleash great civil conflict in Europe. And Soleimani, who will be going into Europe under the banner of the “reformed” UN (NWO) to “reestablish order and bring peace,” will thus enter wearing a blue turban&#8230;<br />
<a href="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/unturbans.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6933" src="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/unturbans.png" alt="" width="528" height="350" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/unturbans.png 528w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/unturbans-300x199.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 528px) 100vw, 528px" /></a></p>
<p>According to the globalist plan for <strong>TWO prophecy fulfillments</strong>, the first fulfillment has Turkey’s Erdogan playing the evil “Dajjal” character. The Dajjal will pose as an Antichrist so Soleimani’s Imam Mahdi character can pose as the savior. And in the second fulfillment, Soleimani’s Mahdi character will be revealed as another Antichrist so the globalists’ Kabbalah-Christ character can pose as the real “Jesus Christ.”</p>
<p>Since there will be two fulfillments, we may see two blue turbans in the near future: one worn by Erdogan and one worn by Soleimani. So don’t be surprised if you see Erdogan sporting a blue turban after the upcoming <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_presidential_election,_2018" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Turkish presidential election</a>. The election will effectively make him the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caliphate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Caliph</a> of Turkey, and the greatest caliph of the Ottoman Empire, Suleiman the Magnificent, wore a turban&#8230;<br />

&#8230;from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suleiman_the_Magnificent" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia</a></p>
<p>As for why the turban would be blue, it’s quite simple: Erdogan frequently wears blue suits&#8230;<br />
<a href="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/blerdogan.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6941" src="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/blerdogan.png" alt="" width="524" height="349" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/blerdogan.png 524w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/blerdogan-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 524px) 100vw, 524px" /></a><br />
&#8230;and <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=presidential+color" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blue is a presidential color</a>. So look for him to wear it (either actually or symbolically) during a post-election summit with the EU, right before he &#8220;releases the hounds.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Now let me show you how Hollywood (with the Nostradamus film) and the globalist geopolitical scriptwriters (with planned events like the migrant invasion) have teamed up to fulfill Nostradamus’ predictions. Here are some quotes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eW24s94Svxg&amp;t=35s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from the film</a> about the man who will <em>&#8220;enter Europe wearing a blue turban&#8221;;</em> I’ve matched them with their corresponding fulfillments&#8230;</p>
<p><em>&#8230;He will be the <strong>terror</strong> of mankind. Never more horror&#8230;</em><br />

<a href="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/merkflight78B.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7414" src="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/merkflight78B.png" alt="" width="577" height="259" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/merkflight78B.png 577w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/merkflight78B-300x135.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 577px) 100vw, 577px" /></a><br />
&#8230;from the <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/698766/Germany-migrant-secret-flights-planes-Syria-Merkel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Express</a>. Here is a key excerpt&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>“Speculation has been rife that the country is ushering in thousands of migrants via Cologne Bonn Airport, fuelled by <strong>the fact every night numerous planes from Turkey are landing</strong>.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The article goes on to offer the German government’s denials of any secret flights, so it’s quite interesting that the author states as a <strong>“fact”</strong> that <strong>“every night numerous planes from Turkey are landing.”</strong> The article offers a preliminary glimpse into the secret cooperation between the Western leaders and Erdogan. And to see how that cooperation fits into the larger context of globalist operations, let me show you something I wrote a couple of years ago. It starts by examining a couple of headlines from the Drudge Report&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/headlines79.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7415" src="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/headlines79.png" alt="" width="410" height="107" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/headlines79.png 410w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/headlines79-300x78.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 410px) 100vw, 410px" /></a></p>
<p>In the headlines outlined in red, we see Drudge foreshadowing the Summer of Terror. Note that the two cities specifically mentioned for attack are the core power centers of the EU. The coming attacks against these power centers and the Vatican will give rise to a growing disinformation meme about an attack against “Christian civilization.” This is what the globalists want you to believe…</p>
<p><em><strong>“Christian civilization is under full-scale assault by Islamists from without and Satanists from within. The secretly-Satanic Western elite made common cause with the Muslims to create a terrorist army and get it into the Western nations in order to bring down Christianity. The Muslims supplied the men and the Satanists opened the gates and brought them in under ‘migrant’ cover.”</strong></em></p>
<p>This idea of a war between civilizations – Muslim versus Christian – is why Drudge added the headline (outlined in yellow) mentioning “civilizational jihad.”</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>Over the past couple of days, I’ve noticed some propaganda pieces that are worth pointing out. So without further ado, here is&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>EXHIBIT A: This is an example of the “war of civilizations” meme I mentioned earlier in this update&#8230;</strong><br />
<a href="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/BBPrince.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2852" src="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/BBPrince.png" alt="BBPrince" width="664" height="801" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/BBPrince.png 664w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/BBPrince-249x300.png 249w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/BBPrince-624x753.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 664px) 100vw, 664px" /></a><br />
&#8230;From <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/06/13/erik-prince-u-s-must-deny-entry-people-may-threaten-christian-way-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Breitbart.com</a>. And here is an excerpt&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> <strong>Erik Prince, former CEO of private security firm Blackwater</strong> who served as a Navy SEAL and <strong>CIA asset</strong>, told Breitbart News Sunday’s Stephen K. Bannon that to win the war against radical Islamic terrorism, the United States must deny entry to people who pose a threat to <strong>America’s Christian way of life</strong>&#8230;</p>
<p>“We have no obligation as a country to allow people in that are an inherent threat or could be an inherent threat to our way of life — to our <strong>Western Judeo-Christian civilization</strong>”&#8230; <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p>
<p>So here we have a “former” CIA asset pointing out the need to deny jihadis entry into America so that “America’s Christian way of life” and “Western Judeo-Christian civilization” can be protected. Seeing this, you have to ask yourself a question&#8230;</p>
<p><em><strong>If the “evil Western elite” are really trying to destroy Christianity and bring in Luciferianism, Satanism, and the New Age, why is one of their CIA flunkies (Erik Prince) speaking about the need to protect Christianity?</strong></em></p>
<p>The answer is that it’s all part of the good cop / bad cop strategy the globalists are using to bring in the real NWO. They are using the “Satanic Western elite’s unipolar world order” to scare people into the arms of the “Christian-led (Putin) multipolar world order.” This is why the fear-mongering disinformation agents who dominate the alternative media (such as Alex Jones) scream so loudly about the Western Satanists&#8230;<br />

<p>Make no mistake&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>The globalists are bringing in their New World Order <a href="http://redefininggod.com/the-rockefeller-plan-for-the-brics-new-world-order-in-their-own-words/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">through Putin and the BRICS</a>, and their ultimate goal is to unite the people of the world under an updated, Kabbalized Christianity.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Now let me share a paragraph I wrote in <a href="http://redefininggod.com/2018/07/globalist-agenda-watch-update-19-the-status-of-ongoing-globalist-operations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Update 19</a> last month&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>As part of their prophecy fulfillment plan, the globalists have had elements of their controlled alternative media narrate a “clash of civilizations” between Islam and Christendom. And according to the script of this contrived drama, the “Western Satanists and Middle-East Islamists” have struck an alliance to destroy Christian civilization. <strong>Part of their strategy to do this has been to infiltrate an Islamist army into Europe under “migrant” cover, then have the “Satanist-run” intelligence agencies of Western Europe supply them with the weapons they need to wreak havoc at the appointed time.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>With this in mind, if we look at the globalists’ own statistics on the migrants, we see that roughly half of them are males of fighting age&#8230;<br />
<a href="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/malemigrants79.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7416" src="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/malemigrants79.png" alt="" width="431" height="167" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/malemigrants79.png 431w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/malemigrants79-300x116.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 431px) 100vw, 431px" /></a><br />
&#8230;from the <a href="http://www.pewglobal.org/2016/08/02/4-asylum-seeker-demography-young-and-male/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew Research Center</a></p>
<p>Roughly 42% are males aged 18-35 (military age), and if you add in the teens and over-35s who are also able to fight, you easily reach over 50% &#8212; not even counting the women who will participate. So once Erdogan calls on the migrants to &#8220;take Europe for Islam&#8221; and the globalist intelligence services hand them their weapons, an army of up to half a million or more jihadis will be running wild in Europe. In comparison, do you know how many personnel are in the German Army? A paltry 60,000. In the French Army? Only 109,000. Europe will have its hands full.</p>
<p>So the secret migrant flights from Erdogan’s Turkey to Merkel’s Germany highlight their secret “Satanic” collaboration to take down “Western Christian Civilization,&#8221; and it&#8217;s all a contrived part of a larger plan: to bring in the New World Order, which is the gateway to their ultimate goal, the fake &#8220;Millennial Kingdom.&#8221;</p>
<p>On another note, guess who’s coming to dinner&#8230;<br />

<p>To understand why it’s significant that the two of them, <a href="http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkish-parliaments-oath-taking-ceremony-to-be-held-on-july-7-134261" target="_blank" rel="noopener">along with Ukraine&#8217;s President Poroshenko</a>, are getting together a week before the Trump-Putin Summit, read the rest of this entry.</p>
<p>Over the next couple of days, I will be gathering my writings on Erdogan for a new addition to the Compendium. Here is the preface I’ve written for the section&#8230;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Erdogan’s globalist-assigned role as Al-Masih ad-Dajjal, the first of two Muslim Antichrists</strong></h2>
<p>The ultimate goal of the globalist plan vis-a-vis the Muslims is to destroy Islam as a religion and exterminate all Muslims who will not convert to Kabbalized Christianity. To achieve this, they have selected two of their minions, Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Iran’s Major General Qasem Soleimani, to play the eschatological roles of Al-Masih ad-Dajjal and the Imam Mahdi respectively.</p>
<p>If you are unfamiliar with Al-Masih ad-Dajjal, Erdogan’s character, here is a little about him <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Masih_ad-Dajjal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from Wikipedia</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> Al-Masih ad-Dajjal (&#8220;the false messiah, liar, the deceiver&#8221;) is an evil figure in Islamic eschatology. He is to appear, pretending to be al-Masih (i.e. the Messiah), before Yawm al-Qiyamah (the Day of Resurrection). He is an anti-messianic figure, comparable to the Antichrist in Christian eschatology and to Armilus in medieval Jewish eschatology. <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>If you are also unfamiliar with the Imam Mahdi, Soleimani’s character, here is a little about him <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahdi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from Wikipedia</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> The Mahdi (literally &#8220;guided one&#8221;) is an eschatological redeemer of Islam who will appear and rule for five, seven, nine or nineteen years (according to differing interpretations) before the Day of Judgment and will rid the world of evil. <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, neither the Dajjal nor the Mahdi were included in the Quran by Allah and Muhammad. They are make-believe characters that were created by lesser men in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadith" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hadith</a>, a collection of writings that were assembled several generations after Muhammad’s passing.</p>
<p>It is the common practice of deceivers to make their lies palatable by mixing them with truths, and so it is with the men who assembled the Hadith. The Hadith were written and compiled to subvert Islam for the selfish purposes of men, and if they are not rejected as the invalid lies that they are, they will give rise to the total destruction of the Muslim world. God does not protect those who live a lie and act improperly because of it.</p>
<p>Using the lies of the Hadith, the globalists will have their chosen Dajjal (Erdogan) create havoc on the international stage so they can script his defeat at the hands of their chosen Mahdi (Soleimani). This will make their Dajjal appear to be a Satanic liar and their Mahdi appear to be Allah’s faithful servant. And seven years later, they will have their Mahdi lead Muslims to their destruction in the Second Battle of Armageddon.</p>
<p>If we cannot deter the globalists from acting on their plans for this year, the Second Battle of Armageddon will occur in the year 2025. So if you are a Muslim, you have just a little over seven years to live &#8212; unless you stop Erdogan and Soleimani. Either Islam will end or those two pretenders will end. The choice is yours.</p>
<p>That being said, this is what I’ve previously written about Erdogan’s role as the Dajjal&#8230;</p>
<p>More to come.</p>
<p><strong>[Section 7 &#8211; 10-13 July 2018] &#8211; The NATO Summit and the Putin-Netanyahu meeting (continued 2)</strong></p>
<p>Tomorrow is the <strong>11</strong>th, the first day of the NATO Summit and the day Putin and Netanyahu will be meeting, and it should give us indications as to which direction the globalists will take the Trump-Putin Summit next week. This is what we’re watching for&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>&gt; Trump-confronting drama at the NATO Summit.</strong> If we see it, the assassination is more likely to go forward. But if the proceedings are portrayed as relatively cordial, it may indicate a backing-off.</p>
<p><strong>&gt; Whether Netanyahu emerges from his meeting with Putin smiling or frowning.</strong> A frown will suggest that the assassination is a go; a smile will suggest a backing-off (on the assassination by Netanyahu and on Russia’s air support for the Syrian offensive by Putin). Netanyahu would then take advantage of the Russian Air Force&#8217;s absence by launching his invasion within a week or two.</p>
<p>Should Putin remain alive and maintain his air support for the offensive, it indicates that the globalists are pressing the delay button once again (and there won’t be an Israeli invasion at this particular time). They&#8217;ll move on to their next contingency plan.</p>
<p><strong>[Addendum &#8211; 12 July 2018] &#8211;</strong> So was there drama at the NATO Summit? Yep&#8230;<br />

&#8230;from <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/07/trump-nato-allies/564881/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Atlantic</a></p>
<p>The Atlantic is a propaganda rag for those globalists assigned to Team Atlantic Empire (to which the Russian “Atlantic Integrationists” are supposedly tied). So having them portray Trump as threatening the viability of the Empire’s military arm establishes another motive for his assassination.</p>
<p>On top of this, the globalists staged a public fight between Trump and Erdogan (who is scripted to be one of the ring leaders of the assassination)&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>“During <strong>public portions</strong> of the meeting&#8217;s opening, <strong>Erdogan was seen involved in a lengthy, heated discussion with his U.S. counterpart Donald Trump</strong>.” &#8211; from the <a href="https://www.dailysabah.com/diplomacy/2018/07/11/erdogan-arrives-to-nato-summit-in-brussels-seen-chatting-with-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daily Sabah</a></p></blockquote>
<p>So from the Trump side, the assassination is still an active possibility.</p>
<p><strong>[Addendum &#8211; 13 July 2018] &#8211; On the Putin side</strong>, Netanyahu began his meeting with Putin with a veiled threat over Russian air support for the Syrian offensive. Right in front of the press, he mentioned the Israeli shootdown of a drone “over Israeli territory” that quite conveniently occurred while he was traveling to Moscow (the Israelis were likely piloting the drone). He then said this&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>“We will continue to act decisively against <strong>any</strong> spillover and <strong>any</strong> infiltration of Israeli territory or airspace.” &#8211; from <a href="http://time.com/5336477/putin-russia-netanyahu-israel-syria/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Time</a></p></blockquote>
<p>At first glance, this statement might not sound like a threat. But if you take a moment to look at the circumstances of what occurred as well as what the Israelis said about it, you begin to see the sinister overtones of Netanyahu’s comments&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>&gt;</strong> <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/israel-shoots-down-syrian-drone-over-golan-heights-1.5466014" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The drone was over the <strong>Golan Heights</strong></a> when it was shot down, and as the Syrian offensive continues to approach that area, Russian warplanes will be flying closer and closer to it.</p>
<p><strong>&gt;</strong> The Israelis went out of their way to say that <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/idf-patriot-missile-fired-toward-incoming-drone-from-syria/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the drone may have <strong>accidentally</strong> crossed over the Heights</a> before being shot down. Given the speed of combat jets and the small area they’ll be operating in, Russian aircraft could easily stray over the Heights during their air support sorties.</p>
<p>So&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>Netanyahu has said that Israel will act decisively against ANY spillover from the Syrian offensive.</li>
<li>The Israelis have established that they’ll shoot down aircraft even if they accidentally fly over the Golan Heights.</li>
<li>Both the Syrian Air Force and Russian air force fly Russian aircraft, which makes positive identification of an intruding armed aircraft difficult.</li>
</ul>
<p>So Netanyahu’s veiled threat to Putin was this&#8230;</p>
<p><em><strong>“If Russian planes inadvertently cross over the Golan Heights during their air support missions, we’ll shoot them down. Accidents happen, so you might want to pull back your air support.”</strong></em></p>
<p>Given this threat, let’s watch for any Russian airstrikes near the Golan Heights over the weekend. If they occur, the assassination is still an active possibility from Putin’s side.</p>
<p>Next, we’ll look at a fallback scenario the globalists are setting up with Hillary Clinton and Erdogan for 2021.</p>

<p>It’ll be interesting to see how the alt-media spin this. Is it a “Deep State effort to sabotage the Trump-Putin Summit” or is it “Trump adding another bargaining chip before his negotiations with Putin”?</p>
<p><em>Later &#8211;</em> After scanning through <a href="https://www.justice.gov/file/1080281/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the indictment</a>, it looks like this will be played as an attempt by Mueller to sabotage Trump and Putin&#8217;s effort to reach agreements and team up.</p>
<p><em>Later &#8211;</em> When I ran across this little gem a few minutes ago, I literally laughed out loud&#8230;<br />

<p>The propaganda guys are going to cartoonish lengths to establish the supposed “Deep State / Western Globalist effort to derail the Trump-Putin Summit.”</p>
<p>Adding to the incredible spectacle of the last few days, the Secret Service just allowed a JFK-level security breach to occur in close proximity to POTUS. <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/6776097/donald-trump-security-scare-as-greenpeace-protester-paraglides/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Watch the video</a> as a leftist protester is allowed to fly up to Trump while the Secret Service does nothing. You can even see Trump scurry into the building as the glider moves within striking distance of him. Such theatrics!</p>
<p>All the summit-sabotaging shenanigans we’ve seen today on Friday the 13th will serve as an excellent setup for one of two possible outcomes on Monday&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Putin and Trump’s &#8220;assassination&#8221; at the Helsinki Summit</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">or</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Putin and Trump’s &#8220;triumph&#8221; at the Helsinki Summit</strong></p>
<p>As I read the tea leaves today, the globalists appear to be on the path to delivering the latter. So tomorrow I’ll cover what will happen at the Summit if there is no assassination attempt:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>a Putin-Trump agreement to withdraw all foreign forces from Syria</strong><br />
<strong>(Iranian, Russian, AND American).</strong></p>
<p>I’ll go into all the hows and whys, including how they’ll handle the Turks, British and French, in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>[Section 9 &#8211; 14 July 2018] &#8211; What will happen if there&#8217;s no assassination</strong></p>
<p>Should the globalists decide against the assassination show on Monday, they will instead script a big win for the “peacemakers” Trump and Putin. <strong>It will take the form of an agreement to withdraw all foreign forces from Syria after the defeat of the final ISIS stronghold of Hajin, Syria.</strong> The withdrawal will include Russian and Iranian forces from Putin’s side and American, British and French forces from Trump’s side. And since neither US nor Russian forces will leave Syria while Turkish forces are still in the north, you’ll later see Erdogan accept a deal to withdraw in return for geographic boundaries for the Kurds. According to the script, Erdogan very much wants the withdrawal of all foreign forces; it would leave Assad as the only barrier between him and the Israeli border.</p>
<p>Such an agreement would be a win-win for Trump and Putin&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>ON TRUMP&#8217;S SIDE</strong>, the narrative has been that he wants to withdraw US forces from Syria, but the “Deep State” twisted his arm to stay until ISIS’s final defeat&#8230;<br />

<p>Well, guess what&#8230; the press are now narrating that ISIS is facing the collapse of its last major stronghold&#8230;<br />

<p>So according to the globalist script, Putin will offer Trump Russia and Iran’s withdrawal from Syria, which will give him political cover for the American pullout. Trump will be able to say&#8230;</p>
<p><em><strong>“ISIS is defeated. Russia is withdrawing. Iran is withdrawing. We won! Now it’s time to go!”</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>ON PUTIN&#8217;S SIDE</strong>, the agreement will thoroughly fulfill his stated mission for Russia’s intervention in Syria&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> Shortly after the operation began, Russian officials were cited as saying that, apart from <strong>fighting terrorist organisations such as ISIL</strong>, Russia&#8217;s goals included <strong>helping the Syrian government retake territory from various anti-government groups</strong> that are labelled by the U.S. and its coalition as “moderate opposition”, a broader geopolitical objective being to <strong>roll back U.S. influence</strong>. In his televised interview broadcast on 11 October 2015, Russian president Vladimir Putin said the military operation had been thoroughly prepared in advance; he defined <strong>Russia&#8217;s goal in Syria as &#8220;stabilising the legitimate power in Syria and creating the conditions for political compromise.”</strong> &#8211; from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_military_intervention_in_the_Syrian_Civil_War" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia</a> <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>So Putin will be able to say&#8230;</p>
<p><em><strong>“We began the intervention in Syria to help defeat the ISIS terrorists. This mission was accomplished. We intended to help the Syrian government retake its territory from foreign proxy groups. This mission was accomplished. We intended to roll back US influence in the internal affairs of Syria and the region. With the American withdrawal, this mission is accomplished. We intended to stabilize the legitimate government of Syria. This mission was accomplished. We intended to create conditions for a political compromise. With this agreement with President Trump, this mission is accomplished and our goals are fulfilled. Now we can bring our victorious forces home.”</strong></em></p>
<p>Putin will also be able to say that he kept his word to President Assad&#8230;<br />

<p>Given the advantages of such an agreement to both sides, this deal seems the globalists&#8217; obvious scripting for a &#8220;Trump Triumphant&#8221; scenario. The preparatory propaganda is certainly hinting at it&#8230;<br />

<p>&#8230;even as it also talks of supposed &#8220;Neocon panic&#8221; over such a deal (which would provide the Evil Deep State characters with another strong motivation to follow through on an assassination as part of a &#8220;Vindex Falls&#8221; scenario)&#8230;<br />

<p>So will the globalists opt for the deal or the assassination show to supposedly stop the deal? I currently think it’s a little more likely that they’ll do the deal, but I wouldn’t bet my life on it. We’ll find out Monday.</p>
<p>By the way, I wrote this back in Section 5&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>The globalists seem to be timing the Syrian offensive in the south to bring them near the Golan Heights around the time of the summit&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>This means that right before the Helsinki Summit, the eastern pocket may fall and the Syrians and Russians would start focusing the whole of their attention on the western pocket near the Golan Heights.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Well, lo and behold&#8230;<br />

&#8230;from <a href="https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/syrian-air-defense-on-high-alert-as-saa-prepares-for-offensive-near-occupied-golan-heights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Al-Masdar News</a></p>
<p>Everything is cued-up to go in either direction.</p>
<p>Oh, and one more thing&#8230;</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier in this entry, if a 100 kiloton nuclear attack by &#8220;ISIS terrorists&#8221; occurs, look for them to either live-stream the attack or post a pre-recorded video around the time of the attack. They&#8217;ll do this for two reasons: <strong>1) to establish that the attack was conducted by ISIS</strong> (since the attackers will be vaporized in the blast, it will be hard for the globalists to credibly blame ISIS without video evidence), and <strong>2) to show the bomb</strong>, which will look like this&#8230;<br />
<a href="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/nkn714.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7455" src="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/nkn714.png" alt="" width="519" height="347" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/nkn714.png 519w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/nkn714-300x201.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 519px) 100vw, 519px" /></a></p>
<p>They&#8217;ll show the bomb in the video so people will recognize it as a &#8220;North Korean&#8221; nuke (even though it will actually be an Israeli copy). The controlled alt-media guys will go crazy measuring it and counting the number of bolts on it to prove that it&#8217;s North Korean. This is how the globalists will ignite the Asian part of the war.</p>
<p><strong>[Section 10 &#8211; 15 July 2018] &#8211;</strong> The Summit is now hours away, so what will we see? A mushroom cloud? A pandemic? A deal on Syria? The best outcome would be a few quick meetings followed by a meaningless agreement and a quick afternoon departure, just like the Singapore Summit. Such a result would indicate that the globalists abandoned any big plans they had for it.</p>
<p>Here are two more things to watch for as we go into tomorrow&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>1) A “Deep State” chemical false flag in Syria to prevent a Syria agreement at the Summit.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2) A “sonic attack” on Trump and/or Putin</strong> like <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/2154903/us-health-agency-joins-investigation-sonic-attacks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">those the American diplomats have been suffering around the world</a>. If such an attack were to &#8220;incapacitate&#8221; Trump, he could be removed from office under the 25th Amendment. The presence of sonic weapons could be another reason for the seagulls leaving town.</p>
<p>Let’s just hope the seagulls left because of non-weaponized sonic emitters the Finns used to drive out the birds and clean up before the Summit &#8212; a measure they would publicly deny to avoid pissing off the environmentalists.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Helsinki Summit and “Disease X”</strong></h3>
<p>A reader passed along a rather curious article this morning&#8230;<br />

&#8230;from <a href="https://sputniknews.com/world/201807131066334121-seagulls-leave-helsinki-trump-putin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sputnik</a></p>
<p>Back during the Singapore Summit, I warned about a possible biological method of assassination whereby an agent that takes a week or more to manifest infection symptoms would be administered to the target(s). They would then leave the Summit feeling fine only to die of an &#8220;untreatable&#8221; infection days later. And if you think about it, there are two ways to accomplish such a hit: <strong>1) directly infect the target(s) from close range</strong>, or <strong>2) infect the hosting city before the target’s arrival, leading to the infection of the target while he’s there</strong>. So did the seagulls sense something in the air? Are they feeling ill?</p>
<p>Given the extensive research the Soviet Union conducted on biological agents and dispersal mechanisms, it’s certainly within the capabilities of the FSB to infect a city (and then point the finger at ISIS). And if it’s been done, it’s already too late for the people of Helsinki (and everywhere else).</p>
<p>Helsinki is a very busy transportation hub for people traveling all over Europe. So if a communicable biological agent was released there in the past week or so, it’s already spreading globally (helped along by people from all over the world who are mixing together at the World Cup). And its spread will enable the globalists to activate the “Disease X” lockdown scenario for which they’ve been preparing the public&#8230;<br />

<p><em>If “Disease X” is a highly-communicable <strong>bird flu</strong> engineered to have a slow (7-17 day) incubation period in humans, <strong>might it affect seagulls more quickly?</strong></em></p>
<p>The net effect of a Disease X outbreak in Helsinki is that both Putin and Trump will pretend to die from it (rest assured that they&#8217;ve been inoculated against the agent and that the infection is treatable for &#8220;the right people&#8221;). And this would elevate Pence and Medvedev to the presidencies, with the &#8220;pandemic&#8221; giving them an excuse to do their police state lockdown right off the bat.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s hope the seagulls come back.</p>

			<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>(This post was published on the Home Page from June 13 &#8211; June 26)</strong></p>
<p>In this entry, we’ll check in on all the event triggers and plots the globalists are attempting to set up and carry out this year. And we’ll start with <strong>Erdogan’s planned invasion of Israel</strong> (see <a href="http://redefininggod.com/2018/05/globalist-agenda-watch-2018-update-18-how-the-united-nations-general-assembly-will-unleash-erdogans-invasion-of-israel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Update 18</a> for background information on this plot).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.un.org/pga/72/wp-content/uploads/sites/51/2018/06/PGA-letter-10th-emergency-special-session.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Today at 3PM EDT(US), the United Nations General Assembly will hold another meeting of the 10th Emergency Special Session on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict</a>. In this meeting, they will overwhelmingly pass a Turkish/Algerian draft resolution calling for an “international protection force” for the Palestinians. And while I’ve been unable to track down an online copy of the draft resolution, I did come across one element of it in a press report&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> The draft resolution “requests the [UN] Secretary-General to examine the present situation and to submit a written report, as soon as possible, but <strong>not later than 60 days from the adoption of the present resolution</strong>, containing, inter alia, his proposals on ways and means for ensuring the safety, protection and well-being of the Palestinian civilian population under Israeli occupation, including, inter alia, recommendations regarding an international protection mechanism”. &#8211; from the <a href="https://www.aa.com.tr/en/world/unga-likely-to-discuss-palestine-resolution-next-week/1170448" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Andalou Agency</a> <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>So once the resolution passes, the question will be&#8230;</p>
<p><em>Will it contain language that Erdogan can seize upon to quickly move an initial protection force into place before or slightly after the Turkish election (June 24), or will he have to wait till August?</em></p>
<p>Once the passed resolution is posted online, I’ll dig through it to get the answer.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>~ MORE 1 ~</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-palestinians-un/united-nations-condemns-excessive-israeli-force-against-palestinians-idUSKBN1J935B" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The resolution has passed by a vote of 120-8</a>, so now I wait for them to post the text of the resolution on the UN website.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>~ MORE 2 ~</strong></p>
<p>I’ve read through <a href="https://undocs.org/A/ES-10/L.23" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the resolution</a>, and they’ve essentially pressed the delay button until the Secretary General issues his report. Although the report deadline is in mid-August, it’s possible it could be completed in July, especially if there is an “urgent need” due to “increasing Israeli atrocities.” Should they wait until mid-August, though, the invasion will occur in September, right on time for the “Battle of Armageddon.”</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>“Erdogan’s Plan” to Assassinate the “Two Great Christian Leaders” in Austria</strong></h3>
<p>As part of their prophecy fulfillment plan, the globalists have had elements of their controlled alternative media narrate a “clash of civilizations” between Islam and Christendom. And according to the script of this contrived drama, the “Western Satanists and Middle-East Islamists” have struck an alliance to destroy Christian civilization. Part of their strategy to do this has been to infiltrate an Islamist army into Europe under “migrant” cover, then have the “Satanist-run” intelligence agencies of Western Europe supply them with the weapons they need to wreak havoc at the appointed time.</p>
<p>With this in mind, have a look at what is happening in Austria right now&#8230;<br />
<a href="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/austriamosque614.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7253" src="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/austriamosque614.png" alt="" width="590" height="239" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/austriamosque614.png 590w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/austriamosque614-300x122.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px" /></a><br />
&#8230;from <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/jerusalem/2018/06/10/erdogan-predicts-war-between-the-cross-and-crescent-over-austria-mosque-closures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Breitbart</a>. Here are some striking excerpts&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan attacked Austria’s impending closure of mosques and consequent expulsion of Turkish-funded imams, saying the move is anti-Islamic while promising a response&#8230;</p>
<p>Mr. Erdogan, speaking Saturday, said: “They say they’re going to kick our religious men out of Austria. Do you think we will not react if you do such a thing?”</p>
<p>“That means we’re going to have to do something,” he added without elaborating&#8230;</p>
<p>The new policy comes after a number of scandals involving mosques in Austria, including one in which Islamists were plotting to overthrow the government to replace it with an Islamic caliphate. The ATIB association came under fire last week when a Turkish mosque posted images of young children swearing oaths to the Turkish state.” <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>And can you guess where they’re currently planning to hold the Trump-Putin Summit? Here is some preparatory propaganda about it that came out this week&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> <strong>At present a Trump-Putin summit carries a literal life-and-death urgency.</strong> There must be a clear understanding between the leaders of the two nuclear superpowers before some mishap somewhere results in unimaginable catastrophe for both countries and for the whole world.</p>
<p><strong>The summit must happen – soon.</strong> Judging from their statements both presidents agree, <strong>and Austria has already offered to host the meeting in Vienna</strong>. &#8211; from <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/jun/11/trump-putin-summit-right-move/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Washington Times</a> <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Within the prophecy fulfillment / “Clash of Civilizations” stage play, Erdogan is playing a character named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Masih_ad-Dajjal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Al-Masih ad-Dajjal</a>, the Muslim version of the Anti-Christ. <strong>So when the “two great Christian leaders,” Trump and Putin, show up in Austria this summer, the Dajjal can retaliate against Austria and “destroy the heart of the Christian resistance” in one fell swoop.</strong> And the most likely method of assassination will be “ISIS detonating a North Korean nuke in Vienna.”</p>
<p>I have lots more information on this scenario, and I&#8217;ll write about it in intricate detail if they foolishly attempt to go forward with it.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Why Rome also will be nuked by Erdogan</strong></h3>
<p>According to the globalist script, it was inevitable that Erdogan would butt heads with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/18/world/europe/austria-chancellor-kurz.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the new “populist government” of Austria</a> and its anti-migrant policies. That being said, can you think of another European country that just got a new anti-migrant “populist government&#8221;?&#8230;<br />

&#8230;from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/01/world/europe/italy-government-populist.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The New York Times</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/11/world/europe/italy-migrant-boat-aquarius.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Italy’s new government has already moved to block the arrival of a migrant ship</a>, and in a remarkable “coincidence,” their capital city also hosts one of the “great Christian leaders,” the Pope. So it’s only a matter of time before the script has Erdogan spitting fire at them. <strong>And just like a well-timed nuclear attack against Austria’s capital city would bring the death of two of Christianity’s “great leaders,” Trump and Putin, another such attack against Italy’s capital city would bring the death of the third. A destroyed Vatican would “decapitate the Crusaders” once and for all.</strong></p>
<p>If the globalists proceed with their war plan this year, a nuclear attack on Rome is almost a certainty. The “prophesied” fiery destruction of Rome is something their premier Christian prophecy propagandist, Tom Horn, has heavily promoted. <a href="http://www.newswithviews.com/Horn/thomas196.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">With “prophetic” quote after “prophetic” quote, he says that “the City of Seven Hills will be destroyed” at a time of “apostasy and the rise of the False Prophet and Antichrist.”</a></p>
<p>Here is the apostasy&#8230;<br />

<p>After the planned Islamist Intifada in Europe, people will think that Erdogan was the Antichrist. But when the NWO approaches its 3.5 year mark, the globalists will make sure the public realize that Putin, who will have defeated Erdogan, <em>“was the real Antichrist all along&#8221;</em> &#8212; that <em>&#8220;he had Erdogan pretend to be the Antichrist so he could pretend to be Christ.&#8221;</em> And 3.5 years after that, the globalists will present us with their &#8220;real Christ&#8221; who will defeat Putin.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Erdogan&#8217;s war on the EU will begin in Cyprus</strong></h3>
<p>If you are a longtime reader, you may remember that we tracked a developing scenario back in March that involved a Turkish drill ship violating Cyprus’ Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) to start a confrontation with the EU (Cyprus is an EU member state). Here are some key excerpts from back then&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>To provide a little historical context to what’s happening now&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> On 15 July 1974, the Greek military junta under Dimitrios Ioannides carried out a coup d&#8217;etat in Cyprus, to unite the island with Greece. The coup ousted president Makarios III and replaced him with pro-enosis nationalist Nikos Sampson. In response to the coup, five days later, on 20 July 1974, the Turkish army invaded the island, citing a right to intervene to restore the constitutional order from the 1960 Treaty of Guarantee. <strong>This justification has been rejected by the United Nations and the international community.</strong> &#8211; from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus#1974_coup,_Turkish_invasion_and_division" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia</a> <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p>
<p>This Turkish invasion led to the partitioning of the island, and the Turks subsequently established the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Cyprus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus</a>, which is <em>“a partially recognised state that comprises the northeastern portion of the island of Cyprus. <strong>Recognised only by Turkey, Northern Cyprus is considered by the international community to be part of the Republic of Cyprus.</strong>”</em></p>
<p>Turkey’s claim on resources in the Cyprus EEZ is based on this Northern Cyprus puppet regime, which is not recognized by the UN or the “international community.” So when Cyprus requests assistance in keeping the Turks out of their EEZ, the US and EU will respond under the pretext of “upholding international law.” And their successful expulsion of the Turkish drill ship and navy will lead to Erdogan’s “embarrassment and outrage,” thus spurring his cancellation of the migrant deal.</p>
<p>Here is how the confrontation spiral may develop:</p>
<p>1) Turkey will send the drill ship into Cyprus’ Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).<br />
2) The Cyprus Navy will send their patrol boats to confront it.<br />
3) Turkey will then send some of their large warships to intimidate the patrol boats.<br />
4) Cyprus will reach out to the US and EU navies for assistance, which will be provided.<br />
5) An &#8220;outraged&#8221; Erdogan will &#8220;release the hounds.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, when the big events they had planned for that timeframe got cancelled, the whole drill ship confrontation scenario got put on the back burner&#8230; <strong>until this month&#8230;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;<strong>The Turkish drillship Fatih, formerly DeepSea Metro II</strong>, is close to Antalya in Turkey on with the intention of heading at some point soon for the Eastern Mediterranean to begin deep-sea drilling, possibly close to or inside Cyprus’ exclusive economic zone (EEZ).</p>
<p><strong>Observers expect the drillship to remain in Antalya until after the Turkish elections on June 24.</strong> According to Politis, its sources said any drilling actions by Turkey in the region could trigger tensions, not only around Cyprus but also in Israel, Egypt and Lebanon.</p>
<p>It said, the arrival of the <strong>Fatih, (‘Conqueror’ in Turkish)</strong>&#8230;&#8221; &#8211; from a June 5 <a href="https://cyprus-mail.com/2018/06/05/turkish-drillship-close-to-antalya/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cyprus-Mail article</a></p></blockquote>
<p>So this is the trigger scenario the globalists now plan to use to get the Erdogan-EU war started after the Turkish election. Following the naval confrontation, Erdogan will cancel the migrant deal and flood the EU with a new wave of migrants. Later, he’ll kick off the European Intifada when he hits the Trump-Putin summit and/or the Vatican.</p>
<p><strong>[ALERT Addendum &#8211; 17 June 2018] &#8211; Be on the lookout for a Turkish strike against Assad and Soleimani in the coming weeks.</strong> <a href="https://www.dailysabah.com/defense/2018/06/04/turkey-receives-official-invitation-for-f-35-delivery" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Turkey is taking delivery of its first F-35 stealth jet on June 21</a> (right here in Fort Worth), just three days before the Turkish election. This jet would be the perfect instrument to strike the two leaders without warning. Look for it to possibly happen during a meeting of the two, and look for the strike to initially be blamed on Israel.</p>
<p><strong>Also be on the lookout for an imminent Israeli military incursion into southern Syria <em>“to establish a buffer zone between Israel and Iranian forces in the area.”</em></strong> This incursion may be accompanied by or followed by a massive Israeli and/or US Coalition air assault on Syrian and Iranian forces throughout the country.</p>
<p>Israel and the US will ostensibly be doing this to “kick Iran out of Syria,” but the real purpose is to clear the way for Turkish forces to roll down through Syria to attack Israel for the “Battle of Armageddon.” Surviving government and rebel forces in Syria will then be eager to join with Erdogan to push Israel out of Syria and destroy her completely.</p>
<p><strong>[ALERT Addendum, Part 2 &#8211; 19 June 2018] &#8211;</strong> I stumbled across all this by observing currently unfolding events and by watching a prophecy propaganda interview of Joel Richardson on Tom Horn’s Skywatch TV network &#8212; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBGHblD5q0U&amp;t=1m26s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an interview that begins with what appears to be a thumb-on-knuckle Masonic handshake</a>&#8230;<br />
<a href="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/skymason618.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7275" src="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/skymason618.png" alt="" width="670" height="385" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/skymason618.png 670w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/skymason618-300x172.png 300w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/skymason618-624x359.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" /></a></p>
<p>Near the end of the interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBGHblD5q0U&amp;t=23m33s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at the 23:33 mark</a>, Richardson brings up something I haven’t heard out of them before. And he prefaces his remarks by talking of the need to be humble when interpreting the Bible (because he knows he is about to give a deliberately misleading, halfway accurate prediction).</p>
<p>He suggests that before the Gog-Magog War begins, there will be a <em>“massive regional Iranian-Turkish war first”</em> and that <em>“we may be seeing that right now with Iran invading all the way over to Syria and eventually Turkey responding.”</em> <em>“ Turkey’s already invading Syria right now,”</em> he adds. He then offers the reason for the preliminary war with a question: <em>“How is it that we expect Iran to come under a Turkish-led coalition, unless one is defeated?”</em></p>
<p>Upon hearing this, it didn’t take long to realize what he’s driving towards.</p>
<p>The globalists have neither the time nor inclination to stage a big war between Turkey and Iran before Gog-Magog, <em>but they do have both the time and inclination to stage an assassination</em>. Within the globalist prophecy fulfillment script, Erdogan is playing Islam’s Satanic false messiah, the Dajjal, and Iran’s Qasem Soleimani is playing the real messiah, the Mahdi. So the scriptwriters will have the Dajjal strike down the Mahdi in a fake assassination before Gog-Magog begins. The Mahdi will then be &#8220;resurrected&#8221; to return at the climax of the “Battle of Armageddon,” which will culminate Gog-Magog.</p>
<p>Previously, I had been wondering how they would get Turkey, Iran and Syria to cooperate in the invasion of Israel. And thanks to the propagandists at Skywatch TV and current events, I now know how they’ll do it&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>1) They’ll have Israel invade southern Syria</strong>, which will make every Muslim fighting in every faction in Syria want to stop fighting each other and start fighting Israel.</p>
<p>On the same day I listened to the Skywatch TV interview, I saw this in the news&#8230;<br />

&#8230;from <a href="https://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Report-Iranian-backed-Syrian-militias-change-uniforms-head-toward-Golan-560178" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Jerusalem Post</a>. Here is an excerpt&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> Hezbollah and Iranian- backed Shi’ite militias are concentrating in an area dubbed the “triangle of death” near the Golan Heights, as <strong>the Syrian regime prepares its major post-Ramadan offensive</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>The offensive is designed to defeat the rebels in southern Syria</strong> and has raised concerns in Jerusalem, Washington, Moscow and Amman as a potential crisis looms.</p>
<p><strong>This comes as Israel continues warning the Syrian regime to remove Iranian forces from the country.</strong> <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>For a while now, <a href="https://warontherocks.com/2018/02/israels-deepening-involvement-syrias-rebels/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Israel has been supporting a group of Muslim militias in southern Syria</a> to supposedly keep Iranian forces away from the Israeli border. But this supposed post-Ramadan Syrian offensive threatens to displace those militias and leave Iran-backed militias in their place. This is something Netanyahu will not accept.</p>
<p>So if you combine this with <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/idf-launches-surprise-exercise-in-golan-heights-amid-lingering-iran-tensions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent news of Israeli reservists being activated for a surprise “drill” near the Golan Heights</a>, you start to see that the IDF will be pushing into southern Syria to ostensibly stop Iran from getting closer to their border. And as the Jerusalem Post article suggests, Netanyahu will not confine his air support for the operation to southern Syria. He’ll be hitting Iranian forces everywhere in the country.</p>
<p><strong>2) They’ll have Israel and the US Coalition hobble Iranian and government forces in Syria with massive airstrikes</strong>. This will save Erdogan from having Muslim blood on his hands as he moves his forces through Syria.</p>
<p>In addition to the Israeli air campaign hinted-at in the Jerusalem Post article, we’ve seen this warning coming out of Russia&#8230;<br />

&#8230;from <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-06-14/russia-warns-credible-information-impending-staged-chemical-attack-syria" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zero Hedge</a></p>
<p>So when the Syrian offensive in the south begins, we may also see a chemical false-flag blamed on the Syrian government that will unleash US Coalition airstrikes on government forces. The result would be a massive combined air campaign in which the IDF would focus on Iranian targets in Syria and the Coalition would focus on Syrian government targets.</p>
<p><strong>3) They’ll have Erdogan (the Dajjal) assassinate Soleimani (the Mahdi) in a way that looks like Israel did it (probably with a stealth air strike)</strong>. This, plus the airstrikes from point 2, will result in Iran blaming Israel and the US for the deaths of Soleimani and their forces.</p>
<p>And since they’ll have no organized forces left in Syria, Iran will&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>order their surviving men to fight alongside the remnants of the Syrian army in the invasion of Israel</li>
<li>support Soleimani’s invasion of Israel with their rocket forces</li>
<li>possibly unleash a few “North Korean-made nukes” on the US</li>
</ul>
<p>Back on March 29, I wrote this&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Israel just established their capability to take out Soleimani wherever he may be&#8230;</strong><br />

&#8230;from the <a href="http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Report-Israeli-stealth-fighters-fly-over-Iran-547421" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jerusalem Post</a>. Here is an excerpt&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> Sources quoted in Al-Jarida stated that two stealth fighters flew over <strong>Syrian</strong> and <strong>Iraqi</strong> airspace to reach <strong>Iran</strong>, and even targeted locations in the Iranian cities Bandar Abbas, Esfahan and Shiraz. <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p>
<p>Syria, Iraq and Iran are the places Qasem Soleimani spends the bulk of his time, so if the stealth fighters can fly through those nations undetected, they can get to him any time they want.</p></blockquote>
<p>At that time, I expected Netanyahu to take out Soleimani in order to enrage the Iranians into attacking Israel. But now that I think about the planned Soleimani assassination show within the context of the globalist prophecy fulfillment plan, <strong>it seem only natural that the Dajjal will be the one to kill the Mahdi</strong>, and that he’ll do it in a way that casts suspicion on Israel. And since the Israelis made such a big deal about threatening Iran with their stealth strike capabilities, a stealth jet attack will do nicely as a means of assassination.</p>
<p>As I pointed out in the alert, Erdogan will get his first stealth jet on June 21st, and this is the official plan they’ve had for it&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> Turkey should be officially delivered the first of 100 F-35As on order, on Jun. 21, in the U.S.</p>
<p><strong>Two TuAF pilots are currently being trained in the U.S.</strong>; after the training is completed, and another stealth aircraft is delivered, <strong>the F-35 jets are planned to be brought to Turkey in September of 2019</strong>. The trained <strong>pilots will fly the two F-35s from the U.S., accompanied by a refueling plane</strong>&#8230; &#8211; from <a href="https://theaviationist.com/2018/05/11/turkeys-first-f-35a-lightning-ii-stealth-aircraft-makes-maiden-flight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Aviationist</a> <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>So the world thinks that Turkey’s first stealth aircraft won’t arrive in Turkey until late 2019, but will they really wait that long? The globalists have arranged for both <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-israel-wary-about-f-35-sale-to-turkey-hopes-u-s-denies-upgrade-1.6119034" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Israel</a> and <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/turkey/u-s-senate-moves-to-block-sale-of-f-35-jets-to-turkey-1.6193142" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the US Congress</a> to talk about denying Turkey any F-35s, thus giving the Turks motivation to fly it home immediately. And to ostensibly avoid triggering the Israelis and the Congress, both the Pentagon and the Turks will want to do it quietly. We may not learn about it until after the war.</p>
<p>Once enough time has elapsed to fly the F-35 from Fort Worth to Turkey, the globalists will be free to stage the Soleimani assassination any time they wish. And to ensure that Erdogan will eventually get credit for the strike, they may employ a Turkish SOM cruise missile&#8230;<br />

&#8230;Here’s more about the SOM: <a href="https://www.realcleardefense.com/2017/12/15/a_turkish_standoff_missile_on_the_f-35_299010.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOM_(missile)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2</a>.</p>
<p>In case the Turkish F-35 isn’t mission-ready at the chosen time, they’ll make sure the Israelis have a SOM to fire from one of their F-35s. Netanyahu and Erdogan work for the same people after all.</p>
<p>Both the F-35 and the SOM are stealthy, so the total lack of radar warning before the missile impact will lead everyone to conclude that it was a stealth attack. And given that everyone knows of Israel’s stealth capability and no one will suspect that Turkey&#8217;s is operational, the blame will naturally fall on Israel (until after the war when the missile debris is objectively analyzed).</p>
<p><strong>4) They’ll have someone assassinate Assad.</strong> It could be Erdogan, Netanyahu, or the US “Deep State” that ultimately gets the historical credit, but the initial war-starting blame will be put on Netanyahu’s shoulders&#8230;<br />

<p>Assad’s death will leave Syria in disorder, and the Syrians will then be eager to fall in behind a strong leader, Erdogan, to strike at Israel.</p>
<p>As for when this chain of events will be set in motion, the first time window is <strong>June 21- June 25</strong>. But the climactic battle won&#8217;t likely take place until early September&#8230;<br />

<p><strong>[Addendum &#8211; 20 June 2018] &#8211; The Lubavitchers plot the Jordanian invasion of Israel</strong></p>
<p>Before I tell you what happened yesterday, here is a bit of background on what’s been going on in Jordan from a <a href="http://redefininggod.com/2018/05/june-11-30-is-shaping-up-to-be-a-shtstorm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous entry</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Shifting our gaze to the Middle East, <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/jordan-protests-snowball-over-imf-backed-austerity-070639164.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there are IMF austerity-inspired protests underway in Jordan</a>. And such unrest could potentially lead to the fall of the existing government led by Prime Minister Hani Al-Mulki. This would be significant because Mulki “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hani_Al-Mulki#Career" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chaired the negotiating committee which produced the Israel-Jordan peace treaty between Jordan and Israel in 1994</a>.” So a new government would likely be anti-IMF, anti-West, and anti-Israel. And <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=erdogan+jordan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the press have already been narrating Jordan&#8217;s king growing closer to Erdogan</a>.</p>
<p>The globalists may be orchestrating this in order to open Jordan to Erdogan’s invasion force for Israel. Israel would then face invasion from the north (Lebanon and Syria), east (Jordan), and south (Egypt) in September. It would literally take a miracle to save Israel from all that, and that&#8217;s exactly what the globalists have planned.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>“<strong>Jordan’s new prime minister will be more responsive to the public mood</strong> than his predecessor, who quit on Monday, analysts have said.</p>
<p><strong>King Abdullah accepted Hani Al-Mulki’s resignation</strong> after nearly a week of street protests against a draft tax law linked to an economic package from the International Monetary Fund.</p>
<p>Al-Mulki’s fate was sealed at a face-to-face meeting with the king at the Husseiniya palace on Sunday night, sources said. Local media reported that the education minister, <strong>Omar Al-Razzaz</strong>, has been asked to form a government.”</p></blockquote>
<p>So if the new Jordanian Prime Minister, Omar Razzaz, is going to be more responsive to the public mood, what might that mean for Israel?&#8230;<br />

<p>It should also be noted that Razzaz’s father, Munif Razzaz, was an Arab nationalist who was murdered while under house arrest. Here is a bit of his ideology &#8212; the ideology under which Omar was raised&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> <strong>Resentments towards the Western powers for creating Israel could never be forgotten Razzaz believed, and the creation of Israel led to the popular demand of an end to all Western tutelage in the Arab world.</strong> Razzaz claimed that Arab nationalism was the conflict between two forces; the reactionary classes and the masses. The reactionary classes were inefficient vassals of Western capitalist imperialism who had betrayed the nation, while the masses were &#8220;anti-imperialist, anti-capitalist and <strong>anti-Zionist</strong>, and in favour of unity, freedom, socialism and neutralism.&#8221; &#8211; from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munif_Razzaz#Thought" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia</a> <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>So now his son Omar is in position to help bring about the destruction of Israel and see his father’s dream fulfilled. It’s some rather Disney-esque scripting on the globalists’ part, but I&#8217;m sure the ladies will like it.</p>
<p><strong>[Addendum &#8211; 21 June 2018] &#8211;</strong> I stumbled upon an article today that raises some interesting questions&#8230;<br />

<p>A new war in Syria would provide Netanyahu with a timely distraction, don’t you think? And that’s precisely what the scriptwriters want you to think: that what’s about to happen is driven by political forces, not occult agendas.</p>
<p><strong>[Addendum &#8211; 22 June 2018] &#8211;</strong> It’s getting very close now&#8230;<br />
<a href="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/zerohour622.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7309" src="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/zerohour622.png" alt="" width="953" height="133" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/zerohour622.png 953w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/zerohour622-300x42.png 300w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/zerohour622-768x107.png 768w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/zerohour622-624x87.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 953px) 100vw, 953px" /></a><br />
&#8230;from <a href="https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/zero-hour-approaches-ne-daraa-as-syrian-troops-prepare-to-start-offensive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Al-Masdar News</a>. Here is an excerpt regarding the element of the offensive that will trigger the coming Israeli incursion&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>“In addition to the upcoming assault on northeast Dara’a, the Syrian Arab Army and their allies from the National Defense Forces (NDF) have also moved in position to launch their <strong>Al-Quneitra offensive</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>With the jihadist rebels launching several attacks on Al-Quneitra recently, the Syrian military has made the decision to kickoff this operation in the coming days.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The U.S. State Department has warned the Syrian and Russian governments against launching this offensive; however, Damascus has ignored Washington’s calls regarding this upcoming operation.</strong>”</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/jihadist-rebels-launch-attack-near-occupied-golan-heights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Israelis have had their militia proxy forces attack Syrian forces in Quneitra</a> to goad the Syrians into launching the offensive. Once they do, the Israeli incursion and air strikes will begin. The last paragraph about the Syrians and Russians ignoring US warnings hints at the US Coalition airstrikes to come.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>What’s going on with Merkel and Erdogan</strong></h3>
<p>Before I show you what I want to show you today, let’s review a little background information from a couple of previous entries&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>They have pressed the replay button for Erdogan’s migrant invasion / intifada in Europe.</strong> I wrote about this in <a href="http://redefininggod.com/2018/04/globalist-agenda-watch-war-mass-arrests-watch-part-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[Update 17 – 17 May 2018] – The Dajjal, Turkey’s Erdogan, prepares his invasions of Israel and Europe</a>. Here is the relevant section&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> On the European front, the globalists have installed another trigger for Erdogan’s “migrant invasion of Christendom.” <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/18/europe/erdogan-turkey-early-elections-intl/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Turkish presidential election that will give him new powers is scheduled for June 24</a>. And <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/global-europe/news/eu-still-seeking-june-deal-on-refugee-plan-says-blocs-migration-chief/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the next EU summit to deal with the migrant problem is scheduled for June 28-29</a>. This close timing is no mere coincidence.</p>
<p>The globalist script will have Erdogan either win the election with clear signs of improprieties or be forced into a second round election with his power in jeopardy. So less than a week after the first round of the election, they’ll have him pick a fight with Europe to either distract the Turkish people from the voting improprieties or create an emergency that will forestall the second round of the election. <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p>
<p>Now if we look at <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/can-turkeys-economic-turmoil-derail-erdogans-reelection-1527759001" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the economic troubles that are flaring up on Erdogan right now</a>, as well as <a href="https://ahvalnews.com/meral-aksener/turkish-nationalist-presidential-candidate-says-opposition-alliance-should-continue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the uniting of the opposition parties against him</a>, there is talk that he could lose the election or at least the first round. This is in keeping with the scenario I’ve outlined.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#8212;</p>
<p>In the May 8 Special Note, I talked about the globalist attempt to artificially fulfill the “prophecies” of Nostradamus, and I said this…</p>
<p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> So don’t be surprised if you see Erdogan sporting a blue turban after the upcoming Turkish presidential election. The election will effectively make him the Caliph of Turkey, and the greatest caliph of the Ottoman Empire, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suleiman_the_Magnificent" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Suleiman the Magnificent</a>, wore a turban…</p>
<p>…look for him to wear it (either actually or symbolically) <strong>during a post-election summit</strong> with the EU, right before he “releases the hounds.” <strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>With the idea of Erdogan showing up in the EU after the election in mind, get a load of this&#8230;<br />
<a href="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/merkerd622.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7305" src="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/merkerd622.png" alt="" width="485" height="649" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/merkerd622.png 485w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/2a8.e4e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/merkerd622-224x300.png 224w" sizes="(max-width: 485px) 100vw, 485px" /></a><br />
&#8230;from the <a href="http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/merkel-erdogan-invited-to-germany-after-turkeys-elections-132545" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hurriyet Daily News</a></p>
<p>On the day after this report showed up in the Turkish media, <a href="https://anfenglish.com/news/berlin-refutes-merkel-s-invitation-to-erdogan-27057" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the German media refuted it</a>, perhaps based on the improper protocol of the invitation. But these competing accounts raise an obvious question&#8230;</p>
<p><em>Did Merkel really invite Erdogan, or has Erdogan invited himself?</em></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_general_election,_2018" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The second round of the Turkish election will occur, if needed, on <strong>July 8</strong></a>. So according to the mainstream narrative, if Erdogan fails to secure a majority of the vote on June 24, he’ll have two weeks to do something to get the Turkish people to “rally around the flag.” Showing up at the EU Summit or in Berlin in the days that follow will provide him with the perfect opportunity to pick a fight with the EU over their migration policies.</p>
<p>Also, let’s not forget that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/merkels-government-faces-internal-rebellion-over-immigration-in-germany/2018/06/18/69efe4e6-70bc-11e8-b4d8-eaf78d4c544c_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the press are narrating the potential fall of Merkel’s government</a>; <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/17/angela-merkel-extra-time-reach-deal-with-eu-asylum-row" target="_blank" rel="noopener">her coalition partner has supposedly given her till the end of June to toughen Germany’s migration policies</a>. So if her meeting with Erdogan triggers a massive new wave of migrants, the globalists can take things in one of two directions&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>1) they can trigger the immediate fall of Merkel’s government and stage a populist uprising that will sweep through Germany and the rest of Europe</strong>, or</p>
<p><strong>2) they can have Merkel, Macron, and other Establishment EU leaders declare states of emergency “in an attempt to hold on to power and loot the banks.” This would be followed by a “populist revolution” that would force them out of power.</strong></p>
<p>Now let’s look at the timing of all this&#8230;</p>
<p>If the globalists follow the natural course of events as they’ve set them up, we’ll see an imminent Israeli incursion into southern Syria. This would be followed by Erdogan showing up in the EU next week, picking a fight, and then releasing a massive new wave of migrants. Trump would then arrive in Europe in the following week for the (now urgent) NATO Summit and Putin Summit/Assassination. After that, Erdogan will unleash the European intifada, in which we’ll see mass shootings, IEDs that blow high speed trains off their tracks, missiles that shoot airliners out of the sky, etc.</p>
<p>As a “shock and awe” alternative timing, they could set off all these events over the course of the Fourth of July through Friday the 13th timeframe next month.</p>
<p><strong>[Addendum &#8211; 23-24 June 2018] &#8211;</strong> Trump’s Lubavitchers, Kushner and Greenblatt, were in Egypt on Thursday arranging the invasion of Israel from the south and west&#8230;<br />

<p>That being the case, I think it timely to review what we’ve learned about Chabad’s involvement in arranging the coming hot phase of the “Gog-Magog War” and its concluding “Battle of Armageddon.” So I’ve added a new section near the top of the Compendium article (which is further down this page). Here are the new section’s title and introduction&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>How and why the Chabad-Lubavitch cult is steering the Middle East towards war</strong></p>
<p>In <a href="http://redefininggod.com/trump-and-putin-agents-of-chabad-lubavitch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump and Putin: Agents of Chabad-Lubavitch</a>, I showed the intimate connections both Trump and Putin have with the Kabbalist Chabad-Lubavitch &#8220;End Times&#8221; cult. And in this section, I&#8217;ll show you how Chabad is connected to all the other big players in the Middle East <del>peace</del> war process, as well as how Chabad is connected to the Mossad. These connections are significant because the Kabbalists are the ones pushing for an &#8220;End Times&#8221; war in the Middle East. They&#8217;re doing it so they can bring in the Jewish Messiah (the Moshiach), <a href="http://redefininggod.com/trump-and-putin-agents-of-chabad-lubavitch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a role they&#8217;ve cast Vladimir Putin to play</a>.</p></blockquote>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>~ MORE ~</strong></p>
<p>In addition to visiting Jordan and Egypt during their Middle East “peace” tour, <a href="http://news.trust.org/item/20180623235208-zir3w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s Lubavitchers also visited Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Israel</a> &#8212; the three nations that will be involved in the planned false-flag “Houthi” cruise missile attack. <a href="https://www.albawaba.com/news/operation-hodeidah-port-can-end-yemen-war-or-prelude-catastrophe-1148974" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The current battle for the Yemeni Port of Hodeidah is being staged to create a desperate situation for the Houthis</a> which will be pointed-to as <em>“the reason they launched the missile attack on Al-Udeid Airbase, Prince Sultan Airbase, and Tel Aviv.”</em></p>
<p><strong>I&#8217;ve posted what I’ve written about this false-flag in a new addition to the Compendium.</strong></p>
<p>Another thing to note about the Lubavitcher “peace” tour is that Kushner has said the peace plan will be ready “soon.” Expect to hear them either announce the plan or announce a release date for it prior to Trump’s trip to Europe. This will reestablish one of the motives for Trump’s assassination: <em>“Netanyahu wanted to stop Trump’s peace plan and its concessions to the Palestinians.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>~ MORE 2 ~</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/23/trump-putin-meeting-bolton-moscow-pompeo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Guardian is reporting</a> that <em>“Russian media quoted the Kremlin as saying on Tuesday there were no plans for a meeting between Trump and Putin before a Nato summit in Brussels on 11-12 July.”</em> So this means the meeting will likely occur on <strong>Friday the 13th</strong> &#8212; a perfect day for an assassination.</p>
<p><strong>If you recall what happened a few weeks ago, the globalists staged a dramatic confrontation between Trump and the other G7 leaders right before he flew to Singapore for the last planned assassination opportunity at the Trump-Kim summit. And now they’ll stage similar drama at the NATO Summit immediately before he flies to Vienna for the next planned assassination opportunity at the Trump-Putin summit.</strong></p>
<p>Getting back to the Trump-Kim summit, have you noticed that there’s been no real progress on a peace deal since then? That’s because they weren’t planning on the attendees to be alive after the summit. All that came out of the summit process was North Korea froze their warhead and missile tests and the US froze their wargames, thus effectively implementing <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/us-rejects-freeze-for-freeze-proposal-from-china-russia-to-break-north-korea-impasse" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Putin and Xi’s “freeze for freeze&#8221; proposal</a>. So even in their retreats, the globalists make lemonade out of lemons: they added to Putin’s “peacemaker” mythos.</p>
<p><strong>[Addendum &#8211; 24 June 2018] &#8211; </strong><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/24/europe/turkish-election-results-intl/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Erdogan has been declared the winner of the Turkish presidential election</a>, and <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/978893/turkey-elections-latest-update-erdogan-Muharrem-Ince-result" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports of vote rigging</a> are already coming out. If the globalists intend to proceed with what they have planned, you&#8217;ll see LOTS of news about election irregularities and mass protests in Turkey. According to the script, this is what will drive him to Europe to confront the EU leaders and distract the Turkish populace.</p>
<p><strong>[Addendum &#8211; 26 June 2018] &#8211;</strong> So far, so good. Despite the initial article about Turkish police impounding a car filled with election ballots, the globalists have not driven the Turkish people to the streets with reports of election fraud. Now we wait to see if Erdogan shows up at the EU Summit or in Germany under the pretext of &#8220;combating Anti-Muslim migration policies.&#8221; We also wait to see if/when the <a href="https://www.fleetmon.com/vessels/fatih_9503770_2981971/?language=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Turkish drillship Fatih</a> shows up in the Cyprus Exclusive Economic Zone. Erdogan may be scripted to send it in response to the EU Summit’s failure to set migrant policy according to his wishes.</p>
<p><strong>Meanwhile, in Syria</strong>, the script has the US luring the Syrian Army into a trap&#8230;<br />

Of course, the US can “keep their word” on this matter by intervening after a conveniently timed false-flag chemical attack instead. 😉</p>

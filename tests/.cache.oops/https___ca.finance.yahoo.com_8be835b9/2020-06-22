The company was sounding out some investors last week for a similar structure at a yield of 11%, Bloomberg News previously reported.As the most debt-laden of the largest U.S. airlines, American is having to pay up. The yield on the bond is more akin to that of riskier CCC debt currently trading around 11.65%, even though the offering is expected to have at least two ratings in the double B ratings tier, the highest in the junk market.American is also marketing a $500 million four-year loan at a spread of 9.5 percentage points over the London interbank offered rate and at a discounted price between 95 cents to 96 cents on the dollar, said the people, who asked not to be named discussing a private transaction. That comes to an all-in yield around 11%, based on Bloomberg calculations.Representatives for Citigroup Inc., which is leading both financings, and American declined to comment.The debt will be secured by slots, gates and routes across the world in the United States, Latin America, Asia, and Europe, and comes as the carrier diverges from its recent reliance on federal aid as the coronavirus pandemic suppresses travel demand.It’s part of a larger $3.5 billion financing that also includes $750 million of new shares, which are expected to trade on Tuesday, and $750 million of senior convertible notes due in 2025 that are offered with an initial coupon range of 6.0% to 6.5%, according to other people familiar with the matter. The conversion premium is offered at 17.5% to 22.5%.Read more: American Air slumps after announcing $3.5 billion financing planThe company’s shares dropped 6.6% to $14.94 at 2:32 p.m. in New York, the biggest decline on the S&amp;P index of major U.S. airlines.Steep CostAmerican is offering steeper yields than some of its rivals. Delta Air Lines Inc. sold a $3.5 billion secured bond in April at a yield of 7%, and followed that with a $1.25 billion unsecured deal in June that offered a yield of 7.375%.The junk bond may be sold as soon as Wednesday, with commitments for the loan due the same day. Calls with loan and bond investors began earlier on Monday. Proceeds will refinance a $1 billion 364-day term loan the company raised from banks in March, with the remaining used to enhance the company’s liquidity, according to a news release.Other sweeteners have been included. The junk bond, which cannot be repaid for the life of the deal, includes a rare provision that protects investors if the valuation of assets pledged as collateral falls.Investors will closely examine the collateral package on American’s bonds, according to market watchers. United Airlines Holdings Inc. last month scrapped a $2.25 billion bond deal that was secured on a pool of aging jets after investors pushed back on the collateral and the company wasn’t satisfied with the final terms. United is now preparing a new $5 billion debt sale secured against its frequent-flyer program.After the transaction, American will still have about $3 billion to $4 billion of unencumbered assets, excluding those in the AAdvantage miles reward program, according to deal documents. The company is expected to reach a daily cash burn of $40 million in June, down from $100 million in April.American will be joining both Delta and JetBlue Airways Corp by tapping the leveraged loan market to boost liquidity.

As of June 20, Toronto had reported 13,856 cases and 1,039 fatalities since the start of the outbreak. More than 11,800 people have recovered.California Case Climb; LAX to Scan for Fevers (2 p.m. NY)California’s confirmed cases rose 2.4% -- up from the seven-day average of 2.2% -- for a total of 178,054, according to state data. The 4,230 new cases today was the third-biggest daily increase.The most-populous state, which on Sunday reported a record number of new infections, also has seen increased hospitalizations and intensive-care stays. Its rate of positive tests over the last 14 days was 4.8%; Governor Gavin Newsom had said a week ago that the rate had been stabilizing around 4.5%.In Los Angeles, the hardest-hit part of California, Mayor Eric Garcetti said that Los Angeles International Airport will begin using thermal cameras in two locations to spot travelers who may be infected with the virus. The cameras will be located in both arrival and departure areas of the Tom Bradley International Terminal.People showing a temperature of more than 100.4 degrees will be approached by an airport staff member and offered a second screening with a hand-held, touchless thermometer. Those with an elevated temperature will be advised not to travel, Garcetti said. He stressed, however, that the pilot project is voluntary.U.S. Preps for Flu Hitting as Covid Remains (1:40 p.m. NY)U.S. health agencies are preparing for a flu season that will be complicated by the coronavirus pandemic, which they don’t expect to be mitigated by a vaccine anytime soon.Covid activity is expected to “continue for some time” and “could place a tremendous burden” on an already stretched health-care system if coupled with the influenza season that comes each fall, top officials including Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, will tell House lawmakers on Tuesday, according to prepared testimony.The testimony contrasts with recent rhetoric from President Donald Trump, who has pushed to move on from the virus despite almost 120,000 American deaths and large rises in cases in some states as they reopen. According to the testimony, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield and Fauci will tell Congress that the duration of the pandemic is unknown and that a vaccine that can be distributed widely isn’t imminent, despite Trump’s push for one by year-end.Fauci Says He’s No Obstacle to NFL Season (12:54 p.m. NY)Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious disease specialist, said he’s been mistakenly painted as an obstacle to the National Football League’s upcoming season and only gave its officials advice after they requested it.The director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said he was consulted by the NFL as it searches for a way to preserve the safety of players and the public during the pandemic.“I haven’t set any strict conditions or other directions for the football league,” Fauci said in an interview. “They have come to me and asked me from a medical standpoint a bunch of questions about risks. They are a very competent group of people, and they will make up their own minds.”Fauci told CNN last week that the league’s season may not be played if there’s a resurgence in cases, unless players are essentially kept in a “bubble” isolating them from others and tested almost every day. U.S. President Donald Trump said later in a tweet that he told the scientist that he has “nothing to do with football.”Covid-19 Accelerates in Latin America, WHO Says (12:45 p.m. NY)The number of new cases reached a record 183,000 in the most recent World Health Organization daily report as the disease spreads in several big countries simultaneously, WHO officials said at a press briefing in Geneva.Latin America is particularly afflicted. The number of reported cases has increased 25% in Brazil over the past week, while Chile is up 41% and Argentina 38%, according to Mike Ryan, head of the WHO’s health emergencies program.Separately, there’s been a limited number of transmissions of the disease from humans to minks at farms in the Netherlands and Denmark, and back again to people, according to Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO’s lead technical officer on Covid-19. Still, the predominant way the disease spreads is through human-to-human transmission, she said.Illinois Expands Reopening (12:30 p.m. NY)All four regions of Illinois are on track to enter Phase 4 on June 26. It’s the second to last step of the state’s reopening plan. About 400,000 Illinois residents are expected to go back to work as sectors such as health and fitness, movies and theater, museums and zoos, as well as indoor dining at restaurants are allowed to resume, Governor J.B. Pritzker’s office said in a statement.Gatherings can expand up as many as 50 people, and indoor dining can resume with groups of 10 or less, tables 6-feet (1.8 meters) apart and standing areas at no more than 25% of capacity. Chicago and state officials said that public health metrics such as new Covid-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths are moving down, allowing the city to enter Phase 4 after it was delayed in the third stage.“We’ve continued to see really good progress,” Allison Arwady, commissioner of the Chicago Department of Public Health, said during a call with reporters. Capacity limits may be expanded or eased during Phase 4 if the numbers continue to decline but the city is taking incremental steps to avoid spikes that other places that re-opened have seen, she added.Portugal Steps Up Measure in Lisbon Suburbs (11:54 a.m. NY)The Portuguese government plans to tighten restrictions in some municipalities around Lisbon as it tries to contain new clusters of the outbreak in the city’s outskirts. Gatherings will now be limited to 10 people, down from 20 previously, Prime Minister Antonio Costa said on Monday.Portugal reported 259 new coronavirus cases on Monday, and now has 12,310 active cases, Secretary of State for Health Antonio Lacerda Sales said at a press conference in Lisbon. Daily new cases have ranged between 192 and 421 in June, and the additional infections have mostly been recorded in the greater Lisbon region, where authorities have increased testing.Murphy Expects Some ‘Spiking’ in N.J. (11:10 a.m. NY)Governor Phil Murphy of New Jersey, the second hardest-hit U.S. state, told CNN that if his state had a surge like Florida’s, he would do a turnaround on his gradual and restricted return of retail, dining and other services.“You’d have to put some sort of break on the reopening,” Murphy said. “You’d have no choice.” He said New Jersey is certain to see “some amount of spiking” as indoor activity increases, but he’s counting on testing and contact tracing to prevent mass flare-ups.New Jersey starting Monday allowed barber shops and salons to reopen, by appointment only and with masks and other precautions in place. Indoor shopping malls can open on June 29, but Murphy hasn’t set an opening date for movie theaters, indoor dining and gyms.S.C. Protesters Urged to Get Tested (11:03 a.m. NY)A leader of an anti-police brutality group in South Carolina is urging demonstrators to get tested after several people involved with the protests recently tested positive, The State newspaper from Columbia reports.Lawrence Nathaniel, one of the leaders of the I Can’t Breathe South Carolina movement, posted a note on his Facebook page saying several protesters in Columbia marches from late May to mid-June tested positive.

The metal also has found support from increasing monetary stimulus, including the Bank of England adding to its bond buying program last week and the Federal Reserve signaling rates will remain low. Increased amounts of monetary stimulus tend to boost zero-yield gold as a hedge against declining interest rates.“Gold appears poised for breakout,” Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at ThinkMarkets in London, said in an emailed note. “While gold is undoubtedly boosted by haven flows due to the economic damage caused by the pandemic as well as concerns over a second wave, there is little doubt that the metal is also finding good support from central bank money flooding the financial markets.”Gold futures for August delivery rose 0.8% to settle at $1,766.40 an ounce at 1:30 p.m. on the Comex in New York. That’s the highest close since April 14, when the metal reached a level last seen on Oct. 11, 2012.Gold futures are up 16% this year. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is forecasting a record $2,000 an ounce over the next 12 months, while JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. said investors should stick with gold as it is most leveraged to a low real-yield environment. Citigroup said in a note Monday that bids from ETF and over-the-counter investors could help push average prices in the second half beyond $1,715 an ounce, and reiterated gold could breach $2,000 by the middle of 2021.“Covid-19 worries together with the eventual inflationary impact of central bank stimulus are providing the support for gold,” said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank A/S. While recent gains have once again attracted some profit-taking, buyers are also returning, he said.Net bullish bets in U.S. futures and options rose for the first time in four weeks, recovering from a one-year low, Commodity Futures Trading Commission data showed on Friday.Investors also continue to pile into gold-backed exchange-traded funds, which boosted their holdings by almost 30 tons on Friday, according to initial data compiled by Bloomberg. Of that inflow, about 23 tons went into SPDR Gold Shares, the most in a year in tonnage terms.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.</p></div></div></div></li><li class="js-stream-content" data-reactid="167"><div class="Py(14px) Pos(r)" data-test-locator="mega" data-reactid="168"><div class="Cf" data-reactid="169"><div class="Fl(start) Pos(r) Mt(2px) W(30%) Maw(255px)" data-reactid="170"><div class="H(0) Ov(h) Bdrs(2px)" style="padding-bottom:56%;" data-reactid="171"><img srcset="https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/zTK79AcBP9qtbNoKn4eVTw--~B/Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMjM7cT04MDt3PTIyMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-ca/the_canadian_press_business_130/af0a1a0764dcb1b5f4f9c4ff044fecc4.cf.jpg 1x,https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ALgAc5AIRVy1tiydplU4qA--~B/Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0yNDY7cT04MDt3PTQ0MDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-ca/the_canadian_press_business_130/af0a1a0764dcb1b5f4f9c4ff044fecc4.cf.jpg 2x" class=" W(100%) Trsdu(0s)!

Jay Inslee is struggling to help the county at the heart of the state&#x27;s agricultural belt that he once called home.The coronavirus pandemic is hitting Yakima County hard, with cases surging far faster in this region about 140 miles (225 kilometres) southeast of Seattle than the rest of the state. The virus has caused turmoil in the farm and food processing industry, where some fearful workers staged wildcat strikes recently to demand employers provide safer working conditions.Hospitals in the county are filled to capacity and have started sending patients to neighbouring counties, officials said.Efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19 among the county&#x27;s 250,000 residents have so far failed, and Yakima County is one of only three in Washington that has remained in Phase One lockdown while most of the state is starting to reopen.Inslee said a big reason is that many people in Yakima County are declining to wear masks.Visits to fast-food restaurants and other essential businesses found lots of employees and customers not wearing masks. In Selah, youth league baseball games were being played with spectators — few wearing masks — in the stands.Inslee on Saturday announced he was preparing a proclamation to require Yakima County residents to wear masks when outside their homes. Stores and other businesses will be banned from selling to customers without masks, he said.“That essentially means: ‘’No mask, no service, and no mask, no goods,&#x27;&#x27; Inslee said.As of Sunday, Yakima County had at least 6,283 cases of coronavirus, second-highest among counties in the state, and 138 deaths. King County, which includes Seattle and has nearly 10 times more people, had recorded at least 9,211 cases and 600 deaths.Inslee noted the infection rate in Yakima County was 28 times higher than the rate in King County. He predicted it would jump dramatically this summer if people don&#x27;t take steps to limit exposure.“It is terrifying,&#x27;&#x27; Inslee said of the region, home to tens of thousands of workers on farms and in food processing plants who make up the bulk of the economy.Just over 50% of the county&#x27;s virus cases involve Hispanic residents, who make up the bulk of the agricultural workforce. In addition, 26% per cent of virus tests in the county come back positive, compared to a state average of about 6%.Rivera, 36, works in a fruit warehouse. A native of Mexico who has lived 20 years in the United States, she was a leader of a two-week wildcat strike at the warehouse when management refused to provide workers with masks, hand sanitizer and other safety equipment.“We were scared. &#x27;&#x27; she said, stressing that people were working shoulder-to-shoulder.The valley&#x27;s bounty of apples, cherries, pears and other crops are sorted, cleaned and packaged at the warehouse.The workers who went on strikes at several plants mostly earn the minimum wage of $13.50 an hour. They were heartened by support from the medical community, as doctors and nurses came by to drop off masks and other supplies.The wildcat strikes, which involved half a dozen fruit warehouses, have all been settled, but fears remain.Rosalinda Gonzalez, 41, is a native of Mexico who has lived in the United States since 1995. Married with three children, she also went on strike for protective equipment and a safer work environment.“We are always afraid,&#x27;&#x27; Gonzalez said, adding that many workers at her warehouse have tested positive for the virus.Some farmers have taken extraordinary steps, some prescribed by the governor&#x27;s office, to protect their work force.Gilbert is the owner of Gilbert Orchards,where he grows 4,000 acres of apples, cherries, wine grapes and other crops in the shadow of the Cascade Range.He provided face marks for his workforce, spending $22,000 in April to buy 16,000 masks from China. His employees practice social distancing and migrant workers are housed in dormitories that no longer include bunk beds, as required by the governor&#x27;s proclamations. Vans now carry seven people at a time to distant fields instead of 15.But that doesn&#x27;t mean he will stay in business.Costs for farmers are rising dramatically, even as the markets for produce are dropping because of trade restrictions overseas and people&#x27;s inability to pay for the products in the United States because of job losses, Gilbert said.He recently took 300 acres of apples out of production.“At our cost structure, it didn&#x27;t make sense to keep growing,&#x27;&#x27; he said.Inslee said the county also has lots of cases in nursing homes, and a large percentage of the region&#x27;s employees are rated as essential and thus continued to go to work.“”This is the place where our food comes from,&#x27;&#x27; Inslee noted.As a result, local politicians pushed him hard to start allowing the reopening of businesses in Yakima County.Rivera said safeguarding health should be the most important consideration.“It’s super necessary to protect our families.? she said.Nicholas K.

Massachusetts Institute of Technology was among the earliest recipients of the act, which served as the basis for many other institutions, including the University of California and Washington State University.These schools “and their counterparts in every state created a new type of university with a new practical focus on problem solving that the world had never seen,” Romer, co-recipient of the 2018 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, said in a telephone interview. “The success of California and Massachusetts is a sign of the high level of investment that those states have made in their university and research systems.”California ranked No. 1 in the Bloomberg index for patent activity and second for both technology-company density and concentration of science- and engineering-degree holders. Its state university system and pre-eminence in research -- along with private Stanford University -- have been influential in building Silicon Valley, headquarters for established tech companies including Alphabet’s Google and Apple and also the breeding ground for budding startups.”Entrepreneurism and innovation are core to our economy, and our workforce and will be the foundation of our recovery,” said Chris Dombrowski, acting director of the Governor’s Office of Business and Economic Development.Last year, California entrepreneurs received more than $67 billion in venture-capital funding, according to data from PitchBook. That’s more than three times New York, the second-highest state for deal flow.According to a joint report from PwC and CB Insights, the top five highest-valued private U.S. tech companies are all California-based: JUUL Labs, Stripe, Airbnb, Space X and Palantir Technologies.Among U.S. companies that went public last year, the five reaping the highest year-to-date returns also are in California: Zoom Video Communications, IT-service provider Fastly and life-science specialty businesses Vir Biotechnology, Livongo Health and IDEAYA Biosciences.Second place Massachusetts took the crown for tech-company density. General Electric, Raytheon, Thermo Fisher Scientific and Biogen are headquartered in the Northeastern state. Prior to the pandemic, Boston-based Toast -- a restaurant-management platform -- was a venture-capital favorite. The startup raised $400 million at a $4.9 billion valuation in February.Covid-19 InnovationRounding out the top five are No. 3 Washington, No. 4 Connecticut and Oregon, which jumped two spots to No. 5. Colorado is the only state in the top 10 that isn’t on the West or East coasts.This is the third straight year that California, Massachusetts and Washington have lead the index. Romer noted the important work being done in all three to deal with the Covid-19 virus that has shocked the U.S. economy by causing businesses to close, putting millions of Americans out of work.For example, Massachusetts-based Moderna Therapeutics developed a new vaccine, currently in human clinical trials, in just 63 days. BARDA -- the U.S. Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority -- awarded Moderna $483 million to begin producing it if it’s approved by the Food and Drug Administration.Economic research shows that technological innovation is accelerated during recessions, so states that already have a strong foundation of R&amp;D and tech investment may be best suited to adapt to a post-Covid-19 world.Alabama was the biggest mover, rising five spots to No. 41. Its research and development spending has increased by 68 basis points, and Huntsville, near the Tennessee border, recently appeared in other rankings as having a high percentage of STEM workers and people with science and engineering degrees. Known as Rocket City, Huntsville is home to the Redstone Arsenal, which houses NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center and the U.S. Missile Defense Agency.The bottom five states are Kentucky, Louisiana, Arkansas, West Virginia and Mississippi.To access the data behind this index, click here.(Adding quote from California governor’s office in eighth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.</p></div></div></div></li><li class="js-stream-content" data-reactid="193"><div class="Py(14px) Pos(r)" data-test-locator="mega" data-reactid="194"><div class="Cf" data-reactid="195"><div class="Fl(start) Pos(r) Mt(2px) W(30%) Maw(255px)" data-reactid="196"><div class="H(0) Ov(h) Bdrs(2px)" style="padding-bottom:56%;" data-reactid="197"><img srcset="https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/G.8icMo2Oza1_TPxsRkctw--~B/Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMjM7cT04MDt3PTIyMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/16cc7d59c5baad3dbb60b32321c0232d.cf.jpg 1x,https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Y31Bb8763Sf_ofHc8YyzMg--~B/Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0yNDY7cT04MDt3PTQ0MDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/16cc7d59c5baad3dbb60b32321c0232d.cf.jpg 2x" class=" W(100%) Trsdu(0s)!

The Nasdaq Composite headed for its seventh straight advance in the longest rally of the year. The S&amp;P 500 turned higer in afternoon trading, though lagged behind as an increase in coronavirus cases led to some renewed temporary shutdowns in the U.S. The index rallied almost 2% last week.“There’s absolutely a big tug-of-war going on right now,” JJ Kinahan, the chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade, said by phone. “Everyone is trying to figure out who is going to be the winners and losers when things get quote-unquote back to normal. That to me shows that everybody is trying to figure out which way to go.”Gold neared a seven-year high, while the dollar weakened. European stocks slumped, with Wirecard AG in free-fall after more than $2 billion in assets went missing. The yield on Germany’s 30-year government debt fell below zero for the first time since May. Crude oil hovered below $40 a barrel in New York.There are increasing signs that the virus is continuing to rapidly spread as governments work to reopen their economies. Cases of the deadly virus rose by a record for a single day on June 21, according to the World Health Organization, with flare ups across the U.S. and new scares in Germany and Australia.But investors are wagering that policymakers will be unwilling to stop business activity or slow progress toward a economic recovery. In the U.K., Prime Minister Boris Johnson is preparing to relax social distancing rules in a major boost to the hospitality industry.At the same time, risk appetite is being supported by historic stimulus programs by central banks around the world. Equity markets have steadied in recent weeks and the S&amp;P 500 is within 10% of its pre-pandemic peak.“The market doesn’t believe that we will see such draconian lockdowns even if there is a resurgence of the virus. The politics have moved on,” said James Athey, a money manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments. “Rightly or wrongly, there’s also a pretty widespread feeling that riskier assets won’t go down too far because the Federal Reserve won’t let them.”In Turkey, the benchmark equities index erased its 2020 losses, lifted in a rally driven mostly by a wave of buying from local investors.Here are some key events coming up:MSCI Inc. on Tuesday announces its market classification review for 2020.The IMF will release new 2020 growth projections on Wednesday.U.S. jobless claims, durable goods and GDP data are due Thursday.A rebalance of Russell indexes is due on Friday.These are the main moves in markets:For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.</p></div></div></div></li><li class="js-stream-content" data-reactid="206"><div class="Py(14px) Pos(r)" data-test-locator="mega" data-reactid="207"><div class="Cf" data-reactid="208"><div class="Fl(start) Pos(r) Mt(2px) W(30%) Maw(255px)" data-reactid="209"><div class="H(0) Ov(h) Bdrs(2px)" style="padding-bottom:56%;" data-reactid="210"><img srcset="https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/8y4NGwk2GIHmO4iADUdl_Q--~B/Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMjM7cT04MDt3PTIyMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-06/6dcfda00-b4b5-11ea-bedf-26003430d569.cf.jpg 1x,https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/kjvOuDCI44uIrSRtYNxpBQ--~B/Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0yNDY7cT04MDt3PTQ0MDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-06/6dcfda00-b4b5-11ea-bedf-26003430d569.cf.jpg 2x" class=" W(100%) Trsdu(0s)!

PETERSBURG, Fla. — Coronavirus cases in Florida surpassed 100,000 on Monday, part of an alarming surge across the South and West as states reopen for business and many Americans resist wearing masks or keeping their distance from others.The disturbing signs in the Sunshine State as well as places like Arizona, Alabama, Louisiana, Texas and South Carolina — along with countries such as Brazil, India and Pakistan — are raising fears that the progress won after months of lockdowns is slipping away.“It is snowballing. We will most certainly see more people die as a result of this spike,” said Dr. Marc Boom, CEO and president of Houston Methodist Hospital, noting that the number of COVID-19 hospital admissions has tripled since Memorial Day to more then 1,400 across eight hospital systems in the Houston metropolitan area.He predicted that in three weeks hospitals could be overwhelmed, and he pleaded with people to cover their faces and practice social distancing.“It is possible to open up at a judicious pace and coexist with the virus, but it requires millions and millions of people to do the right thing. Right now, we don’t have that” because people have let their guard down, Boom said.The number of newly confirmed coronavirus cases across the country per day has reached more than 26,000, up from about 21,000 two weeks ago, according to an Associated Press analysis of data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The analysis looked at a seven-day rolling average through Sunday.Over 120,000 deaths in the U.S. have been blamed on the virus.Over the weekend, the virus seemed to be everywhere at once: Six staff members helping set up for President Donald Trump&#x27;s rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, tested positive, as did 23 Clemson University football players in South Carolina. At least 30 members of the Louisiana State University football team were isolated after becoming infected or coming into contact with someone who was. Meatpacking plants were also hit with outbreaks.In Orlando, 152 coronavirus cases were linked to one bar near the University of Central Florida campus, said Dr. Raul Pino, a state health officer in the resort city.“A lot of transmission happened there,” Pino said. “People are very close. People are not wearing masks. People are drinking, shouting, dancing, sweating, kissing and hugging, all the things that happen in bars. And all those things that happen are not good for COVID-19.”Although he asked health officials to renew calls for people to wear masks and keep their distance, Gov. Ron DeSantis has not signalled he will retreat from reopening the state after three months of shutdowns that have damaged the economy.Dr. Michael Ryan, the World Health Organization&#x27;s emergencies chief, said that the outbreak is “definitely accelerating” in the U.S. and a number of other countries, dismissing the notion that the record daily levels of new COVID-19 cases simply reflect more testing. He noted that numerous countries have noted marked increases in hospital admissions and deaths.“The epidemic is now peaking or moving towards a peak in a number of large countries,&quot; he warned.Arizona, in particular, is seeing disturbing trends in several benchmarks, including the percentage of tests that prove positive for the virus. Arizona&#x27;s is the highest in the nation.The state&#x27;s positive test rate is at a seven-day average of 20.4%, well above the national average of 8.4% and the 10% level that public health officials say is a problem. When the positive test rate rises, it means that an outbreak is worsening — not just that more people are getting tested.At Maryland&#x27;s Fort Washington Medical Center on the outskirts of the nation’s capital, workers described a scramble to find new beds, heartbreaking interactions with family members of critically ill patients and their frustration with Americans who do not believe the coronavirus threat is real.“Everybody is out lounging on the beaches. Just thinking that it’s over. And it’s not,” respiratory therapist Kevin Cole said. &quot;It’s far from being over. And unfortunately, it’s those people that keep we’ll keep this pandemic going.”Meanwhile, New York City, once the most lethal hot spot in the U.S., lifted more of its restrictions Monday, moving a big step closer to normal.Eve Gonzalez, a 27-year-old food industry worker in New York whose job had not yet resumed, said it was too soon: “I’m dying to go out, but people’s health is more important.&quot;Nine million people have been confirmed infected by the virus worldwide and about 470,000 have died, according to Johns Hopkins, though experts say the actual numbers are much higher because of limited testing and cases in which patients had no symptoms.Amid the global surge, the head of WHO warned that world leaders must not politicize the outbreak but unite to fight it.Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who has faced criticism from President Donald Trump, said during a videoconference for the Dubai-based World Government Summit that it took over three months for the world to see 1 million confirmed infections, but just eight days to see the most recent 1 million cases.Tedros did not mention Trump by name or his determination to pull the United States out of the U.N. health agency but warned against “politicizing” the pandemic.“The greatest threat we face now is not the virus itself, it’s the lack of global solidarity and global leadership,” he said. “We cannot defeat this pandemic with a divided world.”Trump has criticized the WHO for its early response to the outbreak and what he considers its excessive praise of China, where the outbreak began, though his own administration’s response in the U.S. has come under attack. Trump has threatened to end all U.S. funding for the WHO.Companies around the world are racing to find a vaccine, and there is fierce debate over how to make sure it is distributed fairly. WHO&#x27;s special envoy on COVID-19, Dr. David Nabarro, said he believes it will be “2 1/2 years until there will be vaccine for everybody in the world.”India&#x27;s health care system has been slammed by the virus. The country&#x27;s caseload climbed by nearly 15,000 Monday to over 425,000, with more than 13,000 deaths.After easing a nationwide lockdown, the Indian government in recent weeks ran special trains to return thousands of migrant workers to their home villages.In Pakistan, infections are accelerating and hospitals are having to turn away patients, with new cases up to 6,800 a day.

The damage pushed the Federal Reserve to flood the markets with trillions of dollars in stimulus, which, combined with the easing of lockdown restrictions and hopes for a fast economic recovery, have helped the S&amp;P 500 index rally almost 40% since its March low.Blackstone has been “aggressively” looking to put some of its $150 billion in dry powder to use, Schwarzman said in April. He also said that while all companies, including Blackstone, will be affected by the pandemic, the pain will be temporary, citing the U.S. government’s stimulus efforts. The New York-based firm saw asset values across most of its business segments plunge in the first quarter because of the economic fallout from the virus, but its long-term focus should put it in a position to hang on to companies as they regain strength.China’s OutlookChina will continue to grow at double or triple the rate of developed countries, Schwarzman said at Monday’s event. It could internalize its markets and depend less on exports, he said.Schwarzman has strong ties to China.

As of June 20, Toronto had reported 13,856 cases and 1,039 fatalities since the start of the outbreak. More than 11,800 people have recovered.The Peel region, which is west of Toronto, will also be allowed to move into “stage two” of the province’s reopening plan. However, the Windsor-Essex area will have to wait until outbreaks among temporary foreign workers on farms in the area are brought under control, Ford said.“No one wants to see every region of Ontario opened more than I do, but we have to do it right, and unfortunately right now the threat of this virus in Windsor-Essex is still too great,” he said.Part of the delay can be blamed on the agriculture sector, he said.“Farmers just aren’t cooperating,” he said. “They aren’t sending the people out to be tested.”On Monday, New York City entered phase two of its reopening plans with similar types of businesses allowed to unlock their doors. Still, things won’t quite be back to normal as shoppers should be prepared to wear face masks and physically distance from others. Manhattan restaurants are allowed to offer only outdoor seating.Toronto’s downtown core has been quiet since shutdowns to contain the virus were implemented in early March. The city has remained under partial lockdown as most of the rest of the province moved into Stage Two earlier this month.Read more: Toronto’s Underground City Faces Bleak Future With Bankers MIAIt’s not clear how much Toronto’s financial district will be affected by today’s news.

In the U.S., sales surged more than 70% in the 15 weeks ended June 13. In the U.K., consumption of canned corned beef has taken off. Even in South Korea, where Spam is an old favorite, sales are expanding at the fastest pace in years.At first, people were loading up on pantry staples with a long shelf life during lockdown conditions. Then, shortages of some fresh meat supplies, especially in the U.S., also helped to drive sales. Now, the economic downturn is underpinning demand.There’s the obvious factor of income here. With millions thrown out of work in the last few months, consumers are looking for a way to cut back on grocery bills, and they’re trading in fresh meat for canned varieties. But there’s also something deeper going on -- a return to comfort food and nostalgia in troubled times.Ray Herras, a graduate student at Columbia University, is a Filipino American. Spam gained popularity in the cuisines of Southeast Asia after occupying U.S. forces brought the canned ham with them. For Herras, Spam is a taste of childhood.“I grew up eating Spam. It is deeply ingrained in Filipino culture, but I wasn’t really eating Spam until quarantine,” said Herras, who started adding it to his grocery purchases at least every other week. He’s not sure how much longer he’ll keep the buying up, but it’s always a staple whenever he’s “feeling homesick,” he said.Canned meat has been available for more than 80 years. It’s sometimes frowned upon by filet-mignon loving elites, but it’s also got a cult following. Spam musubi -- think of it like a porky twist on sushi -- is a popular snack in Hawaii. In Korea, it’s eaten with kimchi and steamed rice. In the U.S., a slice of fried Spam with eggs can be a breakfast treat. And in the U.K., tinned corned beef is served up as hash with potatoes and fried onions.But while the die-hard fans are always there, the recent boom in sales is something even the canned meat makers didn’t see coming.“Even I thought it could be difficult to increase our sales of canned meat to more than what we expected,” said Kasper Lenbroch, chief executive officer of the unit that houses the Tulip brand at Danish Crown Group, Europe’s top meat processor. “It’s not very often when you’re in food that you can see traditional products like these grow as much as they have done right now.”Sales of Tulip Pork Luncheon Meat, sold in 120 markets around the world, are expected to go up 25% this year, Lenbroch said. Sales are “growing all over,” including in the U.K., Germany, Greece, Japan and Singapore, among many others.Marfrig Global Foods SA, the Brazilian beef giant, is seeing a similar jump at its Uruguay business, which supplies corned beef to the U.S. Sales of the product are expected to reach as high as 3,500 metric tons this year, said Marcelo Secco, CEO of the unit. That would be up almost double compared with 2019, when about 1,800 tons were sold, he said.Secco points to the recent jump in U.S. meat prices as turning consumers on to canned alternatives. Some of America’s biggest livestock slaughter plants were forced to close earlier this year after coronavirus outbreaks saw thousands of workers falling ill. That caused wholesale beef prices to double in about a month. While the market has come back down, corned beef was there to help fill supply gaps -- and now that consumers have returned to the old staple, they may be more inclined to stick with it.“There isn’t a supermarket in the U.S. that doesn’t have corned beef,” Secco said. “It’s a product that everyone knows.”While U.S. sales of canned meat have slowed since an initial surge when lockdowns started in mid-March, they are still well above 2019 levels. In the week ended June 13, sales were up 17%, according to Nielsen data.Hormel Food Corp.’s Spam was already seeing sales growth in the past several years, but nothing like the increase taking place now.“The last time Spam saw a similar pattern in interest was back to when the brand started during the Great Depression. The economic situation wasn’t great -- that was carried into World War II,” said Brian Lillis, Hormel’s senior brand manager for Spam. “What we saw over the last few months is really people all over the country purchasing the product.”Hormel shares are up about 8% this year, while the S&P 500 Index is down 4%.Spam has a storied history in South Korea, the No. 2 consumer after the U.S. It’s a popular holiday gift sold in lavish packages, which make up about 60% of annual sales, according to CJ CheilJedang Corp., the Korean producer of the tinned ham.When coronavirus cases started spreading in the country in February and March, consumers stayed home and cooked more -- but many people still had leftover Spam from holiday packages. It wasn’t until April that sales really started taking off.In the two months of April and May, CJ saw Spam sales soar more than 50% from a year earlier.“The outbreak of coronavirus has revived the domestic canned food industry, which was on the verge of entering a period of stagnation,” said Lee Seung Hoon, a spokesman at CJ. “Now we are expecting growth in the market.”(Updates with Hormel

-- American Airlines Group Inc. is tapping all corners of the capital markets to raise at least $3.5 billion of cash in the latest test of investor willingness to finance travel companies still under strain from the coronavirus pandemic.The company is marketing a $1.5 billion secured junk bond maturing in 2025 with early pricing discussions for a yield of about 12%, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The company was sounding out some investors last week for a similar structure at a yield of 11%, Bloomberg News previously reported.As the most debt-laden of the largest U.S. airlines, American is having to pay up. The yield on the bond is more akin to that of riskier CCC debt currently trading around 11.65%, even though the offering is expected to have at least two ratings in the double B ratings tier, the highest in the junk market.American is also marketing a $500 million four-year loan at a spread of 9.5 percentage points over the London interbank offered rate and at a discounted price between 95 cents to 96 cents on the dollar, said the people, who asked not to be named discussing a private transaction. That comes to an all-in yield around 11%, based on Bloomberg calculations.Representatives for Citigroup Inc., which is leading both financings, and American declined to comment.The debt will be secured by slots, gates and routes across the world in the United States, Latin America, Asia, and Europe, and comes as the carrier diverges from its recent reliance on federal aid as the coronavirus pandemic suppresses travel demand.It’s part of a larger $3.5 billion financing that also includes $750 million of new shares, which are expected to trade on Tuesday, and $750 million of senior convertible notes due in 2025 that are offered with an initial coupon range of 6.0% to 6.5%, according to other people familiar with the matter. The conversion premium is offered at 17.5% to 22.5%.Read more: American Air slumps after announcing $3.5 billion financing planThe company’s shares dropped 6.6% to $14.94 at 2:32 p.m. in New York, the biggest decline on the S&P index of major U.S. airlines.Steep CostAmerican is offering steeper yields than some of its rivals. Delta Air Lines Inc. sold a $3.5 billion secured bond in April at a yield of 7%, and followed that with a $1.25 billion unsecured deal in June that offered a yield of 7.375%.The junk bond may be sold as soon as Wednesday, with commitments for the loan due the same day. Calls with loan and bond investors began earlier on Monday. Proceeds will refinance a $1 billion 364-day term loan the company raised from banks in March, with the remaining used to enhance the company’s liquidity, according to a news release.Other sweeteners have been included. The junk bond, which cannot be repaid for the life of the deal, includes a rare provision that protects investors if the valuation of assets pledged as collateral falls.Investors will closely examine the collateral package on American’s bonds, according to market watchers. United Airlines Holdings Inc. last month scrapped a $2.25 billion bond deal that was secured on a pool of aging jets after investors pushed back on the collateral and the company wasn’t satisfied with the final terms. United is now preparing a new $5 billion debt sale secured against its frequent-flyer program.After the transaction, American will still have about $3 billion to $4 billion of unencumbered assets, excluding those in the AAdvantage miles reward program, according to deal documents. The company is expected to reach a daily cash burn of $40 million in June, down from $100 million in April.American will be joining both Delta and JetBlue Airways Corp by tapping the leveraged loan market to boost liquidity. Delta raised a $1.5 billion loan in April at 4.75 percentage points more than Libor with a discounted price of 97 cents on the dollar. JetBlue raised $750 million from a loan earlier this month at 5.25 percentage points over Libor and also with a 97 cent discounted price.Southwest Airlines Co, which is rated investment grade, also recently raised about $4 billion of bonds total in deals in April and June.(Updates with loan pricing all-in yield in fourth paragraph and trading levels in the eighth.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","pubtime":1592851579000,"is_eligible":true,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fca.finance.yahoo.com\u002Fnews\u002Famerican-air-kicks-off-2-132239115.html","property":"Business","categoryLabel":"Business","title":"American Air Dangles 12% Bond Yield in $3.5 Billion Cash Hunt","images":{"original":{"height":1333,"width":2000,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002FXrxDpo7awB7kcv0zB7gLYQ--~B\u002FaD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen\u002Fbloomberg_markets_842\u002F74cec72a0f38983d631f6dc43345ff79.cf.jpg"},"img:220x123":{"height":123,"width":220,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002FFyWq2JbWVNi0Nvyq.jECBw--~B\u002FZmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMjM7cT04MDt3PTIyMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen\u002Fbloomberg_markets_842\u002F74cec72a0f38983d631f6dc43345ff79.cf.jpg"},"img:440x246":{"height":246,"width":440,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002FK_1cBF9CqmxoNDL.60eEhg--~B\u002FZmk9c3RyaW07aD0yNDY7cT04MDt3PTQ0MDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen\u002Fbloomberg_markets_842\u002F74cec72a0f38983d631f6dc43345ff79.cf.jpg"}},"type":"article","link":"\u002Fnews\u002Famerican-air-kicks-off-2-132239115.html","id":"90b6e0b5-4c0b-3501-a350-c18207de1ccd","publisher":"Bloomberg","publisher_id":"bloomberg_markets_842","off_network":false},{"i13n":{"bpos":1,"cpos":3,"cposy":6},"summary":"(Bloomberg) -- The number of new cases around the globe reached a record, fueled by a surge in Latin America, the World Health Organization said.

As of June 20, Toronto had reported 13,856 cases and 1,039 fatalities since the start of the outbreak. More than 11,800 people have recovered.California Case Climb; LAX to Scan for Fevers (2 p.m. NY)California’s confirmed cases rose 2.4% -- up from the seven-day average of 2.2% -- for a total of 178,054, according to state data. The 4,230 new cases today was the third-biggest daily increase.The most-populous state, which on Sunday reported a record number of new infections, also has seen increased hospitalizations and intensive-care stays. Its rate of positive tests over the last 14 days was 4.8%; Governor Gavin Newsom had said a week ago that the rate had been stabilizing around 4.5%.In Los Angeles, the hardest-hit part of California, Mayor Eric Garcetti said that Los Angeles International Airport will begin using thermal cameras in two locations to spot travelers who may be infected with the virus.

Those with an elevated temperature will be advised not to travel, Garcetti said. He stressed, however, that the pilot project is voluntary.U.S. Preps for Flu Hitting as Covid Remains (1:40 p.m. NY)U.S. health agencies are preparing for a flu season that will be complicated by the coronavirus pandemic, which they don’t expect to be mitigated by a vaccine anytime soon.Covid activity is expected to “continue for some time” and “could place a tremendous burden” on an already stretched health-care system if coupled with the influenza season that comes each fall, top officials including Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, will tell House lawmakers on Tuesday, according to prepared testimony.The testimony contrasts with recent rhetoric from President Donald Trump, who has pushed to move on from the virus despite almost 120,000 American deaths and large rises in cases in some states as they reopen. According to the testimony, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield and Fauci will tell Congress that the duration of the pandemic is unknown and that a vaccine that can be distributed widely isn’t imminent, despite Trump’s push for one by year-end.Fauci Says He’s No Obstacle to NFL Season (12:54 p.m. NY)Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious disease specialist, said he’s been mistakenly painted as an obstacle to the National Football League’s upcoming season and only gave its officials advice after they requested it.The director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said he was consulted by the NFL as it searches for a way to preserve the safety of players and the public during the pandemic.“I haven’t set any strict conditions or other directions for the football league,” Fauci said in an interview. “They have come to me and asked me from a medical standpoint a bunch of questions about risks. They are a very competent group of people, and they will make up their own minds.”Fauci told CNN last week that the league’s season may not be played if there’s a resurgence in cases, unless players are essentially kept in a “bubble” isolating them from others and tested almost every day. U.S. President Donald Trump said later in a tweet that he told the scientist that he has “nothing to do with football.”Covid-19 Accelerates in Latin America, WHO Says (12:45 p.m. NY)The number of new cases reached a record 183,000 in the most recent World Health Organization daily report as the disease spreads in several big countries simultaneously, WHO officials said at a press briefing in Geneva.Latin America is particularly afflicted. The number of reported cases has increased 25% in Brazil over the past week, while Chile is up 41% and Argentina 38%, according to Mike Ryan, head of the WHO’s health emergencies program.Separately, there’s been a limited number of transmissions of the disease from humans to minks at farms in the Netherlands and Denmark, and back again to people, according to Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO’s lead technical officer on Covid-19. Still, the predominant way the disease spreads is through human-to-human transmission, she said.Illinois Expands Reopening (12:30 p.m. NY)All four regions of Illinois are on track to enter Phase 4 on June 26. It’s the second to last step of the state’s reopening plan. About 400,000 Illinois residents are expected to go back to work as sectors such as health and fitness, movies and theater, museums and zoos, as well as indoor dining at restaurants are allowed to resume, Governor J.B. Pritzker’s office said in a statement.Gatherings can expand up as many as 50 people, and indoor dining can resume with groups of 10 or less, tables 6-feet (1.8 meters) apart and standing areas at no more than 25% of capacity. Chicago and state officials said that public health metrics such as new Covid-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths are moving down, allowing the city to enter Phase 4 after it was delayed in the third stage.“We’ve continued to see really good progress,” Allison Arwady, commissioner of the Chicago Department of Public Health, said during a call with reporters. Capacity limits may be expanded or eased during Phase 4 if the numbers continue to decline but the city is taking incremental steps to avoid spikes that other places that re-opened have seen, she added.Portugal Steps Up Measure in Lisbon Suburbs (11:54 a.m. NY)The Portuguese government plans to tighten restrictions in some municipalities around Lisbon as it tries to contain new clusters of the outbreak in the city’s outskirts.

(11:10 a.m. NY)Governor Phil Murphy of New Jersey, the second hardest-hit U.S. state, told CNN that if his state had a surge like Florida’s, he would do a turnaround on his gradual and restricted return of retail, dining and other services.“You’d have to put some sort of break on the reopening,” Murphy said. “You’d have no choice.” He said New Jersey is certain to see “some amount of spiking” as indoor activity increases, but he’s counting on testing and contact tracing to prevent mass flare-ups.New Jersey starting Monday allowed barber shops and salons to reopen, by appointment only and with masks and other precautions in place. Indoor shopping malls can open on June 29, but Murphy hasn’t set an opening date for movie theaters, indoor dining and gyms.S.C.

The metal also has found support from increasing monetary stimulus, including the Bank of England adding to its bond buying program last week and the Federal Reserve signaling rates will remain low. Increased amounts of monetary stimulus tend to boost zero-yield gold as a hedge against declining interest rates.“Gold appears poised for breakout,” Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at ThinkMarkets in London, said in an emailed note. “While gold is undoubtedly boosted by haven flows due to the economic damage caused by the pandemic as well as concerns over a second wave, there is little doubt that the metal is also finding good support from central bank money flooding the financial markets.”Gold futures for August delivery rose 0.8% to settle at $1,766.40 an ounce at 1:30 p.m. on the Comex in New York. That’s the highest close since April 14, when the metal reached a level last seen on Oct. 11, 2012.Gold futures are up 16% this year. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is forecasting a record $2,000 an ounce over the next 12 months, while JPMorgan Chase & Co. said investors should stick with gold as it is most leveraged to a low real-yield environment. Citigroup said in a note Monday that bids from ETF and over-the-counter investors could help push average prices in the second half beyond $1,715 an ounce, and reiterated gold could breach $2,000 by the middle of 2021.“Covid-19 worries together with the eventual inflationary impact of central bank stimulus are providing the support for gold,” said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank A\u002FS. While recent gains have once again attracted some profit-taking, buyers are also returning, he said.Net bullish bets in U.S. futures and options rose for the first time in four weeks, recovering from a one-year low, Commodity Futures Trading Commission data showed on Friday.Investors also continue to pile into gold-backed exchange-traded funds, which boosted their holdings by almost 30 tons on Friday, according to initial data compiled by Bloomberg. Of that inflow, about 23 tons went into SPDR Gold Shares, the most in a year in tonnage terms.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","pubtime":1592850837000,"is_eligible":true,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fca.finance.yahoo.com\u002Fnews\u002Fgold-drives-toward-highest-since-043031981.html","property":"Business","categoryLabel":"Business","title":"Gold Drives Toward Highest Since 2012 on Virus Resurgence Concern","images":{"original":{"height":1314,"width":2000,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002F0oS9_jkvxYfzxt3C3RO2zA--~B\u002FaD0xMzE0O3c9MjAwMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen\u002Fbloomberg_markets_842\u002F951663aef0a62c8c9caea296d78288e8.cf.jpg"},"img:220x123":{"height":123,"width":220,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002FTBjT4598obSzIB8G71w7Tg--~B\u002FZmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMjM7cT04MDt3PTIyMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen\u002Fbloomberg_markets_842\u002F951663aef0a62c8c9caea296d78288e8.cf.jpg"},"img:440x246":{"height":246,"width":440,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002FPx4SKOXk7YZcZoT_QjvNpQ--~B\u002FZmk9c3RyaW07aD0yNDY7cT04MDt3PTQ0MDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen\u002Fbloomberg_markets_842\u002F951663aef0a62c8c9caea296d78288e8.cf.jpg"}},"type":"article","link":"\u002Fnews\u002Fgold-drives-toward-highest-since-043031981.html","id":"d852a9ab-c71d-3d46-b157-62f8b8215190","publisher":"Bloomberg","publisher_id":"bloomberg_markets_842","off_network":false},{"i13n":{"bpos":1,"cpos":11,"cposy":14},"summary":"YAKIMA, Wash. — Fruit warehouse worker Armida Rivera says her days in Yakima County, Washington, are filled with the fear of getting the coronavirus.Sean Gilbert worries about the threat to his family's century-old orchard business in the county.And Washington Gov. Jay Inslee is struggling to help the county at the heart of the state's agricultural belt that he once called home.The coronavirus pandemic is hitting Yakima County hard, with cases surging far faster in this region about 140 miles (225 kilometres) southeast of Seattle than the rest of the state. The virus has caused turmoil in the farm and food processing industry, where some fearful workers staged wildcat strikes recently to demand employers provide safer working conditions.Hospitals in the county are filled to capacity and have started sending patients to neighbouring counties, officials said.Efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19 among the county's 250,000 residents have so far failed, and Yakima County is one of only three in Washington that has remained in Phase One lockdown while most of the state is starting to reopen.Inslee said a big reason is that many people in Yakima County are declining to wear masks.Visits to fast-food restaurants and other essential businesses found lots of employees and customers not wearing masks. In Selah, youth league baseball games were being played with spectators — few wearing masks — in the stands.Inslee on Saturday announced he was preparing a proclamation to require Yakima County residents to wear masks when outside their homes. Stores and other businesses will be banned from selling to customers without masks, he said.“That essentially means: ‘’No mask, no service, and no mask, no goods,'' Inslee said.As of Sunday, Yakima County had at least 6,283 cases of coronavirus, second-highest among counties in the state, and 138 deaths. King County, which includes Seattle and has nearly 10 times more people, had recorded at least 9,211 cases and 600 deaths.Inslee noted the infection rate in Yakima County was 28 times higher than the rate in King County. He predicted it would jump dramatically this summer if people don't take steps to limit exposure.“It is terrifying,'' Inslee said of the region, home to tens of thousands of workers on farms and in food processing plants who make up the bulk of the economy.Just over 50% of the county's virus cases involve Hispanic residents, who make up the bulk of the agricultural workforce. In addition, 26% per cent of virus tests in the county come back positive, compared to a state average of about 6%.Rivera, 36, works in a fruit warehouse. A native of Mexico who has lived 20 years in the United States, she was a leader of a two-week wildcat strike at the warehouse when management refused to provide workers with masks, hand sanitizer and other safety equipment.“We were scared. '' she said, stressing that people were working shoulder-to-shoulder.The valley's bounty of apples, cherries, pears and other crops are sorted, cleaned and packaged at the warehouse.The workers who went on strikes at several plants mostly earn the minimum wage of $13.50 an hour. They were heartened by support from the medical community, as doctors and nurses came by to drop off masks and other supplies.The wildcat strikes, which involved half a dozen fruit warehouses, have all been settled, but fears remain.Rosalinda Gonzalez, 41, is a native of Mexico who has lived in the United States since 1995. Married with three children, she also went on strike for protective equipment and a safer work environment.“We are always afraid,'' Gonzalez said, adding that many workers at her warehouse have tested positive for the virus.Some farmers have taken extraordinary steps, some prescribed by the governor's office, to protect their work force.Gilbert is the owner of Gilbert Orchards,where he grows 4,000 acres of apples, cherries, wine grapes and other crops in the shadow of the Cascade Range.He provided face marks for his workforce, spending $22,000 in April to buy 16,000 masks from China. His employees practice social distancing and migrant workers are housed in dormitories that no longer include bunk beds, as required by the governor's proclamations. Vans now carry seven people at a time to distant fields instead of 15.But that doesn't mean he will stay in business.Costs for farmers are rising dramatically, even as the markets for produce are dropping because of trade restrictions overseas and people's inability to pay for the products in the United States because of job losses, Gilbert said.He recently took 300 acres of apples out of production.“At our cost structure, it didn't make sense to keep growing,'' he said.Inslee said the county also has lots of cases in nursing homes, and a large percentage of the region's employees are rated as essential and thus continued to go to work.“”This is the place where our food comes from,'' Inslee noted.As a result, local politicians pushed him hard to start allowing the reopening of businesses in Yakima County.Rivera said safeguarding health should be the most important consideration.“It’s super necessary to protect our families.? she said.Nicholas K.

Massachusetts Institute of Technology was among the earliest recipients of the act, which served as the basis for many other institutions, including the University of California and Washington State University.These schools “and their counterparts in every state created a new type of university with a new practical focus on problem solving that the world had never seen,” Romer, co-recipient of the 2018 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, said in a telephone interview. “The success of California and Massachusetts is a sign of the high level of investment that those states have made in their university and research systems.”California ranked No. 1 in the Bloomberg index for patent activity and second for both technology-company density and concentration of science- and engineering-degree holders. Its state university system and pre-eminence in research -- along with private Stanford University -- have been influential in building Silicon Valley, headquarters for established tech companies including Alphabet’s Google and Apple and also the breeding ground for budding startups.”Entrepreneurism and innovation are core to our economy, and our workforce and will be the foundation of our recovery,” said Chris Dombrowski, acting director of the Governor’s Office of Business and Economic Development.Last year, California entrepreneurs received more than $67 billion in venture-capital funding, according to data from PitchBook. That’s more than three times New York, the second-highest state for deal flow.According to a joint report from PwC and CB Insights, the top five highest-valued private U.S. tech companies are all California-based: JUUL Labs, Stripe, Airbnb, Space X and Palantir Technologies.Among U.S. companies that went public last year, the five reaping the highest year-to-date returns also are in California: Zoom Video Communications, IT-service provider Fastly and life-science specialty businesses Vir Biotechnology, Livongo Health and IDEAYA Biosciences.Second place Massachusetts took the crown for tech-company density. General Electric, Raytheon, Thermo Fisher Scientific and Biogen are headquartered in the Northeastern state. Prior to the pandemic, Boston-based Toast -- a restaurant-management platform -- was a venture-capital favorite. The startup raised $400 million at a $4.9 billion valuation in February.Covid-19 InnovationRounding out the top five are No. 3 Washington, No. 4 Connecticut and Oregon, which jumped two spots to No. 5. Colorado is the only state in the top 10 that isn’t on the West or East coasts.This is the third straight year that California, Massachusetts and Washington have lead the index. Romer noted the important work being done in all three to deal with the Covid-19 virus that has shocked the U.S. economy by causing businesses to close, putting millions of Americans out of work.For example, Massachusetts-based Moderna Therapeutics developed a new vaccine, currently in human clinical trials, in just 63 days. BARDA -- the U.S. Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority -- awarded Moderna $483 million to begin producing it if it’s approved by the Food and Drug Administration.Economic research shows that technological innovation is accelerated during recessions, so states that already have a strong foundation of R&D and tech investment may be best suited to adapt to a post-Covid-19 world.Alabama was the biggest mover, rising five spots to No. 41. Its research and development spending has increased by 68 basis points, and Huntsville, near the Tennessee border, recently appeared in other rankings as having a high percentage of STEM workers and people with science and engineering degrees. Known as Rocket City, Huntsville is home to the Redstone Arsenal, which houses NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center and the U.S. Missile Defense Agency.The bottom five states are Kentucky, Louisiana, Arkansas, West Virginia and Mississippi.To access the data behind this index, click here.(Adding quote from California governor’s office in eighth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","pubtime":1592850512000,"is_eligible":true,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fca.finance.yahoo.com\u002Fnews\u002Fcalifornia-massachusetts-rank-most-innovative-130000285.html","property":"News","categoryLabel":"News","title":"California, Massachusetts Rank as Most Innovative States","images":{"original":{"height":399,"width":633,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002F.mCugT09pbsVvGhOK.iYtA--~B\u002FaD0zOTk7dz02MzM7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen\u002Fbloomberg_markets_842\u002F0387d9e82905455b6ced5a4d17fe3e84.cf.jpg"},"img:220x123":{"height":123,"width":220,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002F1eKvwAdCh.1UWPPJm71Jmg--~B\u002FZmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMjM7cT04MDt3PTIyMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen\u002Fbloomberg_markets_842\u002F0387d9e82905455b6ced5a4d17fe3e84.cf.jpg"},"img:440x246":{"height":246,"width":440,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002FCBeH0zPDnzq0zyqNR_ifZA--~B\u002FZmk9c3RyaW07aD0yNDY7cT04MDt3PTQ0MDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen\u002Fbloomberg_markets_842\u002F0387d9e82905455b6ced5a4d17fe3e84.cf.jpg"}},"type":"article","link":"\u002Fnews\u002Fcalifornia-massachusetts-rank-most-innovative-130000285.html","id":"73952d32-84b7-347c-86d7-5640b9006db4","publisher":"Bloomberg","publisher_id":"bloomberg_markets_842","off_network":false},{"i13n":{"bpos":1,"cpos":13,"cposy":16},"summary":"(Bloomberg) -- Technology stocks pulled broad U.S. equity indexes higher Monday, as investors continued to bet on companies with strong balance sheets and better prospects in an economy where work-from-home remains part of the norm.The Nasdaq 100 jumped 1%, with Adobe, Amazon.com and Square trading at all-time highs. The Nasdaq Composite headed for its seventh straight advance in the longest rally of the year. The S&P 500 turned higer in afternoon trading, though lagged behind as an increase in coronavirus cases led to some renewed temporary shutdowns in the U.S. The index rallied almost 2% last week.“There’s absolutely a big tug-of-war going on right now,” JJ Kinahan, the chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade, said by phone. “Everyone is trying to figure out who is going to be the winners and losers when things get quote-unquote back to normal. That to me shows that everybody is trying to figure out which way to go.”Gold neared a seven-year high, while the dollar weakened. European stocks slumped, with Wirecard AG in free-fall after more than $2 billion in assets went missing. The yield on Germany’s 30-year government debt fell below zero for the first time since May. Crude oil hovered below $40 a barrel in New York.There are increasing signs that the virus is continuing to rapidly spread as governments work to reopen their economies.

In the U.K., Prime Minister Boris Johnson is preparing to relax social distancing rules in a major boost to the hospitality industry.At the same time, risk appetite is being supported by historic stimulus programs by central banks around the world.

The politics have moved on,” said James Athey, a money manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments. “Rightly or wrongly, there’s also a pretty widespread feeling that riskier assets won’t go down too far because the Federal Reserve won’t let them.”In Turkey, the benchmark equities index erased its 2020 losses, lifted in a rally driven mostly by a wave of buying from local investors.Here are some key events coming up:MSCI Inc. on Tuesday announces its market classification review for 2020.The IMF will release new 2020 growth projections on Wednesday.U.S. jobless claims, durable goods and GDP data are due Thursday.A rebalance of Russell indexes is due on Friday.These are the main moves in markets:For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","pubtime":1592850294000,"is_eligible":true,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fca.finance.yahoo.com\u002Fnews\u002Faussie-slips-early-trading-yen-205729792.html","property":"Business","categoryLabel":"Business","title":"U.S. Stocks Advance on Tech Surge; Treasuries Rise: Markets Wrap","images":{"original":{"height":675,"width":1200,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002FM2bONDn5PydT4aUVME.c3Q--~B\u002FaD02NzU7dz0xMjAwO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen\u002Fbloomberg_markets_842\u002F16cc7d59c5baad3dbb60b32321c0232d.cf.jpg"},"img:220x123":{"height":123,"width":220,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002FG.8icMo2Oza1_TPxsRkctw--~B\u002FZmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMjM7cT04MDt3PTIyMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen\u002Fbloomberg_markets_842\u002F16cc7d59c5baad3dbb60b32321c0232d.cf.jpg"},"img:440x246":{"height":246,"width":440,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002FY31Bb8763Sf_ofHc8YyzMg--~B\u002FZmk9c3RyaW07aD0yNDY7cT04MDt3PTQ0MDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen\u002Fbloomberg_markets_842\u002F16cc7d59c5baad3dbb60b32321c0232d.cf.jpg"}},"type":"article","link":"\u002Fnews\u002Faussie-slips-early-trading-yen-205729792.html","id":"57bcf25c-19de-397e-be25-bc91f4a3be28","publisher":"Bloomberg","publisher_id":"bloomberg_markets_842","off_network":false},{"i13n":{"bpos":1,"cpos":14,"cposy":17},"summary":"Charles Schwab Chief Global Investment Strategist Jeffrey Kleintop joins Yahoo Finance’s Akiko Fujita to discuss the latest COVID-19 stimulus outlook.","pubtime":1592850198000,"is_eligible":true,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fca.finance.yahoo.com\u002Fvideo\u002Fkudlow-coronavirus-stimulus-bill-highly-182318067.html","property":"News","categoryLabel":"News","title":"Kudlow: Coronavirus stimulus bill highly likely this summer","images":{"original":{"height":3432,"width":6088,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002FHnx_zekYiNjJJ8u5aAinQw--~B\u002FaD0zNDMyO3c9NjA4ODthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fmedia-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com\u002Fcreatr-uploaded-images\u002F2020-06\u002F6dcfda00-b4b5-11ea-bedf-26003430d569.cf.jpg"},"img:220x123":{"height":123,"width":220,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002F8y4NGwk2GIHmO4iADUdl_Q--~B\u002FZmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMjM7cT04MDt3PTIyMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fmedia-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com\u002Fcreatr-uploaded-images\u002F2020-06\u002F6dcfda00-b4b5-11ea-bedf-26003430d569.cf.jpg"},"img:440x246":{"height":246,"width":440,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002FkjvOuDCI44uIrSRtYNxpBQ--~B\u002FZmk9c3RyaW07aD0yNDY7cT04MDt3PTQ0MDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fmedia-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com\u002Fcreatr-uploaded-images\u002F2020-06\u002F6dcfda00-b4b5-11ea-bedf-26003430d569.cf.jpg"}},"type":"video","link":"\u002Fvideo\u002Fkudlow-coronavirus-stimulus-bill-highly-182318067.html","id":"f4b23040-6cfa-32f6-be92-c6f4d2275e8d","publisher":"Yahoo Finance Video","publisher_id":"video.yahoofinance.com","off_network":false},{"i13n":{"bpos":1,"cpos":15,"cposy":18},"summary":"ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. — Coronavirus cases in Florida surpassed 100,000 on Monday, part of an alarming surge across the South and West as states reopen for business and many Americans resist wearing masks or keeping their distance from others.The disturbing signs in the Sunshine State as well as places like Arizona, Alabama, Louisiana, Texas and South Carolina — along with countries such as Brazil, India and Pakistan — are raising fears that the progress won after months of lockdowns is slipping away.“It is snowballing. We will most certainly see more people die as a result of this spike,” said Dr. Marc Boom, CEO and president of Houston Methodist Hospital, noting that the number of COVID-19 hospital admissions has tripled since Memorial Day to more then 1,400 across eight hospital systems in the Houston metropolitan area.He predicted that in three weeks hospitals could be overwhelmed, and he pleaded with people to cover their faces and practice social distancing.“It is possible to open up at a judicious pace and coexist with the virus, but it requires millions and millions of people to do the right thing. Right now, we don’t have that” because people have let their guard down, Boom said.The number of newly confirmed coronavirus cases across the country per day has reached more than 26,000, up from about 21,000 two weeks ago, according to an Associated Press analysis of data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The analysis looked at a seven-day rolling average through Sunday.Over 120,000 deaths in the U.S. have been blamed on the virus.Over the weekend, the virus seemed to be everywhere at once: Six staff members helping set up for President Donald Trump's rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, tested positive, as did 23 Clemson University football players in South Carolina. At least 30 members of the Louisiana State University football team were isolated after becoming infected or coming into contact with someone who was. Meatpacking plants were also hit with outbreaks.In Orlando, 152 coronavirus cases were linked to one bar near the University of Central Florida campus, said Dr. Raul Pino, a state health officer in the resort city.“A lot of transmission happened there,” Pino said. “People are very close. People are not wearing masks. People are drinking, shouting, dancing, sweating, kissing and hugging, all the things that happen in bars. And all those things that happen are not good for COVID-19.”Although he asked health officials to renew calls for people to wear masks and keep their distance, Gov. Ron DeSantis has not signalled he will retreat from reopening the state after three months of shutdowns that have damaged the economy.Dr. Michael Ryan, the World Health Organization's emergencies chief, said that the outbreak is “definitely accelerating” in the U.S. and a number of other countries, dismissing the notion that the record daily levels of new COVID-19 cases simply reflect more testing. He noted that numerous countries have noted marked increases in hospital admissions and deaths.“The epidemic is now peaking or moving towards a peak in a number of large countries,\" he warned.Arizona, in particular, is seeing disturbing trends in several benchmarks, including the percentage of tests that prove positive for the virus. Arizona's is the highest in the nation.The state's positive test rate is at a seven-day average of 20.4%, well above the national average of 8.4% and the 10% level that public health officials say is a problem. When the positive test rate rises, it means that an outbreak is worsening — not just that more people are getting tested.At Maryland's Fort Washington Medical Center on the outskirts of the nation’s capital, workers described a scramble to find new beds, heartbreaking interactions with family members of critically ill patients and their frustration with Americans who do not believe the coronavirus threat is real.“Everybody is out lounging on the beaches. Just thinking that it’s over. And it’s not,” respiratory therapist Kevin Cole said. \"It’s far from being over. And unfortunately, it’s those people that keep we’ll keep this pandemic going.”Meanwhile, New York City, once the most lethal hot spot in the U.S., lifted more of its restrictions Monday, moving a big step closer to normal.Eve Gonzalez, a 27-year-old food industry worker in New York whose job had not yet resumed, said it was too soon: “I’m dying to go out, but people’s health is more important.\"Nine million people have been confirmed infected by the virus worldwide and about 470,000 have died, according to Johns Hopkins, though experts say the actual numbers are much higher because of limited testing and cases in which patients had no symptoms.Amid the global surge, the head of WHO warned that world leaders must not politicize the outbreak but unite to fight it.Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who has faced criticism from President Donald Trump, said during a videoconference for the Dubai-based World Government Summit that it took over three months for the world to see 1 million confirmed infections, but just eight days to see the most recent 1 million cases.Tedros did not mention Trump by name or his determination to pull the United States out of the U.N. health agency but warned against “politicizing” the pandemic.“The greatest threat we face now is not the virus itself, it’s the lack of global solidarity and global leadership,” he said. “We cannot defeat this pandemic with a divided world.”Trump has criticized the WHO for its early response to the outbreak and what he considers its excessive praise of China, where the outbreak began, though his own administration’s response in the U.S. has come under attack. Trump has threatened to end all U.S. funding for the WHO.Companies around the world are racing to find a vaccine, and there is fierce debate over how to make sure it is distributed fairly. WHO's special envoy on COVID-19, Dr. David Nabarro, said he believes it will be “2 1\u002F2 years until there will be vaccine for everybody in the world.”India's health care system has been slammed by the virus. The country's caseload climbed by nearly 15,000 Monday to over 425,000, with more than 13,000 deaths.After easing a nationwide lockdown, the Indian government in recent weeks ran special trains to return thousands of migrant workers to their home villages.In Pakistan, infections are accelerating and hospitals are having to turn away patients, with new cases up to 6,800 a day. The government has relaxed its coronavirus restrictions, hoping to salvage a near-collapsed economy in the country of 220 million people.___Associated Press journalists from around the world contributed.Tamara Lush, Nathan Ellgren And Tammy Webber, The Associated Press","pubtime":1592850112000,"is_eligible":true,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fca.finance.yahoo.com\u002Fnews\u002Fvirus-cases-surge-us-worldwide-060137387.html","property":"Health","categoryLabel":"Health","title":"Surging US virus cases raise fear that progress is slipping","images":{"original":{"height":683,"width":1024,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002FQ0fTep7E1fS1pQyRpaQnsQ--~B\u002FaD02ODM7dz0xMDI0O2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen-ca\u002Fthe_canadian_press_business_130\u002Fe6579e384f1a77a1160b841ab6faec1b.cf.jpg"},"img:220x123":{"height":123,"width":220,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002F4_cn868NvuDALI4pBzcKOA--~B\u002FZmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMjM7cT04MDt3PTIyMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen-ca\u002Fthe_canadian_press_business_130\u002Fe6579e384f1a77a1160b841ab6faec1b.cf.jpg"},"img:440x246":{"height":246,"width":440,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002FOjN974eDKjg4HSlmoQuILQ--~B\u002FZmk9c3RyaW07aD0yNDY7cT04MDt3PTQ0MDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen-ca\u002Fthe_canadian_press_business_130\u002Fe6579e384f1a77a1160b841ab6faec1b.cf.jpg"}},"type":"article","link":"\u002Fnews\u002Fvirus-cases-surge-us-worldwide-060137387.html","id":"e545b579-1db7-3020-9406-4c9c29e86d13","publisher":"The Canadian Press","publisher_id":"the_canadian_press_business_130","off_network":false},{"i13n":{"bpos":1,"cpos":16,"cposy":19},"summary":"Yahoo Finance’s Heidi Chung joins Zack Guzman to discuss China's decision to suspend poultry imports from one Tyson Foods plant that has seen an uptick in COVID-19 cases.","pubtime":1592849871000,"is_eligible":true,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fca.finance.yahoo.com\u002Fvideo\u002Fchina-pauses-imports-tyson-plant-181751942.html","property":"News","categoryLabel":"News","title":"China pauses imports from Tyson plant over coronavirus fears","images":{"original":{"height":1389,"width":2473,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002FClGcStbLkG4CRP_vFkfB4w--~B\u002FaD0xMzg5O3c9MjQ3MzthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fmedia-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com\u002Fcreatr-uploaded-images\u002F2020-06\u002Fc3686ac0-b4b2-11ea-bcf5-e2d329a4abc7.cf.jpg"},"img:220x123":{"height":123,"width":220,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002FnDwBciZQgdhM9qVRyPVi_w--~B\u002FZmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMjM7cT04MDt3PTIyMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fmedia-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com\u002Fcreatr-uploaded-images\u002F2020-06\u002Fc3686ac0-b4b2-11ea-bcf5-e2d329a4abc7.cf.jpg"},"img:440x246":{"height":246,"width":440,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002FRFZgQNdZmpjAtEz8vHtbmw--~B\u002FZmk9c3RyaW07aD0yNDY7cT04MDt3PTQ0MDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fmedia-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com\u002Fcreatr-uploaded-images\u002F2020-06\u002Fc3686ac0-b4b2-11ea-bcf5-e2d329a4abc7.cf.jpg"}},"type":"video","link":"\u002Fvideo\u002Fchina-pauses-imports-tyson-plant-181751942.html","id":"e8a950ad-bbbe-3a9c-9b94-7eb39c86dfec","publisher":"Yahoo Finance Video","publisher_id":"video.yahoofinance.com","off_network":false},{"i13n":{"bpos":1,"cpos":17,"cposy":20},"summary":"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday pushed back against pressure from airlines to reopen the nation's borders, saying moving too quickly could spark a second wave of the coronavirus.  \"I understand there are a lot of tourism firms and airlines who would like us to be able to once again to welcome tourists,\" Trudeau told a daily briefing.

Group Inc., said the economy is likely to benefit from a V-type recovery in the next few months.The co-founder of the world’s biggest alternative asset management firm weighed in on markets in an interview Monday during the Bloomberg Invest Global virtual event.“You’ll see a big V in terms of the economy going up for the next few months because it’s been closed,” he said.Markets are benefiting from both liquidity and optimism that the coronavirus crisis can eventually be contained, Schwarzman said, but he cautioned on the economy, “It’ll take quite a while before we sync up and get back to 2019 levels.”The spread of the pandemic seized up credit markets and put an end to Wall Street’s longest-ever bull market earlier this year. The damage pushed the Federal Reserve to flood the markets with trillions of dollars in stimulus, which, combined with the easing of lockdown restrictions and hopes for a fast economic recovery, have helped the S&P 500 index rally almost 40% since its March low.Blackstone has been “aggressively” looking to put some of its $150 billion in dry powder to use, Schwarzman said in April. He also said that while all companies, including Blackstone, will be affected by the pandemic, the pain will be temporary, citing the U.S. government’s stimulus efforts. The New York-based firm saw asset values across most of its business segments plunge in the first quarter because of the economic fallout from the virus, but its long-term focus should put it in a position to hang on to companies as they regain strength.China’s OutlookChina will continue to grow at double or triple the rate of developed countries, Schwarzman said at Monday’s event. It could internalize its markets and depend less on exports, he said.Schwarzman has strong ties to China. He started a school in the country and has traveled there frequently -- at times functioning as an intermediary between the Washington and Beijing governments. The billionaire has also previously advised President Donald Trump and was present in the White House when he announced the first part of the China-U.S. trade deal.With assets of $538 billion as of March 31, Blackstone is the world’s largest alternative asset manager.(Updates with China comments in seventh paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","pubtime":1592849655000,"is_eligible":true,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fca.finance.yahoo.com\u002Fnews\u002Fschwarzman-sees-big-v-economic-174103217.html","property":"Business","categoryLabel":"Business","title":"Schwarzman Sees ‘Big V’ Economic Rebound in Next Few Months","type":"article","link":"\u002Fnews\u002Fschwarzman-sees-big-v-economic-174103217.html","id":"331d44b4-e71a-3858-a11b-7adc76c6617c","publisher":"Bloomberg","publisher_id":"bloomberg_markets_842","off_network":false},{"i13n":{"bpos":1,"cpos":22,"cposy":25},"summary":"Hazel C.

shopping malls and swimming pools on Wednesday after officials determined that the Covid-19 virus is under control.“We’re winning the fight, but it’s not over,” Ontario Premier Doug Ford said at a news conference Monday, while cautioning residents to use common sense and continue to social distance. “It can turn and bite us in the backside in about a heartbeat.”The country’s financial center has also been one of its Covid hotspots. As of June 20, Toronto had reported 13,856 cases and 1,039 fatalities since the start of the outbreak. More than 11,800 people have recovered.The Peel region, which is west of Toronto, will also be allowed to move into “stage two” of the province’s reopening plan. However, the Windsor-Essex area will have to wait until outbreaks among temporary foreign workers on farms in the area are brought under control, Ford said.“No one wants to see every region of Ontario opened more than I do, but we have to do it right, and unfortunately right now the threat of this virus in Windsor-Essex is still too great,” he said.Part of the delay can be blamed on the agriculture sector, he said.“Farmers just aren’t cooperating,” he said. “They aren’t sending the people out to be tested.”On Monday, New York City entered phase two of its reopening plans with similar types of businesses allowed to unlock their doors. Still, things won’t quite be back to normal as shoppers should be prepared to wear face masks and physically distance from others. Manhattan restaurants are allowed to offer only outdoor seating.Toronto’s downtown core has been quiet since shutdowns to contain the virus were implemented in early March. The city has remained under partial lockdown as most of the rest of the province moved into Stage Two earlier this month.Read more: Toronto’s Underground City Faces Bleak Future With Bankers MIAIt’s not clear how much Toronto’s financial district will be affected by today’s news. Two dozen major Toronto employers -- including Canada’s key banks and insurers -- have said they intend to keep most downtown staff home until at least September.Ford thanked Ontarians for their hard work during the lockdown.“Because of them, because of their efforts, we’re beating this virus,” he said.(Updates with premier’s comment in second paragraph, regional information in fourth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","pubtime":1592849267000,"is_eligible":true,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fca.finance.yahoo.com\u002Fnews\u002Fnext-wave-toronto-businesses-allowed-180747708.html","property":"News","categoryLabel":"News","title":"Next Wave of Toronto Businesses Allowed to Reopen Wednesday","images":{"original":{"height":1334,"width":2000,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002FvvXB4X9i9HUO0jHr_l3jfQ--~B\u002FaD0xMzM0O3c9MjAwMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen\u002Fbloomberg_markets_842\u002Fa6c108c7fc18fbd0b9655836aba44333.cf.jpg"},"img:220x123":{"height":123,"width":220,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002FQpVl7T6MVImNtJF0yYv24Q--~B\u002FZmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMjM7cT04MDt3PTIyMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen\u002Fbloomberg_markets_842\u002Fa6c108c7fc18fbd0b9655836aba44333.cf.jpg"},"img:440x246":{"height":246,"width":440,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002FhZEatK8sIbk8ImdKWztk5Q--~B\u002FZmk9c3RyaW07aD0yNDY7cT04MDt3PTQ0MDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen\u002Fbloomberg_markets_842\u002Fa6c108c7fc18fbd0b9655836aba44333.cf.jpg"}},"type":"article","link":"\u002Fnews\u002Fnext-wave-toronto-businesses-allowed-180747708.html","id":"e4e3d577-16fb-323a-a69d-974bc47a0a5d","publisher":"Bloomberg","publisher_id":"bloomberg_markets_842","off_network":false}],"view":"mega","ccode_fptoday":"ntk_assetlist_unified__en-CA__finance__default__default__featurephone__ga__noSplit","fptoday_remaining":0,"ccode":"ntk_assetlist_unified__en-CA__finance__default__default__featurephone__ga__noSplit","comscore":"pageview_candidate","more":0,"more_items":[],"components":[{"bundleName":"tdv2-applet-stream-hero.carousel","name":"StreamHeroCarousel","props":{"componentConfig":{"leadDimension":"img:900x505","moreItemsModulus":6,"moreDimension":"img:206x116","resizeTag":["img:900x505|1|95","img:206x116|2|80"],"showSummary":true,"ui":{"share_buttons":{"buttons_to_show":["tumblr","facebook","twitter","mail"],"enable":false},"rotationEnabled":false,"rotationInterval":6000,"comments_count":3,"smart_crop":true,"video_config":{"yvapid":"193","vpConfigOverrides":{"skipOnError":"always"},"preReactPlayerInit":true,"yahooVideoPlaylist":{"enabled":true,"ui":{"show":true,"position":"hidden"},"width":1,"height":1},"useAppDocking":true,"suppressAdContext":true,"renderOnServer":true,"mute":true,"playContext":"default"},"video_autoplay_enabled":true,"sports_morelink_enabled":false,"comments":false,"enable_canvass_comments":true,"prerender":{"enabled":true,"renderTargetId":"default"},"minMoreItems":3,"show_comments_drawer":false,"lead":null,"video_enabled":false},"clientDelayOnVideo":1000}}},{"bundleName":"tdv2-applet-stream","name":"MegaItem"},{"bundleName":"tdv2-applet-stream","name":"MegaItem"},{"bundleName":"tdv2-applet-stream","name":"MegaItem"},{"bundleName":"tdv2-applet-stream","name":"MegaItem"},{"bundleName":"tdv2-applet-stream","name":"MegaItem"},{"bundleName":"tdv2-applet-stream","name":"MegaItem"},{"bundleName":"tdv2-applet-stream","name":"MegaItem"},{"bundleName":"tdv2-applet-stream","name":"MegaItem"},{"bundleName":"tdv2-applet-stream","name":"MegaItem"},{"bundleName":"tdv2-applet-stream","name":"MegaItem"},{"bundleName":"tdv2-applet-stream","name":"MegaItem"},{"bundleName":"tdv2-applet-stream","name":"MegaItem"},{"bundleName":"tdv2-applet-stream","name":"MegaItem"},{"bundleName":"tdv2-applet-stream","name":"MegaItem"},{"bundleName":"tdv2-applet-stream","name":"MegaItem"},{"bundleName":"tdv2-applet-stream","name":"MegaItem"},{"bundleName":"tdv2-applet-stream","name":"MegaItem"},{"bundleName":"tdv2-applet-stream","name":"MegaItem"},{"bundleName":"tdv2-applet-stream","name":"MegaItem"},{"bundleName":"tdv2-applet-stream","name":"MegaItem"},{"bundleName":"tdv2-applet-stream","name":"MegaItem"},{"bundleName":"tdv2-applet-stream","name":"MegaItem"},{"bundleName":"tdv2-applet-stream","name":"MegaItem"},{"bundleName":"tdv2-applet-stream","name":"MegaItem"},{"bundleName":"tdv2-applet-stream","name":"MegaItem"}],"stream_remaining":0,"category":"LISTID:5e2d3941-7502-49a1-8ac2-ab98b8185a6d"},"ts":1592852118.276,"cposy":30}}},"LangStore":{"defaultBundle":"td-app-finance","baseLangs":{"td-app-finance":{"{0} -

Morningstar categories help investors and investment professionals make meaningful comparisons between funds. The categories make it easier to build well-diversified portfolios, assess potential risk, and identify top-performing funds. We place funds in a given category based on their portfolio statistics and compositions over the past three years. If the fund is new and has no portfolio history, we estimate where it will fall before giving it a more permanent category assignment. When necessary, we may change a category assignment based on recent changes to the portfolio.","MORNINGSTAR_CATEGORY":"Morningstar Category","MORNINGSTAR_STYLE_BOX_DESC":"Yahoo partners with Morningstar a leading market research and investment data group to help investors rate and compare funds on Yahoo Finance.

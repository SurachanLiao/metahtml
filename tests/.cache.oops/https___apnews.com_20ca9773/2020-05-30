— Tense protests over the death of George Floyd and other police killings of black people grew Saturday from New York to Tulsa to Los Angeles, with police cars set ablaze and reports of injuries mounting on all sides as the country convulsed through another night of unrest after months of coronavirus lockdowns.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The protests, which began in Minneapolis following Floyd's death Monday after a police officer pressed a knee on his neck until he stopped breathing, have left parts of the city a grid of broken windows, burned-out buildings and ransacked stores. The unrest has since become a national phenomenon as protesters decry years of deaths at police hands. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Tens of thousands of people were in the streets across the country, many of them not wearing masks or observing social distancing, raising concerns among health experts about the potential for spreading the coronavirus pandemic at a time when much of the country is in the process of reopening society and the economy.\u003c/p>\u003cp>After a tumultuous Friday night, racially diverse crowds took to the streets again for mostly peaceful demonstrations in dozens of cities from coast to coast. The previous day’s protests also started calmly, but many descended into violence later in the day. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"social-embed\" id=\"se0:f083e920-91f0-11ea-f4bc-ddea3200833c\">\u003ciframe aria-describedby=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"529\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-wY7HR\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/wY7HR/30/\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% !important;\" title=\"chart Protests grow across across the U.S.\">\u003c/iframe>\u003cscript type=\"text/javascript\">(function() {'use strict';window.addEventListener('message', function(event) {if (typeof event.data['datawrapper-height'] !== 'undefined') {for (var chartId in event.data['datawrapper-height']) {var iframe = document.getElementById('datawrapper-chart-' + chartId) || document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\" + chartId + \"']\");if (!iframe) {continue;}iframe.style.height = event.data['datawrapper-height'][chartId] + 'px';}}});})();\u003c/script>\u003cp class=\"social-caption\">\u003c/p>\u003c/div>\u003cp>— In Washington, the National Guard was deployed outside the White House, where chanting crowds were taunting Secret Service agents. Dressed in camouflage and holding shields, the troops stood in a tight line a few yards from the crowd, preventing them from pushing forward. President Donald Trump, who spent much of Saturday in Florida for the SpaceX rocket launch, landed on the lawn in the presidential helicopter at dusk and went inside without speaking to journalists. \u003c/p>\u003cp>— In Philadelphia, at least 13 officers were injured when peaceful protests turned violent and at least four police vehicles were set on fire. Other fires were set throughout downtown.\u003c/p>\u003cp>— In the Greenwood District of Tulsa, Oklahoma, the site of a 1921 massacre of black people that left as many as 300 dead and the city’s thriving black district in ruins, protesters blocked intersections and chanted the name of Terence Crutcher, a black man killed by a police officer in 2016.\u003c/p>\u003cp>— In Seattle, police fired tear gas and stun grenades to try to disperse black-clad crowds that smashed downtown shopfronts, stole merchandise and tossed mannequins onto the street. \u003c/p>\u003cp>— In Los Angeles, protesters chanted “Black Lives Matter,” some within inches of the face shields of officers. Police used batons to move the crowd back and fired rubber bullets. One man used a skateboard to try to break a police SUV's windshield. A spray-painted police car burned in the street. \u003c/p>\u003cp>— And in New York City, dangerous confrontations flared repeatedly as officers made arrests and cleared streets. A video showed two NYPD cruisers lurching into a crowd of demonstrators who were pushing a barricade against one of them and pelting it with objects, knocking several people to the ground. It was unclear if anyone was hurt.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Our country has a sickness. We have to be out here,” said Brianna Petrisko, among those at lower Manhattan’s Foley Square, where most were wearing masks amid the coronavirus pandemic. “This is the only way we’re going to be heard.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Back in Minneapolis, the city where the protests began, 29-year-old Sam Allkija said the damage seen in recent days reflects longstanding frustration and rage in the black community. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“I don’t condone them,” he said. “But you have to look deeper into why these riots are happening.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who said local forces had been overmatched Friday, fully mobilized the state’s National Guard and promised a massive show of force. The Guard announced Saturday it had more than 4,000 members responding to Minneapolis and would quickly have nearly 11,000. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd,” Walz said. “It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great cities.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Soon after the city's 8 p.m. curfew went into force, lines of police cars and officers in riot gear moved in to confront protesters, firing tear gas to push away throngs of people milling around the city’s 5th police precinct station. The tougher tactics came after city and state leaders were criticized for not forcefully enough confronting days of violent and damaging protests that included protesters burning down a police station shortly after officers abandoned it.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump appeared to cheer on the tougher tactics being used by law enforcement Saturday night. He commended the Guard deployment in Minneapolis, declaring “No games!” and also said police in New York City “must be allowed to do their job!”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Overnight curfews were imposed in more than a dozen major cities nationwide, ranging from 6 p.m. in parts of South Carolina to 10 p.m. around Ohio. People were also told to be off the streets of Atlanta, Denver, Los Angeles, Seattle and Minneapolis — where thousands had ignored the same order Friday night.\u003c/p>\u003cp>More than 1,300 people have been arrested in 16 cities since Thursday, with more than 500 of those happening in Los Angeles on Friday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The unrest comes at a time when most Americans have spent months inside over concerns surrounding the coronavirus, which the president has called an “invisible enemy.” The events of the last 72 hours, seen live on national television, have shown the opposite: a sudden pivot to crowds, screaming protesters and burning buildings, a stark contrast to the empty streets of recent months. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“Quite frankly I’m ready to just lock people up,\" Atlanta Police Chief Erika Shields said at a news conference. Demonstrations there turned violent Friday, and police were arresting protesters Saturday on blocked-off downtown streets. “Yes, you caught us off balance once. It’s not going to happen twice.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>This week's unrest recalled the riots in Los Angeles nearly 30 years ago after the acquittal of the white police officers who beat Rodney King, a black motorist who had led them on a high-speed chase. The protests of Floyd's killing have gripped many more cities, but the losses in Minneapolis have yet to approach the staggering totals Los Angeles saw during five days of rioting in 1992, when more than 60 people died, 2,000-plus were injured and thousands arrested, with property damage topping $1 billion.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Many protesters spoke of frustration that Floyd’s death was one more in a litany. It came in the wake of the killing in Georgia of Ahmaud Arbery, a black man who was shot dead after being pursued by two white men while running in their neighborhood, and in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic that has thrown millions out of work, killed more than 100,000 people in the U.S. and disproportionately affected black people. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The officer who held his knee to Floyd’s neck as he begged for air was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. But many protesters are demanding the arrests of the three other officers involved.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Leaders in many affected cities have voiced outrage over Floyd's killing and expressed sympathy for protesters' concerns. But as the unrest intensified, they spoke of a desperate need to protect their cities and said they would call in reinforcements, despite concerns that could lead to more heavy-handed tactics. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Minnesota has steadily increased to 1,700 the number of National Guardsmen it says it needs to contain the unrest, and the governor is considering a potential offer of military police put on alert by the Pentagon. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Governors in Georgia, Kentucky, Ohio and Texas also activated the National Guard after protests there turned violent overnight, while nighttime curfews were put in place in Portland, Oregon, Cincinnati and elsewhere. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Police in St. Louis were investigating the death of a protester who climbed between two trailers of a Fed Ex truck and was killed when it drove away. And a person was killed in the area of protests in downtown Detroit just before midnight after someone fired shots into an SUV, officers said. Police had initially said someone fired into the crowd from an SUV. \u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Numerous AP journalists contributed from across the U.S.\u003c/p>","mediaCount":16,"shortId":"c743eaecd9a5948a4576565b12e3230d","localLinkUrl":"https://apnews.com/c743eaecd9a5948a4576565b12e3230d","interactiveLinkUrl":null,"downloadSettings":null,"interactiveLinkUrlText":null,"richEmbeds":[],"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:c743eaecd9a5948a4576565b12e3230d","media":[{"altText":null,"imageFileExtension":".jpeg","id":"3436e89f8c17475ab96fa9126a4c8160","videoRenderedSizes":[],"imageMimeType":"image/jpeg","externalId":null,"videoMimeType":null,"type":"Photo","imageRenderedSizes":[3000,2000,1000,800,600,400],"aspectRatio":1.4641288433382138,"gcsBaseUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/3436e89f8c17475ab96fa9126a4c8160/"}],"videoContext":"\u003cp class=\"social-caption\">\u003c/p>","tagIds":["GeorgeFloyd","apf-topnews","Tulsa","state-California","state-Texas","state-NewYork","AhmaudArbery","state-Oregon","state-Minnesota","Minneapolis","state-Georgia","LosAngeles","state-Michigan","Pandemics","NewYork","state-NewYorkCity","VirusOutbreak","apf-GeneralNews","apf-Health","apf-usnews"],"hasTextOverlay":false,"bylines":"By TIM SULLIVAN and STEPHEN GROVES","leadPhotoId":"3436e89f8c17475ab96fa9126a4c8160"},{"embedHeight":null,"contentSponsor":null,"mediumIds":["1c8788363e5e4b4bbfd94bcb5d1c4a2b","1c8914997f2b4b5189059a50a1e7494d","0a9a85e986b24f9ab2836bc031adfee7","d8a30480a8464f45ad45179a82578849","1cc7970e7147439facdf709a43f565fe","3f8ece48b45f47c7af0e9485beb23f4c","351723a9cd34488a82e96c1de7b5d91f","230e3ff5d35e4a41939a7116b08be2cd","58ac3da845c04366997796db5dc4a71a","942892c88d0449f0b4fb84bcaa41b0cc","7804240c10744b7eabf4832bf7d1c2ca","aa731f67dd05434cb9f95c892e9a7b08","7d66b1d0e6f74d478bdbcfb934559e29","a88fb5ef8be949b38a35cdf76918ac00","af4f689299b8426c83a52a960906ee2e","3e33fd81534a499e881f32ea2058d5dd","add17fa81123474891e63ccd82e80122","c898e1df54884ce3a2a48d56e5a044a1","e09b0d2676294a529066110459d26b49","23f1312bae2c41eca02daec59e92dc1d","90353a7dcf3742298bb66aec37553b08","0effa7f915804232a51d5c45428288df","d3910f28c009495abf2359c82dff56d3","b732357ede354510a15a834b2ceccf94","487f858fd2874a2ba0399f51099babe5","0de9471d8bee4c57be610f051134ba03","cc520a5e49304b02abb1f2012464cc25","140ee7f3512b4c82977e4a13d14fcb25","aa59bdc9cebf4cb38c3cec4dc3dadcd2"],"title":"US--Minneapolis-Police-Death-The Latest","headline":"The Latest: Minneapolis officials: Violence has been stopped","localMemberName":null,"updated":"2020-05-31 04:30:39","contentType":"text","layoutType":"Small Photo","tagObjs":[{"name":"George Floyd","id":"GeorgeFloyd","isPr":null,"order":0},{"name":"AP Top News","id":"apf-topnews","isPr":false,"order":2},{"name":"Minneapolis","id":"Minneapolis","isPr":null,"order":0},{"name":"Business","id":"apf-business","isPr":null,"order":0},{"name":"Violence","id":"Violence","isPr":null,"order":0},{"name":"General News","id":"apf-GeneralNews","isPr":false,"order":6},{"name":"U.S. News","id":"apf-usnews","isPr":null,"order":7}],"embedCaption":null,"gcsUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/contents/urn:publicid:ap.org:b97b945c8814043d4a55c4091b0b6713","embedLinkURL":null,"language":null,"leadVideoId":null,"firstWords":"\u003cp>The Latest on the death in Minneapolis of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white police officer pressed a knee on his neck:\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>MINNEAPOLIS — Officials in...\u003c/p>","published":"2020-05-30 15:27:55","embedHTML":null,"sequenceNumber":null,"notificationId":"urn:publicid:ap.org:b97b945c8814043d4a55c4091b0b6713","storyHTML":"\u003cp>The Latest on the death in Minneapolis of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white police officer pressed a knee on his neck:\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>MINNEAPOLIS — Officials in Minneapolis say they’ve succeeded for now in stopping the violent protests that ravaged parts of the city for several days after the death of George Floyd.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Police, state troopers and National Guard members moved in to break up protests after an 8 p.m. curfew took effect, firing tear gas and rubber bullets to clear streets outside a police precinct and elsewhere.

Ever since it retired the space shuttle in 2011, NASA has relied on Russian spaceships launched from Kazakhstan to take U.S. astronauts to and from the space station.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Over the past few years, NASA outsourced the job of designing and building its next generation of spaceships to SpaceX and Boeing, awarding them $7 billion in contracts in a public-private partnership aimed at driving down costs and spurring innovation.

On Saturday, stormy weather threatened another postponement for most of the day, but the skies began to clear just in the time.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The astronauts set out for the launch pad in a gull-wing Tesla SUV after Behnken pantomimed a hug of his 6-year-old son, Theo, and said: “Are you going to listen to Mommy and make her life easy?” Hurley blew kisses to his 10-year-old son and wife.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Nine minutes after liftoff, the rocket's first-stage booster landed, as designed, on a barge a few hundred miles off the Florida coast, to be reused on another flight.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Thanks for the great ride to space,” Hurley told SpaceX ground control. The two crewmates batted around a floating blue dinosaur plush toy doubling as a dragon, demonstrating that they had reached zero gravity.\u003c/p>\u003cp>SpaceX controllers at Hawthorne, California, cheered and applauded wildly, and NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine declared: \"This is everything that America has to offer in its purest form.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Attendance inside Kennedy Space Center was strictly limited because of the coronavirus, and the crowd amounted to only a few thousand. By NASA’s count, over 3 million viewers tuned in online. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Despite NASA’s insistence that the public stay safe by staying home, spectators flocked to beaches and roads, some of them not wearing masks or keeping 6 feet from others.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Among the spectators was Neil Wight, a machinist from Buffalo, New York.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“With everything that’s going on in this country right now, it’s important that we do things extraordinary in life,” he said. \"We’ve been bombarded with doom and gloom for the last six, eight weeks, whatever it is, and this is awesome.

The SpaceX technicians who helped them get into their spacesuits wore masks and gloves that made them look like black-clad ninjas. And the SpaceX controllers had masks and were seated far apart.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In keeping with Musk’s penchant for futuristic flash, the astronauts wore angular white uniforms with black trim. Instead of the usual multitude of dials, knobs and switches, the Dragon capsule has three large touchscreens.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Once settled in orbit, Hurley disclosed that the capsule has been christened Endeavour, a storied name in the history of exploration, also given to one of the space shuttles.\u003c/p>\u003cp>SpaceX has been launching cargo capsules to the space station since 2012. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Under the new corporate-public model, aerospace companies design, build, own and operate spaceships, and NASA is essentially a paying customer on a list that could eventually include non-government researchers, artists and tourists.

The next SpaceX voyage to the space station, set for the end of August, will have a full, four-person crew: three Americans and one Japanese.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The first flight was originally targeted for around 2015. But the project encountered bureaucratic delays and technical setbacks. A SpaceX capsule exploded on the test stand last year. And Boeing’s first Starliner capsule ended up in the wrong orbit and was nearly destroyed during a test flight in December.\u003c/p>\u003cp>For SpaceX and the future of public-corporate space exploration, the stakes on Saturday were extraordinarily high.\u003c/p>\u003cp>With the spaceship finally on its way, Musk got choked up talking about the weight of his responsibility for the astronauts' lives and their families and noted that the return to Earth is more dangerous in some ways than ascent, “so we don't want to declare victory yet.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Still, Musk said he wasn't nervous about the launch on Saturday the way he was during the previous attempt. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“Today, I don’t know, it felt like just the fates were aligned,” he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Associated Press writers Jill Colvin and Mike Schneider in Cape Canaveral, Fla., contributed to this report.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

If whites are surprised, Cunningham said, it is only because they view the world through rose-colored, Caucasian glasses. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“I think white people were spared the truth of what was happening so they could believe there was progress being made,” she said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>But recent events like the deaths of George Floyd in Minneapolis and of Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old black man chased and killed by armed white men as he jogged through a south Georgia neighborhood, could not be ignored.

For example, he said, 80 to 90 percent of the arrests for breaking social distancing rules in New York City were of blacks or Latinos.\u003c/p>\u003cp>And these encounters often escalate. He cited the incident last week involving a white woman in New York’s Central Park and a black birdwatcher who complained that her dog was not leashed.

But Ray said he could easily imagine a scenario where they believed the white woman, not the black man, and the situation deteriorated. “It ends with George Floyd,” he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>For many blacks, the line between police brutality and their sufferings in the COVID-19 pandemic is not a tenuous one.

In a 2010 study, sociologist Evelyn J. Patterson found that while prison generally shortened the lives of white inmates, incarcerated black prisoners had lower death rates than those on the outside. Mostly, she concluded, it was because they received better health care there.\u003c/p>\u003cp>None of this is new.

They’ve blamed left-wing extremists, far-right white nationalists and even suggested the involvement of drug cartels. These leaders have offered little evidence to back up those claims, and the chaos of the protests makes verifying identities and motives exceedingly difficult. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Police officers across the country were gearing up Saturday for another night of potentially violent clashes in major cities. Some states had even called in the National Guard to aid overwhelmed police. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The finger pointing on both sides of the political spectrum is likely to deepen the political divide in the U.S., allowing politicians to advance the theory that aligns with their political view and distract from the underlying frustrations that triggered the protests. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Saturday told reporters he’d heard unconfirmed reports that white supremacists were coming from elsewhere to stoke the violence and that even drug cartels “are trying to take advantage of the chaos.” John Harrington, the state’s commissioner of public safety, later said they had received intel reports on white supremacists. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“But I cannot say that we have confirmed observations of local law enforcement to say that we’ve seen cells of white supremacists in the area,” he said Saturday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But federal officials later pointed to “far left extremist groups.\" President Donald Trump alleged the violence was “being led by Antifa and other radical groups.” Antifa, short for anti-fascists, is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Attorney General William Barr later seemed to echo Trump's assertion, saying the violent incidents in Minneapolis were driven by groups using \"Antifa-like tactics.\" Barr vowed that federal prosecutors across the country would use federal riots statutes to charge protesters who cross state lines to participate in violent rioting. \u003c/p>\u003cp>A Justice Department spokesperson said the attorney general’s assertion was based on information provided from state and local law enforcement agencies, but did not detail what that information entailed. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf was even more vague, declining to point to any particular ideology in his assessment. His agency has heard that “a number of different groups are involved in these whether it’s Antifa or it’s others, frankly,\" he said. The groups appeared to be organized and using tactics that wouldn’t normally happen in peaceful protest, he said, though he didn’t elaborate. \u003c/p>\u003cp>While the motives behind the violence were unclear, there was firmer evidence that some of the protesters were coming to the demonstrations from outside the urban centers that have been the epicenter of the demonstrations. \u003c/p>\u003cp>In New York City, federal officials were bringing charges against several suspects, including one of two sisters from upstate New York accused of throwing a Molotov cocktail through the back window of a police van in Brooklyn, a law enforcement official said. The initially peaceful demonstrations in New York City over Floyd’s death spiraled into chaos as night fell Friday. Protesters confronted police officers, destroying police vehicles and setting fires.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In Detroit, 37 of the 60 people who were arrested in overnight protests did not live in the city — and many came from nearby suburbs, police Chief James Craig said Saturday. Although Detroit is about 80% black, many of those arrested were white.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We support the right to free speech. We support peaceful protests,” Craig told reporters. “If you want to disrupt, stay home and disrupt in your own community.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Initially, St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter said he’d been told all of those arrested in his city Friday were from outside the state. But a spokesman said Saturday night the mayor had later learned more than half are from Minnesota. \u003c/p>\u003cp>In Hennepin County, which includes Minneapolis, 47 of the 57 people arrested in protest incidents through Saturday morning had provided a Minnesota address to authorities, according to Jeremy Zoss, a spokesman for the Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Carter expressed the opinion of many black activists in the Twin Cities who have expressed disbelief that local residents would destroy their own neighborhoods, burning down essential services and damaging small businesses. And while it was local protesters and groups that staged initial angry, but peaceful, demonstrations, it was agitators from elsewhere that strategically escalated the tension by causing damage and setting fires, they said. Their beliefs were reinforced by the large numbers of white people in the protests in Minneapolis.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I think about a third of the people are from out of town here to make the city burn,” said Justin Terrell, executive director of the Council for Minnesotans of African Heritage. “It is just putting black people in a crossfire not just between fascists and anarchists -- but putting us in a crossfire with the national guard.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>It’s exceedingly difficult in the chaos and dark of the events to prove these claims. The challenge is made harder in the Minnesota protest, where very few arrests were made in the first two nights of unrest. St. Paul arrest records showed 18 people were arrested on charges related to civil unrest from Thursday to early Saturday morning. Of those, only four were from outside the state; two were listed as unknown. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Still, some civil rights leaders had a clear message for anyone coming to protest, even those who show up to call for justice for Floyd. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“The moment has passed. Go home, stay away from here. We are a vulnerable population. At the end of that day if black folks can’t rebuild then the only thing we’ve done is build more power for white folks,\" said Terrell. \"You’re talking about years, decades of work undone by these groups -- and by the officer.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump vowed Saturday that the “radical left criminals, thugs and others” would “not be allowed to set communities ablaze.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>“I will not allow angry mobs to dominate,” he said. “Won’t happen.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Hennessey reported from Minneapolis.

Prices for meats, poultry, fish and eggs increased the most, rising 4.3%. Although the 2.9% jump in cereals and bakery products wasn't as steep, it was still the largest increase the agency has recorded.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Dairy and related products, and fruits and vegetables increased by 1.5 percent in April.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Egg prices also reached an all-time record of more than $3 a dozen in late March, but they have since fallen to less than $1 a dozen.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The situation has been worse for meat prices, largely because of illnesses among slaughterhouse workers. The outbreaks struck pork processing plants the hardest, but beef and chicken processors also saw some impact as thousands of workers tested positive for the virus and the United Food and Commercial Workers union said at least 44 workers had died of COVID-19 as of Friday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>April retail prices for boneless pork chops and ham were nearly 6% higher than in March and retail prices for hamburger and sirloin steak were about 4% higher, the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported. The price of whole fresh chickens rose by more than 12%.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>After numerous closures, most pork plants have reopened but often not at full capacity, forcing pig farmers to euthanize animals that couldn't be processed.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“There are biological constraints to this and that’s why I would anticipate prices to stay high at least for some period of time,” said Trey Malone, an agriculture economist and professor at Michigan State University. “If you’re going to euthanize thousands of animals and it takes six months to raise a new one, obviously there’s going to be some type of delay or buffer in the supply chain.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>By mid-May, beef and pork slaughterhouses were operating at about 60% capacity, though that figure has since climbed to nearly 90%, said Jayson Lusk, an economist at Purdue University. Although Lusk was optimistic that the worst of the meat supply crunch is over, he said it’s always possible that a second wave of illness could cause the situation to worsen.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Some grocery price jumps were because of people stocking up when the coronavirus first arrived. But even as some prices have dropped, the cost of produce such as potatoes, onions and carrots has remained above last year's prices.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Much of the increase appears to be because more people are cooking at home.\u003c/p>\u003cp>For garlic, most of which is imported from China, a 278% price increase from a year ago is largely due to a sluggish supply chain in China. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Jeff Dunn, CEO of Bolthouse Farms, a major provider of carrots and distributor of salad dressings and fruit and vegetable-based beverages, said he doesn't anticipate new supply problems. But he noted that some of his company's workers in distribution and field work have become sick, and that there is an additional cost to implement and maintain procedures intended to keep workers safe.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Someone has to pick up those costs, he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“There is real cost being built across every supply chain. Not just with us but with the retailer in terms of incremental cost associated with COVID,\" Dunn said. “At some point, if you want any chance to hold up any kind of margin, those costs are going to have to be passed on or somehow recognized by the government with some help.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Given that the percentage of Americans' paychecks that go toward food has declined over the past 50 years, many people likely can handle the recent price increases. But the coronavirus also has pushed roughly 41 million Americans out of work, and for them, even a small price hike can be troubling.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We’ve obviously seen this record increase in unemployment filings, and so there are more people who are at risk in that sense that they literally don’t have any employment to secure the money that they would need to buy the food that they traditionally purchase,” Malone said. “For the people who are already operating on the margins, these price increases are nontrivial.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>It's also a tough time for livestock farmers, who had hoped that after some down years, they would benefit from new trade deals and a strong domestic economy.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Farmers thought they saw the light at the end of tunnel,” Lusk said. “It turns out that it was the headlight of a train.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Check out more of the AP’s coronavirus coverage at \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak\">https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak\u003c/a> and \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak\">https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak\u003c/a>\u003c/p>","mediaCount":8,"shortId":"54f1efe0afa71b0a939fda91cf917366","localLinkUrl":"https://apnews.com/54f1efe0afa71b0a939fda91cf917366","interactiveLinkUrl":null,"downloadSettings":null,"interactiveLinkUrlText":null,"richEmbeds":[],"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:54f1efe0afa71b0a939fda91cf917366","media":[{"altText":null,"imageFileExtension":".jpeg","id":"aa5f53e74dc645f0b990fd40b0eefc64","videoRenderedSizes":[],"imageMimeType":"image/jpeg","externalId":null,"videoMimeType":null,"type":"Photo","imageRenderedSizes":[3000,2000,1000,800,600,400],"aspectRatio":1.4964070135096292,"gcsBaseUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/aa5f53e74dc645f0b990fd40b0eefc64/"}],"videoContext":"en getting essential ingredients is difficult.\u003c/p>","tagIds":["state-Iowa","apf-topnews","Iowa","UnderstandingtheOutbreak","apf-Health","apf-GeneralNews","apf-lifestyle","apf-business","Prices","VirusOutbreak","apf-usnews"],"hasTextOverlay":false,"bylines":"By DAVID PITT","leadPhotoId":"aa5f53e74dc645f0b990fd40b0eefc64"},{"embedHeight":null,"contentSponsor":null,"mediumIds":["1fd0f691259e457ca42a4dcecd93f69a","df15734a0b1c430c98d090b2fcc3124a","2655081dde1d4d1c87ecf138bd4bd5f9","3522ed929ab24ffc8bb003178a054c7f"],"title":"Religion-Twin Traumas","headline":"US faith leaders wrestle twin traumas in protests, virus","localMemberName":null,"updated":"2020-05-30 23:19:30","contentType":"text","layoutType":"Small Photo","tagObjs":[{"name":"George Floyd","id":"GeorgeFloyd","isPr":null,"order":0},{"name":"Ahmaud Arbery","id":"AhmaudArbery","isPr":null,"order":0},{"name":"Race and ethnicity","id":"Raceandethnicity","isPr":null,"order":0},{"name":"New York","id":"NewYork","isPr":null,"order":0},{"name":"Minneapolis","id":"Minneapolis","isPr":null,"order":0},{"name":"AP Top News","id":"apf-topnews","isPr":null,"order":10},{"name":"Virus Outbreak","id":"VirusOutbreak","isPr":null,"order":0},{"name":"General News","id":"apf-GeneralNews","isPr":false,"order":5}],"embedCaption":null,"gcsUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/contents/urn:publicid:ap.org:4cec64bad2e8e14aee8100172d8f03f9","embedLinkURL":null,"language":null,"leadVideoId":null,"firstWords":"\u003cp>NEW YORK (AP) — American religious leaders across faiths are grappling with the heavy burden of helping to heal two active traumas: rising civil unrest driven by the police killing of George Floyd...\u003c/p>","published":"2020-05-30 23:19:28","embedHTML":null,"sequenceNumber":null,"notificationId":null,"storyHTML":"\u003cp>NEW YORK (AP) — American religious leaders across faiths are grappling with the heavy burden of helping to heal two active traumas: rising civil unrest driven by the police killing of George Floyd and the coronavirus pandemic.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Christian, Jewish and Muslim leaders have raised their voices to condemn racial bias in the justice system while discouraging violence in response to the killing of Floyd, a black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee into his neck.

Hebda held a Friday online prayer service “for racial justice and peace\" alongside Rev. Erich Rutten, the priest of a historic African American parish in St. Paul. The Revs. Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton also traveled to Minneapolis on Thursday, with Jackson speaking at a local Baptist church. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Imam Asad Zaman, the Muslim American Society of Minnesota’s executive director, outlined multiple law enforcement reform proposals in response to Floyd’s death. Zaman noted in \u003ca href=\"https://www.startribune.com/to-end-pattern-of-violence-a-tangible-reform-agenda-is-needed/570848522/\">an op-ed\u003c/a> this week that “the Qur’an teaches us that to save a single life is to save all of humanity.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>But as the frustration sparked by Floyd’s killing scorched dozens of other cities, religious denominations nationwide began speaking out to sympathize with the pain that brought protesters into the streets. White Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin has been charged with murder in connection with Floyd’s death, which follows the highly-publicized killings of two black Americans this year -- Georgian Ahmaud Arbery, shot while running, and Breonna Taylor, shot by police in her Louisville, Kentucky home.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Seven senior members of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops issued a statement calling racism “not a thing of the past or simply a throwaway political issue,\" adding: “While it is expected that we will plead for peaceful non-violent protests, and we certainly do, we also stand in passionate support of communities that are understandably outraged.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>The National Association of Evangelicals rooted \u003ca href=\"https://www.nae.net/nae-addresses-racial-turmoil-calls-for-action/\"> its call\u003c/a> for racial equality in the Bible, while Southern Baptist leaders \u003ca href=\"http://bpnews.net/54877/southern-baptist-leaders-issue-joint-statement-on-the-death-of-george-floyd\">released a statement\u003c/a> noting Biblical teachings against “injustice and the misuse of authority and force.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>One pastor planning to reopen his church for in-person worship this week, amid ongoing tension over the public health risk of physical services, said the protests show communities have a strong need for religious institutions during a time of crisis. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“I think the church is essential, and I think people need church in America, and the church has got to stand against social injustice,” said Danny Carroll, of Water of Life Community Church in Fontana, California. \u003c/p>\u003cp>For Rev. Jacqui Lewis, whose church plans to keep forgoing in-person worship as the pandemic goes on, spiritual comfort and social organizing can happen just as effectively online. Lewis, senior minister at New York City’s Middle Collegiate Church, urged other faith leaders to respond to Floyd’s killing by taking their sympathy from words to actions.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Grief is not enough. Prayer is not enough,“ Lewis said. “It’s a baby, first step for denominations to decry the violence. The next step is, what will you do to make sure your congregations are not racist?”\u003c/p>\u003cp>This week’s protests against racial injustice came as interfaith leaders prepared to mark a national day of mourning and lament for those killed by the coronavirus on Monday, an effort backed by the U.S. Conference of Mayors. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Sen. Chris Coons, D-Delaware, part of an accompanying bipartisan congressional proposal for a civic moment of silence, said the effort to honor the dead would “show the best of what faith means in America.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The demonstrations also erupted just ahead of the Christian holy day of Pentecost and the Jewish holiday of Shavuot, both celebrated at a set time after previous holy days in the faiths. That count imbued this holy day with a more solemn meaning for Rabbi Rick Jacobs, president of the Union for Reform Judaism.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Just as Jews have counted the days between Passover and Shavuot, Jacobs said, they have been “counting the dead from COVID-19, and sadly, tragically, we’re counting more black people killed in our country at the hands of law enforcement.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We could treat all of these things as separate … but I do think there’s an intersection” given the pandemic’s outsized effect on communities already struggling with racism, he added. \u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Giovanna Dell’Orto contributed for AP from St. Paul/Minneapolis. \u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Associated Press religion coverage receives support from the Lilly Endowment through the Religion News Foundation.

Tom Wolf signed a disaster emergency declaration to assist cities. The declaration authorizes the adjutant general of the state National Guard and the Pennsylvania State Police Commissioner to activate personnel.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Peaceful protests earlier were touching shows of our collective grief,” Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney said Saturday night, just as the city's curfew hit. “But the anger being displayed this afternoon cannot and will not continue.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>In Pittsburgh, public safety officials said multiple officers were injured and three journalists were attacked or injured by protesters. The injuries weren't serious, police said. Officials urged people to avoid downtown, where a police vehicle was torched earlier, as demonstrations continued into the evening. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Earlier Saturday, a crowd gathered at Philadelphia's City Hall, kneeling for more than eight minutes in honor of Floyd, a black man who died after a white officer pressed a knee into his neck for several minutes.

Rizzo, mayor from 1972 to 1980, was praised by supporters as tough on crime but accused by critics of discriminating against minorities. His 10-foot-tall (3-meter-tall) bronze statue outside the Municipal Services Building, across from City Hall, has been defaced before and is to be moved next year.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Outlaw said that at least nine separate fires were set in the city, to both police cars and structures.

Police reported that the crowd near the PPG Arena was mostly peaceful but a group “overtook and destroyed” a marked police vehicle. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Protesters later smashed a glass business front and were dispersed with gas, police said. Pittsburgh Public Safety later reported more business fronts broken out in the downtown area “and protests are entering businesses.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>Wendell Hissrich, the city's public safety director, said there is “extensive” damage downtown.

blue house where Edgar Silva had spent two feverish days gasping for air before drawing his last breath on May 12.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It wasn’t COVID,” Silva’s daughter, Eliete das Graças insisted to

But in the absence of evidence proving otherwise, relatives like das Graças are quick to deny the possibility that COVID-19 claimed their loved ones, meaning that the toll is likely a vast undercount.\u003c/p>\u003cp>As ambulances zip through Manaus with sirens blaring and backhoes dig rows of new graves, the muggy air in this city by the majestic Amazon River feels thicker than usual with such pervasive denial. Manaus has seen nearly triple the usual number of dead in April and May.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Doctors and psychologists say denial at the grassroots stems from a mixture of misinformation, lack of education, insufficient testing and conflicting messages from the country’s leaders.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Chief among skeptics is President Jair Bolsonaro, who has repeatedly called COVID-19 a “little flu,” and argued that concern over the virus is overblown.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Asked by a reporter about the surging number of deaths on April 20, Bolsonaro responded, “I’m not a gravedigger, OK?” \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"3de022fe2bbd4ea7a607b8d1756e84f6\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>He has resisted U.S. and European-style lockdowns to contain the virus’ spread, saying such measures aren’t worth the economic wreckage. He fired his first Health Minister for supporting quarantines, accepted the resignation of a second one after less than a month on the job, and said that the interim minister, an army general with no background in health or medicine, will remain in charge of the pandemic response “for a long time.” In a cabinet meeting last month, a visibly enraged Bolsonaro insulted governors and mayors enforcing stay-at-home measures. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The president’s political followers are receptive to his dismissal of the virus, as determined as he is to proceed with life as usual.\u003c/p>\u003cp>On a recent Saturday in Manaus, locals flocked to the bustling riverside market to buy fresh fish, unaware of the need for social distancing, or uninterested. As swamped intensive-care units struggled to accommodate new patients airlifted from the Amazon, the faithful returned to some of the city’s evangelical churches. Coffins arriving by riverboat did nothing to dampen the enthusiasm of young people at clandestine dance parties. And in the streets, masks frequently covered chins and foreheads rather than mouths and noses.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"4433c0fbaf69458d86c5cc32ef137238\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms. But for some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause severe illness such as pneumonia and lead to death. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The new sickness made its way to Manaus in March, in the middle of the rainy season. At least that's when health officials first became aware of it in the capital of Amazonas state, which is at once remote and international. One precarious road connects the city to the rest of Brazil, and other municipalities are hours away by boat. But tropical fauna and flora normally draw tourist cruises up the Amazon, and business people fly in from around the world, to visit its free trade zone. Just last October, Manaus sent a delegation to China looking for investors.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The city's first virus fatality was reported on March 25 and deaths have surged since then. But due to a lack of testing, just 5% of the more than 4,300 burials performed in April and May were confirmed cases of COVID-19, according to city funeral statistics.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"3aa143c464d04b5abef9f870036589de\">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"c55753f4f9234c7fada81884c66b8705\">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"b3a7829020164778ac7529b61911ef38\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>To accommodate its swelling number of coffins, the public Nossa Senhora Aparecida cemetery razed an area of tropical forest to dig dozens of trenches in the rust-colored soil for burials.\u003c/p>\u003cp>These mass graves sparked anger toward city officials among families of the deceased. Why did their loved ones’ bodies have to be buried in such a way, they asked, if there was no evidence the deaths were caused by COVID-19?\u003c/p>\u003cp>Das Graças was among those who had hoped that her father could have a proper sendoff. But it wasn’t to be. The white-suited men informed her that his coffin would be sealed, a precaution taken now regardless of cause of death. He would be sent to the public cemetery’s refrigerated container to await burial.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“A person can’t even die with dignity,” das Graças, 49, said through tears. “He’s going to spend the night in the freezer when we could be doing his wake at home!”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"hub-link-embed\" id=\"afs:Content:8973490144\">Full Coverage:Photography\u003c/div>\u003cp>Home wakes are no longer permitted.

Ambulance doctor Sandokan Costa said patients often omit the mention of COVID-19 symptoms, putting him and his colleagues at greater risk. “What has most struck me is people’s belief that the pandemic isn’t real.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Costa fell ill with the virus in late March but has worked non-stop since recovering and is astonished to see his fellow citizens on the streets acting as though nothing is going on. There is a stigma attached to the new disease, he said. “Coronavirus has become something pejorative.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"bea49dd1195c45989cc8429d3dd3856b\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Health care officials attribute much of that to Bolsonaro’s handling of the pandemic.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Rather than take precautions, Bolsonaro has supported the use of chloroquine, the predecessor of an anti-malaria drug that U.S. President Donald Trump has advocated for treatment of coronavirus and is taking himself to ward it off. Bolsonaro ordered the Army’s Chemical and Pharmaceutical Laboratory to boost its chloroquine production despite a lack of clinical proof that it is effective. A large study recently published in the Lancet medical journal suggests that the malaria drugs not only do not help but are also tied to a greater risk of death in coronavirus patients. \u003c/p>\u003cp>In Manaus, scientists stopped part of a study of chloroquine after heart rhythm problems developed in a quarter of people given the higher of two doses being tested.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Visiting the hard-hit Amazon capital was a priority for Bolsonaro’s second health minister, Nelson Teich, who donned a body suit to tour several hospitals. But he resigned days later after disagreeing with the president's demand that the ministry recommend chloroquine be prescribed to patients with mild coronavirus symptoms. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"4771e4c27a604aaea98cb53eb79add5a\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Amazonas Gov. Wilson Lima, a Bolsonaro ally, downplayed the virus at first. “There’s huge hysteria and panic,” Lima said March 16, three days after the first virus case in Manaus was confirmed in a woman who had traveled from Europe. That same day he declared a state of emergency, but his first measures were limited—cancellation of events organized by the state, suspension of classes and prison visits. For the rest, he recommended avoiding crowds and good hand washing.\u003c/p>\u003cp>It was only on March 23, when his state had 32 cases including local transmissions that he ordered the suspension of non-essential services. But the restrictions were never imposed on the city’s industrial zone.\u003c/p>\u003cp>A month later, hospitals in Manaus were overwhelmed with thousands of cases and hundreds of dead.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In late-April the governor announced plans to progressively reopen commerce, but backed down as the death toll continued to climb. This month, he told the Associated Press in an interview that the unusual surge in deaths can only be explained by the outbreak. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“There’s no doubt that the majority (have died) because of COVID-19,” Gov. Lima said as he sat in a vast but empty meeting room in the state government headquarters in Manaus. “We don't have any other explanation for this if not COVID.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>He admitted lack of testing makes it nearly impossible to have a clear idea how many people in the state are infected. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"15a86643f79d4a5096fb442f9591bb3a\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>But even with vast under-reporting, Amazonas state has the highest number of deaths by COVID-19 per capita in the country with more than 1,700 fatal victims.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Poor and crowded neighborhoods have been particularly affected. Unable to afford private consultations and fearing the chaos of the public health system, many only sought medical help when it was too late. Others preferred to die at home rather than alone at a hospital.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Lima’s administration has come under fire for spending half a million dollars (2.9 million Brazilian reais) to buy 28 ventilators at quadruple the market price from a wine importer and distributor. The breathing machines were deemed inadequate for use on coronavirus patients after inspections by the regional council of medicine and Manaus' health surveillance office.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Lima denies any wrongdoing. Asked if he would have done anything differently to confront the virus, the governor shook his head.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Even if I had stopped it (economy), if I had closed the city for 30 days, no one goes in and no one goes out. At some point I would have had to open and at some point the virus would have gotten here,” he said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The virus has, in the meantime, spread upriver from Manaus, creeping into remote towns and indigenous territories to infect indigenous tribes. The sparsely populated but vast rainforest region is completely unprepared to cope. Some towns can’t get oxygen tanks refilled or don’t have breathing machines, forcing nurses to manually pump air into lungs. When they do have machines, power cuts frequently shut them down.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"a55c766383aa47b1ae92a6fc6c43c9f6\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Many patients are being airlifted to Manaus, the only place in the state of 4 million people with full intensive care units.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Although health experts warn that the pandemic is far from over in the Amazon region, or the rest of the country, national polls show adherence to lockdowns and quarantines falling, and a growing number of Brazilians are neglecting local leaders’ safety recommendations.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Every day there are different messages coming from the federal government that clash with measures by the cities and states, and with what science says” said Manaus-based physician Adele Benzaken.\u003c/p>\u003cp>A public health researcher who until last year lead the HIV/AIDS department at the Health Ministry, Benzaken already has lost four colleagues in the pandemic. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Meanwhile, misinformation and disinformation about the virus is swirling, some of it shared by the president himself. On May 11, Instagram labeled one of his posts as fake news after he falsely claimed a state had seen a drop in respiratory disease this year. Facebook also blocked one of his posts in March that showed him praising the healing powers of chloroquine to supporters. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"e32c71e6f2ba4b5ab1413919144222f5\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>One false claim circulating on social media said the death rate in Manaus plummeted the day after the health minister’s visit. Another purported to show an empty coffin being unearthed at Manaus’ cemetery, implying the city was inflating its death toll. But the photo was taken in Sao Paulo three years ago. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Still, the messages take root and spread like jungle foliage.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“My opinion is that they’re making this up and trying to make money from it” Israel Reis, 54, said outside Manaus’ fish market. He didn’t specify who “they” might be. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Reis, who recently lost his job in an electronics maintenance company due to the pandemic, spoke without a mask and said he “of course” agrees with Bolsonaro the severity of the pandemic is exaggerated and death toll inflated. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"c55de745bb484a0cad8048f2336122d3\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>He recently advised his nephew against seeking help at the local health clinic for an earache. “Any dizziness and they’ll say it’s that thing,” he said, referring to the virus. \u003c/p>\u003cp>One recent late afternoon, a group of paunchy middle-aged men seated in plastic chairs on the sidewalk debated measures to fight the virus. The street bar, just a few blocks from a police station in downtown Manaus, was operating in violation of state COVID-19 restrictions, yet officers in a passing squad car didn’t even slow down to reprimand them. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Icy beer provided relief from the sweltering heat, and tropical insects had begun sounding their pre-dusk drone. The men, too, were getting worked up. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“Put on your mask!” yelled one friend.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I don’t need one!” screamed another, Henrique Noronha. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Noronha, 52, argued that only the elderly and those with health problems should stay home – as Bolsonaro affirms -- and the fit should return to normal. Despite his age and full figure, Noronha didn't believe he’s at risk. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“This virus came to clean things up,” he said. “But I’ll be fine.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"e31cbd53caae423699e053dc0f4e168a\">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"9c7ce265d0df44329dbffdeb334e4d13\">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"3fb0650d7e9f4f868321c5647b48e018\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>AP writer David Biller contributed reporting from Rio de Janeiro.

This month, pandemic politics shadowed \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/eed5031c4908f195ac4a4c5e27dc3dd9\">Trump’s trip to Michigan as he toured a factory making lifesaving medical devices.\u003c/a> He did not publicly wear a face covering despite a warning from the state’s top law enforcement officer that refusing to do so might lead to a ban on his return.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/63bc4cbe662c1fe67878952209d737f4\">Presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden, meanwhile, wore a mask along with his wife, Jill,\u003c/a> as they laid a wreath Monday at a Delaware veterans’ memorial — his first public appearance since mid-March. Trump later retweeted Fox News analyst Brit Hume’s criticism of Biden for wearing a mask in public.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/339c62ee35d5acbc7bcd762ce9dc6005\">Vice President Mike Pence was criticized for not wearing a mask \u003c/a> while on a visit to the Mayo Clinic.\u003c/p>\u003cp>NETANYAHU’S PASSOVER HOLIDAY\u003c/p>\u003cp>While the rest of \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/262adb646d8515f2ec987228c317c064\">Israel was instructed not to gather with their extended families for traditional Passover Seder\u003c/a> in April, Netanyahu and President Reuven Rivlin hosted their adult children for the festive holiday meal, drawing fierce criticism on social media. Israeli television showed a photo of Avner Netanyahu, the premier’s younger son, attending the Seder at his father's official residence. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Benjamin Netanyahu later apologized in a televised address, saying he should have adhered more closely to the regulations. \u003c/p>\u003cp>THE FRENCH EXCEPTION\u003c/p>\u003cp>French President Emmanuel Macron also has been inconsistent with masks, leaving the French public confused. Although \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/fe461ecbffacb67c747a3234300c90de\">Macron has sometimes appeared in a mask for visits at hospitals and schools\u003c/a>, it's a different story in the Elysee presidential palace and for speeches. During a visit to a Paris hospital on May 15, Macron initially wore a mask to chat with doctors but then removed it to talk with union workers. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Interior Minister Christophe Castaner also faced criticism this month for huddling with dozens of mask-makers in a factory for a photo where everyone removed their masks. \u003c/p>\u003cp>PUTIN’S DIFFERENT APPROACH\u003c/p>\u003cp>The only time Russian President Vladimir Putin wore protective gear in public was on March 24, when \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/04e2df3928cd82fb385114685f14c373\">he visited a top coronavirus hospital in Moscow. \u003c/a> Before donning a hazmat suit, Putin shook hands with Dr. Denis Protsenko, the head of the hospital. Neither wore masks or gloves, and a week later, Protsenko tested positive for the virus. That raised questions about Putin’s health, but the Kremlin said he was fine.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Putin has since held at least seven face-to-face meetings, according to the Kremlin website. He and others didn’t wear masks during those meetings, and Putin also didn’t cover his face for events marking Nazi Germany’s defeat in World War II.\u003c/p>\u003cp>When asked why Putin doesn’t wear a mask during public appearances, spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the Kremlin has a different approach to protecting the president’s health.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“When it comes to public events, we ask medical workers to test all the participants in advance,” Peskov told reporters. \u003c/p>\u003cp>PUERTO RICO OFFICIAL’S INCONSISTENT MESSAGE\u003c/p>\u003cp>Puerto Rico Gov. Wanda Vázquez was criticized for not always wearing a mask despite holding new conferences ordering people to cover their face outside their homes and inside businesses. A member of the opposition Popular Democratic Party also filed a police complaint last week against members of Vázquez’s New Progressive Party, alleging they violated a curfew by gathering to inaugurate the party’s new headquarters. Police are investigating the incident, which angered many Puerto Ricans. \u003c/p>\u003cp>SCOTTISH MEDICAL OFFICIAL TAKES THE LOW ROAD\u003c/p>\u003cp>Scotland’s chief medical officer, Dr. Catherine Calderwood, broke her own rules and traveled to her second home during lockdown in April.

She apologized and resigned.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I did not follow the advice I’m giving to others,” Calderwood said. “I am truly sorry for that.

Japan didn’t enforce a stay-at-home recommendation, but his case outraged the public because many were following social distancing measures. \u003c/p>\u003cp>ITALIAN PRESS CONFERENCE CRITICISM\u003c/p>\u003cp>At a March news conference to open a COVID-19 field hospital in Milan’s old convention center, photographers and video journalists were pushed into corners that did not allow proper spacing. Only text reporters were given seating in line with regulations. The Codacons consumer protection group announced it would file a complaint with prosecutors in Milan.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“What should have been a moment of great happiness and pride for Lombardy and Italy was transformed into a surreal event, where in violation of the anti-gathering rules, groups of crowds formed,’’ Codacons said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>SOUTH AFRICA’S RULE-BREAKING DINNER\u003c/p>\u003cp>In April, Communications Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams was placed on special leave for two months and forced to apologize by President Cyril Ramaphosa after she violated stay-at-home regulations. Ramaphosa directed police to investigate after a photo emerged on social media of Ndabeni-Abrahams and several others having a meal at the home of former deputy minister of higher education Mduduzi Manana.\u003c/p>\u003cp>SPANISH HOSPITAL CEREMONY INVESTIGATED\u003c/p>\u003cp>Madrid’s regional and city officials sparked controversy when they gathered on May 1 for a ceremony shuttering a massive field hospital at a convention center. Eager to appear in the final photo of a facility credited with treating nearly 4,000 mild COVID-19 patients, dozens of officials didn't follow social distancing rules. Spain’s restrictions banned more than 10 people at events like the one that honored nurses and doctors. The central government opened an investigation, and Madrid regional chief Isabel Díaz Ayuso apologized. She said officials “got carried away by the uniqueness of the moment.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Former Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy also defied strict stay-at-home orders, with a television station filming him power walking around in northern Madrid. The Spanish prosecutor’s office is investigating whether Rajoy, who was premier from 2011 to 2018, should be fined.\u003c/p>\u003cp>INDIAN CRICKET GAME CRITICIZED\u003c/p>\u003cp>In India, a top leader of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party drew flak last weekend after playing a game of cricket. Manoj Tiwari, also a member of India’s parliament, said he followed social distancing rules during the game. Videos circulating on social media showed Tiwati without a mask. He was also seen taking selfies with people. \u003c/p>\u003cp>LEADERS WHO FOLLOW THE RULES\u003c/p>\u003cp>Some leaders are setting a good example, including Portuguese President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa. Media jokingly called him the most relaxed politician in the world after he was photographed queuing at a supermarket this month, wearing a mask and following social distancing measures. The photo was widely shared on social media. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Another rule-follower is Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, who did not visit his ill 96-year-old mother in a nursing home during the last eight weeks of her life because of coronavirus restrictions. He only came to her bedside during her final hours this month. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“The prime minister has respected all guidelines,” according to a statement read by a spokesman. “The guidelines allow for family to say goodbye to dying family members in the final stage.

The UFC used minimal personnel to stage the fight, and the promotion said everyone involved was subject to strict health and safety protocols.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The 33-year-old Burns (19-3) dominated on his feet and on the ground, finishing his first main-event bout with likely the biggest win of his career and his sixth consecutive victory since July 2018, including four straight since moving back up to welterweight.\u003c/p>\u003cp>From a first-round knockdown to a strong finish, the Florida-based Brazilian soundly defeated one of the most accomplished welterweights in UFC history and made his case for a shot at champion Kamaru Usman, who happens to be his training partner.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I trained so hard for this fight, and I knew I could do it,” said Burns, who entered the bout ranked sixth in the crowded 170-pound division. “I was calling these guys out for a reason. I’m coming to stay. That was a former champion right there. You saw a dominant performance against a former champion. I’m ready. I feel so good right now.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The judges all gave all five rounds to Burns, scoring it 50-45, 50-44 and 50-44. Burns called out Usman in his post-fight interview.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I love the champ, my training partner,” Burns said. “But come on, give me a shot. A lot of respect, a lot of love for you, but I think I'm next. ... If they want to make a fight in July, come on. I don't have a scratch.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>Burns came out with furious energy against Woodley, dropping the ex-champ in the opening seconds and gaining full mount. A gaping cut opened in Woodley's left eyebrow in the opening minutes, and Burns again overcame Woodley's famously strong takedown defense to drop Woodley again in the second round.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Woodley (19-5-1) hadn't fought since losing his title in a one-sided thrashing from Usman in March 2019. Woodley had reigned atop the division for nearly three years, and the 38-year-old University of Missouri graduate said he dealt with depression while debating whether to stay in MMA or to pursue a music career.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Burns' victory capped an entertaining show at the Apex, where the octagon is only 25 feet in diameter, compared to 30 feet in most competitive cages. The compact dimensions typically lead to more aggressive fighting, and this card featured six finishes in its 11 bouts.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Burns was fighting in a fan-free arena for the second time in 2 1/2 months. He stopped veteran Demian Maia in Brasilia on March 14 in the UFC’s final show before it halted competition.\u003c/p>\u003cp>After an eight-week break, the UFC returned to competition earlier this month with three shows over eight days in Jacksonville, Florida. With ambitions to hold near-weekly cards throughout the summer as part of its expansive broadcast deal with ESPN, the promotion relocated its operations to its own facilities after the Nevada Athletic Commission agreed three days ago to allow the return of combat sports.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Although this card was fairly light on star power, the promotion will stage UFC 250 next Saturday night from the same gym. Two-division champion Amanda Nunes' featherweight title defense against Canada's Felicia Spencer headlines the pay-per-view card.\u003c/p>\u003cp>UFC President Dana White continues to promise additional shows this summer from the so-called “Fight Island,” an undisclosed private isle where the promotion intends to host bouts between fighters who can't enter the U.S. due to health restrictions.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Sakai (15-1-1) remained unbeaten in the UFC with his fourth straight victory when two judges favored him 29-28 after a lively bout with Ivanov (18-4), who was up 30-27 on the third judge's card.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Sakai escaped punishment from referee Jason Herzog in the third round when he blatantly grabbed the chain-link wall of the cage while attempting to avoid a takedown attempt by Ivanov.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Grabbing the cage is illegal and punishable by a point deduction, but Herzog merely warned Sakai verbally. The decision was met with audible disbelief by Daniel Cormier, the former UFC heavyweight champion working in the quiet arena as a color commentator.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Strawweight contender Mackenzie Dern opened the main card by finishing Hannah Cifers with a knee bar that was the first leg-lock submission victory by a woman in UFC history.

The count includes only teams cut with the coronavirus outbreak and its impacts cited as all or part of the reason.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Of the 78 teams lost in Divisions II and III and the NAIA, 44 were from three schools that closed at least in part because of financial fallout from the pandemic. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>No Power Five conference school is known to have dropped any sports.

This, he said, is especially important at a time when enrollment declines are accelerating as budget woes hit higher education.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Akron athletic director Larry Williams was ordered to chop 23%, or $4.4 million, from his budget. Akron depends on student fees for 40% of its athletic budget and enrollment is expected to be down 20% this fall. The school dropped men’s cross country and golf and women’s tennis two weeks ago, and there will be other spending and staff reductions.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Williams noted the accounting system used by his and other universities often consider the athletic department a cost center and revenue is generally not considered.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“So we in athletics don’t get credit for any of those tuitions that are paid by the walk-ons. The university does,” Williams said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Williams said deep cuts to football would not be a good idea for Bowl Subdivision schools because the sport typically supports the rest of the athletic department. Akron, for example, draws revenue from the Mid-American Conference’s television contract, guarantees for playing nonconference road games, ticket sales, sponsorships and donations.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>David Ridpath, associate professor in Ohio University's Sports Administration program and president of the Drake Group, a nonprofit that advocates for academic integrity and athlete welfare, said the pandemic marks a tipping point for college sports.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“There is a ton of fat to cut before you get to dropping teams,” he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Ridpath said he would start with football, suggesting there are too many coaches and staff members on D-I teams. He also said there should be more regional scheduling for all sports to save travel costs and that a school should have the flexibility to play football at the Division I level but play tennis, golf and other non-revenue sports at Division III, where there are no athletic scholarships.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Big 12 Commissioner Bob Bowlsby said he worries about schools cutting Olympic sports. A former member of the U.S. Olympic Committee, he said colleges play a big role in the development of international-level athletes.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“There are only 17 men’s gymnastics programs in the country,” he said. \"If those go away, our Olympic efforts in men’s gymnastics will be devastated. Similarly, with different numbers, the same is true with women’s gymnastics and swimming, wrestling and a whole array of other things like water polo.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Broad-based programming is easy to talk about and expensive to do,\" he added. \"But all of our programs will poorer for not having those student-athletes around. It’s short-sighted to view discontinuation of sports as an extremely high priority and viable way to save money.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Small colleges have long used sports as an enrollment driver, and Staben said the model can work for larger schools. \u003c/p>\u003cp>As Idaho’s president from 2014-19, Staben thwarted a plan to drop three sports two years ago. Eliminating women’s swimming and soccer and men’s golf would have trimmed $1 million.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Staben said he did a study analyzing the revenue derived from tuition-paying athletes in those and other partial-scholarship sports and found they represented a net gain for the university — even though that didn’t show on the athletic department ledger.

As I have watched the events unfold in the days following the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, a city where I coached and once called home, I see how many people continue to feel those same feelings -- helpless, frustrated, invisible, angry.

I have seen things, I have lived, but this is a new level, this is a new monster and to top it all, it is invisible,” Martin told The Associated Press in a recent interview via Zoom. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“I spent two weeks with a poker face so my family wouldn't be affected, but finally I was able to raise my head and say ‘eh, something very good has to come out of this, get creative.’ And I started making music and it was my medicine, honestly, because I really felt like I was gasping for air,” he said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The result is “Pausa,” a surprise EP “with a lot of introspection” released Thursday, featuring four new songs that evoke romance, and at times, sadness. It includes collaborations by Sting (singing in Spanish,) Carla Morrison, Diego El Cigala and Pedro Capó, as well as the previously released singles “Cántalo,” with Residente and Bad Bunny, and “Tiburones.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>It is the first part of a bigger project that will follow with “Play” — hence his use of the hashtag #PausaPlay in social media. The initial idea was to release a whole album that he had previously been working on for months, but Martin felt that the rhythms were not the most appropriate for the moment. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“I said, ‘Sony, lets divide the album in two. Let's start now a little calmer and bring in the party afterward’,” he said. “What I am presenting, these four songs, are little magical things that happened during the quarantine, like calling Sting, like talking to Carla Morrison.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>The new songs are “Simple,” with Sting; “Recuerdo,” with Mexican indie-pop singer-songwriter Morrison; “Cae de una,” with Puerto Rican Capó, and “Quiéreme,” with flamenco singer Diego El Cigala. Each embraces the style of the guest. Martin says he got out of his comfort zone “a little” — such as with Flamenco style vocals — but still manages to achieve a natural sound. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The songs were recorded with the artists in London, Paris, Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, with the help of sound engineer Enrique Larreal in New York.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“My engineer was able to create a system where everyone — my producer in Miami, me in L.A. — had a sharp, immaculate audiovisual experience. I can be recording and literally see in my laptop the movement he is making in his console table in New York,” Martin said. “What did he do? What did he invent? Well, he's already receiving calls because there's a lot of curiosity.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Martin has been in lockdown with his husband, Jwan Yosef, his four children and his mother, who had come to Los Angeles earlier to care for her grandchildren while the singer was supposed to tour.

DEATHS\u003c/p>\u003cp>TRUMP: “For all of the political hacks out there, if I hadn’t done my job well, &amp; early, we would have lost 1 1/2 to 2 Million People, as opposed to the 100,000 plus that looks like will be the number.” — tweet Tuesday, before the toll of known deaths passed 100,000.\u003c/p>\u003cp>THE FACTS: This opinion comes from his ego, not science, and evades the fact that the U.S. has experienced far more known sickness and death from COVID-19 than any other country. Well-documented \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/d7cb8610b50a2e79ce1a72929f23f02b\">failures in U.S. testing \u003c/a> and gaps in containment in the crucial early weeks contributed to the severity of the crisis.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Early in the U.S. outbreak, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the death toll could have reached or exceeded 2 million if no steps had been taken to contain the disease. That is to say, if public health authorities, governors, mayors, the president and the public did nothing. \u003c/p>\u003cp>A do-nothing course was never an option and federal officials never forecast such an outlier death toll.

Either the very weak Radical Left Mayor, Jacob Frey, get his act together and bring the City under control, or I will send in the National Guard &amp; get the job done right. ... Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts.\" — tweets Friday.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>THE FACTS: His vow to send in the National Guard skirts vital context, though that's not the larger issue here.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Minnesota's governor already had activated the state's National Guard in response \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/e27cfce9464809aa8c91afd74c930bb5\">to the chaos\u003c/a>. Trump was unclear on whether he intended to have the federal government tap National Guard personnel in other states for the purpose of law enforcement in Minnesota.\u003c/p>\u003cp>U.S. law prohibits federal use of the National Guard or active-duty troops for domestic law enforcement. That prohibition can be overidden only in extreme circumstances. The Pentagon on Friday took the rare step of ordering the Army to put several active-duty U.S. military police units on the ready to deploy to Minneapolis if called.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The larger issue was Trump's comment that “when the looting starts, the shooting starts.\" That phrase from the violent front lines of the civil rights era evokes a brutal, hair-trigger police response and could be taken to mean Trump was threatening to have looters shot. Trump said later that is not what he meant and that he was not familiar with the origins of the phrase.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Twitter said the tweet's closing line “violates our policies regarding the glorification of violence based on the historical context\" and \"could inspire similar actions today.” People had to click on the warning to access the hidden tweet. When Trump's tweet was repeated on the White House account instead of his own, Twitter flagged it similarly.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump said later he did not mean his comment as a threat but as an observation that looting tends to lead to people being shot. “I don’t want this to happen,” he tweeted.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The protests were sparked by the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white police officer kneeled on his neck.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>VOTING FRAUD\u003c/p>\u003cp>TRUMP: “So ridiculous to see Twitter trying to make the case that Mail-In Ballots are not subject to FRAUD. How stupid, there are examples, &amp; cases, all over the place. Our election process will become badly tainted &amp; a laughingstock all over the World.” — tweet Thursday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>TRUMP: “There is NO WAY (ZERO!) that Mail-In Ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent. Mail boxes will be robbed, ballots will be forged &amp; even illegally printed out &amp; fraudulently signed.” — tweet Tuesday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>THE FACTS: No, there aren't examples and cases “all over the place.” Voting fraud is rare.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Two Trump tweets prompted Twitter to take the extraordinary step of attaching fact-checking notices, infuriating the president.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump appointed a commission after the 2016 election to get to the bottom of his persistent theory that voting fraud is rampant. But the bottom fell out. The panel disbanded without producing any findings.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Some election studies have reported a higher incidence of mail-in voting fraud compared with in-person voting, but the overall risk is all but imperceptible. The Brennan Center for Justice \u003ca href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/debunking-voter-fraud-myth\">said in 2017\u003c/a> the risk of voting fraud is 0.00004% to 0.0009%.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Trump is simply wrong about mail-in balloting raising a ‘tremendous’ potential for fraud,” Richard L. Hasen, an elections expert at the University of California, Irvine School of Law, recently wrote in an op-ed. “While certain pockets of the country have seen their share of absentee-ballot scandals, problems are extremely rare in the five states that rely primarily on vote-by-mail, including the heavily Republican state of Utah.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump’s push for in-person voting also runs counter to CDC guidance urging Americans to avoid crowds and keep 6 feet (1.8 meters) apart. The federal guidelines “encourage mail-in methods of voting if allowed in the jurisdiction,” given the coronavirus threat. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump himself voted by mail in the Florida Republican primary in March.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>TRUMP: “The Governor of California is sending Ballots to millions of people, anyone ... living in the state, no matter who they are or how they got there, will get one. ...This will be a Rigged Election. No way!” — tweet Tuesday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>THE FACTS: Not true that Californians are getting ballots regardless of who they are. Only registered voters in California will receive ballots.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>INSULIN\u003c/p>\u003cp>TRUMP, wondering about taking insulin even though he’s not diabetic: “I don’t use insulin. Should I be? Huh? I never thought about it. But I know a lot of people are very — very badly affected, right? Unbelievable.” — remarks Tuesday at Medicare event.\u003c/p>\u003cp>THE FACTS: To be clear, taking insulin if you’re non-diabetic can kill you.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In people with diabetes, the pancreas cannot make insulin so they often require several doses a day. But that same insulin if taken in overdose or by non-diabetics can lead to hypoglycemic coma, which can have varied outcomes from confusion and dizziness to death.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Prodded by the president to speak to the wisdom of taking insulin when non-diabetic, Surgeon General Jerome Adams gently corrected him. He told Trump his body makes all the insulin it needs.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump stopped musing about the idea after that except to say he thought he'd asked \"a very good question, actually.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>SCARBOROUGH\u003c/p>\u003cp>TRUMP: “A lot of interest in this story about Psycho Joe Scarborough. So a young marathon runner just happened to faint in his office, hit her head on his desk, &amp; die? I would think there is a lot more to this story than that?” — tweet Sunday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>TRUMP: “So many unanswered &amp; obvious questions, but I won’t bring them up now! Law enforcement eventually will?” — tweet Tuesday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>THE FACTS: He's spreading a groundless conspiracy theory about MSNBC host Joe Scarborough, a former Republican congressman from Florida, and a woman who had worked on his staff decades ago. There are no “unanswered” questions after an autopsy report ruled the 2001 death accidental, despite Trump's dark musings.\u003c/p>\u003cp>After Lori Klausutis was found dead in Scarborough’s Fort Walton Beach congressional office, an autopsy revealed she had an undiagnosed heart condition and a coroner concluded she passed out and hit her head as she fell.

The FBI opened the investigation based on entirely different information: that a Trump campaign aide was said to have learned that Russia had dirt on Trump opponent Hillary Clinton. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The dossier contained unsubstantiated accounts of Trump's personal behavior. It did factor into applications the FBI submitted to conduct surveillance on a different campaign aide, Carter Page, but it is not the case that the dossier sparked the Russia investigation.\u003c/p>\u003cp>More broadly, McEnany was pushing an unsupported conspiracy theory that the FBI investigation was tainted with partisan bias and hatched by Democrats.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>DRUG PRICES\u003c/p>\u003cp>TRUMP: “In the past, Obamacare prevented insurance providers from competing to offer lower costs for seniors. There was no competition, there was no anything, and they ran away with what took place, and the seniors were horribly hurt.” — Medicare event Tuesday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>THE FACTS: President Barack Obama's health law actually reduced out-of-pocket prescription costs for older people. And it did not prevent insurers from competing to offer lower costs.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The law reduced what older people had to pay back then by gradually closing the “doughnut hole,” a notorious coverage gap in Medicare’s popular “Part D” prescription drug plan.\u003c/p>\u003cp>A 50% discount that Obamacare secured from drug makers on brand name medicines yielded an average savings of $581 in 2011 for older people with high drug costs, according to an analysis at the time by Medicare’s nonpartisan Office of the Actuary, for The Associated Press.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The law also directed Medicare to pick up more of the cost of generic drugs, saving an additional $22. \u003c/p>\u003cp>On Tuesday, Trump announced that next year most older people will have access to prescription plans that limit monthly copays for insulin to $35, for an average savings of $446 annually. \u003c/p>\u003cp>By tackling the coverage gap, Obamacare helped Medicare recipients with high drug costs generally, not only patients who must take insulin to manage their diabetes.\u003c/p>\u003cp>On the claim that Obamacare stifled insurer competition, there's no evidence of that.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Given the large number of Medicare prescription drug plans available to seniors, it is not clear how the Obama administration prevented insurers from competing with each other,” said Tricia Neuman, a Medicare expert with the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Neuman cited statistics for 2012, midway through the Obama years, when the average number of Medicare Part D drug plans ranged across regions from a low of 25 to a high of 36 — more than enough to facilitate healthy competition.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>TRUMP: “So we’re getting it down — $35 per month ... So it’s a massive cut — I guess, 60, 70%. Nobody has seen anything like this for a long time. Sleepy Joe can’t do this — that, I can tell you.” — Medicare event Tuesday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>THE FACTS: Joe Biden proposes to do much more, whether he could get it done as president or not.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Democratic presidential candidate supports allowing Medicare to negotiate prices with drug makers, restricting price increases to the inflation rate and limiting launch prices for new drugs that face no competition.\u003c/p>\u003cp>As a 2016 candidate, Trump also had backed Medicare negotiations. But he has not pursued that idea as president, although the Congressional Budget Office estimated it could result in significant savings for taxpayers and consumers.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Congress is at an impasse over legislation to reduce drug costs, including a bipartisan Senate bill backed by Trump that would act to limit price increases for medicines already on the market. But it would not authorize Medicare to negotiate prices.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>HEALTH CARE\u003c/p>\u003cp>TRUMP: “We’re always working on preexisting conditions and saving your preexisting conditions.

It has been pressing in court for full repeal of Obama’s health law, which requires insurers to take all applicants, regardless of medical history, and charge the same standard premiums to healthy people and those who had medical problems before or when they signed up.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump and other Republicans say they’ll have a plan to preserve protections for people with preexisting conditions, but the White House has provided no details.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Associated Press writers Eric Tucker and Robert Burns in Washington and AP News Researcher Rhonda Shafner in New York contributed to this report.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>EDITOR'S NOTE — A look at the veracity of claims by political figures.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___ \u003c/p>\u003cp>Find AP Fact Checks at http://apnews.com/APFactCheck \u003c/p>\u003cp>Follow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck\u003c/p>","description":null,"pullQuoteObjs":[],"embedCaption":null,"sequenceNumber":null,"title":"US--Fact Check-Week","headline":"AP FACT CHECK: Trump vs. Twitter on truth and consequences","localMemberName":null,"dateline":null,"old_lead_video_key":null,"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:c95cc7b435ca2839d157008d249c74ce","truncatedFirstWords":false,"etag":"c95cc7b435ca2839d157008d249c74ce_0a24aza0c0","notificationId":null,"version":null,"videoContext":null,"latestEtag":null,"embedLinkURL":null,"bylines":"By HOPE YEN, CALVIN WOODWARD and RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR","revision":null,"mediumIds":["aed37a9bb9be4623afa8e43bb3ae2238","26fa2b97c03244c2a6128a231f7c5704","9a952fb77d794deb9b2c3e0c1a667444","8fed9bd3e9754b6ca1a9ee0b58b69e6d","3bab435060874635a5ddf429146def0f","d2c1498f63904cdd95558394966d7c96","2e91194eb0334f98ac395c29926c0f53","a049b09674c5493a8da1d050d051ada6"],"media":[{"altText":null,"embedCaption":null,"imageFileExtension":".jpeg","title":null,"videoMimeType":null,"gcsBaseUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/aed37a9bb9be4623afa8e43bb3ae2238/","state":null,"flattenedCaption":"President Donald Trump speaks in the Rose Garden of the White House, Friday, May 29, 2020, in Washington.

None of these are legit, even though they were shared widely on social media. The Associated Press checked them out. Here are the facts:\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>CLAIM: Video appears to show presumptive Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden on “The View” avoiding a question about inappropriate touching.\u003c/p>\u003cp>THE FACTS: The video, taken from Biden’s April 26, 2019, appearance on ABC’s daytime talk show “The View,” was edited to make it appear he failed to give a direct answer to the question about inappropriate touching. The Daily Caller, a conservative website, posted the edited clip on April 26, 2019, and labeled it as “satire.” Social media users shared the spoof video a year later with negative comments and no satire label. “Do you really want this man as your President? Seriously @JoeBiden #RacistBiden is not fit to be a leader even of his own home. Listen to him on the view. It is so funny how the ladies are trying to help him. Even put words on his mouth. Nothing worked for #CreepyJoeBiden,” stated one Twitter user, who shared the video on May 25. The video features multiple misleading edits, where key portions of Biden’s response were taken out. For example, in one instance, co-host Sunny Hostin asks Biden, “Are you prepared to apologize to those women?” In the actual exchange Biden states, “Look, here’s the deal, I have to be and everyone has to be much more aware of the private space of men and women … and I am much more cognizant of that.” The camera stays fixed on Biden. The edited clip takes out large portions of Biden’s response to the question to make it appear incoherent: “Look, here’s the deal, I am so, like for example, I actually thought in my head when I walked out here, I mean, do I ... we’re friends. I should be able to read better. But I have never in my life done anything in approaching a woman that has been…” In the edited clip, the co-hosts appear shocked at Biden’s response. Their facial expressions were spliced in and taken from other points of the interview. In another part of the edited clip, co-host Joy Behar says, “Here’s your opportunity right now to just say you apologize, you’re sorry, I think we can clean this up right now.” In the actual clip, she poses this comment when discussing Anita Hill. Hill accused then-Supreme Court-nominee Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment and Biden led the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing into the accusation. Clips of the original interview can be found on official accounts belonging to “The View” on Twitter and YouTube. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>CLAIM: Two photos circulating on social media show the Minneapolis police officer who was videotaped kneeling on a black man’s neck during an arrest on Monday. In one the man pictured is wearing a baseball cap that says “Make Whites Great Again,” and in the other he is on stage at a Trump rally. \u003c/p>\u003cp>THE FACTS: The officer, Derek Chauvin, is not in either of the photos. On May 27, a photo was shared widely on social media featuring a man wearing a “Make Whites Great Again” hat and holding a blackberry between his thumb and index finger. The hand appeared to be making an OK sign, a gesture that has been used widely by white supremacists. Jonathan Lee Riches, a known internet troll, confirmed he is the man in the photo, but he says the image was altered and he was not wearing the hat. Facebook and Twitter users shared the image on Wednesday claiming it showed Chauvin. In many cases the photo was juxtaposed with a photo of Chauvin kneeling on Floyd’s neck. Chauvin and three other police officers were dismissed from the department soon after a video emerged that showed him kneeling on Floyd’s neck, even after he complained of being unable to breathe. Several prominent Twitter users, including Ice Cube, posted the photo under the false impression it showed Chauvin. Riches said his face was edited into the image, but did not provide the original photo when asked. The windows and landscape in the background of the photo appear to match the backgrounds of photos Riches has posted on Facebook. Riches is known for creating outrageous posts after tragic and politically charged events. He pretended to be the shooter’s uncle after a 2012 elementary school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, and was indicted in federal court in 2018 for posing as the gunman who shot former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Other photos shared widely on social media after Floyd's death wrongly claimed Chauvin was among police officers onstage with President Donald Trump at a rally in Minneapolis last October. The officers are smiling in shirts that said “Cops for Trump.” “Photos Released on Social Media Appeared to Show Minneapolis Police Officer Who Murdered George Floyd,” read the headline of a Facebook post by left-leaning news website the Political Tribune, which had racked up nearly 120,000 views on Wednesday. “Did this murder ‘Make America great again?’\" read a post retweeted more than 1,700 times. The widespread photos actually show Bloomington Police Federation President Mike Gallagher, not Chauvin, according to Minneapolis police union president Lt. Bob Kroll. “Can you put a stop to the false narrative please?” Kroll told the AP. “None of the officers in the incident were near the Trump rally.” Gallagher did not return a request for comment.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>CLAIM: Photo shows a federal agent disguised as a protester to incite violence in the protests demanding justice for George Floyd, who died after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for several minutes as he begged for air.\u003c/p>\u003cp>THE FACTS: The photo was taken during a protest in Germany earlier this month, before Floyd’s death on Monday and the protests that followed in Minneapolis this week. The photo, which showed a man wearing a mask, a red hoodie and a black beanie with an earpiece sticking out underneath, circulated widely on social media. Posts cited the earpiece as evidence the man was a federal agent hiding among the protesters in Minneapolis. A reverse image search found the photo on social media posts as early as May 18, a week before Floyd’s death. The man in the photo was identified in posts as an antifascist taking part in protests there. The photo was shared with #falseflag hashtags, which has been used by conspiracy theorists to say that events or protests are staged, and an #AgentProvocateur hashtag. One post with the photo received more than 1,000 likes and retweets on Twitter. Anti-lockdown protesters demonstrated across Germany during the weekend prior to May 18, including in Frankfurt, where they protested against the measures enacted to curb the spread of coronavirus. The photo was shared Friday to suggest it showed a federal agent pretending to be a protester in Minneapolis, where protests — some violent — erupted after Floyd’s death in police custody. “Who is this Minnesota protester taking orders from?” one post shared in an online forum said. A Qanon account that also shared the photo Friday on Instagram received more than 4,000 likes. “You think these events happen organically? Try again..,” the post said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>CLAIM: A photograph shared on social media shows a building fire in Minneapolis amid protests in the aftermath of the officer-involved death of George Floyd.\u003c/p>\u003cp>THE FACTS: The photo shows a mini-mall on fire during the 1992 riots in Los Angeles. As protests and riots erupted in Minneapolis in the wake of Floyd’s death, a Minnesota gun rights Facebook group shared a photograph of a fire crew responding to a building engulfed in flames. The post, which quickly amassed more than 27,000 views on Wednesday, addressed the state’s governor directly: “Paging Governor Tim Walz, are you.. uhh... gonna stop any of this or... ?” However, a reverse image search of the photo reveals it was actually taken more than 25 years ago in Los Angeles. The April 30, 1992, image, captured by photographer Mike Nelson, depicts firefighters spraying water on a burning mini-mall during the LA riots. Demonstrations rocked the city that year after the acquittal of officers involved in an excessive force lawsuit for their arrest and beating of Rodney King. Though the photo is old, it is true that Minneapolis has faced three nights of protests after the death of George Floyd, and that some of the protesters set fires.\u003c/p>\u003cp>____\u003c/p>\u003cp>CLAIM: “Looters” steal children’s ‘Thomas the Tank Engine’ mall train during Minneapolis protests.\u003c/p>\u003cp>THE FACTS: The photo of people driving a children’s train down a city street was taken in August 2014 during protests in Ferguson, Missouri. The photo circulated widely on social media this week with posts that falsely claimed protesters in Minneapolis stole the children’s “Thomas the Tank Engine” train from a nearby mall. “Looters have stolen the children’s train out of the #Minneapolis...\" one post shared on Facebook stated. The post had nearly a thousand shares. Another post on Twitter falsely claimed the train was stolen from the mall: “Minneapolis trippin fr they stole the mall train,” said a tweet posted on May 28. The post had over 8,000 retweets. On Aug. 9, 2014, white Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson fatally shot Michael Brown, who was black and unarmed. The shooting prompted demonstrations that lasted for weeks. Police responded with tear gas and rubber bullets. Several journalists covering the Ferguson protests at the time posted photos and videos on social media showing people riding the train in August 2014.\u003c/p>\u003cp>____\u003c/p>\u003cp>CLAIM: Protesters looted Mall of America Wednesday night, with a video showing someone driving a car through North America’s largest shopping complex.\u003c/p>\u003cp>THE FACTS: No incidents have occurred at the Mall of America since protests erupted in Minneapolis this week, Mall of America spokeswoman Sarah Grap confirmed to The Associated Press. Social media users are falsely claiming in Facebook and Twitter posts that the Mall of America was trashed this week during protests. Some are using a 2019 video of a car driving through an Illinois mall to make the false claim. The video was taken in September 2019 at the Woodfield Mall in Schaumburg, Ill. A witness at the time captured the film of the SUV driving through the mall, sending shoppers scurrying. That witness video was used by several Chicago news outlets that reported on the incident. The Mall of America is in Bloomington, a suburb of Minneapolis, about seven miles south of the police station near where Floyd was arrested. \u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>CLAIM: The coronavirus has an HIV protein that proves it was genetically modified.\u003c/p>\u003cp>THE FACTS: Experts say the coronavirus has no HIV sequences in it’s genetic makeup. Since the early days of the coronavirus outbreak, social media posts have tried to cast doubt on its origins. Recently, online posts have tried to link the coronavirus and HIV to suggest the novel coronavirus was man-made. “Those little spikes that come out of the Coronavirus and make it attach inside our lungs so efficiently are Spike Glycoproteins, better known as S-proteins for short. Well the Covid-19 strain that’s currently going around has S-protein 120 spikes. S-protein 120 is only found in one other virus known to man, HIV,” states a claim circulating on Facebook. It goes on to say that shows “the current Covid-19 strain was indeed genetically modified by the insertion of these HIV proteins into the Coronavirus and therefore weaponizing it.” Vincent Racaniello, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Columbia University, says such claims are not true. The coronavirus has no HIV-1 sequences, which can be seen by looking at the genome sequence, he said. “The spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 is just like the spike of every other CoV,” Racaniello said in an email. “It is not from HIV-1. This post is pure nonsense, fake science, and not worth responding to.” Similar posts circulated early this year after a scientific paper was published on bioRXIV, a repository for scientific papers that have not yet been peer reviewed or published in a traditional scientific journal. The paper was posted by Indian scientists who said they had found “uncanny similarity of unique inserts in the 2019-nCoV spike protein to HIV-1 gp120 and Gag.” At the time, the paper was widely debunked by scientists on social media. It was withdrawn from bioRXIV following the criticism, but the paper was used as fodder for conspiracy theorists and continues to circulate online in various forms. A new version of the false claim attempts to make a link between the number (120, they falsely state) of spike proteins on coronavirus, which allow the virus to attach to human cells, and the molecular weight, 120kDa, of the glycoprotein protein on the outer layer of HIV. The gp120 protein in HIV helps the virus find a targeted host cell so it can replicate. Dr. Phyllis Kanki, a professor of health sciences in the department of immunology and infectious diseases at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said the 120 connection the post makes is inaccurate and means nothing. “I don’t know where they get this idea that it has 120 spikes, that is clearly wrong,” Kanki said. “It would be far greater than that.” Experts further say the genes in the coronavirus spike protein and HIV gp120 look nothing alike. “It’s like saying that because a dog has legs and we have legs then we are both the same thing,” said Dr. Joseph Petrosino, chair of molecular virology and microbiology and director of the Alkek Center for Metagenomics and Microbiome Research at Baylor College of Medicine. “That 120 has nothing to do with the 120 that’s on the HIV molecule.” The posts also suggest that Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, was involved in creating the virus because he is listed on several patents related to HIV research. Fauci received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2008 for his work around HIV and AIDS. The false claim around the genetic makeup of the coronavirus, which has killed more than 100,000 people in the U.S. and 350,000 people globally, plays into a larger conspiracy theory that suggests the virus was made in a lab. It continues to circulate online despite the scientific proof that the virus comes from nature. A paper published in March in Nature, one of the world’s leading science journals, completed an analysis of the public genome sequence data of the virus and related viruses, and concluded that the coronavirus originated through natural processes.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>CLAIM: Italy discovers through autopsies that COVID-19 is “not a virus, but a bacterium,” which clots the blood. COVID-19 can “easily” be treated with aspirin and blood thinning medicine.\u003c/p>\u003cp>THE FACTS: Posts circulating on social media misrepresent information from an Italian study of people who died of COVID-19. The \u003ca href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.19.20054262v1\">study\u003c/a>, which hasn't been peer-reviewed, refers to COVID-19 as a virus, not bacterium. “COVID 19 is for sure a virus and antibiotics do not have any effect against this infection,” Aurelio Sonzogni, a pathologist at Ospedale Papa Giovanni XXIII, a hospital in Bergamo, and an author of the report, told the AP in an email. In addition, while blood clotting can occur in those infected with the disease, anticoagulants can’t treat the infection. The widely-shared post contains several other false claims, including that the World Health Organization “law” does not allow autopsies on those who died with COVID-19. Sonzogni said that by performing 100 autopsies, they found that “COVID 19 was able to trigger a damage to blood vessels of lungs and of other organs, leading to diffuse thrombotic occlusions.” Thrombotic occlusions happen when a blood clot forms inside the blood vessels. According to AP reporting, it’s not clear how many patients with the virus develop the clots. But studies from China, Europe and the U.S. suggest that clots develop in anywhere from 3% to 70% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Patients commonly receive blood thinning drugs for prevention, the AP noted. The posts also falsely state, “Ventilators and ICU units were not necessary,” for those infected with COVID-19, and suggest that aspirin and anticoagulants can “easily” treat the virus instead. Some doctors are moving away from treating patients using ventilators, but it is because they are seeking new, less invasive ways of treating the virus, according to AP reporting. And while anticoagulants may be used to address blood clots, doctors can’t just treat the infection with blood thinners. \"Clotting is triggered by many illnesses,” Agnes Lee, medical director of the Thrombosis Program at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, told the AP. “We do not use aspirin or anticoagulants to treat infection. That’s not the use for these medications.” Another false claim in the post states that Italy is “demanding Bill Gates and the World Health Organization be held accountable for ‘crimes against humanity’ for misleading, misdirecting, and withholding life saving information from the world, which cost the lives of thousands.” The government has made no such demand. In the last few months, there have been several conspiracy theories swirling online that target Gates, the billionaire founder of Microsoft, for his work around vaccines. On May 14, Sara Cunial, an independent member of Italy's Chamber of Deputies, made a speech suggesting that Gates should be arrested. She is part of the populist 5-Star Movement, whose founder Beppe Grillo casts doubt on vaccines, pharmaceutical companies and the health industry.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>This is part of The Associated Press’ ongoing effort to fact-check misinformation that is shared widely online, including work with Facebook to identify and reduce the circulation of false stories on the platform.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___ \u003c/p>\u003cp>Find all AP Fact Checks here: https://apnews.com/APFactCheck\u003c/p>\u003cp>___ \u003c/p>\u003cp>Follow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck\u003c/p>","description":null,"pullQuoteObjs":[],"embedCaption":null,"sequenceNumber":null,"title":"Not-Real-News","headline":"NOT REAL NEWS: A look at what didn't happen this week","localMemberName":null,"dateline":null,"old_lead_video_key":null,"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:8869612df303dfa444df98a43dfff035","truncatedFirstWords":true,"etag":"8869612df303dfa444df98a43dfff035_0a1aza0c0","notificationId":null,"version":null,"videoContext":"iding a question about inappropriate touching.\u003c/p>","latestEtag":null,"embedLinkURL":null,"bylines":"By ALI SWENSON, ARIJETA LAJKA, BEATRICE DUPUY and AMANDA SEITZ","revision":null,"mediumIds":["c129ff31e164481b9d31eb7a66e0345d","598ddf50f0b444b2b7694e3fd828e9dc","e8f0e74e876643c1b8ba92ba41183c47"],"media":[{"altText":null,"embedCaption":null,"imageFileExtension":".jpeg","title":null,"videoMimeType":null,"gcsBaseUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/c129ff31e164481b9d31eb7a66e0345d/","state":null,"flattenedCaption":"FILE - In this April 26, 2019 file photo, former Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden rides in a car after appearing on ABC's \"The View\" in New York.

champion Tyron Woodley to win a unanimous decision on Saturday night in the mixed martial arts promotion's return to Las Vegas.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Brazilian heavyweight Augusto Sakai employed some unpunished gamesmanship to eke out a split-decision victory over Bulgaria’s Blagoy Ivanov in the penultimate bout of the UFC’s first show in its hometown since the coronavirus pandemic began.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The event was held without fans at the UFC Apex, a small gym with broadcast facilities on the promotion’s corporate campus. The UFC used minimal personnel to stage the fight, and the promotion said everyone involved was subject to strict health and safety protocols.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The 33-year-old Burns (19-3) dominated on his feet and on the ground, finishing his first main-event bout with likely the biggest win of his career and his sixth consecutive victory since July 2018, including four straight since moving back up to welterweight.\u003c/p>\u003cp>From a first-round knockdown to a strong finish, the Florida-based Brazilian soundly defeated one of the most accomplished welterweights in UFC history and made his case for a shot at champion Kamaru Usman, who happens to be his training partner.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I trained so hard for this fight, and I knew I could do it,” said Burns, who entered the bout ranked sixth in the crowded 170-pound division. “I was calling these guys out for a reason. I’m coming to stay. That was a former champion right there. You saw a dominant performance against a former champion. I’m ready. I feel so good right now.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The judges all gave all five rounds to Burns, scoring it 50-45, 50-44 and 50-44. Burns called out Usman in his post-fight interview.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I love the champ, my training partner,” Burns said. “But come on, give me a shot. A lot of respect, a lot of love for you, but I think I'm next. ... If they want to make a fight in July, come on. I don't have a scratch.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>Burns came out with furious energy against Woodley, dropping the ex-champ in the opening seconds and gaining full mount. A gaping cut opened in Woodley's left eyebrow in the opening minutes, and Burns again overcame Woodley's famously strong takedown defense to drop Woodley again in the second round.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Woodley (19-5-1) hadn't fought since losing his title in a one-sided thrashing from Usman in March 2019. Woodley had reigned atop the division for nearly three years, and the 38-year-old University of Missouri graduate said he dealt with depression while debating whether to stay in MMA or to pursue a music career.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Burns' victory capped an entertaining show at the Apex, where the octagon is only 25 feet in diameter, compared to 30 feet in most competitive cages. The compact dimensions typically lead to more aggressive fighting, and this card featured six finishes in its 11 bouts.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Burns was fighting in a fan-free arena for the second time in 2 1/2 months. He stopped veteran Demian Maia in Brasilia on March 14 in the UFC’s final show before it halted competition.\u003c/p>\u003cp>After an eight-week break, the UFC returned to competition earlier this month with three shows over eight days in Jacksonville, Florida. With ambitions to hold near-weekly cards throughout the summer as part of its expansive broadcast deal with ESPN, the promotion relocated its operations to its own facilities after the Nevada Athletic Commission agreed three days ago to allow the return of combat sports.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Although this card was fairly light on star power, the promotion will stage UFC 250 next Saturday night from the same gym. Two-division champion Amanda Nunes' featherweight title defense against Canada's Felicia Spencer headlines the pay-per-view card.\u003c/p>\u003cp>UFC President Dana White continues to promise additional shows this summer from the so-called “Fight Island,” an undisclosed private isle where the promotion intends to host bouts between fighters who can't enter the U.S. due to health restrictions.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Sakai (15-1-1) remained unbeaten in the UFC with his fourth straight victory when two judges favored him 29-28 after a lively bout with Ivanov (18-4), who was up 30-27 on the third judge's card.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Sakai escaped punishment from referee Jason Herzog in the third round when he blatantly grabbed the chain-link wall of the cage while attempting to avoid a takedown attempt by Ivanov.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Grabbing the cage is illegal and punishable by a point deduction, but Herzog merely warned Sakai verbally. The decision was met with audible disbelief by Daniel Cormier, the former UFC heavyweight champion working in the quiet arena as a color commentator.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Strawweight contender Mackenzie Dern opened the main card by finishing Hannah Cifers with a knee bar that was the first leg-lock submission victory by a woman in UFC history.

There were no details on the charges or nature of the injuries. A spokesman for U.S. Park Police said their officers made no arrests, but several suffered minor injuries and one was taken to a hospital after being struck in the helmet by a projectile.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf on Saturday called the protesters “criminals” who committed “acts of violence while hiding behind their First Amendment right of lawful protest.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Wolf said the Secret Service was “evolving and adapting to the changing nature of the threats they face.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Floyd is the black man who was being held in handcuffs when he died Monday in Minneapolis after a police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after Floyd stopped moving and pleading for air.

At that time, there were no cell phones to record my treatment, no cable news stations with 24/7 coverage, no social media to record the reality of the situation or offer support nor condemnation. But I can remember exactly how I felt as an 8-year-old child. I felt helpless. I felt as if I was neither seen, nor heard, nor understood. As I have watched the events unfold in the days following the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, a city where I coached and once called home, I see how many people continue to feel those same feelings -- helpless, frustrated, invisible, angry. I understand the outrage because it seems the list continues to grow: Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, George Floyd. The injustices continue to mount and nothing seems to be changing.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Fifty-four years later, my son is now 8 years old and I look at the world he is growing up in and wonder, how much has really changed? How often is he judged on sight? Is he growing up in a world where he is seen, and heard, and understood? Does he feel helpless? Will he be treated like George Floyd or Ahmaud Abrey? What have we really done in the last 54 years to make his 8-year-old world better than mine was? We all have to be and do better.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>In Germany, U.S. national soccer player Weston McKennie played for Schalke on Saturday wearing an armband referencing Floyd's death.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The midfielder had the handwritten message “Justice for George” on white tape around his left arm.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“To be able to use my platform to bring attention to a problem that has been going on to long feels good!!!” McKennie wrote on Twitter alongside pictures of himself wearing the armband. “We have to stand up for what we believe in and I believe that it is time that we are heard!”\u003c/p>\u003cp>McKennie’s Schalke team lost 1-0 to Werder Bremen.\u003c/p>","mediaCount":1,"shortId":"8afe607bc9a5133fbf01b1fba2583e61","localLinkUrl":"https://apnews.com/8afe607bc9a5133fbf01b1fba2583e61","interactiveLinkUrl":null,"downloadSettings":null,"interactiveLinkUrlText":null,"richEmbeds":null,"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:8afe607bc9a5133fbf01b1fba2583e61","media":[],"videoContext":null,"tagIds":["GeorgeFloyd","Football","apf-football","NewYork","apf-GeneralNews","NFL","apf-sports","DerekChauvin","AhmaudArbery","RogerGoodell","state-NewYork","apf-usnews"],"hasTextOverlay":false,"bylines":null,"leadPhotoId":"0c82724a2a04415c8d05ed07fab8df8a"}],"notificationUrl":null,"textColor":null,"sponsorUrl":null,"teamLimit":null,"cardType":"Wire Story","sponsorServeAd":false,"notificationText":null,"notificationUpdated":null},{"feed":[],"pollUpdated":null,"headlineWidget":false,"dividerColor":null,"tagObjs":[],"sponsorImageUrl":null,"hubPeekLinkText":null,"borderColor":null,"cardTitle":null,"localMemberName":null,"collectionTagObjs":[],"notificationTitle":null,"minimizedStoryCount":null,"shortId":"f2110c825f3a0e91516b0ed85547c886","allowAd":true,"layoutType":"Small Photo","pollWeek":null,"disclaimerText":null,"teams":null,"hubPeekTagName":null,"sponsorAttribution":null,"bracketsSettings":null,"textScale":null,"expandedStoryCount":null,"hubPeekTagId":null,"cardHeadline":null,"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:f2110c825f3a0e91516b0ed85547c886","pollId":null,"contents":[{"embedHeight":null,"contentSponsor":null,"mediumIds":["5310dd6511b8416cb81da5a0b3464191"],"title":"US--Trump-G7","headline":"Trump postpones G7 meeting, seeks expansion of members","localMemberName":null,"updated":"2020-05-31 01:22:54","contentType":"text","layoutType":"Small Photo","tagObjs":[{"name":"AP Top News","id":"apf-topnews","isPr":null,"order":9},{"name":"International News","id":"apf-intlnews","isPr":null,"order":1},{"name":"General News","id":"apf-GeneralNews","isPr":false,"order":8},{"name":"Politics","id":"apf-politics","isPr":null,"order":2},{"name":"Business","id":"apf-business","isPr":null,"order":1},{"name":"Virus Outbreak","id":"VirusOutbreak","isPr":null,"order":0},{"name":"U.S. News","id":"apf-usnews","isPr":null,"order":5},{"name":"Russia","id":"Russia","isPr":null,"order":0},{"name":"Donald Trump","id":"DonaldTrump","isPr":null,"order":0}],"embedCaption":null,"gcsUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/contents/urn:publicid:ap.org:f2110c825f3a0e91516b0ed85547c886","embedLinkURL":null,"language":null,"leadVideoId":null,"firstWords":"\u003cp>ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE (AP) — President Donald Trump said Saturday that he will postpone until the fall a meeting of Group of 7 nations he had planned to hold next month at the White House despite...\u003c/p>","published":"2020-05-31 00:15:27","embedHTML":null,"sequenceNumber":null,"notificationId":null,"storyHTML":"\u003cp>ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE (AP) — President Donald Trump said Saturday that he will postpone until the fall a meeting of Group of 7 nations he had planned to hold next month at the White House despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

The investigation is part of a larger effort by Democrats and some Republicans to find out more about Trump’s recent moves to sideline several independent government watchdogs. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The Democrats plan to interview multiple officials in the administration who may have more information about Linick’s dismissal on May 15, including whether Secretary of State Mike Pompeo recommended the firing for retaliatory reasons. Pompeo has denied Linick’s firing was retaliatory but has not given specific reasons for his dismissal.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The investigation is being led by House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., House Oversight and Reform Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., and New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Republicans on those panels will also be invited to question Linick and other witnesses. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“If Secretary Pompeo pushed for Mr. Linick’s dismissal to cover up his own misconduct, that would constitute an egregious abuse of power and a clear attempt to avoid accountability,” the Democrats said in a joint statement Friday. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The committees said they will release transcripts shortly after each interview.\u003c/p>\u003cp>It’s unclear whether Linick will come to Capitol Hill in person or appear virtually for the transcribed interviews.

He said he recommended to Trump that Linick be terminated. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Pompeo told reporters that he was unaware of any investigation into allegations that he may have mistreated staffers by instructing them to run personal errands for him and his wife such as walking his dog and picking up dry cleaning and takeout food. Thus, Pompeo said, the move could not have been retaliatory. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Pompeo did acknowledge that he was aware of an investigation into his decision last year to bypass congressional objections to approve a multibillion-dollar arms sale to Saudi Arabia because he had answered written questions about it posed by Linick’s office. He maintained he did not know the scope or scale of the investigation.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Engel and Menendez have been demanding answers and documents from the State Department and Pompeo personally for months on a variety of topics that goes far beyond Linick’s dismissal.\u003c/p>\u003cp>After complaining for more than a year that Pompeo and his staff have either refused to respond or provided only perfunctory answers to questions posed on personnel and policy matters, the two Democrats and their Democratic committee colleagues have teamed up to try to force a complete explanation from Pompeo and the White House as to why Trump fired Linick.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Engel and Menendez earlier demanded that administration officials preserve and turn over all records related to Linick’s dismissal. They said they have received no information so far. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Linick is one of several inspectors general whom Trump has removed from office, sparking outrage among Democrats who say the administration is undermining government accountability. Linick was an Obama administration appointee whose office was critical of what it saw as political bias in the State Department’s current management but had also taken issue with Democratic appointees. \u003c/p>\u003cp>He played a small role in Trump’s impeachment last year. In October, Linick turned over documents to House investigators that he had received from a close Pompeo associate that contained information from debunked conspiracy theories about Ukraine’s role in the 2016 U.S. election. Democrats were probing Trump’s pressure on Ukraine to investigate Democrats. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Linick is the second inspector general to be fired who was involved with the impeachment process. Michael Atkinson, the former inspector general for the intelligence community, triggered the impeachment probe when he alerted Congress about a whistleblower complaint that described a call between Trump and Ukraine’s president last summer. Trump fired Atkinson in April, saying he had lost confidence in him. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, has said the White House is legally required to provide more answers to Congress about the firings and gave Trump a deadline to give them. But in a letter to Grassley this week, the administration offered no new details about why they were let go.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The response from White House counsel Pat Cipollone said that Trump has the authority to remove inspectors general, that he appropriately alerted Congress and that he selected qualified officials as replacements.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The president also moved to replace the chief watchdog at the Department of Health and Human Services, Christi Grimm, who testified that her office was moving ahead with new reports and audits on the department’s response to the coronavirus pandemic despite Trump’s public criticism of her.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In addition, Trump demoted acting Defense Department Inspector General Glenn Fine, effectively removing him as head of a special board to oversee auditing of the coronavirus economic relief package.

She’s a fighter. So most of my focus was on Jacob. He was 14 and I didn’t want him to grow up without a dad. I wanted to be there when he walked across the stage. I didn’t want him going, 'I wish my dad was there.’“\u003c/p>\u003cp>He was there Saturday, behind the wheel of the family car, driving through Gasoline Alley, and he was there for the family photo with the old race car that had been brought to the speedway from the high school lobby six blocks away.\u003c/p>\u003cp>And then, as school officials whisked other families on and off the track, he grabbed his son's arm, pulled him tight and gave him the hug of a lifetime. \u003c/p>\u003cp>School principal Luke Zartman and speedway officials came up with a plan that worked within the state's social distancing guidelines to give these seniors an unforgettable moment. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“When we realized we weren't coming back and we realized the seniors would miss out on so many things at the end of the year, to imagine them not being properly celebrated at the end was heartbreaking,\" Zartman said. “It just adds a bright spot to an otherwise dark time to to send them out the way they deserve.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>Sporting venues certainly have played their part in the coronavirus fight, from testing sites at major league ballparks and NFL stadiums.

Some stood in front of race shops with handmade signs bearing the names of seniors. One by one, the cars came into the speedway, forming a three-car front row at the yard of bricks — for all the world looking like the front row for the Indianapolis 500, postponed this year to August.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“This has been amazing,” said Cindy Foxworthy, Ted’s wife. “For the whole town of Speedway to come out for these kids the way they did really is a dream come true.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>In an email sent to Zartman a few days ago, Ted Foxworthy thanked school officials for finding a way to stage graduation during a global pandemic. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“What you have provided means more to my family than just the ceremony,” he wrote. “This has become a victory for my family.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>What he left out was the part about his first challenging summer four years ago, undergoing chemotherapy, and how his 14-year-old son cared for him.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Jacob had to go through this with us, he and Cindy. She was still working and he was taking care of me,\" he said. “That’s asking a lot for a 14-year-old kid to spend your summer getting stuff when you’re dad needed it. I was like a pickle that summer. I was sitting in the recliner or laying on the coach, I was just gone,I lost a summer.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>They grew closer, and Ted began counting the birthdays and the days to graduation amid a sobering prognosis. Those who survive the first six months with this aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Foxworthy said, still face about an 80% fatality rate after five years.

The duo is making the transition from racing in a Ford to a Chevrolet now and preparing for events that don't include practice or qualifying. \u003c/p>\u003cp>As NASCAR tries to make up eight postponed points races the schedule has been condensed into one-day shows, and teams don't have two or more practice sessions to dial-in a setup. Stenhouse and Chris Buescher essentially swapped rides at the end of 2019, and Buescher's old notes from Bristol are at their disposal. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“Our setups, looking at what we normally run versus what they ran here, are pretty similar, so I feel good about that,” Stenhouse said, adding that he's quickly getting comfortable in the Camaro and NASCAR current aerodynamic package. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“The feel that I have in this race car is better than any of the feel that I had in my Cup cars over my career so far,” he said. \"I’m looking forward to getting to Bristol knowing that we’ve had good runs there.

Paul Menard took it one step further by telling his Wood Brothers Racing team he was retiring at the end of the year and they should hire DiBenedetto. \u003c/p>\u003cp>DiBenedetto got the ride that puts him under the Team Penske umbrella and has been decent this year. He finished second at Las Vegas in the second race of the season and led 10 laps Thursday night at Charlotte. \u003c/p>\u003cp>He's ranked 11th in the standings. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“I’m excited about how good of a team we have and resources and teammates and you name it,\" he said. “We’ve shown if we hit it or we’re close, we can be up front at any of these races.

The main draw is scheduled to start Aug. 31. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“We continue to be, I would say, 150% focused on staging a safe environment for conducting a U.S. Open at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in New York on our dates. It’s all I wake up -- our team wakes up -- thinking about,” Allaster said. “The idea of an alternative venue, an alternative date ... we've got a responsibility to explore it, but it doesn’t have a lot of momentum.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>An announcement should come from “mid-June to end of June,” Allaster said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>All sanctioned competition has been suspended by the ATP, WTA and International Tennis Federation since March and is on hold until late July.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The French Open was postponed from May to September; Wimbledon was canceled for the first time since 1945. \u003c/p>\u003cp>There is no established COVID-19 protocol for tennis, a global sport with several governing bodies.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Everybody would agree to the fundamental principles, I’m sure: protecting the health of participants, following the local laws and minimizing the risk of the transmission of the virus,” said Stuart Miller, who is overseeing the ITF’s return-to-tennis policy. “But then you have to get down into the specific details.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>One such detail: The USTA wants to add locker rooms — including at indoor courts that housed hundreds of temporary hospital beds at the height of New York’s coronavirus outbreak — and improve air filtration in existing spaces. Also being considered: no locker-room access until just before a match. So if anyone goes to Flushing Meadows just to train, Allaster said, “You come, you practice, and return to the hotel.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The USTA presented its operational plan to a medical advisory group Friday; now that will be discussed with city, state and federal government officials.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The fundamental goal here is to mitigate risk,” Allaster said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Governors around the country, such as New York’s Andrew Cuomo, who are open to allowing professional sports resume say that should be without fans.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We are spending a lot of time and energy on all the models, including no fans on site,” Allaster said. “The government will help guide us.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>In 2019, about 850,000 people attended the U.S. Open site from the week before the main draw through the finals.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Lew Sherr, the USTA’s chief revenue officer, told the AP it is “less and less likely” spectators would be at the U.S. Open this year.\u003c/p>\u003cp>That, Sherr said, means “forgoing ticketing revenue, forgoing hospitality revenue, forgoing a portion of your sponsorship revenue.” But TV and digital rights fees, plus remaining sponsorship dollars, are “significant enough that it’s still worth it to go forward with a no-fans-on-site U.S. Open,” he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Other areas Allaster addressed:\u003c/p>\u003cp>SCORING \u003c/p>\u003cp>Having best-of-three-set matches in men’s singles “has hardly been discussed,” she said. “If the players came to us and said, ‘That is something we want to do,’ we would consider it. But we will not make a unilateral decision on that without player input.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>TESTING\u003c/p>\u003cp>Before traveling to New York, players would need proof of a negative COVID-19 test. “Once they come into our, let’s say, ‘U.S. Open world,’” Allaster said, “there will be a combination of daily health questionnaires, daily temperature checks and ... some nasal or saliva or antibody testing.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>CHARTERS\u003c/p>\u003cp>Paris, Vienna, Frankfurt, Buenos Aires and Dubai are among the cities where players could catch a flight to John F.

Mayor Jacob Frey ordered a citywide curfew at 8 p.m. local time, beginning on Friday. In that city, peaceful protests picked up steam as darkness fell, with thousands of people ignoring the curfew to walk streets in the southern part of the city. Some cars were set on fire in scattered neighborhoods, business break-ins began and eventually there were larger fires. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Active-duty forces are normally prohibited from acting as a domestic law enforcement agency. But the Insurrection Act offers an exception.

Symbolically, it looks very bad if you have to give that up.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Downing would know: He witnessed the Los Angeles riots firsthand in 1992 following the acquittal of four officers accused of beating black motorist Rodney King. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>In Los Angeles, the center of the uprising was an intersection, Florence and Normandie avenues, and the violence spiraled into five days of riots and fires. More than 60 people died, including 10 who were fatally shot by law enforcement.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In 1992, then-Lt. Downing would typically oversee that intersection, but he was on vacation studying for a promotional exam. A different lieutenant was in charge instead.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The lieutenant made a decision: He ordered his officers to abandon the intersection. An hour later, a truck driver was pulled from his vehicle and brutally beaten by rioters.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I think that sent a signal to the rest of the city,” said Downing, who immediately rushed to work. “When you have that coupled with political leadership saying ‘show your anger, go to the streets’ it was kind of like permission to go out and misbehave and be violent.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Nearly 30 years later, police officers around the country are confronted with an eerily similar dilemma, with cities aflame, violent protests erupting and another challenging night ahead Saturday as National Guard troops start arriving in some cities.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The mere presence of armed National Guard troops on the streets in Minneapolis and elsewhere brings back memories of the civil rights and anti-war protests of the 1960s and '70s, but they are only there as a support to local law enforcement and do not have the authority to make arrests. \u003c/p>\u003cp>They can use their weapons in “self defense” but are trained in less lethal crowd control tactics that attempt to de-escalate tensions, unlike the combat techniques that have largely been abandoned since the Kent State University shootings in Ohio in 1970 when the state’s National Guard killed four students and wounded nine.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Alex Vitale, a sociology professor at Brooklyn College, said that when deciding how to manage large protests, police and political leaders look for ways to facilitate “legitimate outpourings of anger” while trying to limit the likelihood of injury and property destruction. But he said the difficulty is trying to strike that balance.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The crisis of police legitimacy has become so great that then to use the police to manage the situation just enflames the problem,” said Vitale, who has studied the policing of protests for two decades.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In Minneapolis and other cities around the nation where high-profile police killings of black people have prompted protests, the rage felt by protesters is understandable, said Ed Gonzalez, sheriff of Harris County, Texas.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We keep promising real change but not delivering it on a consistent basis,” he said. “We see the resulting emotions and anger and calls for change that occur, only for it to happen again.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Edward Maguire, a criminology and criminal justice professor at Arizona State University whose research focuses primarily on policing and violence, said mass arrests are almost always a bad idea during protests.

It is one of the most segregated cities in the country for its size, and schools suffer from stubborn achievement gaps.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The city appointed its first black chief of police nearly three years ago, after slow progress toward making the department more inclusive. Earlier this year, a statewide task force made up of activists, people representing victims of police brutality, and law enforcement leaders released recommendations for policing reforms. \u003c/p>\u003cp>That task force was formed in the wake of several high-profile fatal shootings of black men by police in the Minneapolis area. Those included Clark, who was killed during a struggle with two white Minneapolis officers, and Philando Castile, who was fatally shot by a Hispanic suburban police officer during a traffic stop in 2016. \u003c/p>\u003cp>While Nekima Levy Armstrong, a civil rights lawyer and former president of the Minneapolis NAACP, acknowledges that progress, she said that many old habits are still entrenched.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The system itself has not changed,\" Armstrong said. \"The culture within the Minneapolis Police Department has not changed.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The city’s police department of more than 800 officers is still predominantly white, she said. The department did not respond to a request for up-to-date figures, but the Star Tribune reported in 2014 that the force, including cadets in field training, was 78.9% white, 9.2% black, 5.2% Asian, 4.1% Hispanic and 2.5% American Indian.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Some leaders, including former Mayor R.T. Rybak and state Sen. Jeff Hayden, have blamed the city's police union in recent days for fostering a culture that protects brutal officers and resists efforts at reform. The union's president, Lt. Bob Kroll, did not return a call seeking comment.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The eruption of anger in Minneapolis reflects frustration over these realities, despite some progress, said Teqen Zéa-Aida, a longtime activist in the city. \u003c/p>\u003cp>But the images themselves also demanded a “public response,” he said, though he pushed for protests to happen online given the risks of gatherings during the coronavirus pandemic.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We saw his eyes ... we saw a lynching. George Floyd is Emmett Till, 2020,” he said, referring to the black 14-year-old who was abducted, beaten and killed in 1955 after he was accused of whistling at a white woman in Mississippi, a lynching that helped spur the civil rights movement.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Bystander video and photos of the arrest show Floyd on the ground with his neck under Officer Derek Chauvin's knee, while Chauvin ignores his pleas for help. Two other officers appear to help hold him down, and a fourth attempts to keep space around the scene. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“My stomach hurts, my neck hurts, everything hurts ... I can’t breathe,” Floyd says in the video before eventually becoming motionless. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Police initially said they arrested Floyd because he matched the description of a man suspected of passing a counterfeit $20 bill at a grocery store and that he resisted arrest. Police were trying to put Floyd in a squad car when he stiffened up and fell to the ground, saying he was claustrophobic, according to the criminal complaint detailing charges against Chauvin.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In addition to igniting the turmoil in Minneapolis, Floyd’s death has garnered national attention, and it drew comparisons to the case of Eric Garner, a black man who died in 2014 in New York after he was placed in a chokehold by police and also said he could not breathe.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The delay in Chauvin's arrest may have also helped to drive the protests, which turned markedly more violent than those that followed the deaths of either Clark or Castile. Authorities arrested Chauvin and charged him Friday with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. His attorney had no comment when reached by the AP. The other three officers involved have not been charged, but the investigation is continuing. All four were fired Tuesday shortly after the video began circulating.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Some activists and community leaders said they expected the protests to continue to push for the arrests of and charges for the three other officers.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Floyd’s death “just touched people in a way that they didn’t expect,” said Armstrong.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We must get to the underlying solutions or we will be right back here in a fairly short time,” said Keith Ellison, the state's first African American attorney general, whose son is the Minneapolis city councilman. “We’ve got to literally shift policing.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Ramsey County Undersheriff Bill Finney, who in 1992 became the first African American police chief in Minnesota when he was appointed to the job in neighboring St. Paul, said even when the relationship between police and the black community improves, all sides must guard against complacency.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“You have to constantly make deposits into the community bank of goodwill,” Finney said. “You want to get to a place where the community stops considering you as ‘the police’ and starts seeing you as their police.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Morrison and Nasir are members of the AP’s Race and Ethnicity team.

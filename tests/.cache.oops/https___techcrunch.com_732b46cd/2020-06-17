that platforms like Facebook and YouTube aren&#8217;t liable for illegal content posted to them, as long as they are making efforts to take them down in accordance with the law.<\/p>\n<p>Some in government feel these protections go too far and have led to social media companies suppressing free speech. Trump himself clearly felt suppressed when Twitter <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/26\/twitter-trump-labels-fact-checking-tweet\/\">placed a fact-check warning<\/a> on unsupported claims of fraud in mail-in voting, leading directly to the Order.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"oPZv5JfH8j\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/28\/trump-twitter-executive-order-social-media\/\">Going to war with Twitter, Trump threatens critical social media legal protections<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Going to war with Twitter, Trump threatens critical social media legal protections&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/28\/trump-twitter-executive-order-social-media\/embed\/#?secret=oPZv5JfH8j\" data-secret=\"oPZv5JfH8j\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Starks gave his take on the topic in <a href=\"https:\/\/itif.org\/events\/2020\/06\/17\/fccs-role-reforming-section-230\">an interview with the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation<\/a>, a left-leaning think tank that pursues tech-related issues. While he is just one of five commissioners and the FCC has yet to consider the order in any official sense, his words have weight, as they indicate serious legal and procedural objections to it.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The Executive Order definitely gets one thing right, and that is that the President cannot instruct the FCC to do this or anything else,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;re an independent agency.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>He was careful to make clear that he doesn&#8217;t think the law is perfect \u2014 just that this method of changing it is completely unjustified.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The broader debate about section 230 long predates President Trump&#8217;s conflict with Twitter in particular, and there are so many smart people who believe the law here should be updated,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;But ultimately that debate belongs to Congress. That the president may find it more expedient to influence a 5-member commission than a 538-member Congress is not a sufficient reason, much less a good one, to circumvent the constitutional function of our democratically elected representatives.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The Justice Department has entered the picture as well, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.justice.gov\/opa\/pr\/justice-department-issues-recommendations-section-230-reform\">offering its own recommendations<\/a> for changing Section 230 today \u2014 though like the White House, Justice has no power to directly change or invent responsibilities for the FCC.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"lmPuNsMq6r\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/02\/trump-executive-order-lawsuit-cdt\/\">Trump&#8217;s executive order attacking social media companies faces its first legal challenge<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Trump&#8217;s executive order attacking social media companies faces its first legal challenge&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/02\/trump-executive-order-lawsuit-cdt\/embed\/#?secret=lmPuNsMq6r\" data-secret=\"lmPuNsMq6r\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Fellow Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel echoed his concerns, paraphrasing an earlier statement on the order: &#8220;Social media can be frustrating, but turning the FCC into the President\u2019s speech police is not the answer.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>After detailing some of the legal limitations of the FCC, Section 230, and the difficulty and needlessness of narrowly defining &#8220;good faith&#8221; actions, Starks concluded that the order simply doesn&#8217;t make a lot of sense in their context.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The first amendment allows social media companies to censor content freely in ways the government never could, and it prohibits the government from retaliating against them for that speech,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So much \u2014 <em>so<\/em> much \u2014 of what the president proposes here seems inconsistent with those core principles, making an FCC rulemaking even less desirable.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The worst case scenario, the one that burdens the proper functioning of our democracy, would be to allow the laxity here to bestow some type of credibility on the Executive Order, one that threatens certainly a new regulatory regime upon internet service providers with no credible legal support,&#8221; he continued.<\/p>\n<p>Having said that, he acknowledged that the order does mean that some action should take place at the FCC \u2014 it may just not be the kind of resolution Trump wishes.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m calling to press [the National Telecommunications Industry Association] to send the petition as quickly as possible. I see no reason why they should need more than 30 days from the Executive Order&#8217;s issuance itself so we can get on with it, have the FCC review it and vote,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And if, as I suspect it ultimately will, the petition fails at a legal question of authority, I think we should say it loud and clear, and close the book on this unfortunate detour. Let us avoid an upcoming election season can use a pending proceeding to, in my estimation, intimidate private parties.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>A lot of this is left to Chairman Ajit Pai, who has fairly consistently fallen in line with the administration&#8217;s wishes. And if the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fcc.gov\/document\/carr-welcomes-executive-order-online-censorship\">eagerness of Commissioner Carr<\/a> is any indicator, the Republican members of the Commission are happy to respond to the President&#8217;s &#8220;call for guidance.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>So far there has been no official announcement of FCC business relating to the Executive Order, but if the NTIA moves quickly we could hear about it as early as next month&#8217;s open meeting.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"cwI2YzJoOd\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/10\/social-media-platforms-must-protect-democracy-even-from-the-president\/\">Social media platforms must protect democracy, even from the president<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute;

The Hey iOS app was initially approved by Apple, but then put on pause &#8212; meaning Basecamp couldn&#8217;t submit any updates or bug fixes until it added an option for users to subscribe to Hey&#8217;s service through an in-app purchase.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>This decision on Apple&#8217;s part was met with shock, horror and outrage by Basecamp co-founder and Chief Technology Officer David Heinemeier Hansson and, to some extent, the broader iOS developer community.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Wow.

And when it does acquire a user, Apple wants it to hand over a commission no matter if the new user discovered the app for the first time on the App Store or somewhere else. (Like <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/16\/basecamp-launches-hey-a-hosted-email-service-for-neat-freaks\/\">a TechCrunch article<\/a>!)<\/p>\n<p>Apple argues its policies around the use of in-app purchases are not new. In fact, they&#8217;ve been in place since the first set of App Store Review Guidelines were published in September 2010, the company told TechCrunch when questioned about its decision.<\/p>\n<p>The section around in-app purchases was relocated to 3.X from 11.X in 2016, but today states that multi-platform apps can allow access to subscriptions provided elsewhere so long as in-app purchases are also offered with the iOS app. The rules also state that developers can&#8217;t <em>directly or indirectly<\/em> tell iOS users how to make a purchase outside the app. (Hey has a Help screen that says you can&#8217;t sign up in the app and &#8220;we know that&#8217;s a pain.&#8221;) The rules also say you can&#8217;t discourage the use of in-app purchases.<\/p>\n<p>In other words, Apple seems to argue, Basecamp should have known better.<\/p>\n<p>That argument would hold up if Apple enforced its rules uniformly, but it does not.<\/p>\n<p>As Apple observer <a href=\"https:\/\/daringfireball.net\/2020\/06\/hey_app_store_rejection_flimsiness\">John Gruber of Daring Fireball pointed out,<\/a> Apple makes a distinction between business services and consumer apps when enforcing in-app purchase policies. This has to do with how business software is often paid for &#8212; by the company, not the end user, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.protocol.com\/hey-email-app-store-rejection\">as a report by Protocol first noted<\/a>. That&#8217;s why Basecamp&#8217;s flagship service for businesses can be <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/dhh\/status\/1272977217115443200\">offered in the App Store without a subscription sign-up<\/a>, but its consumer app Hey cannot.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s a confusing distinction to make &#8212; and one not documented by Apple&#8217;s rules &#8212; as the line between software meant for business versus consumer use has long since been blurred. In fact, that blurring comes about, in part, because of the democratized access to business-grade software made possible through platforms like the Apple App Store.<\/p>\n<p>Business apps aren&#8217;t the only exception Apple makes.<\/p>\n<p>Apple also carves out exceptions for a type of apps it broadly refers to as &#8220;reader&#8221; apps, even though they aren&#8217;t necessarily about parsing the printed word.<\/p>\n<p>This set does include reading apps &#8212; like magazines, newspapers, and books. And it&#8217;s why the Kindle app lets you read your ebooks, but doesn&#8217;t tell you how to buy more or offer a way to do so in the app. The group has also expanded to include audio, music, video, access to professional databases, VoIP, cloud storage, and other approved services, like classroom management apps.<\/p>\n<p>Not surprisingly, this group of apps where Apple permits the companies to forgo the in-app purchase option (so long as they <em>never ever <\/em>mention how else to subscribe) are also among those with a direct competitor to an Apple paid service.<\/p>\n<p>For example, Spotify, which competes with Apple Music, is considered a &#8220;reader&#8221; app. The group also includes rivals to Apple TV+, iCloud, Podcasts, Classroom, Books, and others.<\/p>\n<p>Spotify has been among the most vocal about how Apple&#8217;s policy negatively impacts its business. Last year, it <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-tech-antitrust-apple-exclusive\/exclusive-antitrust-probers-in-congress-ask-spotify-to-detail-alleged-apple-abuses-sources-idUSKBN1WJ1Y3\">filed <\/a>an antitrust <a href=\"https:\/\/www.timetoplayfair.com\/\">complaint<\/a> against Apple in the E.U. That investigation is now <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_1073\">underway<\/a> which Spotify <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/16\/apple-pay-and-ios-app-store-under-formal-antitrust-probe-in-europe\/\">says<\/a> is great news for consumers.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Apple\u2019s anticompetitive behavior has intentionally disadvantaged competitors, created an unlevel playing field, and deprived consumers of meaningful choice for far too long,&#8221; Spotify&#8217;s statement read. &#8220;We welcome the European Commission\u2019s decision to formally investigate Apple, and hope they\u2019ll act with urgency to ensure fair competition on the iOS platform for all participants in the digital economy,&#8221; it added.<\/p>\n<p>But for the most part, only larger companies have been willing to stand up to Apple publicly on this front.<\/p>\n<p>Among these is Fortnite maker Epic Games, which wants to sell software through its own iOS app. Its CEO, Tim Sweeney, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/TimSweeneyEpic\/status\/1273088984139382784\">said<\/a> he wants all iOS developers to have the option to process payments directly and install software from any source, and won&#8217;t seek out any &#8220;special deal just for ourselves.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Here Apple speaks of a level playing field.

(The company, like many others, currently sells only from its website to avoid this fee.)<\/p>\n<p>Tinder parent Match has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.axios.com\/tinders-parent-company-criticizes-apple-over-app-store-b87d0735-5b6d-4d2a-8fa0-bc577a419c7e.html\">also released a lengthy statement <\/a>against Apple&#8217;s in-app purchase policy, saying it&#8217;s &#8220;acutely aware of [Apple&#8217;s] power over us.&#8221; Match also said it&#8217;s unfair how only digital service providers have to share revenue with Apple when others &#8212; like ride-share apps and social networking apps &#8212; do not.<\/p>\n<p>But many developers bite their tongue and play along with Apple&#8217;s rules out of fear. Stratechery founder Ben Thompson <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/benthompson\/status\/1273079296618201093\">posted to Twitter on Tuesday<\/a> how he&#8217;s hearing from a number of developers who claim Apple is refusing to update their app until they add an in-app purchase option for their SaaS (software as a service) business. It&#8217;s unclear, given these developers didn&#8217;t go on record, how many of their apps had been mistakenly approved by App Store reviewers in the first place.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, the line between Apple enforcing an existing policy it&#8217;s been lax on and a change in direction around enforcement of App Store policies has always been a gray area at best. (Remember how all of<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/01\/in-a-significant-change-apple-customers-can-now-buy-or-rent-titles-directly-in-the-prime-video-app\/\"> a sudden Amazon&#8217;s Prime Video app could rent and sell movies<\/a> once Apple had its own Apple TV+ app it wanted to distribute on Fire TV? And Apple said that fell under an existing policy &#8212; one that magically now included permission for Amazon?)<\/p>\n<p>In a third exception, Apple also turns a blind eye towards companies that incentivize users to pay for access to their upgraded features outside the App Store. For example, Google sells its YouTube Premium service for $11.99 per month via the web, but for $15.99 per month on the App Store to account for Apple&#8217;s commission. Apple allows this, despite its rule about about companies that discourage the use of in-app purchases. (Apparently, giving users a way to save nearly $50 per year by shopping outside the App Store doesn&#8217;t count as &#8220;discouraging&#8221; an in-app purchase?)<\/p>\n<p>The solution to this whole matter is tricky, of course.<\/p>\n<p>As much as developers want to sell directly to consumers without sharing a cut with Apple, it would be wrong to say that apps don&#8217;t benefit from Apple&#8217;s distribution platform. Would iOS apps ever have found as large an audience if they were all side-loaded bits of software instead of being organized, ranked, curated and featured in a built-in App Store?<\/p>\n<p>Plus, consumers want the convenience of making easy purchases inside an app with a payment card they keep on file. Amazon proved consumer demand for this with 1-click checkout, which allowed it to capture massive ecommerce market share over the years. In other words, take away the option to make purchases directly in iOS apps via Apple Pay and prepare for a consumer backlash.<\/p>\n<p>A better compromise would be a reduction in the cut that Apple takes. Today, Apple currently charges a 30% commission on subscriptions in year 1 which drops to 15% in year 2. These commissions are often for apps that have built sizable brands without Apple&#8217;s help &#8212; Spotify, YouTube, Pandora, Hulu, Netflix, Tinder, Fortnite, etc. These apps don&#8217;t need the App Store to be &#8220;discovered&#8221; by users or curated into &#8220;must&#8221; lists by App Store editors, they simply need to serve their existing users who happen to carry an iPhone.<\/p>\n<p>Apple may deserve to stick its hand in the pot to some extent for making apps easy to find, install and pay for, but it&#8217;s getting much harder to argue that 30% is the right price for such a system.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Apple this week is getting publicly dragged for digging in its heels over its right to take a cut of subscription-based transactions that flow through its App Store.

After a certain period of time, Swiftmile will only charge its customers\u2019 scooters.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Tortoise, which launched in October, does not make its own scooters. Instead, Tortoise sells its software to customers, which need to install about $100 worth of equipment on each scooter in order to run Tortoise\u2019s software. That includes two phone cameras, a piece of radar, a processor and a motor. If it\u2019s a two-wheeled vehicle, Tortoise requires the addition of robotic training wheels. All of this is included in the reference design Tortoise provides to operators.<\/p>\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Given the volume of micromobility operators in the space today, Tortoise aims to make it easier for these companies to more strategically deploy their respective vehicles and reposition them when needed. Using autonomous technology in tandem with remote human intervention, Tortoise\u2019s software enables operators to remotely relocate their scooters and bikes to places where riders need them, or, where operators need them to be recharged. On an empty sidewalk, Tortoise may employ autonomous technologies, while it may rely on humans to remotely control the vehicle on a highly trafficked city block.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/eL7NrxIYSEM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'><\/iframe><\/span><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Cities say they need 21st-century infrastructure,&#8221; Swiftmile CEO Colin Roche told TechCrunch. &#8220;This creates that where we have these hubs centered around Swiftmile and Tortoise can come and park and charge.

Shevelenko says he hopes to launch in partnership with Swiftmile in Peachtree Corners as soon as possible. Ideally, the first pilot will be this summer, he said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The technology is ready and the solutions work together,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We want cities to know this is available and the tech is ready and mature.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>After Peachtree Corners, Tortoise and Swiftmile have their eyes set on San Jose. Tortoise, however, is not yet disclosing its vehicle partner.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;But Swiftmile and Tortoise have the same set of customers, in general,&#8221; Shevelenko said. &#8220;The bulk of the Swiftmile business is selling directly to scooter operators and they&#8217;re our customer as well.

(It has more than 120,000 employees today; it had 53,000 in 2014.)<\/p>\n<p>Alphabet will also focus increasingly on creating &#8220;products and programs that help Black users in the moments that matter most,&#8221; writes Pichai. These could be interesting. Among the products in the pipeline is a way to give merchants in the U.S. the option of adding a opt-in \u201cBlack-owned\u201d business attribute to their business profile on Google to help people find and support Black-owned local businesses by using Search and Maps.<\/p>\n<p>As for some of the external commitments that Pichai just announced, the company says it has put together an increased financial package meant to support Black business owners, startup founders, and employees.<\/p>\n<p>While Alphabet last week announced a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/21288066\/youtube-black-creator-amplify-fund-initiative-ceo\">$100 million fund<\/a> tied to its YouTube subsidiary to amplify Black creators and artists, Pichai today revealed a new, separate, $175 million commitment that includes $50 million in financing and grants for small businesses and $100 million in funding participation in Black-led capital firms, startups and organizations supporting Black entrepreneurs.<\/p>\n<p>According to Pichai, this specifically includes increasing Alphabet&#8217;s investment in Plexo Capital, whose founder, Lo Toney, we <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/12\/if-you-want-to-see-more-people-of-color-in-vc-look-to-the-people-at-the-top-says-lo-toney\/\">interviewed last week<\/a>. (Asked for more information about this capital commitment, Toney tells us he &#8220;cannot comment at this time.&#8221;)<\/p>\n<p>Alphabet is also investing a smaller amount ($15 million) in job training through the National Urban League, among other partners, and $10 million to &#8220;help improve the Black community\u2019s access to education, equipment and economic opportunities in our developer ecosystem, and increase equity, representation and inclusion across our developer platforms, including Android, Chrome, Flutter, Firebase, Google Play and more.&#8221; (It isn&#8217;t clear from Pichai&#8217;s announcement how this will work.)<\/p>\n<p>These are, of course, small dollar amounts for one of the most powerful companies on the planet, and the efforts will invariably be seen by critics of the company&#8217;s extensive power (and balance sheet) as not going far enough.<\/p>\n<p>Indeed, though Pichai notes that Google.org this month pledged $12 million to advance criminal justice reform, he notes that the company had previously contributed $32 million to the cause over the previous five-year period, dating back to the 2015 Charleston shooting in which nine African Americans were killed during a Bible study.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s very possible that the programs to which it contributes can&#8217;t effectively absorb the capital faster, but nevertheless, it&#8217;s not a jaw-dropping amount to highlight. Consider that Netflix CEO Reed Hastings alone announced today that he and his wife will <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/news\/article-8432373\/Netflix-CEO-Reed-Hastings-donates-120-Million-historically-black-colleges-universities.html\">donate $120 million<\/a> to support scholarships at historically black colleges and universities, including Spelman College, Morehouse College and the United Negro College Fund.

In addition, the company needed to evaluate situations where up to 50% of personnel were impacted by a virus and unable to work, forcing others to pick up their internal functions and workload.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI honestly thought that it was going to be a waste of time,\u201d said Easter. \u201cI never imagined that we would have had to put our pandemic plan into action. But because we had a tested strategy already in place, we didn\u2019t miss a beat when COVID-19 struck.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In the months leading up to the initial test, Johnson Investment Counsel developed a work anywhere blueprint with their technology partner <a href=\"https:\/\/www.evolveip.net\/\">Evolve IP<\/a>. The plan covered a wide variety of integrated technologies including voice services, collaboration, virtual desktops, disaster recovery and remote office connectivity.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHaving a strategy where our work anywhere services were integrated together was one of the keys to our success,\u201d said Easter. \u201cWe manage about $13 billion in assets for clients across the United States and provide comprehensive wealth and investment management to individual and institutional investors. We have our own line of mutual funds, a state-chartered trust company, a proprietary charitable gift fund, with research analysts and traders covering both equity and fixed income markets. Duct taping one-off solutions wasn\u2019t going to cut it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Easter continued, \u201cIt was imperative that our advisors could communicate with clients, collaborate with each other and operate the business seamlessly. That included ensuring we could make real-time trades and provide all of our other client services.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Five months later, the novel coronavirus hit the United States and Johnson Investment Counsel\u2019s blueprint test got real.<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&#8220;I never imagined that we would have had to put our pandemic plan into action.

investment (ROI), return on ad spend (ROAS), net promoter score (NPS), brand affinity or one of the other sophisticated-sounding acronyms marketers use to gauge success.<\/p>\n<p>Your company&#8217;s one metric that matters should be long-term profitability.<\/p>\n<p>Put another way, your business should be singularly focused on how much money it can return to its owners, investors and shareholders. Sounds obvious, right?<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019d be surprised: A majority of Fortune 500 and Silicon Valley startup marketing budgets aren&#8217;t optimized for long-term profitability.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, budgets are often optimized for secondary or upper-funnel metrics. Besides tracking ROI, ROAS, NPS and brand affinity, many marketers monitor key performance indicators (KPI) like net revenue, customer acquisition cost (CAC), cost per thousand (CPM) and brand recall \u2014 none of which directly correlate with long-term profitability.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, many brands&#8217; marketing departments frequently omit the word &#8220;profit&#8221; all together from the line items and KPIs in their monthly performance reports.<\/p>\n<p>A good way to think about the futility of the KPI status quo is the following fictional scenario, which reflects the marketing and advertising playbooks of a shockingly large segment of American businesses: Main Street Shoes spends $100 on a Facebook ad campaign to promote a new line of sneakers to Jack and Andrew. As a result of the retailer&#8217;s Facebook ad campaign, Jack and Andrew each spend $100 to buy new sneakers.<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The majority of Fortune 500 and Silicon Valley startup marketing budgets aren&#8217;t optimized for long-term profitability.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":133574325,"featured_media":2004513,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"outcome":"","status":"","crunchbase_tag":0,"amp_status":"","relegenceEntities":[],"relegenceSubjects":[],"carmot_uuid":"21ec3060-7017-3dc4-bbdf-a37fde49b816"},"categories":[25515,576737633,576754164,576698407,20429,576633018],"tags":[145533,576605707,576639396,576697669,175,30787,13879],"crunchbase_tag":[],"tc_stories_tax":[],"tc_event":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/GettyImages-505897281.jpg","shortlink":"https:\/\/tcrn.ch\/2Yctxfo","rapidData":{"pt":"","pct":""},"featured":true,"subtitle":"It's time to change how you measure success","fundingRound":false,"seoTitle":"","seoDescription":"","premiumContent":true,"premiumCutoffPercent":0.32,"tc_cb_mapping":[],"associatedEvent":null,"event":null,"authors":[2003661],"hideFeaturedImage":false,"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2003664"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2003664"}],"version-history":[{"count":5,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2003664\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2003670,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2003664\/revisions\/2003670"}],"authors":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/guest-authors\/joe-yakuel"}],"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/edit":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-admin\/post.php?post=2003664&action=edit"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/tc\/v1\/users\/133574325"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2004513"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2003664"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2003664"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2003664"},{"taxonomy":"_tc_cb_tag_taxonomy","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/crunchbase_tag?post=2003664"},{"taxonomy":"tc_stories_tax","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_stories_tax?post=2003664"},{"taxonomy":"tc_event","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_event?post=2003664"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]},"_embedded":{"authors":[{"id":2003661,"name":"Joe Yakuel","link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/author\/joe-yakuel\/","description":"Joe Yakuel is the founder and CEO of <a href=\"https:\/\/within.co\/\">WITHIN<\/a>, the world's first performance branding company.","slug":"joe-yakuel","links":{"twitter":"WITHINco"},"position":"Contributor","cbDescription":"Joe Yakuel is the founder and CEO of <a href=\"https:\/\/within.co\/\">WITHIN<\/a>, the world's first performance branding company.","cbAvatar":"","twitter":"WITHINco"}],"author":[{"id":133574325,"name":"Walter Thompson","url":"https:\/\/anchor.fm\/thegoldencity","description":"Senior Editor Walter Thompson manages TechCrunch's guest post program and Extra Crunch, our premium content service.

that platforms like Facebook and YouTube aren&#8217;t liable for illegal content posted to them, as long as they are making efforts to take them down in accordance with the law.<\/p>\n<p>Some in government feel these protections go too far and have led to social media companies suppressing free speech. Trump himself clearly felt suppressed when Twitter <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/26\/twitter-trump-labels-fact-checking-tweet\/\">placed a fact-check warning<\/a> on unsupported claims of fraud in mail-in voting, leading directly to the Order.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"oPZv5JfH8j\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/28\/trump-twitter-executive-order-social-media\/\">Going to war with Twitter, Trump threatens critical social media legal protections<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Going to war with Twitter, Trump threatens critical social media legal protections&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/28\/trump-twitter-executive-order-social-media\/embed\/#?secret=oPZv5JfH8j\" data-secret=\"oPZv5JfH8j\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Starks gave his take on the topic in <a href=\"https:\/\/itif.org\/events\/2020\/06\/17\/fccs-role-reforming-section-230\">an interview with the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation<\/a>, a left-leaning think tank that pursues tech-related issues. While he is just one of five commissioners and the FCC has yet to consider the order in any official sense, his words have weight, as they indicate serious legal and procedural objections to it.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The Executive Order definitely gets one thing right, and that is that the President cannot instruct the FCC to do this or anything else,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;re an independent agency.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>He was careful to make clear that he doesn&#8217;t think the law is perfect \u2014 just that this method of changing it is completely unjustified.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The broader debate about section 230 long predates President Trump&#8217;s conflict with Twitter in particular, and there are so many smart people who believe the law here should be updated,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;But ultimately that debate belongs to Congress. That the president may find it more expedient to influence a 5-member commission than a 538-member Congress is not a sufficient reason, much less a good one, to circumvent the constitutional function of our democratically elected representatives.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The Justice Department has entered the picture as well, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.justice.gov\/opa\/pr\/justice-department-issues-recommendations-section-230-reform\">offering its own recommendations<\/a> for changing Section 230 today \u2014 though like the White House, Justice has no power to directly change or invent responsibilities for the FCC.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"lmPuNsMq6r\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/02\/trump-executive-order-lawsuit-cdt\/\">Trump&#8217;s executive order attacking social media companies faces its first legal challenge<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Trump&#8217;s executive order attacking social media companies faces its first legal challenge&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/02\/trump-executive-order-lawsuit-cdt\/embed\/#?secret=lmPuNsMq6r\" data-secret=\"lmPuNsMq6r\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Fellow Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel echoed his concerns, paraphrasing an earlier statement on the order: &#8220;Social media can be frustrating, but turning the FCC into the President\u2019s speech police is not the answer.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>After detailing some of the legal limitations of the FCC, Section 230, and the difficulty and needlessness of narrowly defining &#8220;good faith&#8221; actions, Starks concluded that the order simply doesn&#8217;t make a lot of sense in their context.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The first amendment allows social media companies to censor content freely in ways the government never could, and it prohibits the government from retaliating against them for that speech,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So much \u2014 <em>so<\/em> much \u2014 of what the president proposes here seems inconsistent with those core principles, making an FCC rulemaking even less desirable.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The worst case scenario, the one that burdens the proper functioning of our democracy, would be to allow the laxity here to bestow some type of credibility on the Executive Order, one that threatens certainly a new regulatory regime upon internet service providers with no credible legal support,&#8221; he continued.<\/p>\n<p>Having said that, he acknowledged that the order does mean that some action should take place at the FCC \u2014 it may just not be the kind of resolution Trump wishes.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m calling to press [the National Telecommunications Industry Association] to send the petition as quickly as possible. I see no reason why they should need more than 30 days from the Executive Order&#8217;s issuance itself so we can get on with it, have the FCC review it and vote,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And if, as I suspect it ultimately will, the petition fails at a legal question of authority, I think we should say it loud and clear, and close the book on this unfortunate detour. Let us avoid an upcoming election season can use a pending proceeding to, in my estimation, intimidate private parties.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>A lot of this is left to Chairman Ajit Pai, who has fairly consistently fallen in line with the administration&#8217;s wishes. And if the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fcc.gov\/document\/carr-welcomes-executive-order-online-censorship\">eagerness of Commissioner Carr<\/a> is any indicator, the Republican members of the Commission are happy to respond to the President&#8217;s &#8220;call for guidance.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>So far there has been no official announcement of FCC business relating to the Executive Order, but if the NTIA moves quickly we could hear about it as early as next month&#8217;s open meeting.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"cwI2YzJoOd\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/10\/social-media-platforms-must-protect-democracy-even-from-the-president\/\">Social media platforms must protect democracy, even from the president<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute;

The Hey iOS app was initially approved by Apple, but then put on pause &#8212; meaning Basecamp couldn&#8217;t submit any updates or bug fixes until it added an option for users to subscribe to Hey&#8217;s service through an in-app purchase.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>This decision on Apple&#8217;s part was met with shock, horror and outrage by Basecamp co-founder and Chief Technology Officer David Heinemeier Hansson and, to some extent, the broader iOS developer community.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Wow.

And when it does acquire a user, Apple wants it to hand over a commission no matter if the new user discovered the app for the first time on the App Store or somewhere else. (Like <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/16\/basecamp-launches-hey-a-hosted-email-service-for-neat-freaks\/\">a TechCrunch article<\/a>!)<\/p>\n<p>Apple argues its policies around the use of in-app purchases are not new. In fact, they&#8217;ve been in place since the first set of App Store Review Guidelines were published in September 2010, the company told TechCrunch when questioned about its decision.<\/p>\n<p>The section around in-app purchases was relocated to 3.X from 11.X in 2016, but today states that multi-platform apps can allow access to subscriptions provided elsewhere so long as in-app purchases are also offered with the iOS app. The rules also state that developers can&#8217;t <em>directly or indirectly<\/em> tell iOS users how to make a purchase outside the app. (Hey has a Help screen that says you can&#8217;t sign up in the app and &#8220;we know that&#8217;s a pain.&#8221;) The rules also say you can&#8217;t discourage the use of in-app purchases.<\/p>\n<p>In other words, Apple seems to argue, Basecamp should have known better.<\/p>\n<p>That argument would hold up if Apple enforced its rules uniformly, but it does not.<\/p>\n<p>As Apple observer <a href=\"https:\/\/daringfireball.net\/2020\/06\/hey_app_store_rejection_flimsiness\">John Gruber of Daring Fireball pointed out,<\/a> Apple makes a distinction between business services and consumer apps when enforcing in-app purchase policies. This has to do with how business software is often paid for &#8212; by the company, not the end user, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.protocol.com\/hey-email-app-store-rejection\">as a report by Protocol first noted<\/a>. That&#8217;s why Basecamp&#8217;s flagship service for businesses can be <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/dhh\/status\/1272977217115443200\">offered in the App Store without a subscription sign-up<\/a>, but its consumer app Hey cannot.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s a confusing distinction to make &#8212; and one not documented by Apple&#8217;s rules &#8212; as the line between software meant for business versus consumer use has long since been blurred. In fact, that blurring comes about, in part, because of the democratized access to business-grade software made possible through platforms like the Apple App Store.<\/p>\n<p>Business apps aren&#8217;t the only exception Apple makes.<\/p>\n<p>Apple also carves out exceptions for a type of apps it broadly refers to as &#8220;reader&#8221; apps, even though they aren&#8217;t necessarily about parsing the printed word.<\/p>\n<p>This set does include reading apps &#8212; like magazines, newspapers, and books. And it&#8217;s why the Kindle app lets you read your ebooks, but doesn&#8217;t tell you how to buy more or offer a way to do so in the app. The group has also expanded to include audio, music, video, access to professional databases, VoIP, cloud storage, and other approved services, like classroom management apps.<\/p>\n<p>Not surprisingly, this group of apps where Apple permits the companies to forgo the in-app purchase option (so long as they <em>never ever <\/em>mention how else to subscribe) are also among those with a direct competitor to an Apple paid service.<\/p>\n<p>For example, Spotify, which competes with Apple Music, is considered a &#8220;reader&#8221; app. The group also includes rivals to Apple TV+, iCloud, Podcasts, Classroom, Books, and others.<\/p>\n<p>Spotify has been among the most vocal about how Apple&#8217;s policy negatively impacts its business. Last year, it <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-tech-antitrust-apple-exclusive\/exclusive-antitrust-probers-in-congress-ask-spotify-to-detail-alleged-apple-abuses-sources-idUSKBN1WJ1Y3\">filed <\/a>an antitrust <a href=\"https:\/\/www.timetoplayfair.com\/\">complaint<\/a> against Apple in the E.U. That investigation is now <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_1073\">underway<\/a> which Spotify <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/16\/apple-pay-and-ios-app-store-under-formal-antitrust-probe-in-europe\/\">says<\/a> is great news for consumers.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Apple\u2019s anticompetitive behavior has intentionally disadvantaged competitors, created an unlevel playing field, and deprived consumers of meaningful choice for far too long,&#8221; Spotify&#8217;s statement read. &#8220;We welcome the European Commission\u2019s decision to formally investigate Apple, and hope they\u2019ll act with urgency to ensure fair competition on the iOS platform for all participants in the digital economy,&#8221; it added.<\/p>\n<p>But for the most part, only larger companies have been willing to stand up to Apple publicly on this front.<\/p>\n<p>Among these is Fortnite maker Epic Games, which wants to sell software through its own iOS app. Its CEO, Tim Sweeney, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/TimSweeneyEpic\/status\/1273088984139382784\">said<\/a> he wants all iOS developers to have the option to process payments directly and install software from any source, and won&#8217;t seek out any &#8220;special deal just for ourselves.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Here Apple speaks of a level playing field.

Stratechery founder Ben Thompson <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/benthompson\/status\/1273079296618201093\">posted to Twitter on Tuesday<\/a> how he&#8217;s hearing from a number of developers who claim Apple is refusing to update their app until they add an in-app purchase option for their SaaS (software as a service) business. It&#8217;s unclear, given these developers didn&#8217;t go on record, how many of their apps had been mistakenly approved by App Store reviewers in the first place.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, the line between Apple enforcing an existing policy it&#8217;s been lax on and a change in direction around enforcement of App Store policies has always been a gray area at best. (Remember how all of<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/01\/in-a-significant-change-apple-customers-can-now-buy-or-rent-titles-directly-in-the-prime-video-app\/\"> a sudden Amazon&#8217;s Prime Video app could rent and sell movies<\/a> once Apple had its own Apple TV+ app it wanted to distribute on Fire TV? And Apple said that fell under an existing policy &#8212; one that magically now included permission for Amazon?)<\/p>\n<p>In a third exception, Apple also turns a blind eye towards companies that incentivize users to pay for access to their upgraded features outside the App Store. For example, Google sells its YouTube Premium service for $11.99 per month via the web, but for $15.99 per month on the App Store to account for Apple&#8217;s commission. Apple allows this, despite its rule about about companies that discourage the use of in-app purchases. (Apparently, giving users a way to save nearly $50 per year by shopping outside the App Store doesn&#8217;t count as &#8220;discouraging&#8221; an in-app purchase?)<\/p>\n<p>The solution to this whole matter is tricky, of course.<\/p>\n<p>As much as developers want to sell directly to consumers without sharing a cut with Apple, it would be wrong to say that apps don&#8217;t benefit from Apple&#8217;s distribution platform. Would iOS apps ever have found as large an audience if they were all side-loaded bits of software instead of being organized, ranked, curated and featured in a built-in App Store?<\/p>\n<p>Plus, consumers want the convenience of making easy purchases inside an app with a payment card they keep on file. Amazon proved consumer demand for this with 1-click checkout, which allowed it to capture massive ecommerce market share over the years. In other words, take away the option to make purchases directly in iOS apps via Apple Pay and prepare for a consumer backlash.<\/p>\n<p>A better compromise would be a reduction in the cut that Apple takes. Today, Apple currently charges a 30% commission on subscriptions in year 1 which drops to 15% in year 2. These commissions are often for apps that have built sizable brands without Apple&#8217;s help &#8212; Spotify, YouTube, Pandora, Hulu, Netflix, Tinder, Fortnite, etc. These apps don&#8217;t need the App Store to be &#8220;discovered&#8221; by users or curated into &#8220;must&#8221; lists by App Store editors, they simply need to serve their existing users who happen to carry an iPhone.<\/p>\n<p>Apple may deserve to stick its hand in the pot to some extent for making apps easy to find, install and pay for, but it&#8217;s getting much harder to argue that 30% is the right price for such a system.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Apple this week is getting publicly dragged for digging in its heels over its right to take a cut of subscription-based transactions that flow through its App Store.

color are systematically discriminated against, companies whose future depends on their ability to address their own role in this entrenched societal issue are taking some action.<\/p>\n<p>For its part, following weeks of protests around the U.S. and world to defeat racism, Alphabet just announced a number of related promises as part of its commitment to &#8220;translating the energy of this moment into lasting, meaningful change.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Some of these are softer than others &#8212; some are internal while others are external &#8212; but they&#8217;re collectively designed to pack a punch.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Among the most notable of these new commitments is a stated goal of improving leadership representation of underrepresented groups within the corporate colossus to 30 percent by 2025. Toward that end, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.blog.google\/inside-google\/company-announcements\/commitments-racial-equity\/\">writes Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai<\/a>, Google will &#8220;post senior leadership roles externally as well as internally, and increase our investments in places such as Atlanta, Washington DC, Chicago, and London, where we already have offices. We&#8217;ll take the same approach across regions . . . and hire more underrepresented Googlers in communities where the social infrastructure already supports a sense of belonging and contributes to a better quality of life.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Alphabet is also promising to &#8220;do more to address representation challenges and focus on hiring, retention, and promotion at all levels,&#8221; including via a &#8220;new talent liaison within each product and functional area to mentor and advocate for the progression and retention of Googlers from underrepresented groups.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Whether this placates Googlers would be interesting to know, given the pressure that the company has been under for years to diversify &#8212; and the seemingly sluggish pace at which it has moved on this front.<\/p>\n<p>According to Google&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/kstatic.googleusercontent.com\/files\/25badfc6b6d1b33f3b87372ff7545d79261520d821e6ee9a82c4ab2de42a01216be2156bc5a60ae3337ffe7176d90b8b2b3000891ac6e516a650ecebf0e3f866\">most recent diversity report<\/a>, 67.5% of its employees are male, which is down only so slightly from the 69.3% of men who made up the company in 2014. Meanwhile, just 3.5% of its tech employees are Black, compared with 2% in 2014. (It has more than 120,000 employees today; it had 53,000 in 2014.)<\/p>\n<p>Alphabet will also focus increasingly on creating &#8220;products and programs that help Black users in the moments that matter most,&#8221; writes Pichai. These could be interesting. Among the products in the pipeline is a way to give merchants in the U.S. the option of adding a opt-in \u201cBlack-owned\u201d business attribute to their business profile on Google to help people find and support Black-owned local businesses by using Search and Maps.<\/p>\n<p>As for some of the external commitments that Pichai just announced, the company says it has put together an increased financial package meant to support Black business owners, startup founders, and employees.<\/p>\n<p>While Alphabet last week announced a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/21288066\/youtube-black-creator-amplify-fund-initiative-ceo\">$100 million fund<\/a> tied to its YouTube subsidiary to amplify Black creators and artists, Pichai today revealed a new, separate, $175 million commitment that includes $50 million in financing and grants for small businesses and $100 million in funding participation in Black-led capital firms, startups and organizations supporting Black entrepreneurs.<\/p>\n<p>According to Pichai, this specifically includes increasing Alphabet&#8217;s investment in Plexo Capital, whose founder, Lo Toney, we <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/12\/if-you-want-to-see-more-people-of-color-in-vc-look-to-the-people-at-the-top-says-lo-toney\/\">interviewed last week<\/a>. (Asked for more information about this capital commitment, Toney tells us he &#8220;cannot comment at this time.&#8221;)<\/p>\n<p>Alphabet is also investing a smaller amount ($15 million) in job training through the National Urban League, among other partners, and $10 million to &#8220;help improve the Black community\u2019s access to education, equipment and economic opportunities in our developer ecosystem, and increase equity, representation and inclusion across our developer platforms, including Android, Chrome, Flutter, Firebase, Google Play and more.&#8221; (It isn&#8217;t clear from Pichai&#8217;s announcement how this will work.)<\/p>\n<p>These are, of course, small dollar amounts for one of the most powerful companies on the planet, and the efforts will invariably be seen by critics of the company&#8217;s extensive power (and balance sheet) as not going far enough.<\/p>\n<p>Indeed, though Pichai notes that Google.org this month pledged $12 million to advance criminal justice reform, he notes that the company had previously contributed $32 million to the cause over the previous five-year period, dating back to the 2015 Charleston shooting in which nine African Americans were killed during a Bible study.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s very possible that the programs to which it contributes can&#8217;t effectively absorb the capital faster, but nevertheless, it&#8217;s not a jaw-dropping amount to highlight.

But now you can Tweet your voice!<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Rolling out today on iOS, you can now record and Tweet with audio. <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/jezRmh1dkD\">pic.twitter.com\/jezRmh1dkD<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&mdash; Twitter (@Twitter) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Twitter\/status\/1273306563994845185?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 17, 2020<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;Over the years, photos, videos, gifs, and extra characters have allowed you to add your own flair and personality to your conversations,&#8221; a <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.twitter.com\/en_us\/topics\/product\/2020\/your-tweet-your-voice.html\">blog post<\/a> from Twitter announcing the feature reads. &#8220;But sometimes 280 characters aren\u2019t enough and some conversational nuances are lost in translation. So starting today, we\u2019re testing a new feature that will add a more human touch to the way we use Twitter \u2013 your very own voice.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Twitter&#8217;s brevity has always been a ceiling that the social network has seemed to push up against with new products. In 2017, the company announced it was expanding the limits on tweets from 140 to 280 characters. This feature potentially allows for much longer thoughts to be shared on the service, limiting audio clips to 140 seconds. For users chatting away when the limit is reached, instead of being cut off, a new tweet will be threaded beneath the original, allowing the thoughts to continue pouring out.<\/p>\n<p>The limit is still an interesting one, indicating that Twitter isn&#8217;t racing to turn into a podcast platform, but is instead hoping this feature can enable a new type of communication that fits into the existing conversation flows.<\/p>\n<p>One thing that&#8217;s certainly an open question is how audio tweets will add to Twitter&#8217;s abuse problem. Twitter has plenty of challenges when it comes to flagging harassment among text-only tweets, which are much easier to auto-flag with machine learning tools. Decoding abuse in audio snippets is a much taller order for these systems. Furthermore, scrubbing through content that&#8217;s been reported manually is going to be more time-consuming for content moderators.<\/p>\n<p>Audio has been a rolling trend in social networking. Over the past couple of years, podcasts have become a hotter space with companies like Spotify investing heavily in startups and content acquisition. Recently, investors in Silicon Valley raced to fund Clubhouse, an audio-based social network that has gathered a lot of attention over the past several months.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"bG1TjP4Spa\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/18\/clubhouse-app-chat-rooms\/\">Clubhouse voice chat leads a wave of spontaneous social apps<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Clubhouse voice chat leads a wave of spontaneous social apps&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/18\/clubhouse-app-chat-rooms\/embed\/#?secret=bG1TjP4Spa\" data-secret=\"bG1TjP4Spa\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Twitter is rolling out to its platform a new type of tweet &#8212; audio tweets &#8212; allowing users to share thoughts in audio form inside their feeds.

Zoom says this is because it limits some meeting functionality (&#8220;such as the ability to include traditional PSTN phone lines or SIP\/H.323 hardware conference room systems&#8221;).<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Hosts will toggle E2EE on or off on a per-meeting basis,&#8221; it further notes, adding that account administrators will also have the ability to enable and disable E2EE at the account and group level.<\/p>\n<p>Today the company also released a v2 update of its e2e encryption design &#8212; posting the spec to <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/zoom\/zoom-e2e-whitepaper\">Github<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In a major security U-turn, videoconferencing platform Zoom has said it will, after all, offer end-to-end encryption to all users &#8212; including those who do not pay to use its service.

further noting that Bose would no longer be working on third-party developer apps and would halt support for them in mid-July:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Bose AR didn&#8217;t become what we envisioned&#8230; It&#8217;s not the first time our technology couldn&#8217;t be commercialized the way we planned, but components of it will be used to help Bose owners in a different way. We&#8217;re good with that. Because our research is for them, not us.<\/p><\/blockquote><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to Bose for comment.<\/p>\n<p>In 2018, Bose launched their AR program at SXSW, while also debuting a prototype pair of sunglasses with embedded microphones and bone conduction audio built into the frames. The company envisioned a persistent technology that could give audio notifications and feedback based on what a user was doing or where they were. They launched a $50 million fund at the time, dedicated to investing in startups that would build on its platform. The company invested in a number of startups, though it&#8217;s unclear how much of that $50 million fund they invested in the past couple of years.<\/p>\n<p>The company&#8217;s developer initiative hadn&#8217;t been taking on new developer partners since April, so perhaps the writing was on the wall for the program. Nevertheless, for developers interested in how digital tools can augment their senses, it hasn&#8217;t been a great couple of years for platform support. Bose was the most high-profile of efforts to create a dedicated audio AR platform, but visual AR platforms have been folding left and right over the past two years, with entrants like ODG, Meta and Daqri all closing up shop for asset sales. <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/magic-leap\/\">Magic Leap<\/a> has been having its own challenging year, announcing major layoffs earlier this year and a pivot from consumer to enterprise.<\/p>\n<p>Bose isn&#8217;t the first company to pitch a tent in the audio AR space &#8212; Doppler Labs was an early entrant in the space that later shut down, though they notably filed a lawsuit against Bose accusing them of stealing some of their AR audio tech. For Bose, their platform was always facing an uphill battle. They operated the hardware, but only the output device, leaving themselves in a position dependent on the whims and fancies of iOS and Android.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"WcMi3QwaV5\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/11\/01\/smart-earbuds-startup-doppler-labs-shuts-down-after-raising-50m\/\">Smart earbuds startup Doppler Labs shuts down after raising $50M+<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Smart earbuds startup Doppler Labs shuts down after raising $50M+&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/11\/01\/smart-earbuds-startup-doppler-labs-shuts-down-after-raising-50m\/embed\/#?secret=WcMi3QwaV5\" data-secret=\"WcMi3QwaV5\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Headphone-maker Bose is calling it quits on their Bose AR platform play, noting that they&#8217;ll be winding down support for third-party developers on their platform next month.

Security is not just code, however \u2014 it\u2019s also people, operational procedures, and life cycle management of applications.<\/p>\n<p>There is no single answer to any of these vulnerabilities, Steiner says. Instead, mitigation relies on a range of measures that are not perfect but can be used to create an overall system that is very difficult to penetrate. The key is to understand that crypto development is not like agile software development \u2014 once deployed, code is difficult to recall, and security must always be at the forefront.<\/p>\n<p>She closes by noting that crypto developers can learn from security approaches used in other industries, such as aerospace, medicine, and hardware.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/bI45YonLK0Q?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'><\/iframe><\/span><\/p>\n<p>In the second video, Nitya Subramanian, product manager at Celo, discusses \u201cProtocols and Products,\u201d focusing on how building products is different in blockchain versus more traditional centralized products.

the end user, the rigorous focus at all times should be on what will bring people to your product and avoiding a \u201cbuild it and they will come\u201d mentality.<\/p>\n<p>As an example of the full stack approach, she closes with a case study of the digital payments system Celo, which includes a blockchain forked from Ethereum that includes a native asset, topped by a layer of native smart contracts encoding a stablecoin, with a wallet and a developer SDK at the top of the stack.<\/p>\n<p>While each layer of the project has separate development roadmaps, having the application layer allows Celo to identify issues with user experience and informs the development of lower layers of the stack.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video\"

Today, Swiftmile and Tortoise announced a partnership to solve those problems.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These are incredibly complementary services,&#8221; Tortoise co-founder and president Dmitry Shevelenko told TechCrunch. &#8220;Swiftmile provides the ideal destination and origin for repositioning. So riders can have the experience that dockless enables, they can leave the scooter wherever their destination is and using Tortoise, can drive to the nearest Swiftmile station to dock and charge.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Swiftmile has already deployed hundreds of its charging stations in cities like Austin and Berlin. Later this month, Swiftmile will deploy a Spin-branded dock in San Francisco. Swiftmile charges scooter operators by the minute, but not to exceed a certain amount, depending on the market. Initially, the docking system will be open to all operators in order to show them how it works and how beneficial it can be. After a certain period of time, Swiftmile will only charge its customers\u2019 scooters.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Tortoise, which launched in October, does not make its own scooters. Instead, Tortoise sells its software to customers, which need to install about $100 worth of equipment on each scooter in order to run Tortoise\u2019s software. That includes two phone cameras, a piece of radar, a processor and a motor. If it\u2019s a two-wheeled vehicle, Tortoise requires the addition of robotic training wheels. All of this is included in the reference design Tortoise provides to operators.<\/p>\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Given the volume of micromobility operators in the space today, Tortoise aims to make it easier for these companies to more strategically deploy their respective vehicles and reposition them when needed. Using autonomous technology in tandem with remote human intervention, Tortoise\u2019s software enables operators to remotely relocate their scooters and bikes to places where riders need them, or, where operators need them to be recharged. On an empty sidewalk, Tortoise may employ autonomous technologies, while it may rely on humans to remotely control the vehicle on a highly trafficked city block.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/eL7NrxIYSEM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'><\/iframe><\/span><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Cities say they need 21st-century infrastructure,&#8221; Swiftmile CEO Colin Roche told TechCrunch. &#8220;This creates that where we have these hubs centered around Swiftmile and Tortoise can come and park and charge.

Shevelenko says he hopes to launch in partnership with Swiftmile in Peachtree Corners as soon as possible. Ideally, the first pilot will be this summer, he said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The technology is ready and the solutions work together,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We want cities to know this is available and the tech is ready and mature.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>After Peachtree Corners, Tortoise and Swiftmile have their eyes set on San Jose. Tortoise, however, is not yet disclosing its vehicle partner.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;But Swiftmile and Tortoise have the same set of customers, in general,&#8221; Shevelenko said. &#8220;The bulk of the Swiftmile business is selling directly to scooter operators and they&#8217;re our customer as well.

venture capital firm. \t<\/div>\n\t\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><p id=\"speakable-summary\">As I was wrapping up a Zoom meeting with my business partners, I could hear my son joking with his classmates in his online chemistry class.<\/p>\n<p>I have to say this is a very strange time for me: As much as I love my family, in normal times, we never spend this much time together. But these aren\u2019t normal times.<\/p>\n<p>In normal times, governments, businesses and schools would never agree to shut everything down. In normal times, my doctor wouldn&#8217;t agree to see me over video conferencing.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>No one would stand outside a grocery store, looking down to make sure they were six feet apart from one another. In times like these, decisions that would normally take years are being made in a matter of hours. In short, the physical world \u2014 brick-and-mortar reality\u2014 has shut down. The world still functions, but now it is operating inside everyone\u2019s own home.<\/p>\n<p>This not-so-normal time reminds me of 2008, the depths of the financial crisis. I sold my company BEA Systems, which I co-founded, to Oracle for $8.6 billion in cash. This liquidity event was simultaneously the worst and most exhausting time of my career, and the best time of my career, thanks to the many inspiring entrepreneurs I was able to meet.<\/p>\n<p>These were some of the brightest, hardworking, never-take-no-for-an-answer founders, and in this era, many CEOs showed their true colors. That was when Slack, Lyft, Uber, Credit Karma, Twilio, Square, Cloudera and many others got started. All of these companies now have multibillion dollar market caps. And I got to invest and partner with some of them.<\/p>\n<p>Once again, I can\u2019t help but wonder what our world will look like in 10 years. The way we live. The way we learn. The way we consume. The way we will interact with each other.<\/p>\n<h2>What will happen 10 years from now?<\/h2>\n<p>Welcome to 2030. It&#8217;s been more than two decades since the invention of the iPhone, the launch of cloud computing and one decade since the launch of widespread 5G networks. All of the technologies required to change the way we live, work, eat and play are finally here and can be distributed at an unprecedented speed.<\/p>\n<p>The global population is 8.5 billion and everyone owns a smartphone with all of their daily apps running on it. That\u2019s up from around 500 million two decades ago.<\/p>\n<p>Robust internet access and communication platforms have created a new world.<\/p>\n<p>The world\u2019s largest school is a software company \u2014 its learning engine uses artificial intelligence to provide personalized learning materials anytime, anywhere, with no physical space necessary. Similar to how Apple upended the music industry with iTunes, all students can now download any information for a super-low price. Tuition fees have dropped significantly: There are no more student debts. Kids can finally focus on learning, not just getting an education. Access to a good education has been equalized.<\/p>\n<p>The world&#8217;s largest bank is a software company and all financial transactions are digital. If you want to talk to a banker live, you&#8217;ll initiate a text or video conference. On top of that, embedded fintech software now powers all industries.<\/p>\n<p>No more dirty physical money. All money flow is stored, traceable and secured on a blockchain ledger. The financial infrastructure platforms are able to handle customers across all geographies and jurisdictions, all exchanges of value, all types of use-cases (producers, distributors, consumers) and all from the start.<\/p>\n<p>The world\u2019s largest grocery store is a software and robotics company \u2014 groceries are delivered whenever and wherever we want as fast as possible. Food is delivered via robot or drones with no human involvement. Customers can track where, when and who is involved in growing and handling my food. Artificial intelligence tells us what we need based on past purchases and our calendars.<\/p>\n<p>The world largest hospital is a software and robotics company \u2014 all initial diagnoses are performed via video conferencing. Combined with patient medical records all digitally stored, a doctor in San Francisco and her artificial intelligence assistant can provide personalized prescriptions to her patients in Hong Kong. All surgical procedures are performed by robots, with supervision by a doctor of course, we haven\u2019t gone completely crazy. And even the doctors get to work from home.<\/p>\n<p>Our entire workforce works from home: Don\u2019t forget the main purpose of an office is to support companies\u2019 workers in performing their jobs efficiently. Since 2020, all companies, and especially their CEOs, realized it was more efficient to let their workers work from home. Not only can they save hours of commute time, all companies get to save money on office space and shift resources toward employee benefits. I\u2019m looking back 10 years and saying to myself, &#8220;I still remember those days when office space was a thing.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The world\u2019s largest entertainment company is a software company, and all the content we love is digital. All blockbuster movies are released direct-to-video. We can ask Alexa to deliver popcorn to the house and even watch the film with friends who are far away. If you see something you like in the movie, you can buy it immediately \u2014 clothing, objects, whatever you see \u2014 and have it delivered right to your house. No more standing in line. No transport time. Reduced pollution. Better planet!<\/p>\n<p>These are just a few industries that have been completely transformed by 2030, but these changes\u00a0<span style=\"letter-spacing: -0.1px; font-size: 1.125rem;\">will <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">apply universally to almost anything. We were told software was eating the world.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The saying goes you are what you eat. In 2030, software is the world.<\/p>\n<p>Security and protection no longer just applies to things we can touch and see. What\u2019s valuable for each and every one of us is all stored digitally \u2014 our email account, chat history, browsing data and social media accounts. It goes on and on. We don\u2019t need a house alarm, we need a digital alarm.<\/p>\n<p>Even though this crisis makes the near future seem bleak, I am optimistic about the new world and the new companies of tomorrow. I am even more excited about our ability to change as a human race and how this crisis and technology are speeding up the way we live.<\/p>\n<p>This storm shall pass. However the choices we make now will change our lives forever.<\/p>\n<p>My team and I are proud to build and invest in companies that will help shape the new world; new and impactful technologies that are important for many generations to come, companies that matter to humanity, something that we can all tell our grandchildren about.<\/p>\n<p>I am hopeful.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This storm shall pass.

That is, instead of having to click through in-app pop-ups and read the fine print inside an app, consumers can choose to buy an app&#8217;s subscription directly from its Play Store listing page &#8212; even if they don&#8217;t yet have the app installed.<\/p>\n<p>Google vaguely announced the change in <a href=\"https:\/\/android-developers.googleblog.com\/2020\/06\/meet-google-play-billing-library.html\">a blog post<\/a>, but didn&#8217;t offer concrete details as to how this feature worked, instead describing it only as a way for users &#8220;to discover and purchase items outside your app.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The functionality is being made available through the Android Billing Library version 3, which Google recently introduced. The new library can power a subscription promo code redemption experience, where users can redeem free trials before the app is installed. And it allows consumers to resubscribe to subscriptions they used to pay for from the Google Play subscriptions center.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>But the most notable part of the update is how it allows developers to sell subscriptions directly on their app&#8217;s details page. Now, next to the app&#8217;s &#8220;Install&#8221; button, consumers will be able to instead choose to click a separate button to purchase the app&#8217;s subscription and even its free trial.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"vertical aligncenter size-large wp-image-2004741\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/trucaller-subscription-android.png?w=322\" alt=\"\" width=\"322\" height=\"680\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/trucaller-subscription-android.png 1440w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/trucaller-subscription-android.png?resize=71,150 71w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/trucaller-subscription-android.png?resize=142,300 142w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/trucaller-subscription-android.png?resize=768,1621 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/trucaller-subscription-android.png?resize=322,680 322w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/trucaller-subscription-android.png?resize=728,1536 728w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/trucaller-subscription-android.png?resize=970,2048 970w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/trucaller-subscription-android.png?resize=24,50 24w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 322px) 100vw, 322px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In an example, the robocall-blocking app Truecaller shows a button next to &#8220;Install&#8221; which reads, instead, &#8220;Free trial &amp; Install.&#8221; Beneath this, a window provides all the details about the app&#8217;s subscription, including the free trial length, the cost when the trial ends, and what the subscription offers, in terms of feature set.<\/p>\n<p>This more transparent marketing option benefits consumers and developers alike.<\/p>\n<p>Today, too many consumers are still being duped by tricky subscriptions that don&#8217;t play by app store guidelines. The problem isn&#8217;t unique to Android apps, unfortunately. A report from security firm Sophos found that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.zdnet.com\/article\/fleeceware-apps-discovered-on-the-ios-app-store\/\">more than 3.5 million iOS users have installed fleeceware<\/a> apps from Apple&#8217;s App Store, for example.<\/p>\n<p>Google, for its part,<a href=\"https:\/\/android-developers.googleblog.com\/2020\/04\/building-user-trust-through-more.html\">\u00a0introduced a new set of Play Store policies<\/a> in April with the goal of ensuring that users are able to understand the terms of the subscription offer, the free trial period and how they can cancel the subscription, if desired. The updated policy bans things like hidden terms, unclear billing frequencies, and hidden pricing.<\/p>\n<p>This new feature offering a separate button just for subscriptions could give users another way to learn about the app&#8217;s pricing and feature set before making a commitment to download the app.<\/p>\n<p>This, in turn, could help reduce user churn &#8212; as fewer users would drop out of the app once they realize the features they needed were only offered as a paid option. It could also help developers attract more valuable paid subscribers by allowing potential users an easy way to compare their subscription pricing with competitors, while additionally reducing user requests for refunds.<\/p>\n<p>For now, Android users can only purchase subscriptions outside the app from a limited set of developers who have been testing the feature, Google says.<\/p>\n<p>The company tells us it will expand this feature to include other virtual goods in the future.<\/p>\n<p>This latest change isn&#8217;t the only way Google is trying to increase transparency around subscriptions.<\/p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=gnrNckXeSjQ&amp;list=PLWz5rJ2EKKc9Kh-e9fhvc8EI16Avbifie&amp;index=3\">a video shared with developers,<\/a> the company noted it has made improvements to its checkout cart on Google Play to add further distinctions between trial periods and regular pricing. Google also now sends out email reminders to alert users when free trials are ending and it now pops up a notification when an app is uninstalled to remind users they may also want to cancel the app&#8217;s subscription.<\/p>\n<p>Google is also changing the option that lets a customer pause a subscription. Starting on November 1, 2020, this will default to &#8220;on,&#8221; and other features like Account Hold and Restore will be required for app subscription-based apps. Plus, developers will be able to pop-up a list of reasons to keep a subscription when a user hits the cancel button.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We believe that in increasing user trust around subscriptions, you will benefit from an increase higher-quality subscribers and lower refund and chargeback rates,&#8221; says Google Play Commerce product manager, Mrinalini Loew, in the video.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Alongside the Android 11 beta news and updates to Android developer tools, Google has quietly rolled out a significant change in how Android app developers can market their subscriptions on the Google Play Store.

Is it worth the time, energy and money?\u00a0 We asked Felicia Jackson, inventor and founder of <a href=\"https:\/\/cprwrap.com\/\">CPRWrap<\/a>, to share her experience in <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/events\/disrupt-sf-2020\/startup-alley\/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disruptsf2020&amp;utm_content=digitalstartupalley&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=61720digitalsuatcpost&amp;display=\">Startup Alley<\/a>.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>A medical professional trained in CPR, Felicia Jackson froze when her two-year-old son suddenly stopped breathing. \u201cIn my panic, I forgot everything I had been taught. Fortunately, my husband stepped in and eventually saved our son.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That incident inspired Jackson to invent <a href=\"https:\/\/cprwrap.com\/\">CPRWrap<\/a> \u2014 a patented single-use CPR template that guides you through the American Heart Association\u2019s four recommended steps during respiratory or cardiac emergencies.

pledges that every vehicle on its platform will be electric by 2030"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/lyft\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"lyft\">Lyft <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> said Wednesday that every car, truck and SUV on its platform will be all-electric or powered by another zero-emission technology by 2030, a commitment that will require the company to coax drivers to shift away from gas-powered vehicles.<\/p>\n<p>The target, which Lyft plans to pursue with help from the Environmental Defense Fund and other partners, will stretch across multiple programs. It will include the company&#8217;s autonomous vehicles, the Express Drive rental car partner program for rideshare drivers, consumer rental cars for riders and personal cars that drivers use on the Lyft app. That personal car category will be the tricky one.<\/p>\n<p>And there are important caveats to Lyft&#8217;s target that will make it even more challenging to reach. Lyft told TechCrunch it doesn&#8217;t plan to disallow drivers from using the Lyft platform if they don\u2019t have an EV, and doesn&#8217;t believe that such a requirement would be necessary. That means Lyft will have to make moving to an EV so attractive that drivers will make the leap.<\/p>\n<p>Lyft told TechCrunch that it doesn&#8217;t plan to provide incentives to reach that target either. &#8220;We will aggressively promote and help drivers access incentive funds,&#8221; a spokesperson said. &#8220;If policymakers do their part in the next few years, EVs should reach cost-parity with gasoline vehicles by mid-decade.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Lyft plans to use the scale of its platform to push competitors, policy makers and the auto industry to transition toward electrification, Lyft co-founder and president John Zimmer said during a call with reporters Wednesday.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Lyft is now eight years old and the majority of that time was about surviving and getting to the point where Lyft could have that scale and have that influence,&#8221; Zimmer said. &#8220;We are there now and it&#8217;s on us to lead; we feel that responsibility.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The company is facing two significant barriers to reaching that 2030 goal.

The company is finally ready to discuss it in full, just as many companies are getting really serious about remote operations. The secret sauce here is simplicity, allowing for a wide range of different robotics form factors to create remote operations on various devices, including smartphones, laptops and tablets. Freedom says they\u2019ll be able to do it with a single line of code. What\u2019s more, inexperienced operators should be able to control the robots almost instantly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u201cCOVID has accelerated robotics deployments by five years, co-founder and CTO Hans Lee tells TechCrunch. &#8220;People need robots\u00a0today\u00a0and our robotics customers can\u2019t keep up with the demand to build them. We are seeing a ton of longer-term robotics platforms in development pivot to launching in less than 60 days with a significantly simpler system and with humans in the loop. It has really reinforced the value of our\u00a0<span class=\"il\">Pilot<\/span>\u00a0feature and we are excited to be helping make hospitals, streets, agriculture and other areas significantly safer during COVID.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A number of robotics companies are already utilizing the tech, including Bangalore\u2019s Invento Robotics and UCLA spin-off Cyan Robotics. Along with teleoperations, the company is pitching the technology as a stepping stone toward full autonomy.

href=\"http:\/\/www.imagine-impact.com\/\">Imagine Impact<\/a>, the entertainment accelerator launched by Brian Grazer and Ron Howard to try and bring Silicon Valley-style mentorship and project development techniques to Hollywood, has inked a development deal with Netflix and is looking for submissions.<\/p>\n<p>Under the agreement, Impact will identify and develop film ideas in four specific genres over the next year that they will then bring to <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/netflix\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"netflix\">Netflix <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> to produce and distribute, through a global submission process.<\/p>\n<p>The companies did not disclose the financial terms of the agreement.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cNetflix is the most innovative content creation and distribution company of the last decade, leading the way in streaming since 2007 and changing the original content game with House of Cards in 2013,&#8221; said Brian Grazer, Ron Howard and Tyler Mitchell, co-founders of Impact, in a joint statement. &#8220;As Impact continues to evolve the way that global talent is discovered, projects are developed and how the creative industry connects, this partnership demonstrates both companies\u2019 commitment to improving the development system in order to generate more original, quality IP to meet the growing demand.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The first genre that Imagine Impact is looking for pitches in is &#8220;large scale action-adventure movies for all audiences.&#8221; Writers need to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.imagine-impact.com\/netflix\">submit an idea<\/a> and a writing sample from today through July 6.<\/p>\n<p>Launched two years ago, Imagine Impact is a program that Howard, Grazer and Mitchell established to cultivate writing talent by combining the Silicon Valley mentorship model from accelerators like <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/y-combinator\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"y-combinator\">Y Combinator <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> with the Hollywood storytelling magic that Grazer and Howard have perfected over decades as two of the entertainment industry&#8217;s most celebrated producers and writers, actors and directors.<\/p>\n<p>The Imagine Impact vetting process involves both experienced readers and a natural language processing system that the talent incubator developed internally. From its first cohort through to last year&#8217;s team of presenters, Imagine Impact not only provides mentorship, but brings selected screenwriters to Los Angeles for an intensive period of workshopping, subsidized by the accelerator.<\/p>\n<p>From the beginning, the Imagine Impact team recognized that Netflix was democratizing storytelling and creating a global platform for talent. Hollywood, the founders felt, was the best place to nurture that talent, according to interviews with the founders conducted at the company&#8217;s last demo day.<\/p>\n<p>Since the first Impact program, the accelerator program has accepted 65 writers and paired them with industry experts including Akiva Goldsman of &#8220;A Beautiful Mind&#8221; fame.

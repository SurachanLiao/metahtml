Khomeini's fame in western countries is mostly related to the events which took
place from 1979 to 1982. However, he had been a part of Iranian politics since
the early 1950's. His introduction to western media was due to his leadership
during the Iranian revolution of 1979. Khomeini became an undesirable world
figure when he sided with the Muslim students who had taken American embassy
personnel hostage in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
  font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none'>Tehran</span><span style='font-size:

event which is known as the hostage crisis lasted 444 days. He began the
process of becoming an undesirable character in </span><span style='font-size:

this paper is not to provide an analysis of the historical events surrounding
the reign of Ayatollah Khomeini. Rather, it is an attempt to understand
Khomeini's psychopathology and its impact on himself and others. The 31rst
anniversary of the Iranian revolution was </span><span

with joy or anger. However, they never forget it. At that time, along with
millions of others, I was involved in the revolution of 1979. I might not be
able to get away from guilt by blaming my errors on youth and naivete, but I
can certainly claim that I was such a small pawn that I did not have any impact
on those events. Having said that, looking at the pictures of the lost friends
and those unknown heroes who died during the last thirty years causes a lot of
personal sorrow over what has taken place. </span></p>

Islamic republic, Khomeini earned the title of the founding father of the
Islamic Republic. I should add to this, that he is the original criminal,
guilty of crimes against humanity and crimes against the Iranian people. He was
able to single-handedly destroy the dreams of millions of people who were
fighting for their freedom and replaced them with the horrific nightmares of
Islamic Republic. His promises of the rule of God turned to be the rule of the
worst demon ever wearing the cloth of the prophets. He did not leave us with
just a bad experience but with a perpetual killing machine whose job is to
protect its own existence while its existence is an insult to humanity. To
induce so much pain and anguish on 70,000,000 people one must have a unique
personality and a unique childhood. This paper is an attempt at understanding
that character.</span></p>

History:</span></u></b></p>
<P>
<p style='background:white'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Mr.
Khomeini was born in the city of </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  font-family:Verdana'>Khomein</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
Verdana'> in central </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Iran</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>, a small town 300 kilometers
south of </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Tehran</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>, with many small villages and
farming at its core. For generations, his ancestors were clergymen. They
originated in a village in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
  Verdana'>India</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>, and
several of his ancestors were Ayatollahs. Since the family had devoted
themselves to a Shiite sect of Islam and they did not have strong roots in </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Iran</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'> - there was more devotion to the
faith than the country.</span></p>
<P>
<p style='background:white'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Khomeini's
family had immigrated to the city of </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  font-family:Verdana'>Najaf</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
Verdana'> in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Iraq</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'> for religious studies and his
father, who was also a clergyman, moved to Khomein to start his ministry.
Khomeini's father married once and had six children (three sons and three
daughters). Ayatollah Khomeini is the youngest of these six children.
Khomeini's father was killed in his 40's by a group of local bandits who might
have had some connections with the local government of the time. At the time,
Khomeini was only one year old, the bandits were captured and their leader was
decapitated. There were some reports that specified that Khomeini was present
at that horrifying event of the decapitation. I personally heard this story and
its gruesome details from one of the Ayatollahs in </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Iran</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'> in 1985*2. However, there is
ample evidence that he was far too young to have been a part of it. His oldest
brother Ayatollah Pasandideh was about ten years old at that time and was
present during the decapitation. Ayatollah Pasandideh described this event in
detail in his memoirs.*3</span></p>
<P>
<p style='background:white'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>After
Khomeini's father's death, Khomeini's aunt moved into the Khomeini family
household and took over his parenting. There are many reports that this aunt
raised him. There is very little information regarding Khomeini's mother. This
omission is somewhat peculiar as Khomeini's mother was young and available. The
introduction of the aunt into the family must have had specific family reasons
of which we are not aware.</span></p>
<P>
<p style='background:white'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The
reports of the events associated with Khomeini's early childhood are limited
and are mentioned in this article. We know that the aunt was a strong character
and had a lot to do with Khomeini's upbringing. While growing up, Khomeini's
brother took the role of a father figure and considering their age difference
one can see how such an attachment was possible. When Khomeini was 10, his
brother was more than twenty years old. The practice of the oldest son taking
the role of the father after the premature death of a father is a common
practice in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Iran</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'> and strongly expected. That is
what my uncle did after my grandfather died, and that is what I did when my
father died. A son who would be guilty of negligence in carrying out this
responsibility would have the burden of carrying several insults for the rest
of his life.</span></p>
<P>
<p style='background:white'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Khomeini's
brother reported his role in Khomeini's education in detail. One should
consider that the clerical educational system of that time was different than
the secular education of people like my uncle of the same generation. In
clerical education, a student would be assigned to a teacher and he would spend
several years with him until the student was knowledgeable enough to go to a
higher-level teacher.</span></p>
<P>
<p style='background:white'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Khomeini
developed a strong attachment to his brother, which was closer than that for
two typical Iranian brothers. Khomeini had a lot of respect for him and in
their older ages was very concerned about his brother's health. During that
time he was in exile. Howevere, during correspondence with his younger son, he
would urge him to look after Ayatollah Pasandideh. Obviously, Pasandideh was a
father figure to him.*6 apparently, the teacher of his first years was the
brother. Ayatollah Pasandideh reports that he taught Khomeini the art of good
penmanship. Looking at their handwriting, one notices the resemblance in their
writing style. One should keep in mind that in our culture, especially at that
time, poor handwriting was equivalent to a poor education. If one examines
Khomeini's writings one can easily see that even at his very old ages, he had a
very good command of Persian writing. Also, his writings rarely have any
scratching on them. In other words, he would not cross out what he had written.
The same phenomenon is easily detected in his speech and behavior. Obviously,
he was a thoughtful man and he would think about what he wanted to say or write
in advance. Therefore, there was very little modification in his writing.</span></p>

<P>
<p style='background:white'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Ayatollah
Pasandideh, in his memoirs, explains the gruesome events of his father's death
in detail. He also relays that he had been told that he suffers from obsessive-compulsive
disorder; however, he does not explain his condition in detail and he only uses
the term &quot;Vasvas.&quot; Ayatollah Pasandideh's book of memoirs are
detailed enough to suggest obsessive thinking and perfectionism. </span></p>
<P>
<p style='background:white'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Khomeini
moved to the city of </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Qum</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'> in his teenage years. The city of
</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Qum</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'> is a religious city and currently
is the Shiite equivalent of the </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  font-family:Verdana'>Vatican</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
Verdana'>. In those days, if one decided to study theology he would do so in
the cities of </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Qum</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'> or Najaf. It is widely reported
that Khomeini was an intelligent and dedicated student. He was disciplined and
regimented. There are many references to his high IQ. Considering his educated
family background and his rich vocabulary and syntax, one can estimate his IQ
to be at superior levels. </span></p>
<P>
<p style='background:white'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Khomeini
was far too poor to be able to marry like other men of his time who generally
would marry in their late teens or early twenties. Instead, he got married at
the age of 27. As a result of this marriage, he had two sons and three
daughters. He was mostly a student of a famous Ayatollah Borojerdi. The
Ayatollah Borojerdi was quite powerful, wealthy, influential, and had the
ability to keep Khomeini in check.*8</span></p>

</span><span class=wwscontentsmaller1><span style='font-size:7.0pt'>Ayatollah Borojerdi</span></span></p>
<P>
<p style='background:white'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Broujerdi's
orders and words carried a lot of weight. He was also able to maintain a
cordial relationship with the royal family. He had noticed that Khomeini was
hardheaded and had a sharp tongue with political issues. Therefore, he forbade
him from getting involved in politics. I personally have met clergymen in </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Iran</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'> who told me that they had seen
occasions in which Ayatollah Borojerdi would yell at Ayatollah Khomeini and
tell him to be quiet. This kind of public humiliation is quite unusual among

Pasandideh (Khomeini's brother) admits that he was told that he suffered from
&quot;<i>Vasvas.&quot; Vasvas </i>is an Arabic word, which is used in Farsi to
explain compulsive cleaning. However, currently, mental health professionals
use it as an equivalent of different varieties of obsessive compulsive
personality disorder (OCPD). Since Ayatollah Pasandideh admits to his <i>Vasvas</i>
and the fact that he was Khomeini's substitute father, one can postulate that
this condition was pervasive in Khomeini's family, and that his identification
with his older brother might have contributed to it. The statistical
correlation on this topic is quite strong. There is 45-60% higher probability
of developing OCPD for the members of same family than control groups.*7</span></p>
<P>
<p style='background:white'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Ayatollah
Khomeini's life story is a long array of different obsessions and compulsions,
which affected him and all those around him. Since Khomeini was the founding
father of Islamic Republic, we can see the effects of his illness on every
aspect of Iranian politics today.</span></p>
<P>
<p style='background:white'><b><u><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

<P>
<p style='background:white'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>When
reading the Ayatollah's life stories reported by his family members and
students, one is surprised by the unanimous manner in which friend and foe have
explained his regimented and routine behaviors.</span></p>
<P>
<p style='background:white'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The
primary symptoms of OCPD, are a preoccupation with details, rules, lists,
order, organization, and schedules; being very rigid and inflexible in one's
beliefs; showing perfectionism that interferes with completing a task;
excessive focus on being productive with their time; being very conscientious;
having inflexible morality, ethics, or values; hoarding items that may no
longer have value; and a reluctance to trust a work assignment or task to
someone else for fear that one's standards will not be met.</span></p>
<P>
<p style='background:white'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Some
people with OCPD, though not all of them, show an obsessive need for
cleanliness. Those that do not show this tendency are sometimes good at setting
up systems to maintain cleanliness, but may not follow through with the need to
clean because of other &quot;more important&quot; priorities. For example, the
need to get a good grade or finish a project at work might cause the OCPD
person to have a quite messy and unorganized home. But if that same person was
suddenly unemployed or finished with other activities, he or she could very well
start becoming obsessed with cleanliness as other activities take up less time.</span></p>
<P>
<p style='background:white'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>There
are few Moral gray areas for a person with fully developed OCPD. Actions and
beliefs are either completely right or absolutely wrong, with the OCPD
individual always being in the right.</span></p>

<P>
<p style='background:white'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>In
order to be able to establish a clear diagnosis for the Ayatollah we have to
examine his life and see if he manifested the symptoms that are mentioned in
DSMIV-TR. Since many of Khomeini's students and family members have written
extensively about the habits of Ayatollah Khomeini, we have access to an
abundance of evidence for his condition. Interestingly, the reports of
Khomeini's character by different people with very different backgrounds are so
similar that it makes our diagnostic work-up quite easy.</span></p>
<P>
<p style='background:white'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>1.
He had a fear of germs and he was compulsively clean. His daughter*5 reports
that whenever she gave him his medication, he would take his pills with a spoon
rather than with his hand, so that his medication did not get dirty. He used a
spoon to eat bread, which is simply unheard of among us Iranian devout bread
eaters.</span></p>
<P>
<p style='background:white'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>2.
He had several routines, which were widely known. For example, whenever he was
sitting down on the floor - the way that we do in the </span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Middle East-</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'> he would only use his left hand
as an anchor on the floor to get up. He would never use the right hand.*8</span></p>
<P>
<p style='background:white'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>3.
He always walked on the right side of the pedestrian walkway.*8</span></p>
<P>
<p style='background:white'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>4.
He would always enter a room or step on a pulpit using only his left foot
first. He would exit with the right foot.*8</span></p>
<P>
<p style='background:white'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>5.
The routines of the day were so regimented that the members of the family would
organize their daily activity based on Khomeini's behavior using Khomeini as a
clock. For example, their household maid reported that on the days that she was
cooking rice for everybody, she would get started with the task when she would
see that Khomeini was done with the morning studying.*8</span></p>
<P>
<p style='background:white'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>6.
Perfect Punctuality: In the mosques, temples and the shrines, many people have
reported how they could use him as a clock because of his precise routines. He
was so cautious with time that when he returned from his daily walks , if he
was ten seconds early he would walk an extra 10 seconds in the yard before
entering.*3*7</span></p>
<P>
<p style='background:white'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>7.
Khomeini was extremely frugal. His argument was that the money that he had
actually was the money which had been collected to be spent for religious
purposes and he did not have a right to it. Consequently, he would keep his
expenses very low. However, a deeper look at this behavior shows that he
handled finances with extreme precision and at times was unreasonably
demanding. For example, his household servant reported that when they were
living in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Iraq</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'> he had given him a couple of
dinars (each dinar was equivalent to three dollars) to go to the store to buy
groceries. When he came back with the groceries he gave Khomeini his change and
before he got to the door Khomeini screamed at him that it was half a Flous
short (that is less than one penny).*8</span></p>
<P>
<p style='background:white'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>8
The religious rituals were so important for him, that he would compromise very
important events to complete minor noncompulsory rituals of Friday*19 </span></p>
<P>
<p style='background:white'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>9.
Ayatollah Montazeri reported that when Khomeini's book &quot;Resaleh&quot; was
published, he got a copy from Khomeini. He had to argue with the old man
because Khomeini was insisting to be paid ten Tomans (one dollar and thirty
cents).*10</span></p>
<P>
<p style='background:white'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>10.
Cleanliness. He changed his outside attire as soon as he was back in the house
to keep the germs out. Khomeini's daughter reports that Khomeini had a study
room for himself and he would use so many perfumes and colognes that whenever
she would go in to his room she felt like she was going into paradise. He is
also reported as saying that ladies are mischievous and they keep all the good
things to themselves, especially the perfumes. Six or seven times a day he used
cologne to smell better and make the room smell better.*4</span></p>
<P>
<p style='background:white'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>11.
When they were living in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Iraq</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>, which is quite hot, it took a
long time before he permitted the family to get a fan. He actually refused air
conditioning as a gift because of the money it would use for electricity. The
mannerisms of expenditure of money for him and the rest of the family were
astonishingly poor. The places that he rented to live in </span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Qum</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'> or in Najaf were badly run down and cheap.*7 One
should keep in mind that Ayatollahs at his level receive thousands of dollars from
their followers for different religious reasons. Also, since they have hundreds
of visitors a day they usually have houses, which are quite large, and have two
sections an internal part for the family and the external part for receiving
visitors. Some people interpret his frugal behavior as a religious mannerism in
which he did not want to be involved in worldly materials.*7</span></p>
<P>
<p style='background:white'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>However,
we know for a fact that when he arrived in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  font-family:Verdana'>Tehran</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
Verdana'> from Najaf, people who were going to see him had to see his
brother-in-law first and make donations of millions of dollars for a few
minutes of audience. He did not dislike money; he just didn't want to spend it.
Like other people with his condition, money was hoarded for future
catastrophes.*8</span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>12.
Khomeini was extremely critical of others and intolerant of bad behavior from
kids and peasants to the king himself. He was specifically critical of people
in a position of authority. They were always hearing his nagging criticism. </span></p>

<P>
<p style='background:white'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>13.
Constricted affect: Khomeini did not manifest his feelings. He would cry
occasionally in religious ceremonies related to one of the Shiite saints.
However, this type of crying is a purely religious ritual. The contrast is
obvious when we consider the fact that he did not cry when his son got killed.
When he was returning to </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Tehran</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'> from exile and he was in the
plane, a reporter asked him what he felt about returning to </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Iran</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'> after so many years, and his
reply was &quot;Nothing.&quot;*19</span></p>
<P>
<p style='background:white'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>14.
<i>There is one right way of doing things and that is my way of doing things. </i>Khomeini
was the best example of this old saying. He was so regimented and controlling
that his interpretation of Islam and the form of government that he implemented
in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Iran</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'> at this time is a unique
interpretation of the Quran, and of Islam as a whole. No one else in history
has ever come up with this interpretation. This method of government, which is
referred to as &quot;Vellayat Faghih&quot; (the rule of the qualified clergy),
is based on a quotation from Imam Reza who was the 8th Imam of 12 Imams of
Shiite.</span></p>
<P>
<p style='background:white'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>15.
Stubbornness. Khomeini had a habit of not retracting what he would say even if
that would put his life and the lives of his followers at jeopardy. Once he
would make a decision that he was going to do something, he would do it
regardless of consequences. Although this characteristic paid off at the end,
his insistence on conquering </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
  Verdana'>Iraq</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'> added
six years to the Iran-Iraq war with hundreds of thousands of casualties. He
finally had to bitterly accept the peace treaty because of an impending
military defeat, and he died soon after.*15</span></p>
<P>
<p style='background:white'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>16.
Hyper religiosity. Although Khomeini is an Ayatollah and one assumes that an
Ayatollah would be a very religious person, he was much more orthodox,
detailed, and devoted, than other religious leaders. He adhered to the most
minute details of the faith and was totally intolerant of people who would not
follow the rules of Islam as strictly as he did.*12</span></p>
<P>
<p style='background:white'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>17.
Perfectionism. The mannerism of Khomeini's speech is quite different from other
Ayatollahs I have heard. Initially, I used to think that his peculiar manner of
broken sentences and his peasant accent were just related to his background of
being born and raised in the small city of </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  font-family:Verdana'>Khomein</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
Verdana'>. However, upon further examination, it is quite evident that this
peculiarity is caused by his perfectionism.</span></p>
<P>
<p style='background:white'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>He
would explain everything in detail and in the middle of his speech he would
remember other things that he had to add to make the sentence more complete.
This manner of speech made him difficult to follow. He made a series of
lectures for the public on public TV after the Iranian revolution took place.
These speeches were actually interpretations of the Quran. Since every section
of the Quran begins with &quot;with the name of God the merciful,&quot; he spent
about 20 sessions of lectures talking about the word <i>with</i>. He never
passed talking about the Quran without &quot;with'.*19</span></p>
<P>
<p style='background:white'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>18.
Prejudice. In Khomeini's mind there was only one right religion, one right
faith and that was his interpretation of the Shiite sect of Islam. Everything
else was null and void. He was totally intolerant of Jews. In one of his
writings - which was quite difficult to read because of the extensive number of
complex words that he had put in - he tried to prove that when Jewish people
die after death they turn into mice, rabbits and pigs.*10 His prejudice was so
strong that when he was informed that his ardent follower and friend, Prime
Minister Bazargan's grandmother was a converted Jew, their friendship was gone
forever.*8</span></p>
<P>
<p style='background:white'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>19.
Exercise Rituals. He walked three times a day each time for 30 minutes. He did
exercises while lying in the bed, lifting legs and twisting arms and torso
three times a day.*4 </span></p>
<P>
<p style='background:white'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>20.
Obsession with the news. He continuously listened to the radio news, both
Iranian and foreign news, he listened at all hours except to sleep or pray. He
had a portable radio which he carried even during the fast or during the meals.*4
</span></p>
<P>
<p style='background:white'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>21.
Lack of tolerance for dissent and anger. Although clergymen do have a soft side
to them, the only emotion known to come from Khomeini was anger. He was quite
brutal in matters that were important to him. When the members of MEK killed
several of his students, he signed off on execution of several 15 year old
girls who were guilty of selling MEK newspapers.*17</span></p>

the Shah gave more authority to the secret service and to the police to use
brute force and do whatever it took to break the back of the opposition. A part
of this brutality was the use of torture and deliberate exaggeration of the
secret service's power and brutality. Consequently, although the total number
of people who worked for SAVAK wasn't more than a few thousand, we were under
the impression that millions worked for them. Although the total number of
prisoners wasn't more than 5,000, we thought of it as more like 80,000.

country. He was a nationalist. With the increase in the price of oil he had the
money to do whatever he needed. There was actually a high surplus of the money.
There is only so much you can spend to build the infrastructure of the country.
If you go faster than what is needed you run into inflation. He also poured a
lot of money into the army. He was a close friend of President Nixon and he got
his approval to buy whatever he wanted for the armed forces. Americans were
busy with </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Vietnam</span><span

get unloaded in Iranian ports, and once unloaded there were not enough trucks
to get the goods to Tehran and then, not enough drivers to drive the 6000 extra
trucks.*20 Iran was a huge gold mine that everyone had gone crazy on. In my
last year of college (1974) I was making more money than anybody in the family

&quot;Death to the Shah.&quot; So much change in such a short time required
political change. There was a real middle class, and the needs of middle class
are different. Unfortunately, nobody dared to tell the Shah the truth.
Consequently, he was living in his fantasyland, thinking that he was the
undisputed king and we were his loyal subjects, and that our relationship with
him is an old divine relationship, which could not be broken. He was working

1973, his majesty made the most significant, home wrecking error. He closed all
of the superficial parties and turned the country to a one party system. That
was diametrically different to what he needed to do. We were fed up with the
police state; there was no need for a police state. The Shah needed to do
something similar to what King Carlos did in </span><span style='font-size:

so that he would go into history as the son who finished what the father had
started. But he was too paranoid to contemplate relinquishing control. His best
friends were dead or gone. His Army had the same disease, competent and

<P>
<p style='background:white'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>In
all honestly, I was only a freshman in college and his teachings required a
more developed brain. Gradually, I understood what he was talking about. I was
lucky enough to get to know him personally through a mutual friend. Gradually,
we got to know each other, or at least he was kind enough to pretend that he
knew me, and the pride of my life was that we saw a movie together. Later on, I
read just about all of his books and he had a profound impact on my thinking.
He had the same impact on many others. He came up with a new interpretation of
Shiite sect of Islam. He was against the clergy, the ruling class and
billionaires in a country with poor people in it. His massage was that a good
Shiite should rebel against all these forces of evil. The clergy hated Dr
Shariati and some of the Ayatollahs called his work were a blasphemy. A couple
of the Ayatollahs put a ban on going to his lectures. One of the Ayatollahs
called him &quot;crazy boy.&quot;</span></p>
<P>
<p style='background:white'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>We
were all surprised that in an environment of terror, Dr. Shariati was permitted
to hold public classes in which he was hitting everyone including the
government. The last time I saw him was during his last speech in that temple.
He talked about martyrdom; that caused students to get carried away and the
lecture turned into a public protest. The next day the place was closed. </span></p>
<P>
<p style='background:white'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The
recent declassified documents of the SAVAK show that Dr. Shariati had been able
to convince the government that what he was doing was good for the Shah. After
all, he was hitting the clergy and the communists. Ironically, all those
supposedly intelligent people working for Iranian intelligence services did not
realize they were being duped.</span></p>
<P>
<p style='background:white'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Even
though Dr. Shariati did a magnificent job of shaking up the society, in the
final analysis it all worked totally against us, because:</span></p>
<P>
<p style='background:white'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>a)
He openly encouraged us to follow Khomeini (he was under same illusion that we
were)</span></p>
<P>
<p style='background:white'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>b)
Throughout the different stages of the revolution the clergy promoted
Shariati's books; Khomeini's writings were the last thing to read. Once
Khomeini took over he did not implement Shariati's modern doctrine of Islam,
instead he promoted the archaic fundamentalist, orthodox, rigid,
interpretation, which was obviously his own.</span></p>
<P>
<p style='background:white'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>c)
Unfortunately, Dr. Shariati died under peculiar circumstances in 1977, although
without a doubt he was one of the top 10 people who ignited the revolution. He
was not there during the revolution when we needed him the most.</span></p>

it on SAVAK, some called it just an accident. In either case, when the son was
dead, religious people sent many letters of sympathy to Khomeini. In response
he sent a fiery letter to Iranian people saying losing his son was not as
painful as seeing Iranian kids in jail. The Shah ordered an article to be
printed in the papers blasting Khomeini in inappropriate language. It was most
unwise to insult the highest-ranking Ayatollah of the country, who happened to
be an 80 year-old man mourning the loss of his son. By going after Khomeini, he
activated the only organization in the country that could bring him down. He
might have been successful in fighting the clergy if he was popular, or if he
had the testosterone of a twenty-year old. But, he had neither and the friends
of thirty years ago were gone. This was a wrong battle with the wrong enemy at

<P>
<p style='background:white'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>He
was looking at everything from his own rigid prism. For example, when a few of
the revolutionary guards had gone to see him, and he heard that some of them
had done things which were not kosher, he told them they should be more careful
of their behavior because if they behaved in a way that was not right, then
after they died and were in heaven, some people would tell God these guards had
done things which were not quite right. Then the Messiah was going to be
embarrassed in front of angels and would be ashamed that his friends hadn't
behaved the right way*22. He talked about this possible encounter as if he was
convinced of the events to come. His absolute certainty was because of his
total acceptance of all details of the Shiite sect of Islam, while for us, and
the rest of the population, these were just a bunch of religious stories, which
were probably untrue. We just wanted him to help us to kick the Shah out. We
did not want him to become the next Shah with a turban.</span></p>
<P>
<p style='background:white'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>For
him, these thoughts were so real that if a group of students would get together
and start a nationalist group or a socialist group, they were considered the
enemies of God and could be killed with no hesitation. He referred to these
enemies as gangrene, which had to be cut off ASAP before spreading.*18</span></p>
<P>
<p style='background:white'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Once
he took the path of backing off on his promises, including closing some of the
newspapers, people suddenly realized that they weren't getting what they had
bargained for. We were deprived of the democracy we had fought for, and
received something which was not practiced anywhere. The contradiction caused
street battles and everyone lost because he had total control of government and
money and guns. He had hundreds of thousands of devout followers who took his
word as the word of God and they were willing to die for him. In the fight that
pitted a few hundred thousand secular revolutionaries against several million
religious people, the secular groups were destroyed in less than a year. He
also used the hostage crisis to unify his own people and distract the world
from the internal events of </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
  Verdana'>Iran</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>.
While everyone was preoccupied with the American hostages, he killed all of his
real enemies, who were the Iranian seculars. </span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The
entire model of theocracy that he put together was purely of his own making and
was based on his thoughts, ideas, illusions and fantasy. His brutal method of
using savagery caused about seven million Iranians to leave the country. In
other words, in less than 5 years all those who had brains or money were gone.
If you cut off the top 10% of the population, what are you are going to be left
with is 90% of the population that is religious, uneducated, and traditional
followers.</span></p>
<P>
<p style='background:white'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Khomeini
took his position so seriously that he imitated a couple of things that the
Prophet Mohammed had done. Mohammed had sent three messengers to the countries
of </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Persia</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>, </span><span style='font-size:

font-family:Verdana'> and </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
  Verdana'>Egypt</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>,
inviting them to become Muslims. Khomeini sent a messenger to Gorbachov
inviting him to become a Muslim.*20</span></p>
<P>
<p style='background:white'><b><u><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
Verdana'>The great poet</span></u></b></p>
<P>
<p style='background:white'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>One
last point about Khomeini is his total love and devotion to God. Khomeini was a
great poet. After he died his poetry was published. His poetry of younger ages
is too primitive and too harsh, but his poems of later years are just a
delight. We know it's authentic because it's in his handwriting. When you read
it you realize how magnificent it is. In the beginning I had trouble believing
these beautiful poems were coming from his frozen brain. In one of his works,
which was written in winter of 1987, he wrote a beautiful poem telling God how happy
he was his life was over and he was finally able to join him. Six months later
in the summer of 1988, he ordered the execution of about 8,000 political
prisons, who were captured and imprisoned and could not have been any harm to
anybody. The contradiction is mind-boggling. </span></p>
<P>
<p style='background:white'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Khomeini
Died on </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>the 24<sup>th
 </sup>of September, 1992</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>.
At that time he had had 12 years to implement his plans: Kill all enemies,
intimidate the rest, and set up the most horrific government on the planet. I
lost many friends and I know of many fine people that were ordered to death by
him, simply because he was so anal and rigid that he did not want to deviate
one centimeter from what he thought to be the truth.</span></p>
<P>
<p style='background:white'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Since
his death, his disciples have proven to be much worse than him. He used to
kill, torture for God. These guys do the same thing  but for power and money.
The religious ideals that Khomeini wanted to be accepted, loved and implemented
by the people of the world have turned out to be one of the biggest challenges
for the Iranian people and a giant menace for the world.</span></p>

<u>What is an Ayatollah</u>; the term Ayatollah means &quot;sign of God&quot;
and it is specific to the Shiite sect of Islam. In Shiite, there is a belief
that after the Prophet Mohammad's death, his son-in-law and then his grandsons
were the divine leaders of the society for 12 generations. Each one of these
saints is referred to as Imam. The twelfth Imam was Mahdi, who is the Messiah
and disappeared, and who will come back in future to put the rule of God on
Earth. During the absence of messiah, the Ayatollahs are his representatives on
earth. Each Shiite Muslim is required to follow an ayatollah of his time in all
aspects of religion and life. A decree written by an Ayatollah has to be
followed by his followers as if it is the orders of the Messiah itself. There
are those students of theology who finish their schooling and get the final
degree. Once an Ayatollah has a following, he is referred to as Grand
Ayatollah. At this time there are nine Grand Ayatollahs in </span><span

<P>
<p style='background:white'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Periodically,
one of these Grand Ayatollahs gains such popularity that they become the only
Grand Ayatollah of the time. Ayatollah Khomeini is one of them.</span></p>

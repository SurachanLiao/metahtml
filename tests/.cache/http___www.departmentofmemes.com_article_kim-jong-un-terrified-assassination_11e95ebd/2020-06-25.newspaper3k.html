<p><a href="https://www.aol.com/article/news/2017/06/20/report-north-koreas-kim-jong-un-fears-being-assassinated-by-decapitation-unit/22491477/">AOL</a>:&#160;North Korea&#8217;s leader Kim Jong-un is reportedly afraid of potential plots to assassinate him, including by decapitation.</p>
<p>According to The <a href="http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20170615000944" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Korea Herald</a>, this assessment was shared during a recent meeting between South Korean lawmakers and the country&#8217;s intelligence officials.</p>
<p>In fact, one representative who attended the briefing said, &#8220;Kim is so engrossed with collecting information about the &#8216;decapitation operation&#8217; through his intelligence agency.&#8221;</p>
<p>The existence of a so-called &#8220;decapitation unit&#8221; is said to have been <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/05/asia/south-korea-kim-jong-un-brigade/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> by a South Korean Defense official.</p><p>A report by the <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/south-korea-military-unit-trained-decapitate-kim-jong-un-war-north-korea-dprk-special-forces-defence-a7510881.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Independent</a> explains that the team&#8217;s mission is to &#8220;&#8216;decapitate&#8217; Kim Jong-un and other senior Communist officials in the North in the event of war.&#8221;</p>
<p>And while it had been slated to be ready for action by 2019, the timeline was reportedly moved up to the latter part of this year.</p><p class="code-block code-block-2">

She flew to Kuala Lumpur a week before Kim Jong Nam&#8217;s slaying on Feb. 13, 2017. Aisyah was a migrant worker in Kuala Lumpur, and is believed to have approached by a man at the nightclub she was working at who convinced her to participate in the prank.</p><p>A Malaysian High Court judge found last August there was enough evidence to prosecute Aisyah, Huong and the four North Koreans, who fled the country, on a conspiracy to kill Kim Jong Nam. But lawyers have consistently argued that they were merely used for the political assassination, which had clear links to North Korea.</p></section></article>

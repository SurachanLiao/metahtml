HONG KONG – One of the women suspected of killing Kim Jong Nam, the half brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, was freed Monday after prosecutors unexpectedly dropped charges against her.

Siti Aisyah, 26, will now be allowed to return home to Indonesia, Malaysian officials say, after being held for over two years in Malaysia. She and the second suspect in the murder, Doan Thi Huong, 30, from Vietnam, both appeared in court on Monday, but the acquittal only applies to her.

“I feel very happy,” she told reporters at a news conference, thanking everyone who worked for her release. “I didn’t expect that today will be the day of my freedom.”

The two women, who maintain their innocence, were accused of delivering the potent VX nerve agent that killed Kim Jong Nam in an airport terminal in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in February 2017. Both Aisyah and Huong have said that they believed they were taking part in a prank for a television show, and thought they were applying lotion on the man’s face. U.S. officials have said the orders came from Pyongyang.

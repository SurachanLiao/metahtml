Abstract

Tobacco vein distorting virus(TVDV)is one of the casual agents of tobacco bushy top disease． It was designated a tentative member of the family Luteoviridae． Partial sequence of the genome of rIvDV was amplified by RT-PCR from total RNA of tobacco affected with tobacco bushy top disease，using universal primers of Luteoviruses and degenerate primer of Poleroviruses．The 1 654 bp sequence of rIvDV genome encoded partial putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase． coat protein and movement protein． Molecular phylogenetic trees were constructed based on the amino acid sequence of these three proteins．indicating that rIvDV should be a definitive memb er of the family Luteoviridae．According to the higher identities of amino acids of ORFs and the similar length of intergenic spacer region of rIvDV with the member of the genus Polerovirus．we proposed that rIvDV was a new member in the genus Polerovirus．Th is is the first report on the molecular properties of TVDV．

                            Tobacco vein distorting virus(TVDV)is one of the casual agents of tobacco bushy top disease&#65294; It was designated a tentative member of the family Luteoviridae&#65294; Partial sequence of the genome of rIvDV was amplified by RT-PCR from total RNA of tobacco affected with tobacco bushy top disease&#65292;using universal primers of Luteoviruses and degenerate primer of Poleroviruses&#65294;The 1 654 bp sequence of rIvDV genome encoded partial putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase&#65294; coat protein and movement protein&#65294; Molecular phylogenetic trees were constructed based on the amino acid sequence of these three proteins&#65294;indicating that rIvDV should be a definitive memb er of the family Luteoviridae&#65294;According to the higher identities of amino acids of ORFs and the similar length of intergenic spacer region of rIvDV with the member of the genus Polerovirus&#65294;we proposed that rIvDV was a new member in the genus Polerovirus&#65294;Th is is the first report on the molecular properties of TVDV&#65294;</p>

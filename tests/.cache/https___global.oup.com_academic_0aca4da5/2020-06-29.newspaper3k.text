Dear Customer,

As a global organization, we, like many others, recognize the significant threat posed by the coronavirus.

During this time, we have made some of our learning resources freely accessible. Learn more about these useful resources on our COVID-19 page.

Our distribution centers are open and orders can be placed online. Do be advised that shipments may be delayed due to extra safety precautions implemented at our centers and delays with local shipping carriers.

Please contact our Customer Service Team if you have any questions.

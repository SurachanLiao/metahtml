				  <p class="paragraph">The well known 1945 novel <a href="https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/o/orwell/george/o79a/complete.html" title="">Animal Farm</a>,&#160;was written by George Orwell. &#160;Even though it was written years ago, the novel can still be compared to modern day life. &#160;There are many things it could be compared to, but the most relevant example is North Korea. &#160;This includes dictatorship, murder, and government. &#160;&#160;<span>On December 13, 2011 the Supreme Leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-l died from a heart attack.&#160; His son Kim Jong-un became his successor. &#160;</span>In 2013, news came out about the new dictator,&#160;Kim Jong-un. &#160;Both leaders, Napoleon and Kim Jong-un, have many similarities and show many acts of destruction to scare the people around them.</p><p>The supreme leader, or dictator, of North Korea is Kim Jong-un. &#160;Napoleon, from the novel Animal Farm, is also a dictator in&#160;their society. &#160;Napoleon shows evidence of a dictatorship throughout the novel even though he claims he is not one. <a href="http://jenniefragale.blogspot.com/2014/05/animal-farm-north-korea-and-kim-jong-un.html" title="">He begins to show this when he pushes Snowball out of the farm because of the fear that Snowball would influence the animals against himself.</a> Kim Jong-un shows his dictatorship when he takes full control over his country not listening to his peoples demands and suggestions. In the novel, Napoleon slowly begins to break every one of his commandments. When he is confronted by it he lies and changes his commandments ever so slightly. The animals do not question this and blame it on themselves for forgetting the commandments. <a href="http://bernardweiner.com/the-weiner-component-69-historic-irony-george-orwells-animal-farm-north-korea/" title="">Kim Jong-un shows similar characteristics to his people as Napoleon does, when he treats them poorly and gives him more benefits than his people.</a></p><p>Kim Jong-un continues to show his parallel to Napoleon through murder. In Animal Farm,&#160;Napoleon shows he is capable of all sorts of things when he results to murder. He lines up all the animals and brings out his dogs. Anyone who he suspects is part of Snowballs devious plans, he has their throats torn out by the dogs. Kim Jong-un portrays he is capable of terrible things when he too leads to murder.<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2573621/Kim-Jong-Un-orders-33-people-executed-contact-Christian-missionary-say-South-Korean-press.html" title=""> He executes many of his own citizens showing his dark internal nature. For example, He ordered thirty-three people to be executed for having relationships with Christian missionaries.</a> This relates to Napoleons evilness showing the deep correlation &#160; between him and King Jong-un.</p><p>In the novel, Napoleon establishes a hierarchy resembling a modern day government. Napoleon right away enforces the seven commandments posted on the barn as a law system. In doing so he creates a group of enforcers known as the dogs. Kim Jong-un has an army behind him resembling Napoleons dogs. Also his country, North Korea, has its own law system that is enforced and people must follow, also resembling Napoleons commandments. &#160;Napoleon also has a right hand man known as Squealer in the novel. He enforces Napoleons ideas and rules &#160;and goes about the farm restating Napoleon's concepts.&#160;<a href="http://www.newsweek.com/report-kim-jong-uns-sister-marries-son-dictators-right-hand-man-296311" title=""><span>Choe Ryong-Hae is&#160;</span>reportedly Kim Jong-un's right hand man.</a> He gives his insights to Kim Jong-un and enforces his rule just like Squealer does for Napoleon.</p>

							I really liked this parallel between both North Korea and Animal Farm, especially since the recent movie was entertaining yet made it easier to understand North Korea's conflict.  The links helped me learn even more about how much Napoleon and Kim Jong-un are related too.  I learned how Choe Ryong-Hae is Kim Jong-un's right hand man, but is he as oblivious to the corrupt society under the rule, like Squealer?

							Hey Alex, I really enjoyed your comparison of North Korea and Kim Jong-un to Animal Farm. This opened my eyes too how much North Korea and Animal Farm are alike. I enjoyed how you did extensive research and found out who Kim Jong-un's right hand man is to make that great connection between him and Squealer. All in all, I believe you did a fantastic job with this connection and the only question I have is do you believe the people of North Korea will rebel just like the animals did with Mr. Jones?

							Good connection to the book. I think Animal Farm also relates, because in North Korea the people are deprived of food and other things like the animals under Napoleon. I like the Squealer and Ryone-Hae connection.

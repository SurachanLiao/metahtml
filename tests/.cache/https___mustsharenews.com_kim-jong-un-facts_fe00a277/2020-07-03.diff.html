He appreciates K-Pop</h3> <p>Well, not K-Pop as you know it.</p> <p>Mr Kim might actually be the Simon Cowell of North Korea, with his own One Direction to show for it.</p> <p>His protege? Moranbang, an all-female music group.</p> <p>Its members were <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycdDHP7QfWo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">allegedly hand-picked</a>by Mr Kim, who enjoys their blend of pop and rock styles.</p> <p>You won’t find the group’s tunes on Spotify but they’re readily available on YouTube.</p> <p>Our favourite?</p> <h3>2. He’s a ladies’ man</h3> <p>Think that Mr Kim’s just another female-loving politician?</p> <p>Well, he is.</p> <p>But that love is actually reciprocated — or at least appears to be.</p> <p>Propaganda shots Photos of Mr Kim being adored by North Korean ladies are regularly released by the administration.</p> <p> <del><img class="aligncenter wp-image-81091 size-full" src="https://mustsharenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/kim-jong-un-women-1.jpg" alt="" width="1180" height="788"></del> Photo by Korean Central News Agency (via Reuters)

He’s a taken man</h3> <p>In case you wanted to swipe right… don’t!</p> <p>Mr Kim’s wife, Ms Ri Sol-ju might come after you.</p> <p> <del><img class="aligncenter wp-image-81127 size-full" src="https://mustsharenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/gettyimages-952999494.jpg" alt="" width="748" height="577"></del> Photo by Inter Korean Press Corp/NurPhoto (via Getty Images)

He studied in Switzerland</h3> <p>Mr Kim might have chosen to speak Korean during the Singapore Summit, but don’t assume the man isn’t fluent in English.</p> <p>He reportedly spent some time studying in Switzerland.</p> <p>Bustle <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/where-did-kim-jong-un-go-to-school-in-switzerland-he-reportedly-had-a-lavish-youth-in-europe-9348179" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> that in 2009, Mr Kim attended the <a href="http://www.isberne.ch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">International School of Berne</a>, a private English-language boarding school.</p> <p>One look at the school’s website and it makes sense that a young Mr Kim was sent there — it appears to be filled with Asians.</p> <p>But Mr Kim apparently kept a low profile during his studies and didn’t tell anybody about his famous heritage.</p> <h3>5. He has a thing for sneakers</h3> <p>According to his classmates from the Swiss school, Mr Kim boasted an “amazing collection of sneakers worth thousands of pounds”.</p> <p>These days, he dresses more modestly — all black all day, every day.</p> <p>In case you need a dose of Kim-spiration for work tomorrow:</p> <p> <del><img class="aligncenter wp-image-81106 size-full" src="https://mustsharenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/34962220_949177768618642_4175342256259072000_n.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="960"></del> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mustsharenews/?ref=br_rs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></p> <h3>6. He might have gone under the knife</h3> <p>Think Madam <a href="https://mustsharenews.com/rosmah-mansor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rosmah Mansor</a>is the only one who’s visited a plastic surgeon?</p> <p>In 2013, reports swirled that Mr Kim had plastic surgery to look more like his grandfather, Mr Kim Il-sung.</p> <p>It’s easy to see why Mr Kim Jong-un would do that — the elder Mr Kim is still revered as the father of North Korea.</p> <p>But North Korea has <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/northkorea/9822936/North-Korea-hits-out-at-sordid-Kim-Jong-un-plastic-surgery-rumours.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strongly denied</a> these reports, calling the idea of their Supreme Leader undergoing plastic surgery “unimaginable”.</p> <p>You be the judge:</p> <p> <del><img class="alignnone wp-image-81118 size-full" src="https://mustsharenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/main-qimg-2f868fedc7e38e340d8f2dae52247ef8-c.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="400"></del> <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-facts-about-Kim-Jong-Un" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></p> <h3>7. He travels with his own toilet</h3> <p>Your stools tell a lot about you. They can probably reveal what you ate for lunch and any diseases you might have.</p> <p>That’s probably why Mr Kim travels with his own toilet.</p> <p>According to <a href="http://www.theweek.co.uk/94221/why-kim-jong-un-brought-his-own-toilet-to-singapore-and-other-weird-summit-facts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Week</a>, the practice stems from Mr Kim’s fear that foreign agents will use his stools to help their states take advantage of North Korea.</p> <h3>8. He’s a basketball superfan</h3> <p>Ever wondered why basketball legend Dennis Rodman is always hanging around Pyongyang?</p> <p>That’s because Mr Kim is reported to be a huge basketball fan.</p> <p>In fact, a schoolmate of his from the <a href="http://www.isberne.ch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">International School of Berne</a>said that Mr Kim used to spend his school days drawing Michael Jordan.</p> <p>And when Mr Kim met Rodman, he even showed him his “<a href="http://www.realclearlife.com/travel/kim-jong-un-parties-massive-private-island-called-north-koreas-ibiza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">personal island</a>“.</p> <p>That’s you thinking dirty, not us.</p> <h3>9.

He’s part of a dysfunctional family</h3> <p>Thought the Kardashians were messy?

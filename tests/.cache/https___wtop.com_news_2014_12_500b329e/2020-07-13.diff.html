</del><del><br></del><del><br></del><del><b>When:</b> Saturday, Dec. 27, 4:30 p.m. (ESPN)
</del><del><br></del><del><br></del><del><b>Where:</b> New York, N.Y.
</del><del><br></del><del><br></del><del><b>Why to watch:</b> While they finished just 7-5, BC showed a propensity to rise to the occasion for big games, beating then ninth-ranked USC and nearly toppling both Clemson and Florida State. Meanwhile, the Nittany Lions took Ohio State to two overtimes before a heartbreaking loss. Both teams sport top-20 defenses, which should lead to an old-fashioned, low scoring game. Bonus: This has the best venue of any game this year -- Yankee Stadium.

</del><del><br></del><del><br></del><del><b>Where:</b> Memphis, Tenn.
</del><del><br></del><del><br></del><del><b>Why to watch:</b> Both schools notched upsets over top-five programs, with A&amp;M toppling Auburn and WVU handing Baylor its lone defeat of the year. But missed opportunities in their other big games left each team with only seven wins. Both are capable of putting up big numbers, especially with Clint Trickett guiding the Mountaineers' ninth-ranked passing offense.

</del><del><br></del><del><br></del><del><b>Where:</b> Orlando, Fla.
</del><del><br></del><del><br></del><del><b>Why to watch:</b> Once a top-five ranked team, the Sooners took TCU to the wire in Fort Worth and battled Kansas State to a one-point game, but were blown out in Norman by Baylor, then lost the Bedlam game in a stunning finish. They have the talent to compete with a Clemson squad that didn't beat a ranked opponent all year. But with a promising season derailed, will Trevor Knight and company show up?

</del><del><br></del><del><br></del><del><b>Where:</b> Houston, Texas
</del><del><br></del><del><br></del><del><b>Why to watch:</b> While both teams are just 6-6, each is playing some of their best football of the year. With a Razorbacks defense that blanked two top-20 opponents in the final three weeks of the season and a UT offense that was held to 10 points or less four times, this game has the highest likelihood of producing a shutout in this year's bowl slate.

</del><del><br></del><del><br></del><del><b>Where:</b> Nashville, Tenn.
</del><del><br></del><del><br></del><del><b>Why to watch:</b> Notre Dame looked to be knocking on the door of the playoff picture before entering a death spiral that saw them drop five of their final six games. Their reward? A feisty LSU team with the nation's third-best scoring defense. Of course, the Tigers were nails at Death Valley (averaging less than 12 points per game allowed), but were a different team away from home (more than 25 PPG).

</del><del><br></del><del><br></del><del><b>Where:</b> Charlotte, N.C.
</del><del><br></del><del><br></del><del><b>Why to watch:</b> The first matchup of ranked teams come inâ€¦the Belk Bowl. It may be an underwhelming title -- and we may still not know exactly what Belk is, or what it does -- but the Dawgs crushed Auburn and the Cardinals won in South Bend, so both teams have bona fide resumes heading into what should be an entertaining matchup.

</del><del><br></del><del><br></del><del><b>When:</b> Tuesday, Dec. 30, 10 p.m. (ESPN)
</del><del><br></del><del><br></del><del><b>Where:</b> Santa Clara, Calif.
</del><del><br></del><del><br></del><del><b>Why to watch:</b> Let's see, a 10 p.m. ET start against a power conference program playing less than 15 miles from campus? That's not an ideal setup for the Terps, who at +14 are the biggest underdog of the bowl season. Then again, Randy Edsall's crew was 5-1 away from College Park this year, with wins in Happy Valley and The Big House. Don't count them out yet.

</del><del><br></del><del><br></del><del><b>Where:</b> Atlanta, Ga.
</del><del><br></del><del><br></del><del><b>Why to watch:</b> Now we're talking. This clash of top-10 programs who each occupied a playoff spot at some point this year is a perfect start to the second-best day of games this year. TCU's second-ranked offense (46.8 points per game) runs into the Rebels' top scoring defense (13.8 PPG). The Horned Frogs (-3) will look to show the committee that they deserved a spot in the final four.

</del><del><br></del><del><br></del><del><b>Why to watch:</b> Have you ever seen Boise State in a big bowl game? The Broncos have only produced two of the most exciting college football games of all time. The hook and ladder. The Statue of Liberty play. On-field marriage proposals.

</del><del><br></del><del><br></del><del><b>When:</b> Wednesday, Dec. 31, 8 p.m. (ESPN)
</del><del><br></del><del><br></del><del><b>Where:</b> Miami, Fla.
</del><del><br></del><del><br></del><del><b>Why to watch:</b> Georgia Tech was the biggest surprise in college football this year outside of TCU, riding the nation's third-best rushing attack to a road upset of in-state SEC rival Georgia and a near-takedown of Florida State in the ACC title game. Mississippi State, meanwhile, saw its big wins (Texas A&amp;M, Auburn) diminished as the season progressed, then lost to both Alabama and Ole Miss late to fall out of the playoff picture. Can the Yellow Jackets expose the SEC again?

</del><del><br></del><del><br></del><del><b>When:</b> Thursday, Jan. 1, 12 p.m. (ESPN2)
</del><del><br></del><del><br></del><del><b>Where:</b> Tampa, Fla.
</del><del><br></del><del><br></del><del><b>Why to watch:</b> While this matchup probably looked better at the beginning of the year than it does now, both teams have registered a pair of top-20 wins. Wisconsin rode Heisman finalist Melvin Gordon through their Big 10 slate, but will the feature back be able to carry the Badgers against the Tigers, or did Ohio State expose Wisconsin's weaknesses in that unsightly conference title game?

</del><del><br></del><del><br></del><del><b>Where:</b> Arlington, Texas
</del><del><br></del><del><br></del><del><b>Why to watch:</b> Baylor gets its chance to make the committee look bad for excluding them, drawing a top-10 Michigan State squad in a virtual home game. The Spartans rank 7th in points scored and 12th in points against, but struggled the most this year in a 19-point loss in Eugene, against an Oregon squad that operates very similarly to the Bears. Baylor has the top scoring offense in the nation and has not scored less than 27 points in any game. Can Sparty keep up?

</del><del><br></del><del><br></del><del><b>Where:</b> Orlando, Fla.
</del><del><br></del><del><br></del><del><b>Why to watch:</b> The networks probably wish they could swap coverage for this game. Easily the weakest of the New Year's Day bowls, this matchup features Mizzou and Minnesota squads that combined for a grand total of zero wins against teams that finished in the Top 25. But hey, you need something to watch during the commercial breaks of Baylor-Michigan State, which figure to be plentiful.

</del><del><br></del><del><br></del><del><b>Why to watch:</b> The Grandaddy of Them All may be just a semifinal game this year, but it's still a dandy. The last two Heisman Trophy winners will square off as Oregon looks to finally break through and vanquish America's villain, the Florida State Seminoles. Vegas has the Ducks as nine-point favorites, but if the Ducks' defense can force Jameis Winston into mistakes, Marcus Mariota and company -- who haven't won a game by fewer than 25 points since Oct. 11 -- may deliver an even bigger knockout blow.

</del><del><br></del><del><br></del><del><b>Why to watch:</b> Saban vs. Meyer. One legacy program against another. As if you needed any additional reason to watch a national semifinal game, the prospect of seeing one of the most reviled programs in the nation knocked out should make nearly every college football fan happy.

</del><del><br></del><del><br></del><del><b>Why to watch:</b> While it's odd to take a step back in terms of important bowl games after New Year's Day, games like this function like the NIT between the first two weekends of March Madness.

</del><del><br></del><del><br></del><del><b>Why to watch:</b> The best sponsor name of any bowl this year comes buried in the post-New Year's purgatory of two middling major-conference programs.

He is, perhaps, the only reason K-State isn't the laughingstock of the Big 12, building up the program from nothing, retiring, then coming back to do it all over again. His overachieving Wildcats take on the underachieving Bruins and Brett Hundley, who probably should have lost at Virginia, at home against Texas and at Cal.

</del><del><br></del><del><br></del><del><b>Why to watch:</b> You may have gone a little too hard on Wednesday night. It's OK; we understand. No need to try to go out again on Friday. There's football on. No, it's not good football. Yes, Oklahoma is the only ranked team (and not ranked anymore) that either team beat this year. Just let it wash over you; let it put you to sleep.

</del><del><br></del><del><br></del><del><b>Why to watch:</b> More football! Hey, East Carolina gave us one of the more fun blowouts of the season when they hung 70 on UNC. The Pirates sport the second-best passing offense in the game, so at least we can expect some fireworks. With Will Muschamp already out the door at Florida, who knows what to expect out of the Gators?

</del><del><br></del><del><br></del><del><b>Why to watch:</b> This should be a terrific game between two top-flight mid-major programs.

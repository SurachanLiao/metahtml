<br>
<p class="textHLMark">Kim</p>'s absences from official state media often spark speculation and rumors about his health. North Korea has no free press and is often a black hole when it comes to the country's leadership. Analysts are heavily reliant on scanning state media dispatches and watching propaganda videos for any semblance of a clue.
<br>
<br>
<p class="textHLMark">Kim</p> last appeared in North Korean state media on April 11. April 15 -- North Korea's most important holiday, the anniversary of the birth of the country's founding father, 
<p class="textHLMark">Kim</p> Il Sung -- came and went without any official mention of 
<p class="textHLMark">Kim</p> 
<p class="textHLMark">Jong</p> 
<p class="textHLMark">Un</p>'s movements.
<br>
<br>Experts are unsure of what to make of 
<p class="textHLMark">Kim</p>'s absence from any festivities celebrating his grandfather. When North Korean leaders have not shown up to these important celebrations in the past, it has portended major developments. But it has also turned out to be nothing.
<br>
<br>"There have been a number of recent rumours about 
<p class="textHLMark">Kim</p>'s health (smoking, heart, and brain). If 
<p class="textHLMark">Kim</p> is hospitalized, it would explain why he wasn't present on the important April 15th celebrations," said Bruce Klingner, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation and former CIA deputy division chief for North Korea. "But, over the years, there have been a number of false health rumors about 
<p class="textHLMark">Kim</p> 
<p class="textHLMark">Jong</p>-
<p class="textHLMark">un</p> or his father. We'll have to wait and see."

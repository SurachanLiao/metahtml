It also said that North Korea would find and “mercilessly destroy” the terrorists.</p><p>It comes amid high tensions in the region.</p><h2>Comments</h2><p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2017/05/05/asia/north-korea-kim-assassination/index.html?sr=fbCNN050517north-korea-kim-assassination1030AMVODtopLink&amp;linkId=37228479" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">IS did not respond to a request for comment.</a></p><h2>Counterattack Against the South Korean Charge?</h2><p>A similar charge was laid against Pyongyang by Seoul in February 2017 following the murder of Kim Jong Nam, the elder half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, allegedly at the hands of North Korean-appointed agents. Nam was poisoned with the VX nerve agent while in Kuala Lumpur airport. He died en route to a local hospital.</p><p>North Korea has repeatedly denied its hand in Kim Jong Nam’s death.</p><h2>History of unfounded claims</h2><p>North Korea has a past history of doing bombastic propaganda featuring unfounded claims.</p><p>For example, last month, the state-run newspaper Rodong Sinmun went on to <a href="http://www.skynews.com.au/news/top-stories/2017/04/26/darwin-aiding-us-war-preparation--north-korea.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">claim that the US-Australian military exercises in northern Australia were a part of the preparation for nuclear war against the Hermit Kingdom. It also threatened Darwin with a potential retaliatory strike</a>.</p><h2>Admitting part from the South Korean side</h2><p>For its part, South Korea has admitted to having made some plans to kill Kim.</p><p>Last year, their lawmakers said,</p><blockquote><p>“Seoul has a general idea and plan to use precision missile capabilities to target the enemy’s facilities in major areas as well as eliminating the enemy’s leadership.”</p></blockquote> <del><img class="size-full wp-image-16930" title="US and South Korea Accused Accused of Assassination Attempt of its leader Kim Jong Un by North Korea, But How True is It?" src="" alt="" width="600" height="356"><img class="size-full wp-image-16930" title="US and South Korea Accused Accused of Assassination Attempt of its leader Kim Jong Un by North Korea, But How True is It?" src="//marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/national-assembly-building-of-seoul-south-korea-d76ymd.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="356"></del> <p>South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff has developed a system called the Korea Massive Punishment and Retaliation (KMPR) which comprised of surgical missile attacks, entire special warfare units as well as a potential to strike Pyongyang’s leadership if Seoul feels threatened by any nuclear attack.</p><h2>Who is Kim Jong Un?</h2><p><a href="https://marriedbiography.com/kim-jong-un-says-new-missile-gift-american-bs-north-korea-us-independence-day/">Kim Jong-un</a>is the Chairman of the Workers’ Party of Korea (WPK) as well as the supreme leader of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), often referred to as North Korea.

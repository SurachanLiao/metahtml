They are more stressed out by the conflict between Democrats and Republicans or the problem of race relations in America than they are about their marital difficulties, their phobias, their anger at their father-in-law or their worries about getting ahead in their career.
</p><p>In the last few years, a great many of my clients have spent whole sessions venting about Donald Trump or about political correctness. When Trump was elected, several of my patients went on about him for months. They would rage for the whole session without needing me to say a word. In fact, they didn’t want me to say a word. A few years back when Google fired an employee who complained about the political correctness there, many people were venting about that for months.

One kind was the fake kind in which porn stars pretend to be brother and sister or brother and step-sister. The other kind consisted of actual homemade clips by real brothers and sisters. Many were appearing in “cam shows” in which they undressed and had sex for internet audiences who gave tips or paid for private showings.

But there is not yet a concrete plan for how denuclearization could be implemented.</p><p>U.S. intelligence chiefs believe there is little likelihood Kim will voluntarily give up his nuclear weapons or missiles capable of carrying them. Private analysts reviewing commercial satellite imagery  have assessed that the North is still developing nuclear and missile technology despite suspending tests.</p><p>RELATED: <a href="https://abc13.com/politics/what-you-need-to-know-about-trumps-north-korean-summit/3591434/">Here's what you need to know about Trump's North Korean summit</a> <p class="report-typo">

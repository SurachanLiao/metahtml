<p>The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, agreed in a 30 June meeting with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump" class="u-underline">Donald Trump</a> to reopen working-level talks stalled since their failed February summit in Hanoi, but this has yet to happen despite repeated appeals from Washington.</p>
<p>In a statement carried by North Korea&#8217;s official KCNA news agency, the deputy foreign minister, Choe Son-hui, said Pyongyang was willing to have &#8220;comprehensive discussions&#8221; with the United States in late September at a time and place agreed between both sides.</p>
<p>Asked for comment, a US state department spokeswoman said: &#8220;We don&#8217;t have any meetings to announce at this time.&#8221;</p>
<p>On Sunday, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/mike-pompeo" class="u-underline">Mike Pompeo</a>, the US secretary of state, said he hoped to return to denuclearisation talks with North Korea in the coming days or weeks.</p>

<p>But Choe highlighted that Washington needed to present a new approach or the talks could fall apart again.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to believe that the US side would come out with an alternative based on a calculation method that serves both sides&#8217; interests and is acceptable to us,&#8221; Choe said.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the US side toys with an old scenario that has nothing to do with the new method at working-level talks which would be held after difficulties, a deal between the two sides may come to an end.&#8221;</p>
<p>In April, Kim set a year-end deadline for the United States to show more flexibility in talks, which broke down in February over US demands for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/north-korea" class="u-underline">North Korea</a> to give up all of its nuclear weapons and Pyongyang&#8217;s demands for relief from punishing US-led international sanctions.</p>
<p>The end-of-September timeframe would coincide with the annual United Nations general assembly in New York, which Pompeo is due to attend. North Korea&#8217;s mission to the United Nations said last week that the foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, would not attend &#8220;due to his schedule&#8221;.</p>
<p>North Korea has demanded that Pompeo be replaced with a &#8220;more mature&#8221; person in the US negotiating team, while lauding the rapport built between Kim and Trump in three meetings since June 2018.</p>
<p>The US special representative for North Korea, Stephen Biegun, led working-level talks with North Korea in the run-up to the failed Hanoi meeting.</p>

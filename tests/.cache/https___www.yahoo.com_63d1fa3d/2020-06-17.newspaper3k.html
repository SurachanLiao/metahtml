Gratham painted a very dire picture of the investment landscape in the U.S., suggesting that rampant trading by out-of-work investors and speculative fervor around bankrupt companies, including car-rental company Hertz Global Holdings Inc. (HTZ) reflects a market that may be the most bubblicious he's seen in his storied career.</p></div>

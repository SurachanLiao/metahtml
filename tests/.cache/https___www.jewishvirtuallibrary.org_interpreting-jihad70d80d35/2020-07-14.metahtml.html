<article><p align="justify">Every discussion of Islamic                                   militancy turns eventually to two fundamental                                   concerns. First, how much is Islamism (that                                   practiced by fundamentalist Muslims open                                   to violence) rooted in the teaching and practice                                   of the prophet <a href="/muhammad">Muhammad</a>?                                   Would he celebrate the work of <a href="/foreign-terrorist-organizations#Osama">Osama                                     bin Laden</a>? Second, are the violent jihads of                                   our day sanctioned by the <a href="/the-koran-qur-an">Qur'an</a> and                                   by the actions of early Muslim leaders?</p><p align="justify"> The prophet himself engaged                                   in many military battles and could be merciless                                   to his enemies, even those who simply attacked                                   him verbally. His original sympathies with                                   Jews and Christians as &#8220;<a href="/jews-in-islamic-countries">Peoples                                     of the Book</a>&#8221; gave way to a harsher                                   treatment when they did not follow Islam.                                   In one infamous episode, Muhammad cut the                                   heads off hundreds of Jewish males of the                                   Beni Quraiza tribe who did not side with                                   him in battle. The prophet is quoted as saying,  &#8220;The                                   sword is the key of heaven and hell; a drop                                   of blood shed in the cause of Allah, a night                                   spent in arms, is of more avail than two                                   months of fasting or prayer: whosoever falls                                   in battle, his sins are forgiven, and at                                   the day of judgment his limbs shall be supplied                                   by the wings of angels and cherubim.&#8221;</p><p align="justify"> In reference to the Qur'an,                                   many have drawn attention to the famous passage                                   in Surah 2:256:                                    &#8220;Let there be no compulsion in religion.&#8221;                                    This verse fits well with other Qur'an verses                                   in which jihad means personal and communal                                   spiritual struggle or striving. But the Qur'an                                   also uses jihad to mean &#8220;holy war,&#8221;                                    and the language can be extreme. Surah 5:33                                   reads, &#8220;The punishment of those who                                   wage war against God and His Messenger, and                                   strive with might and main for mischief through                                   the land is: execution, or crucifixion, or                                   cutting off of hands and feet from opposite                                   sides, or exile from the land: that is their                                   disgrace in this world, and a heavy punishment                                   is theirs in the Hereafter.&#8221;</p><p align="justify"> Both the example of the                                   prophet and some emphases in the Qur'an provided                                   warrant for Islam's earliest leaders to spread                                   Islam by military conquest. Bloody expansionism                                   was also justified through original Islamic                                   law that divided the world into two realms: Dar                                     al-Harb (the land of war) and Dar                                       al-Islam (land under Islamic rule).

Islamists consider                                   their actions a true jihad or &#8220;holy                                   war&#8221; against infidels and the enemies                                   of Islam. They believe it is right to target                                   America, &#8220;the great Satan.&#8221; Osama                                   bin Laden believes that the Qur'an supports                                   his campaign, that the prophet would bless                                   his cause, and that Allah is on his side.                                   But the vast majority of Muslims believe                                   that nothing in Muhammad's life or in the                                   Qur'an or Islamic law justifies <a href="/terrorism">terrorism</a>.</p><p align="justify"> Bernard Lewis, the great                                   historian of Islam, noted in The Wall                                     Street Journal that throughout history,                                   Muslims have given jihad both spiritual                                   and military meaning. Lewis also pays particular                                   attention to the legal traditions in Islam                                   about what constitutes just war. After noting                                   the many limitations placed on military jihad,                                   he writes, &#8220;What the classical jurists                                   of Islam never remotely considered is the                                   kind of unprovoked, unannounced mass slaughter                                   of uninvolved civil populations that we saw                                   in New York [on September 11, 2001]. For                                   this there is no precedent and no authority                                   in Islam.&#8221;</p><p>Sources: <span class="sources">Excerpted from Christianity Today, (January 7, 2002)    James A.

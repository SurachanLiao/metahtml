The use of the smallpox virus as a biological weapon is very old. Confronted with a high probability of a currennt bioterrorist menace, counteracting strategies have been developed. One of the principle aims relies on the vaccination of teams dedicated to the management of persons infected and the stocking of sufficient doses of vaccine for the whole population of a country.

•

Following worldwide eradication of the disease, preventive vaccination was stopped in 1978 in France for the primo-vaccination, and in 1984 for repeat vaccinations.

•

The various strains used in the first generation vaccinations are weakened living vaccines from the virus of the vaccine, the natural host and origin of which are unknown. Second and third generations vaccines are under study; the principle objective is to obtain efficacy with a minimum of side effects.

•

There are two types of adverse events, generally observed with the first generation vaccines: the first, extremely rare, can be life-threatening; the others, more frequent (10 to 15% of patients) are benign.

•

In emergency situations in the presence of smallpox, there should be no absolute contraindications to vaccination.

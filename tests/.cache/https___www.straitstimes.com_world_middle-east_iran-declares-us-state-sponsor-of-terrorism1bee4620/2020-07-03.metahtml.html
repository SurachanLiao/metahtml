</blockquote><p>The US decision came as part of already far-reaching attempts to undermine the Iranian government.</p><p>President Donald Trump said the "unprecedented" move "recognises the reality that Iran is not only a State Sponsor of Terrorism, but that the IRGC actively participates in, finances, and promotes terrorism as a tool of statecraft." "The IRGC is the Iranian government's primary means of directing and implementing its global terrorist campaign," Trump said in a statement.</p><p>It is the first time the United States has applied the designation to part of a foreign government, rather than guerrilla groups or other informal entities.</p><p>The move follows Trump's decision to pull the United States out of a multilateral deal with Iran that was meant to lift crippling economic sanctions in return curbs on Tehran's nuclear programme.</p><p class="label-inline">Topics:&#160;</p><ul><li><a href="/tags/iran">IRAN</a></li><li><a href="/tags/us-foreign-policy">US FOREIGN POLICY</a></li></ul><p class="a2a-buttons a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 a2a_default_style clearfix">

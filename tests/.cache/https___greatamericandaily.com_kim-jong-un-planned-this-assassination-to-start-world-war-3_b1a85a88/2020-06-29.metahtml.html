In six years, the leader purged senior officials and relatives allegedly plotting to overthrow him and his regime. </p><p>Kim&#8217;s uncle, Jang Song Thaek, was executed in 2013 when he was accused of being a &#8220;traitor&#8221; and committing a series of &#8220;hideous crimes.&#8221; His exiled half-brother, Kim Jong Nam, died this year when two women smeared his face with the banned VX nerve agent in Kuala Lumpar airport in Malaysia. Two women are being charged in his death, although they claim they were duped into thinking they were playing a harmless prank for a hidden-camera TV show.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>When the killings happened, pundits brushed them off as a product of Jong Un&#8217;s lunacy.</p><p>But there may have been another motive.</p><p>A Japanese magazine reported Kim Jong Un ordered the killings because his relatives were secretly meeting with China to stage a coup and replace Jong Un with his half-brother.</p><p>Fox News also reported:</p><blockquote><p>North Korea never acknowledged the half-brother&#8217;s death, but a report by the Japanese magazine Nikkei Asian Review claimed the leader had both relatives killed because of a coup concocted a year after he came to power, Sky News reported. </p><p>The magazine cited three sources who said Jang met with then-Chinese President Hu Jintao in August 2012 and &#8220;proposed a plot to oust Kim Jong Un and replace him with his elder half-brother,&#8221; with China&#8217;s support. </p><p>Hu reportedly didn&#8217;t give Jang a clear answer, and Zhou Yongkang, Kim&#8217;s ally in the Chinese government, informed the North Korean leader about the plot. Kim then &#8220;flew into a rage&#8221; around the time when Jang was executed, whom he branded &#8220;worse than a dog&#8221; and a &#8220;despicable human scum.&#8221;&#160; </p><p>While Kim Jong Nam was not thought to be seeking influence, his position as eldest son of the family that has ruled North Korea since its founding could have made him appear to be a threat. Kim Jong Nam had also spoken out publicly against his family&#8217;s dynastic control of the nuclear-armed nation. </p><p>Kim Jong Nam was killed in 2013 at Malaysian airport.&#160; (Reuters)</p><p>Zhou was sentenced to life in jail in China after being charged with bribery, abuse of power and &#8220;intentionally leaking state secrets.&#8221; </p></blockquote><p>Since remaining in power, Kim Jong Un has pressed forward in developing nuclear weapons that could strike the United States.</p><p>And when he threatened to launch missiles at the U.S. territory of Guam the world was at the brink of nuclear war.</p><p>He backed down from threatening Guam in the face of Donald Trump promising a response of &#8220;fire and fury&#8221; but he has yet to renounce his nuclear weapons program.</p><p>As such, war could break out at any moment.</p><p>Had Jong Un been replaced with someone more amenable to working with China this whole situation could have been avoided.</p><p>But Kim Jong Un killed his relatives and set this all into motion.</p></article>

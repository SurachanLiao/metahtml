Since then, the state has seen exponential growth. In the U.S., there are thousands of confirmed cases and nearly 70 deaths, according to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html" target="_blank">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>. Across the world, more than 175,000 people have been reported to be infected in the pandemic. More than 7,000 have died, according to <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html">Johns Hopkins University</a>.</p><p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="JSWWIWOLOZDIPN5ORYNWE54Y74">So far, New Jersey has recorded three deaths. Rita Fusco-Jackson, a Freehold resident in her 50s died on Thursday, officials <a href="https://www.nj.com/coronavirus/2020/03/nj-confirms-2nd-coronavirus-death-monmouth-county-woman-in-her-50s.html">said this weekend</a>. The first death was of John Brennan, a 69-year-old man from Bergen county, who died March 10.</p><p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="6GGQK6POMNBUHEC22XZBMSRFO4">On Monday night, Gov. Phil Murphy announced the death of a man in his 90s from the virus.</p><p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="TIXBHJPGGVDZXGHMI7GPB4SO7Q">The trajectory for coronavirus cases in New Jersey closely mirrors what has been seen elsewhere in the U.S. and around the world: a slow buildup followed by dramatic spikes that reflect the virus&#8217; exponential spread. The number of cases announced on Monday &#8212; 80 &#8212; raised the state total to 178, an 82% growth in reported cases overnight.</p><p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="T7XHSJ6RONBDZGPVWDECFXF3Z4">As recently as 11 days ago, there was one case in one county in New Jersey. Now, 14 counties are affected. Hunterdon County had its first positive test on Monday, the first new county to be affected since Mercer and Ocean three days ago. The spread has been swift in Essex County. The virus was found in eight other counties prior to being seen for the first time there on Thursday, but Essex now has the second most cases in the state behind Bergen.</p><p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="D5LVERKQO5A7BOPOLBN7THCCWE">As of March 15, there were no reported cases in Cape May, Cumberland, Atlantic, Salem, Gloucester, Sussex or Warren counties.</p><p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="OL7NDDLAGZEKNNDRCPSKO75VDI">On a radio show Sunday, Murphy said he&#8217;d take <a href="https://www.nj.com/coronavirus/2020/03/nj-declares-state-of-emergency-over-coronavirus-concerns.html">&#8220;more draconian steps&#8221; </a>to curb the spread of the virus.</p><p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="7MCMYT74W5GCLM4FV5GZQ6JCRU">Murphy asked for a statewide curfew Monday, requesting New Jerseyans to not leave their homes between 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. to help stop the spread of the virus. He announced it after a joint call with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont. The governors of the tristate area also jointly announced all <a href="https://www.nj.com/coronavirus/2020/03/nj-shuttering-casinos-movie-theaters-and-gyms-because-of-coronavirus.html">movie theaters, gyms, and casinos in all three states must close at 8 p.m. Monday </a>and will remain closed until further instruction. They also said that bars and restaurants will only serve take-out food till further notice.</p><p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="GV27M4SUMFBDXGTET4L3CR4REI">&#8220;We want everybody home &#8212; not out,&#8221; Murphy said.</p><p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5BTYWKJCTBBIFKAUITQJRRTC64"><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScXiCGRLFaplzs-0Z_FNvBVr248HJ13kPmnO9PCc9IKaHWYQw/viewform">Tell us your coronavirus stories</a>, whether it&#8217;s a news tip, a topic you want us to cover, or a personal story you want to share. </p><p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="6FOREFE5IBFABAME3PR4NFQEAU">Disha Raychaudhuri may be reached at <a href="mailto:draychaudhuri@njadvancemedia.com">disha@njadvancemedia.com</a>.

The number of reported coronavirus cases shot up drastically Monday in New Jersey, when the state announced 80 new cases, bringing the total to at least 178.

The first reported case was on March 5, when a 32-year-old man from Fort Lee, Bergen County, tested positive. Since then, the state has seen exponential growth. In the U.S., there are thousands of confirmed cases and nearly 70 deaths, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Across the world, more than 175,000 people have been reported to be infected in the pandemic. More than 7,000 have died, according to Johns Hopkins University.

So far, New Jersey has recorded three deaths. Rita Fusco-Jackson, a Freehold resident in her 50s died on Thursday, officials said this weekend. The first death was of John Brennan, a 69-year-old man from Bergen county, who died March 10.

On Monday night, Gov. Phil Murphy announced the death of a man in his 90s from the virus.

The trajectory for coronavirus cases in New Jersey closely mirrors what has been seen elsewhere in the U.S. and around the world: a slow buildup followed by dramatic spikes that reflect the virus’ exponential spread. The number of cases announced on Monday — 80 — raised the state total to 178, an 82% growth in reported cases overnight.

As recently as 11 days ago, there was one case in one county in New Jersey. Now, 14 counties are affected. Hunterdon County had its first positive test on Monday, the first new county to be affected since Mercer and Ocean three days ago. The spread has been swift in Essex County. The virus was found in eight other counties prior to being seen for the first time there on Thursday, but Essex now has the second most cases in the state behind Bergen.

As of March 15, there were no reported cases in Cape May, Cumberland, Atlantic, Salem, Gloucester, Sussex or Warren counties.

On a radio show Sunday, Murphy said he’d take “more draconian steps” to curb the spread of the virus.

Murphy asked for a statewide curfew Monday, requesting New Jerseyans to not leave their homes between 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. to help stop the spread of the virus. He announced it after a joint call with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont. The governors of the tristate area also jointly announced all movie theaters, gyms, and casinos in all three states must close at 8 p.m. Monday and will remain closed until further instruction. They also said that bars and restaurants will only serve take-out food till further notice.

“We want everybody home — not out,” Murphy said.

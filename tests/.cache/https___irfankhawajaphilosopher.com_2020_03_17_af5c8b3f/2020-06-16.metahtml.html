Out, out, brief candle!</p><p>Life&#8217;s but a walking shadow, a poor player,</p><p>That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,</p><p>And then is heard no more.

Amusingly enough, my ex-wife once told me, flat out, &#8220;Before I met you, I was on the fence about having children. I no longer am. You would make a terrible father. So I&#8217;ve abandoned the idea.&#8221; Music to my ears.</p><p>And yet, I&#8217;ve just had a phone conversation with one of my best friends, in which he asked me whether I would temporarily take custody of his child in the event that both he and his wife die of COVID-19. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; I say, without hesitation. I actually like his kid, as kids go. Granted, the custody he imagines is temporary, until family members could come and do a formal adoption.

The spread of the coronavirus in Contra Costa County added 25 more patients to its list Tuesday, health officials there said.

The Contra Costa County Health Services Department put the number of confirmed cases at 442 in its daily update Tuesday morning. It listed 417 confirmed cases on Monday.

The county added 31 confirmed cases to its list on Monday, 43 on Sunday and 46 on Saturday, the three largest one-day leaps since the pandemic began. The county reported the first positive case of COVID-19 on March 4.

Overall, the county has tested 5,831 patients.

No new deaths have been added to the countyâ€™s total. The coronavirus is responsible for seven deaths during the pandemic.

Health officials also said 29 people were in a hospital with COVID-19 on Tuesday, down one from on Monday.

In a breakdown of the confirmed positive cases in each city, officials said of the 442 cases, 39 were in Richmond, 36 in Concord, 33 in Orinda and 33 in Pittsburg. None of those cities added any additional cases to the total Tuesday.

Those numbers are expected to change, especially with COVID-19 apparently spreading through an Orinda senior care facility.

Officials also said that of the first 417 patients positively diagnosed with coronavirus, 239 were women.

Approximately 1.14 million people live in Contra Costa County. They remain under a stay-at-home order that has been extended at least through May 3.

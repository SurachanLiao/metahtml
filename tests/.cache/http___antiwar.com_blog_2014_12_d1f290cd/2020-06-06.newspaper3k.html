<div><p>The US must not miss the opening right before us for agreements with Iran that would bring economic benefits to both nations. Such a partnership seems possible because the nuclear negotiations have been extended, and Iran is in compliance with dramatic demands for intrusive inspections by beefed up U.N. inspection teams. </p>
<p>The greatest benefit so far to the U.S. and Iran is that negotiations have forestalled military action advocated by hawks, which could have sparked a regional war. The US has far more to gain with Iran as an ally than an adversary. </p>
<p>Iran&#8217;s population of 60 million people is a huge untapped market that is not yet open to US businesses, although European industries are moving in to establish trade. America&#8217;s ranchers and farmers would benefit from trade with Iran, because that country will buy meat and wheat, as well as other products common in our society.</p>

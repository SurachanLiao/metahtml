<h2><p class="mw-headline" id="Background"> Background </p></h2>
<p>By 2017, North Korea had the power to hit any country on Earth with a nuclear warhead without an invasion or getting closer. The United States and South Korea felt as though it was a huge threat to them and to the world. US President <a href="/wiki/Donald_Trump_(Ryan_K%27s_World)" title="Donald Trump (Ryan K's World)">Donald Trump</a> came up with a solution, Project Disruption. The goal of Project Disruption was to leak as much negative information to the citizens of North Korea about their leader and country. When the information was leaked, many citizens were outraged, many tried to leave the country, but with more security, most of these people would be brutally executed.

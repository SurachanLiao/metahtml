Link: http://mysingaporenews.blogspot.com/2020/07/elections-in-western-democracies-and.html </a> </ins></h3><ins> </ins><p class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-1947272225310777125"><ins>Do elections in western countries really demonstrate that they are democratic. No, never, elections in western democracies and pseudo democracies have exposed their cancerous corruptions.</ins></p><p><ins>When elections are around all the rogues, shits, scums and rag tags will take the opportunity to stand for election. When elected they will plunder the country for personal gains and self-interests. All promises to the people during elections are hogwash and soon forgotten. Their behaviour at election time is like wild dogs, hyenas and wolves in heat always barking and howling at each other.</ins></p><p><ins>The robber barons in western democracies, the crooks, scoundrels and rogues in parliament, Senate, Congress and House of Representatives have always been robbing the people and the country freely with impunity. Unfortunately this western political disease has spread far and wide to pseudo democracies all over Africa, Asia and Latin America.</ins></p><p><ins>Western democracies mean legalise robbery by crooks and scoundrels in Congress, Senate, parliament or House of Representatives and other high places of power and authority like the US judiciary, CIA, Pentagon and The Federal Reserve Bank. The citizens are numbed and intimidated and cannot do anything . Corruption is rife and very extensive in all or most western democracies and pseudo democracies, yet it is never easy to pin down a rogue politician on corruption.</ins></p><p><ins>The American politicians have  developed a systematic " Political Lobby" a very powerful corrupted system whereby politicians who are supported by rich millionaires or billionaires in big corporations and companies will represent them to lobby the government to do things at their bidding for their own selfish interests, aggrandizement and enrichment. In the meantime the interests of the  over 95 percent  ordinary American citizens are ignored.</ins></p><p><ins>Thus western democracy is clearly used by the rich and powerful as a tool and instrument to defraud and control the populace and the country. Indeed the Americans use 'Democracy' as a tool and medium to rob and control the whole world especially the poor third world countries through defrauding them by subterfuge.</ins></p><p><ins>Southernglory1</ins></p><p><ins>Friday, 3rd July, 2020

Think the posters were put up by our foreign talents who were unfamiliar with the PAP logo nor were they able to read and could not tell the diffence between an upside down poster.

There are anger and frustration for and against the ruling party and the opposition camp as well.</ins></p><p class="separator"><ins>Now everyone is calling for calm. Not to worry, it would not become like, 'Black Lives Matter' even if the campaign cry is turning to 'Singaporean Lives Matter'. Suddenly everyone seems to be very concern about the well being of Singaporeans, about finding jobs for Singaporeans, and to be serious, they are now talking about good jobs, not drivers, security guards and cleaners.  Is this just part of the political gerrymandering, good enough for one week of campagning and everything back to normal after the GE? Then the official calls will be again for more foreign talents and more population growth? And be happy if you have a job, any job, done be choosy. Be grateful? Cannot use any numbers, very sensitive now.  The official position expounded by Vivian is that the govt has no official target for population growth, not even thinking of 6.9m and definitely not 10m. </ins></p><p class="separator"><ins>Should Singaporeans fearing more job losses to foreigners, higher cost of living and more squeeze and having to make sex in small places be feeling better now, more assured that things would not go down that slippery road of no return?</ins></p><p class="separator"><ins>These are pre election days. Everyone is saying nice things that the people want to hear.

The native Australians have 0 trust in the white Australian govt for the centuries of abuses, ill treatment and racial discrimination after invading and seizing their land. The non white population of Australians have little trust in being treated fairly by the white Australian govt and at best as second or third class citizens.</ins></p><p><ins>Regionally the trust by the nations in the region of white Australia and their white policies has never been lower. In most instances the trust is less than 30 percent. None of the countries in the region believe that the white Australian govt is a part of the region, none see the white Australian govt as part of the region. Most of the countries see white Australian govt as a continued legacy of European colonialism and should have no place in the history and affairs of the region. The white Australians are foreigners to the region.</ins></p><p><ins>Very few countries in the region have trust that the white Australian govt would act responsibly for the interest of the people of the region. Some regard the white Australians as behaving like white colonialists walking around carrying a big stick as if they are the warlords of the region.</ins></p><p><ins>The poll also found that most white Australians viewed favourably their relationship with the USA than with China or countries in the region.</ins></p><p><ins>PS. RISS is the Redbean Institute of Strategic Studies, an authoritative regional think tank.

It simply 
means, watch your back because something unexpected – invariably 
negative, dangerous, violent, unexpected – is going to happen TO YOU.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>In this case of Surya Kumar, given the context of what has happened 
with Ivan Lim and RSM Bryant’s role in it, Surya Kumar’s threat is 
particularly troubling.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The authorities really should look into the threat.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Andrew Loh</ins></p><p><ins>Above is Andrew Loh's post on the latest threat by ex Colonel Surya Kumar against RSM Bryant Wong for exposing PAP candidate Ivan Lim's past. Telling someone to watch your back, implicating that something unpleasant is going to happen is surely not a nice thing to say. What can happen to Bryant Wong and who would be responsible for it?  Now a police report has been made against this big shot ex colonel of the the SAF.</ins></p><p><ins>This reminds me of the threat against me sometime ago by an IB called Raymond in my blog. I too made a police report against him. This Raymond could also be a big shot from some organisation and thus dared to behave so arrogantly, like a gangster.</ins></p><p><ins>I told that Raymond that he better prayed that nothing would happen to me, if it does, then he would be held responsible for it. And this could be anything that could hurt me, be it an accident or in the case of RSM Bryant Wong, losing his job or maybe kena robbed or beaten on the way home.</ins></p><p><ins>Making such uncalled for threat is unacceptable in our so called rule of law state. Are these people gangsters or what? Or are they above the law and could make such threats against another citizen and acted as if nothing would happen to them, they are untouchable?</ins></p><p><ins>Now this colonel better pray that nothing untoward happened to Bryant Wong in the next few days or months. If it does, the fingers would be pointing to him for making this threat.</ins></p><p><ins>Never mind if the police would call him up or not. Pray that Bryant Wong is safe and sound. Bryant can put the blame on him for anything bad that happened to him. Don't pray pray.</ins></p><p><ins>In the past the fear of Singaporeans used to be Sue. Now there is another fear, threats or the legal people would call it criminal intimidation by powerful people or well connected people. A new fear in the scene.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="post-footer-line post-footer-line-1"><ins><span class="post-author vcard">Posted by

Every Chinese worth his salt should be proud of it. Link: http://mysingaporenews.blogspot.com/2020/07/china-led-by-chinese-communist-party-is.html </a> </ins></h3><ins> </ins><p><ins>PART      FIVE</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Last And Concluding episode</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The ultimate triumph of the Chinese Communist Party after a long and lethal life and death struggle against the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek 's KMT , Japan and the Western imperial powers headed by UK, US and France.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The Chinese Communist Party Revolution was disrupted by Chiang. Mao and Chu Teh and the CCP had to escape to the hills in Ching Kang-shan in Hunan where they found the Fourth Red Army  to continue their revolution to bring in a strong and successful socialist China.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The debacle of the CCP in the struggle with Chiang Kai Shek and the KMT was due to the wrong, confusing  and conflicting instructions of Stalin via his officials Borodin and Galen. Thereafter the CCP under the leadership of Mao Tse-tung disavowed Russian communist advice and followed only their own policies and strategy and Mao Tse-tung's instructions. </ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The period from 1922 to the mid 1930s  was a time of great danger to China. Chiang's KMT was beset with great internal feuds, strive and power struggle. The CCP  under the leadership of Mao Tse-tung though  cohesive and united was very much weakened with constant attacks by Chiang's KMT armies.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>In the meantime Japanese aggression against China became more strident and fiercer. After the annexation of Korea in 1910, Japan was coveting the conquest of the Chinese provinces of Manchuria and Outer Mongolia. Japan already occupied the Liaotung Peninsula which it took over from the Russian leasehold after the defeat of Russia in the Russo-Japanese war of 1905. It also took over Russia's control of the railways in Manchuria.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Japan started to invade Manchuria after staging the Mukden Incident  on 18 th September, 1931 whereby a bomb explosion in a railway track was blamed on the Chinese to provide a basis for Japanese aggression. Inspite of China's protest and appeal to the League of Nations none of the Western powers and Russia condemn Japan or came to China's help. Thus China was left to face Japan alone.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Chiang Kai-shek also did not want to confront the Japanese at this time because his priority was to destroy Mao Tse-tung and the CCP as he claimed that the Japanese problem was the disease of the skin while the CCP was the disease of the heart. With this type of warp thinking how could China be saved from foreign aggression and in this case Japanese aggression. So it beholds that only the CCP could save China.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>While the CCP pleaded to the KMT for unity and solidarity among the Chinese to fight and oppose Japanese aggression, Chiang thought otherwise and continued to attack and harass the CCP troops. Mao was concentrating to attack the Japanese with guerilla warfare but ironically he and his CCP troops were constantly attacked and harassed by the KMT armies.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Stalin also contributed to the weakening of the CCP when he supported a different faction which toed the Comintern's instructions to stage uprisings from the cities which always failed with disastrous consequences whereas Mao organized peasant uprisings and resistance. Eventually it was Mao's tactics that reaped the greatest success in galvanizing the Chinese spirit to successfully defeat the reactionary forces of Chiang Kai-shek's KMT and the Japanese armies.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>At Ching Kang-shan Mao regrouped his forces to form the Fourth Army under the command of Chu Teh and Ch'en Yi. Thereafter they moved their headquarters to Juichin, Kiangsi province. The CCP created another base in Shensi province under the charge of Liu Chih-tan and Kao-kang. As pointed out earlier the CCP would have suffered irrecoverable damage if it were to continue receiving wrong instructions from Stalin and the Comintern. Thus Mao and his colleagues, Chu Teh, Chen Yi, Chou En-lai, P'eng Te-huai  and other leaders refused to take instructions from Stalin or the Comintern. Under the strong leadership of Mao Tse-tung they decided on their own policies and strategies in the struggle and fight against the KMT and the Japanese invaders. Moa's growing power and independence from Stalin's or Comintern's control was the essential factor that contributed  to CCP's final victory over the KMT and the Japanese and China's regain of sovereignty when all western powers were driven out of China.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The CCP's base in Juichin became untenable as Chiang Kai-shek's KMT armies kept on attacking and harassing them relentlessly non-stop and with aerial bombing too. If the CCP did not move out of Juichin the communist forces would have been completely wiped out by Chiang Kai-shek. So on October 15 ,1934 Mao and his army started on the Long March with 100,000 soldiers on a 6000 miles journey to Yenan , Shensi province in the north west far away from KMT forces. On November 10, 1934, Juichin fell to the Nationalist - KMT forces. At the end of the epic Long March Mao's forces could count with only about 10, 000 survivors.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>In Yenan other communist forces led by other leaders joined Mao Tse-tung to continue their fight against the KMT and the Japanese invaders. From 1936 the Japanese had stepped up their attack on China and invaded large parts of north east China and the coastal regions. The Chinese communists adopted guerilla warfare against the Japanese and constantly attacked their rear with hit and run tactics. Still the despicable Chiang refused to unite with Mao to fight the Japanese. On December 12, at Sian, Chiang Kai-shek was made a captive by Chang Hsueh-Liang a commander of the KMT army to force him to unite with the CCP to fight the Japanese.  His release was brokered by the good will of Chou En-lai. But the cooperation between the KMT and the CCP did not last long. For soon after the Japanese surrender in 1945, the Chinese civil war between the KMT and the CCP resumed due to the untrustworthy nature of Chiang Kai-shek and the KMT.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The civil war ended with the triumphant victory for Mao Tse-tung and his communist government as they had the whole support of the Chinese people both the rural peasants and the working class proletariats in all the towns and cities. China under the CCP had stood up with pride and dignity on 1st October, 1949 as proclaimed by Chairman Mao Tse-tung.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Thus with the Chinese Communist Party leadership and guidance today's China is able to grow from strength to strength in her all round development in her economy, science and technology, trade and finance, political and military power . The CCP has brought back honour, self-respect, pride and dignity to China and the Chinese people.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>China's success is due to the great leaders both past and present and the millions of patriots who are selfless, self-sacrificing and utterly devoted to serve the country for the glory of the nation. Therefore every Chinese must honour and cherish the CCP and its leaders.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Southernglory1</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Wednesday, 1st July , 2020</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="post-footer-line post-footer-line-1"><ins><span class="post-author vcard">Posted by

Unfortunately he was not in the list of nomination for the GE.</ins></p><p><ins>Though Cheng Bock has made his present felt, there is just so much Cheng Bock can do as an individual, a solitary figure taking on the PAP political machinery. He needed a few heavy weights, I mean really heavy weights, to take on the PAP. Not many are in this category to really move the people and make big changes to the political system and force the PAP to tread more carefully unlike before. A Hsien Yang would have made the difference. Alas, it is not to be.</ins></p><p><ins>So what can the people that are unhappy with the PAP, with its policies that many viewed as anti Singaporeans and pro foreigners, do in this GE? Nothing much really. Nothing really very much. There would be the possibility of one more GRC, ie West Coast led by Cheng Bock, to join WP's Hougang Aljunied GRC in Parliament if the Hougang Aljunid voters have not been swayed to change sides. PAP's weak team there also gives hope that PAP too think Hougang Aljunid is a gone case and not putting much hope in it. Any more GRCs would be mere accidents. So not much to hope for.</ins></p><p><ins>Would there be accidents happening in Holland Bukit Timah with Jee Say rejoining the SDP team to fight Vivian one more time? Would Lim Tean be able to attract enough votes on his own strength, his commanding oratory skills to make his day? He could not ask for more with Josephine Teo struggling under the pressure of unemployment, fake and funny foreign talents and Covid infections in the dormitories and tasked to lead the Jalan Besar team. Would the absence of Halimah in Marsiling Yew Tee opens up a gap for Benjamin Pwee's team under SDP to make a breakthrough? Would Gan Kim Yong be weakened and made to pay a heavy price for the surge in Covid19 cases and all the problems in the hospitals and allow PSP's newcomers led by Francis Yuen, an SAF scholar, to crash through? Nicole Seah is not going to make much of an impact in a fairly weak team and in the wrong place, against the PM to be Heng Swee Kiat's team. Bad strategy is all I can say, wasting a trump card in a losing corner.  She could have added strength to a team with a higher chance of winning, but not against Heng Swee Kiat, I think. The happiest guy and team must be Chan Chun Sing and the Tanjong Pagar team for not having to meet Hsien Yang wearing PSP logo. If there is going to be an earth shaking moment in the GE2020 election, it must be Hsien Yang bungling Chan Chun Sing and the PAP Tanjong Pagar team out of Parliament. Well, it is game over in Tanjong Pagar.</ins></p><p><ins>In the single wards contest there looks like some possibility of a few opposition candidates making it through the gate. Highly watched would be Paul Tambyah. Chee Soon Juan may be given another chance given the bad publicity and performance of Murali in Bukit Batok. The voters there have seen how he performed and may abandon him for the never say die Chee. There are some far fetch chances for Ang Yong Guan and a few others. The smartest move this time is Goh Meng Seng for taking on Ting Pei Ling, a pretty shaky MP, still looking very young and fresh.</ins></p><p><ins></ins></p><p><ins>At the end of the GE PAP is going to be the next govt again for sure and at most with a few of its MPs and ministers missing the boat. The West Coast team is going to sweat a bit more and feeling very uneasy for now. Everything will remain fairly unchanged.  More foreign talents, more changes to CPF rules, more taxes, more fare and fee hikes, more of everything that Singaporeans know best after every GE. Cry also no tears.</ins></p><p><ins>This GE is likely to be another non event. The only little hope is for a big ground shift given all the bad policies that the people are very unhappy about, the influx of foreigners to steal the Singaporeans lunch, Singaporeans unable to get good jobs, CPF like no longer Singaporeans money but money owed to the govt and the govt is collecting it relentlessly at all cost no matter how old a person is, no time limit, no age limit, etc etc.  If there is such a big shift and the voters would vote for anything as long as it is not PAP, then all hell will break lose. This, unfortunately is yet to be the case, at least not proven till after the GE.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="post-footer-line post-footer-line-1"><ins><span class="post-author vcard">Posted by

In this manner the Chinese Communist Party was founded in 1921.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The CCP was founded simultaneously in 1921 in Peking by Chen Tu-Hsiu , Li Ta-Chao  and Mao Tse-tung where Chen Tu Hsiu was Professor of Peking National University ( PEITA ) and  Li Ta-chao  and Mao Tse-tung were Librarian  and  assistant librarian of Peking University respectively and in Paris, France by a group of Chinese students Chu Teh, Chou En-lai and a few others .</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The Chinese Communist Party was founded independently of the  Russian communist party. However, due to a meeting by Dr. Sun Yat Sen with a Russian communist representative Dr. Sun agreed to take in Chinese communists as members of the KMT.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Meanwhile the endless cycle of warlord civil wars continued in the north. The warlord Feng Yu-hsiang was more agreeable to a peaceful reunion of China. Unfortunately before he could finish his task for the unification of China, Dr Sun died in March , 1925. Before long Feng was ousted by the reactionary Chang Tso-lin the warlord of Manchuria. The reactionary Chang Tso-lin also captured and executed Li Ta-chao on April 28, 1927.  So the reunion of China was temporarily shattered.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Before he died Dr, Sun was preparing the KMT government in Canton for an expedition to conquer the north to destroy the warlords. Dr. Sun had established the Whampoa military training college in Canton. Dr. Sun had put Chiang Kai-shek as commander of the Whampoa military college. From this college some of the best generals of the KMT and the CCP were produced. Many of the KMT generals were disillisioned with the self-serving corrupt Chiang Kai-shek and thus in the on-going civil war in later years they were thus being influenced to cross over to join the ranks of Mao Tse-tung and enabled the Chinese Communist Party to win the civil war from 1946 to 1949.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The indiscriminate shooting of Chinese in foreign concessions due to trade disputes.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>On 30th May, 1925 , a huge student crowd demonstrated against the foreign-controlled police of the International settlement in Shanghai on the occasion of the arrest of strikers from a Japanese mill were fired upon with many fatal casualties by the police in the Nanking Road. This resulted in nationwide boycotts of British and Japanese firms from Canton and Hong Kong to Peking. Demonstrations continued unabated for weeks and months in in all Chinese towns and cities which provoked more foreign violence and atrocities.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The Chinese press was very indignant at the violence of the foreign police and fiercely condemned the foreigners in no uncertain terms. There was universal indignation, violent hatred and ferocious threats of vengeance against all western imperialist powers and Japan and these demands were the sole response to outrageous foreign action in China. Hundreds of foreign Christian missionaries felt untenable and had to leave China. These missionaries had been brainwashing the Chinese population especially in the interior and converting them to Christianity while at the same time deculturalise the Chinese folks from their traditional beliefs and traditional values.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The Chinese were very outraged because too often the Chinese were badly treated and killed. Shanghai is a Chinese city and the foreign police just shoot and kill as they like with no responsibility or remorse. And those shot and killed were students, scholars and members of the educated elite who were protesting against acts of imperialist oppression.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The Chinese now insist that all foreign concessions and extra-territorial rights should be abolished. For the first time since the Revolution the whole Chinese nation and people were stirred and roused. The infringement of Chinese sovereignty was too much for the Chinese to accept. They realised that foreign aggressions were the cause of all the sorrows and sufferings of China. Thus there was a strong demand and urge to drive the westerners out , to strip them of their ill-gotten wealth, to seize the concessions and abolish their privileges so that the Chinese revolution could go forward in the assurance of victory of modernization and of peace.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>PART      FOUR</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>KMT And CCP Cooperate to liberate China.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>May 30th, 1925, provided a good date for the KMT and the CCP to work together to liberate China from the warlords. The militarist government in Peking and the provincial warlords who accommodated the foreign powers were described by the Chinese as "Running Dogs of the Imperialists because they refused to unite with the KMT and the CCP to drive out the foreign imperialists to liberate China. This serious issue of liberation stired the minds of the soldiers of the warlords and the militarist government in Peking. They were later to cross over to join the forces of the KMT and CCP in their march northward to overthrow the warlords.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The warlords were cooperating with the western powers and Japan to sell China and divide China into separate colonies of the foreign powers. This was too much for the Chinese people and thus when the revolutionary armies from Canton marched north they were in full support and assured the success of the liberation. By 1926 the Revolutionary armies had taken Wu Han and the whole of the YangTze Valley as well as Nanking and Shanghai.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The west especially the British were seriously alarmed by the success of the KMT-CCP unity. The British sent troops to garrison the international settlement and naval ships to the Yang Tze to protect the foreign concessions.In the past it served to frighten the Chinese but not this time.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The Nationalist revolutionary armies undeterred by the presence of foreign warships approached, attacked and captured Nanking. At Hankow the Chinese overran the British concessions, seized the British ships and drove off the British gunboats with severe casualties by artillery fire.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>In Shanghai, in February, 1927, communist forces under the command of Chou En-lai wrested control of the city from the warlords. Foreign powers and the British could no longer maintain their concessions or extra-territorial powers in China. The British realized it was futile to start a war with a strong and very determined revolutionary China.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the CCP</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The KMT and the CCP were supposed to work together in coalition for the good of China's national development. But after achieving success and victory over the warlords Chiang unceremoniously turned against Mao Tse-tung and the communist. On 26th March, 1927 Chiang struck and slew all the communist leaders he could catch in Shanghai and other cities. Fortunately many of the top communist leaders including Chou En-lai managed to escape.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Chiang was so treacherous that with one fell swoop he got rid of the CCP from KMT coalition government and denied it a role in the Chinese revolution against the warlords. Then in 1928 the nationalist armies marched north to Peking and destroyed the warlord Chang Tso-lin. Chiang then shifted the capital from Peking to Nanking.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Though the warlords and the militarists in the north were defeated the task of freeing China from her subjection to the foreigners was not yet completed. The foreigners still retain most of the concessions and most of the extra-territorial privileges.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Chiang had destroyed all oppositions and failed to satisfy the demands of nationalism . Workers in the big cities were suppressed and the communists were driven from power. However on 1st August , 1927, the Fourth Army of the Nationalist at Nan-chang revolted and went over to the communist to form the Red Army of the CCP. Also the peasants who were suppressed and oppressed by Chiang rallied to the CCP.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>End of   PART   FOUR</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>What eventually happened to the Chinese Communist Party  ( CCP ) after Chiang Kai-shek's treasonable acts will appear in the concluding  PART   FIVE  which will be published tomorrow, Wednesday, 1st July, 2020.</ins></p><ins> </ins></div> <div><h2 class="title"><del>Headphones</del></h2><del> </del><p class="widget-content"><del></del></p><del> </del><p class="clear"><del></del></p><del> </del><del><span class="widget-item-control"><span class="item-control blog-admin"><a class="quickedit" href="//www.blogger.com/rearrange?blogID=17473688&amp;widgetType=HTML&amp;widgetId=HTML5&amp;action=editWidget&amp;sectionId=sidebar-right-2-2" rel="nofollow" target="configHTML5" title="Edit"><img alt="" height="18" src="https://resources.blogblog.com/img/icon18_wrench_allbkg.png" width="18">  Link: //www.blogger.com/rearrange?blogID=17473688&amp;widgetType=HTML&amp;widgetId=HTML5&amp;action=editWidget&amp;sectionId=sidebar-right-2-2 </a> </span></span></del><p class="clear"><del></del></p><del> </del><h2 class="title"><del>Electronics</del></h2><del> </del><del><a href="http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-267/1?campid=5337644675&amp;toolid=7115320019255267&amp;customid=&amp;mpvc="><img border="0px" src="http://rover.ebay.com/ar/1/711-53200-19255-267/1?campid=5337644675&amp;toolid=7115320019255267&amp;customid=&amp;mpt=%5BCACHEBUSTER%5D&amp;adtype=1&amp;size=160x600&amp;mpvc=" alt="Click Here">  Link: http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-267/1?campid=5337644675&amp;toolid=7115320019255267&amp;customid=&amp;mpvc= </a> </del><p class="clear"><del></del></p><del> </del><del><span class="widget-item-control"><span class="item-control blog-admin"><a class="quickedit" href="//www.blogger.com/rearrange?blogID=17473688&amp;widgetType=HTML&amp;widgetId=HTML6&amp;action=editWidget&amp;sectionId=sidebar-right-2-2" rel="nofollow" target="configHTML6" title="Edit"><img alt="" height="18" src="https://resources.blogblog.com/img/icon18_wrench_allbkg.png" width="18">  Link: //www.blogger.com/rearrange?blogID=17473688&amp;widgetType=HTML&amp;widgetId=HTML6&amp;action=editWidget&amp;sectionId=sidebar-right-2-2 </a> </span></span></del><p class="clear"><del></del></p><del> </del><h2 class="title"><del>ebay</del></h2><del> </del><del><a href="http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-12/1?campid=5337644675&amp;toolid=711532001925512&amp;customid=&amp;mpvc="><img border="0px" src="http://rover.ebay.com/ar/1/711-53200-19255-12/1?campid=5337644675&amp;toolid=711532001925512&amp;customid=&amp;mpt=%5BCACHEBUSTER%5D&amp;adtype=1&amp;size=120x600&amp;mpvc=" alt="Click Here">  Link: http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-12/1?campid=5337644675&amp;toolid=711532001925512&amp;customid=&amp;mpvc= </a> </del><p class="clear"><del></del></p><del> </del><del><span class="widget-item-control"><span class="item-control blog-admin"><a class="quickedit" href="//www.blogger.com/rearrange?blogID=17473688&amp;widgetType=HTML&amp;widgetId=HTML9&amp;action=editWidget&amp;sectionId=sidebar-right-2-2" rel="nofollow" target="configHTML9" title="Edit"><img alt="" height="18" src="https://resources.blogblog.com/img/icon18_wrench_allbkg.png" width="18">  Link: //www.blogger.com/rearrange?blogID=17473688&amp;widgetType=HTML&amp;widgetId=HTML9&amp;action=editWidget&amp;sectionId=sidebar-right-2-2 </a> </span></span></del><p class="clear"><del></del></p><del> </del><h2 class="title"><del>Disclaimer</del></h2><del> </del><del><a></a></del><del><br></del><del><br></del><del><br></del><del><br>redbean</del><del><br></del><del><br></del><del><br></del><del><br> </del><p><del>As owner of this blog, I bear no responsibility to what other contributors/bloggers may post.

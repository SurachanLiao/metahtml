But I do think I&#8217;ve gleaned some invaluable insights into how Pyongyang residents live, work and play.</p><p>I had been interested in socialism ever since studying the Russian Revolution at high school, while my sinologist father, Chinese mother and childhood love of Japanese anime had sparked a passion for Chinese and Japanese.</p><p>I went on to study in China and lived on the same dormitory floor as the North Korean contingent. I became intrigued by their lapel pins depicting their national leaders and the North Korean flag stickers on their doors (no other students did this).</p><p>The interactions I had with these students really piqued my curiosity &#8211; they were completely at odds with the stereotypical view of a &#8220;brainwashed&#8221; people. </p><p>I soon began learning all I could about everyday life in the country, from its architecture and fashion to how its people viewed the world. Eventually, I managed to arrange a trip to Pyongyang.</p><p>I became particularly close to two Koreans who worked for a local tour company, and in partnership with them founded my own tour operator specialising in educational tourism to North Korea, Tongil Tours, through which I began to make regular trips to the country leading groups of western tourists.</p><p>After finishing my degree in Asian studies, I decided to take my interest in North Korea to postgraduate level. Pyongyang seemed a natural option, and with my North Korean friends&#8217; help, I began my master&#8217;s in contemporary North Korean literature in April 2018.</p><p>As a long-term foreign resident on a student visa, I have nearly unprecedented access to Pyongyang. I&#8217;m free to wander around the city, without anyone accompanying me. Interaction with locals can be limited at times, but I can shop and dine almost anywhere I want.</p><p>North Korea today is in transition. Despite heavy sanctions, Pyongyang has a small but growing consumer class, due in part to government policies to liberalise sections of the economy.</p><p>Dining out is an important manifestation of this new spending power. Among restaurants I have visited along with other foreign students is a trendy conveyor belt hot pot restaurant, where diners can choose from more than 50 ingredients &#8211; from shiitake mushrooms to macaroni &#8211; for their broth.</p><p>This restaurant is always packed at weekend lunchtimes, with the clientele sporting fashions that wouldn&#8217;t look out of place in Shanghai or Seoul. We&#8217;ve even spotted young people who&#8217;ve clearly had plastic surgery.</p><p>Naturally, Pyongyang has a wide variety of excellent Korean food on offer, from bulgogi to bibimpap. But we&#8217;ve also found <a href="https://tongiltours.com/kaiten-sushi-naegohyang-adidas-store" class="u-underline">conveyor belt sushi</a> and some <a href="https://tongiltours.com/chusok-yonggwang-restaurant-chollima-street" class="u-underline">pretty authentic Chinese restaurants</a>.</p><p>There&#8217;s a <a href="https://tongiltours.com/spring-saturday" class="u-underline">fast food joint</a> whose waitresses told me their food was &#8220;just like KFC&#8221;, and another that serves <a href="https://tongiltours.com/united-states-summit" class="u-underline">hamburgers and French fries</a>. The burger was pretty close to McDonald&#8217;s, only with raw and not pickled cucumber slices.</p><p>When it comes to shopping, imported goods include everything from Haribo gummy bears and New Zealand beef to Adidas sportswear and Dove bodywash.</p><p>Locally manufactured products are improving in quality &#8211; a few years ago all the paper was grey and coarse, but now the shops are full of <a href="https://tongiltours.com/mindulle-notebooks" class="u-underline">notebooks with bleached white paper</a> (although the rockets and Pyongyang monuments on the covers still mark them out as North Korean).</p><p>The government has been encouraging greater use of technology, and while locals are still unable to access the internet, their own internal network is becoming more developed.</p><p>The Pyongyang Metro is always full of &#8220;phone zombies&#8221; staring intently at games, movies or the news. Pretty much the only person I&#8217;ve met who doesn&#8217;t have a smartphone is my 73-year-old literary theory teacher, who has stuck with her 2000s Nokia-style device.</p><p>But perhaps the most insightful experiences I&#8217;ve had have been talking with various locals.</p><p>A taxi driver, for example, told me he knew Australia was a popular tourist destination. He knew we had backed the &#8220;US imperialists&#8221; in the Korean war, which his grandfather had fought in, but said he hoped I would be the first of many foreigners to live in his home town.</p><p>In the dormitory, I shared a room for four months with a local student majoring in English. In most ways, he wasn&#8217;t too different from a typical bloke in his early 20s. An avid football fan, he loved Neymar and Messi, whom he followed alongside the April 25 Sports Club, a local Pyongyang team. He enjoyed the odd drink (and a more regular cigarette).</p><p>He had a particularly keen interest in international politics, and dreamed of one day &#8220;working in the foreign ministry of a unified Korea&#8221;.</p><p>But unlike your typical student, my roommate&#8217;s proudest moment from his uni days was when he represented the university in a <a href="https://tongiltours.com/70th-anniversary-dprk-national-day" class="u-underline">military parade watched by Kim Jong-un</a>.</p><p>He told me of the gruelling training needed to get his goose-stepping up to standard, but also of the bonds he forged with his fellow marchers and the sense of pride and achievement he felt afterwards. He always kept a photo from that day on his desk.</p><p>He once asked me whether Australia was a one-party state. I was taken aback, but did my best to explain our multi-party system. He was particularly interested to hear that we have a communist party, but seemed slightly disappointed when I told him how small it is.</p><p>Now that he&#8217;s moved out of the dorm I&#8217;m unable to contact him again &#8211; foreigners&#8217; phone numbers are on a separate network and meeting locals without an express reason is generally frowned upon. Saying goodbye was emotional.</p><p>But if it&#8217;s any consolation, the fact that an Australian and a North Korean could happily share a room for four months does show that there&#8217;s a better way. We can get along.</p></article>

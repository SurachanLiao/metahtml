The bold measures taken to control the outbreak from closing borders to all international commercial flights to Janata curfew and work from home for all non-essential sectors all point towards this.</p> <p>PM also addressed why we need to do this referring to the growth curve of coronavirus in worst-hit countries. "In these countries, after the initial few days, a sudden explosion of the disease has occurred. In these countries, the number of people infected with coronavirus has increased very rapidly. The Government of India is keeping a close watch on this track record of the spread of coronavirus."</p> <p>That indicates the underlying emergency and the need to contain the spread of the coronavirus. Rightly so with the fast progression in the number of confirmed cases.</p> <p>With 200 reported confirmed cases as per the Indian Health Ministry website, it appears that India still has been largely untouched by the virus.</p> <p>The number of COVID-19 positive cases in India however have been doubling in 5-6 days.</p> Here is how India compares to the rest of the world on number of confirmed cases:<p>Source: Ourworldindata (up to March 19th) </p> <p><del>Source: Ourworldindata (up to March 19th)</del></p> <p>The global figures also show with appropriate containment and mitigation strategies countries like South Korea have been able to slow down the growth in number of confirmed cases. PM Modi indicated towards that in his speech too.</p> <p>Italy, which was reportedly slow in arresting the spread of coronavirus in initial days of the outbreak, saw the variety of confirmed instances go up from 322 to over 10,000 in two weeks.</p> India <ins>TrendsIndia</ins> <del>TrendsIndia</del> saw its first major jump in confirmed cases on March 3-4th when the numbers went up five-fold.

A 70-year-old diabetic patient from Punjab, with a travel history to Germany and Italy, succumbed to the virus.</p> <p>With this India's death rate due to COVID-19 is around 2, lower than the <a href="https://www.wuhanupdate.com/rates/reported-case-fatality-rates-0682066">reported case fatality rates</a> of 3.4% globally (WHO data). However, the fatality rates vary from country to country.</p> <del>The positives in the India story is the recovery rate that stands at 10%.</del> The positives in the India story is the recovery rate that stands at 10%. <p>However currently there is no data available on how many patients are serious or critical, requiring ICU or ventilatory support in India. But if we go by the world data only about 5%, roughly 7,000 are those in critical conditions.</p> <p>While serious questions have been raised on under-reported numbers and the lack of enough testing, Health Ministry's reiteration that "there is no question of community transmission as of now in India" provides some solace.</p> <p>High time the country takes the PM's message of be prepared, stay home and do your bit, seriously to help keep the numbers under control.</p> Catch other coronavirus related updates here

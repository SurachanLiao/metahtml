PM Modi's message was clear - COVID-19 pandemic can hit any country and the need is to contain the spread at this juncture. The bold measures taken to control the outbreak from closing borders to all international commercial flights to Janata curfew and work from home for all non-essential sectors all point towards this.

PM also addressed why we need to do this referring to the growth curve of coronavirus in worst-hit countries. "In these countries, after the initial few days, a sudden explosion of the disease has occurred. In these countries, the number of people infected with coronavirus has increased very rapidly. The Government of India is keeping a close watch on this track record of the spread of coronavirus."

That indicates the underlying emergency and the need to contain the spread of the coronavirus. Rightly so with the fast progression in the number of confirmed cases.

With 200 reported confirmed cases as per the Indian Health Ministry website, it appears that India still has been largely untouched by the virus.

The number of COVID-19 positive cases in India however have been doubling in 5-6 days.

The global figures also show with appropriate containment and mitigation strategies countries like South Korea have been able to slow down the growth in number of confirmed cases. PM Modi indicated towards that in his speech too.

Italy, which was reportedly slow in arresting the spread of coronavirus in initial days of the outbreak, saw the variety of confirmed instances go up from 322 to over 10,000 in two weeks.

India saw its first major jump in confirmed cases on March 3-4th when the numbers went up five-fold. From 5 confirmed cases to 27.The second surge wave in confirmed cases was between March 9th and 14th where the numbers almost doubled.

The last 6 days have been even critical, where we have seen the confirmed cases rise more than double. From 84 recorded on March 14th to 151 on March 18th the numbers almost doubled.

Latest data from Worldometer puts India's current figures at 197 confirmed cases (as of 6pm on March 19th).

State wise figures see wide variations.

Maharashtra has seen the fastest additions in number of confirmed cases in the last 6 days. Number of reported confirmed cases has gone up 3.5 times in the last 5 days, from 14 on 13th March to 49 on 19th March (as of 6pm). Just between yesterday and today the numbers have shot up by 20 percent.

COVID-19 has now affected at least 20 states and union territories in India. Fresh cases have been confirmed in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Chhattisgarh, Chandigarh and Gujarat.

And Delhi with 11 cases have been the states seeing a larger burden.

India on Thursday reported its fourth death due to COVID-19. A 70-year-old diabetic patient from Punjab, with a travel history to Germany and Italy, succumbed to the virus.

With this India's death rate due to COVID-19 is around 2, lower than the reported case fatality rates of 3.4% globally (WHO data). However, the fatality rates vary from country to country.

The positives in the India story is the recovery rate that stands at 10%.

However currently there is no data available on how many patients are serious or critical, requiring ICU or ventilatory support in India. But if we go by the world data only about 5%, roughly 7,000 are those in critical conditions.

While serious questions have been raised on under-reported numbers and the lack of enough testing, Health Ministry's reiteration that "there is no question of community transmission as of now in India" provides some solace.

High time the country takes the PM's message of be prepared, stay home and do your bit, seriously to help keep the numbers under control.

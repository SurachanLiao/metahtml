<p>
The sinking of the Sewol ferry was the defining event of Korea for this year, and this blog's readership reflected that.&#160;</p>

 
<p>
TK already has one new year's resolution: blog more often. I have been quite negligent with AAK! this year--especially in the second half of the year. There were great stories about Korea that gathered international attention, such as the Nut Gate, KC Royals Super Fan, etc., that TK could hardly catch up to. In 2015, TK will reduce other commitments and redouble his effort on AAK!</p>
 

<p>
The Korean wishes everyone a warm and happy end of the year. As always, thank you for reading this humble blog. See you next year.</p>

</h3>

 


<p>
Come one, come all, to this humble blog's annual holiday tradition:  the worst emails of the year 2014! Let's all gather around and wallow in the Interweb's swill of stupidity! Despite seeing the examples of dumb questions from <a href="http://askakorean.blogspot.com/2009/05/ask-korean-news-best-of-worst.html">2008</a>, <a href="http://askakorean.blogspot.com/2009/12/best-of-worst-2009.html">2009</a>, 2010 (in Parts <a href="http://askakorean.blogspot.com/2010/12/best-of-worst-2010-part-i-heartbreak.html">I</a>, <a href="http://askakorean.blogspot.com/2010/12/best-of-worst-2009-part-ii.html">II</a>, and <a href="http://askakorean.blogspot.com/2010/12/best-of-worst-2010-part-iii-worst-email.html">III</a>), <a href="http://askakorean.blogspot.com/2011/12/best-of-worst-2011.html">2011</a>,&#160;<a href="http://askakorean.blogspot.com/2012/12/best-of-worst-2012.html">2012</a>, and <a href="http://askakorean.blogspot.com/2013/12/best-of-worst-2013.html">2013,&#160;</a>people simply do not learn.</p>
 

<p>
As usual, these are all real emails that TK really received from real people for the past year. Below, among all the shitty emails that TK has received, he has selected the douche de la douche, the crap de la crap. Other than redacting personal information, not a single thing about the email is changed or modified in any way. TK's comments and thoughts on the emails are <span>highlighted in blue</span>.</p>

re: &#160;I have a question</p>
 
<p>
Hi The Korean! My name is Emily and I am an ethnically Japanese, Chinese, Hawaiian, Polish, Spanish American that looks really Asian. I also speak fluent English and Japanese. I am proficient in Korean and French. So, if I ever lived in Korea, how would I be treated?</p>
 
<p>
<span>Like a person. Moron.</span></p>
 
<p>
re: &#160;Korean Men and Chinese Women</p>
 
<p>
Hey Korean Person,</p>
 
<p>
I have a question. I am a Chinese woman in my late &#8220;tens&#8221; (18) and I have never been attracted to Korean guys until recently. Truth is, I actually had a Korean boyfriend before and the experience led me to believe Korean guys frankly, look down on Chinese girls. I read your blog post about what Koreans think of Chinese and as thorough as your post was, I don&#8217;t think it answers my questions. It was more of a historical and general viewpoint.</p>
 
<p>
So my question is, what do Korean men think of Chinese women? I know Korean men are men before they are Korean but I am sure most Korean men would never date anyone of African heritage, even if the Kenyan woman happens to have 32D breasts with an amazing smelling vagina. So, Korean men like almost all race have a certain racial preference.</p>
 
<p>
I can pass for either Chinese or Korean in the Winter and Filipino or half Spanish in the Summer so most people can&#8217;t really guess my race. I am just afraid that Korean guys might be turned off when they find out I am Chinese. From my experience, I have no problems with Korean Americans but I am talking about Korean Korean men. Koreans born in Korea who had spent the first half of their life in Korea.</p>
 
<p>
Thanks a lot! :)</p>
 
<p>
<span>After many years of bad emails, TK developed a perverse appreciation for bad emails. This type is one of his favorites: an email that starts ok enough, then slowly degenerates into full crazy over several paragraphs.</span></p>

<p>
Briefly about Seo Taiji:&#160; Easily one of the top three most significant K-pop artist in history. Everything about the modern day K-pop is traceable to his brilliant mind.</p>
 
<p>
About This Song:&#160; 90s Icon is from Seo Taiji's 2014 album, Quiet Night.&#160;</p>
 
<p>
Translation Note:&#160; As is typical with Korean lyrics, many sentences lack a subject, leaving poetic ambiguity as to the precise identity of the person who thinks and feels. Seo Taiji, in particular, is a master of such lyrical construction.</p>

<a href="https://askakorean.blogspot.com/2014/12/is-that-salt-in-your-teeth.html">Is That Salt in Your Teeth?</a>
</h3>

 


 
<p>
Dear Korean,</p><p>
 
 My friend recently came back to New York after living in Korea for a year. She now swears by bamboo salt toothpaste. She says that bamboo salt is commonly used in Korean medicine and is much healthier that anything available in the US. What exactly is bamboo salt?&#160;</p>
<p>
 
 Kristin K.</p>
 
 
<p>
Short answer first: bamboo salt, called juk-yeom [&#51453;&#50684;] in Korea, is a type of basked salt. One can manufacture bamboo salt by packing salt into a bamboo tube, and baking the tube in an oven multiple times.&#160;</p>
 
<p align="center">
<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container"><tbody>
 
<tr><td class="tr-caption">Bamboo salt baking 
(<a href="http://pds.dreamdrug.com/news_image/200403/39139_5.jpg">source</a>)</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</p>
 
<p>
So that is the salt part. But how do we go from salt to toothpaste?</p>
 
<p>
Before toothpaste became common in Korea, Koreans used to brush teeth with either salt or salt water. This worked just fine, as salt is a natural disinfectant. (In fact, brushing with salt <a href="http://www.readersdigest.ca/health/healthy-living/10-ways-keep-your-teeth-clean">may promote gum health</a>.) When TK was younger, public baths in Korea would commonly place a large bowl salt, as older folks preferred using salt to brush their teeth.</p>
 
<p>
Seizing upon this opportunity, Korea's toothpaste makers came up with various types of toothpaste based on bamboo salt. Although Koreans were certainly transitioning to toothpastes, the idea of brushing teeth with salt was still in people's mind. And not just any salt--salt baked nine times in a bamboo tube! Sure it had to be healthier, right?</p> 
 
<p align="center">
<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container"><tbody>
 
<tr><td class="tr-caption">Advertisement for a bamboo salt toothpaste (<a href="http://www.dohae.com/files/image/board/12300">source</a>)</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
 
</p> 
<p>
Makers of the bamboo salt toothpaste love claiming that their product prevents gum disease, and is a healthier alternative to other toothpaste. But much to TKParents' dismay, TK is not a dentist, so he is in no position to say if the bamboo salt toothpaste is actually healthier. He did use this type of product for about a decade, with no result that was significantly more positive or more negative than the one you may expect from an ordinary toothpaste, so there is that.</p><p>

<p>
Happy Thanksgiving to everyone! This year, TK is thankful for his first roasted turkey, a forward progress in his day job and his hobbies, renewed sense of faith, another year of wonderful marriage and another year of loyal readers for the AAK!</p>

</h3>

 

<p class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-5351756826401906368">
[<a href="http://sinonk.com/2014/11/17/under-the-juniper-tree-the-2012-assassination-attempt-on-kim-jong-un/">Cross-posted on Sino-NK</a>]</p><p>
<p>
Mr. Joo Seong-ha deserves to be a personal UNESCO heritage site. The journalist has the most incredible life story: he was a professor at Kim Il-Sung University in North Korea, Then, realizing the tyranny of the North Korean regime, he escaped to China--and was captured, sent back to North Korea and survived the prison camp. On his second try, he succeeded in escaping North Korea for good and seeking asylum in South Korea. Now, as a reporter for one of the most prominent newspapers in South Korea, Joo utilizes his elite North Korea connection to give reports on the country like no one else can. TK has long been a fan of Mr. Joo: a complete list of Joo's articles, translated by TK, <a href="http://askakorean.blogspot.com/2008/02/translated-articles-by-joo-seong-ha.html">is available here</a>.</p>
 
<p>
Recently, Joo broke a story that was never known outside of a handful of North Korean elites: <a href="http://blog.donga.com/nambukstory/archives/92460">two years ago, there was an attempt at Kim Jong-un's life</a>. Below is the story.</p>
 
<p>
* &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; * &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;*</p>
 
<p>
Two years ago, on November 3, 2012, there was an assassination attempt on Kim Jong-un in Pyongyang. That day, Kim was scheduled to visit Munsu Street in Pyongyang. There, he was set to go to Ryugyeongwon, a health club; People&#8217;s Outdoor Skating Rink; and a rollerskating rink. These facilities were only several tens of meters away from one another, with a street in between them.</p>
 
<p>
On the morning of that day, a loaded machine gun was discovered cleverly hidden under a low-growing juniper tree near Ryugyeongwon. The gun was immediately reported to the Ministry of State Security. It was clearly an attempt on Kim Jong-un&#8217;s life. The assassins were apparently aiming for Kim Jong-un&#8217;s visit to the area. Even so, Kim Jong-un summoned enough courage to visit as scheduled.</p>
 
<p>
The North Korean regime never found who was responsible. But the predominant speculation is that a high-ranking person must have been behind it. Kim Jong-un&#8217;s line of movement is top secret, with few knowing where he is planned to be. Also, it had to be someone who could smuggle a machine gun in from abroad, as firearms are strictly controlled in North Korea.</p><p>

Shin Hae-cheol was perhaps the freest talker in all of K-pop history. His fame was built on his ability to speak critically and incisively, as much as it was built on his innovative music. Here is a selection of his quotes that showed the manner of Shin Hae-cheol's speech.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
"The world will self-destruct if young people were never negative or cynical. The world needs the younger generation to look down on the older generation."</p>
 
</li>
<li>"It's easy to think that achieving your dreams is the be-all, end-all. But I hope everyone remembers that there are things that you must not lose in the course of achieving your dreams, that the dreams do not necessarily lead to happiness. God does not care what dream you achieve; but he does enormously care whether you are happy." 
 
</li>
<li>"I think talking about the society or the politics is all part of music. When you start thinking that politics and society have nothing to do with music, that's when music starts getting strange." 
 
</li>
<li>"Some of the music by Rain and DBSK received a rating that says it is harmful for the youth. But right now, what's happening at the National Assembly is hardly instructive for the youth. The National Assembly should be designated as a harmful location for the youth; it should be rated R, and should not be shown on television, including the news, to protect the children." 
 
</li>
<li>(To his wife) "Before I was married, I had such strong suicidal tendencies that I received therapy for it. Since we had children, I was naturally cured because I was so happy. Even in the next life, I want to be your husband. In the next life, let me be your son, your mother, your brother, your dog--anything to keep us tied." 
 
</li>
<li>"We should not take revenge. We may not be able to forgive. In between those two, we can reconcile." 
 
</li>
<li>"Not being embarrassed that you're worried, taking anxiety as a natural part of life--that, I think, is the first step toward resolving that anxiety. It's not as if your life gets truly better if that anxiety goes away. &#160;. . . &#160;But the worst thing is to lie to yourself, that you're not worried." 
 
</li>
<li>"There is a lot of criticism toward the young generation, about how they are not willing to work hard. But there is a difference between working in a situation in which one can dream, and working in a situation in which one cannot see anything. Labor without future is not the answer. The young people are standing in darkness; they cannot tell if a cliff is just a foot away. It's not the case that they do not move because they are too tired; they cannot move because they cannot see ahead." 
</li>

<a href="https://askakorean.blogspot.com/2014/11/shin-hae-cheol-k-pop-icon.html">Shin Hae-cheol, the K-Pop Icon</a>
</h3>

 

<p>
<p>
Fate can be cruelly ironic. Only a few days after TK covered him in this space, with hopes to cover him more going forward, Shin Hae-cheol passed away from cardiac arrest on October 27, 2014. He was only 46 years old.</p>
 
<p>
As TK explained previously, Shin is K-pop&#8217;s greatest rock icon of the 1990s. Through his outspoken activism and direct communication with his loyal listeners, his influence extended well into the 2000s, and well beyond the consumers of pop culture. No one in the history of K-pop left a footprint quite like Shin&#8217;s. Though his life was tragically cut short, it deserves to be known to a wider audience who appreciates K-pop, and wishes to understand where it came from, where it has been.</p> 
<p>
* &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;* &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;*</p>
</p><p>
<p>
K-pop nearly died in 1975. The Park Chung-hee dictatorship saw pop culture, especially rock music, as a threat to public order and ultimately its regime. When Shin Jung-hyeon [&#49888;&#51473;&#54788;], the greatest rocker of the time, refused to write a song praising the dictatorship, the government banned his music and arrested him on trumped-up drug charges. Numerous K-pop artists met the same fate. </p>
 
<p>
Korean pop music, which stood near the forefront of global pop music trends in the 1970s, took a massive step back. Only the inoffensive, melodramatic soft rock could survive for the next decade, as the next dictator Chun Doo-hwan--whose rule ended in 1987--was hardly a fan of rock music either.</p>
 
<p>
Perhaps it was not a coincidence that an upstart band, calling themselves the Infinite Track [&#47924;&#54620;&#44452;&#46020;], came onto the stage as the last contestant of the MBC College Pop Music Festival in 1988, a year after Chun Doo-hwan dictatorship was toppled. The College Festival, which began in 1977, became the new path to stardom after the dictatorship decimated the existing pop music scene. But for a long time, the college bands that performed on the Festival mimicked the larger trend. Their music was soft and meek, tear-jerking without being daring.</p>
 
<p>
That is, until the Infinite Track took the stage. The Infinite Track seemed to be an unlikely band to challenge the status quo--its members were the classic definition of elites, as they were students of Seoul National, Yonsei and Sogang. When the baby-faced lead singer and guitarist Shin Hae-cheol gave the pre-performance interview, few expected what was coming next.</p>
</p><p>
<p>
Then the song began, with blaring fanfare. A rush of synthesizer followed. The drums crashed harder than they did all night. The lights of the freshly constructed Olympic stadium--which just finished serving its purpose in the Seoul Olympics--blinkered wildly to the beat. The song, called To You [&#44536;&#45824;&#50640;&#44172;], instantly owned the crowd. (It would continue to own the crowd for the next thirty years, as it is one of the favorite songs for Korea&#8217;s cheering sports fans today.) When the Infinite Track finished performing, there was no doubt about who won the 1988 College Pop Music Festival.</p>

<p>
Dear Korean,</p>
</p><p>
<p>
Recently, Seo Taiji released a song called Sogyeokdong. From the music video and my limited Korean skills, I gathered that Sogyeodong must be a historical place. What exactly transpired there and what is the significance of the setting for Seo Taiji's music video?&#160;</p>
</p><p>
<p>
Curious person with poor Korean skills :(</p>
</p><p>
 
<p>
Here is a simple rule for AAK!: &#160;if you ask something about the new Seo Taiji song, your question will be published. First, let's listen to the music in question.</p>
</p><p>
<p>
&#49548;&#44201;&#46041;</p><p>
Sogyeokdong</p><p>
&#45208; &#44536;&#45824;&#50752; &#46168;&#51060; &#44151;&#45912; &#44536; &#51329;&#51008; &#44264;&#47785;&#44228;&#45800;&#51012; &#54848;&#47196; &#44152;&#50612;&#50836;</p><p>
I walk alone, on that narrow alley stairs that the two of us used to walk</p><p>
&#44536; &#50715;&#45216;&#51032; &#51673;&#51008; &#54693;&#44592;&#44032; &#45236; &#50694;&#51012; &#49828;&#52824;&#51424;</p><p>
The thick scent of the past sweeps by me</p><p>
&#45328; &#46496;&#45208;&#45716; &#45216; &#49324;&#49892; &#45212;...</p><p>
On the way I left, actually I...</p><p>
&#46321; &#48145; &#52376;&#47560; &#44256;&#46300;&#47492;&#44284; &#52280;&#49352;&#49548;&#47532; &#50696;&#49244; &#51060; &#47560;&#51012;&#50640; &#49332; &#44144;&#50696;&#50836;</p><p>
I will live in this pretty village, with icicles on the roof and sparrows chirping</p><p>
&#49548;&#44201;&#46041;&#51012; &#44592;&#50613;&#54616;&#45208;&#50836; &#51648;&#44552;&#46020; &#44536;&#45824;&#47196; &#51080;&#51424;</p><p>
Do you remember Sogyeokdong? It still remains the same</p><p>
&#50500;&#51452; &#45734;&#51008; &#48164; &#54616;&#50560; &#45576;&#51060; &#50772;&#50632;&#51424;</p><p>
On a very late night, the white snow fell</p><p>
&#49548;&#48373;&#51060; &#49939;&#51060;&#45768; &#45236; &#47576;&#46020; &#49444;&#47132;&#51424;</p><p>
As they piled on, my heart stirred too</p><p>
&#45208;&#45716; &#44536;&#45216; &#48164; &#45800; &#54620;&#49704;&#46020; &#47803; &#51108;&#51424;</p><p>
I could not sleep that night, not even a wink</p><p>
&#51104;&#46308;&#47732; &#50504;&#46076;&#50836; &#45576;&#51012; &#46888;&#47732; &#49324;&#46972;&#51648;&#51424;</p><p>
Don't fall asleep; it all disappears when we open our eyes*</p><p>
&#50612;&#45712; &#45216; &#44049;&#51088;&#44592; &#44536; &#47566;&#45912; &#45255;&#47932;&#51060; &#47568;&#46972;&#44052;&#51424;</p><p>
The stream that used to be so big suddenly dried up</p><p>
&#45236; &#50612;&#47536; &#47560;&#51020;&#46020; &#44536; &#49884;&#45255;&#47932;&#52376;&#47100; &#44536;&#47111;&#44172; &#47568;&#46992;&#44192;&#51424;</p><p>
My young heart, like that stream, must have dried up too</p><p>
&#45320;&#51032; &#47784;&#46304; &#44152; &#46160; &#45576;&#50640; &#45812;&#44256; &#51080;&#50632;&#51424;</p><p>
In my two eyes, I carried everything about you</p><p>
&#49548;&#49548;&#54620; &#54616;&#47336;&#44032; &#45321;&#45321;&#54664;&#45912; &#45216;</p><p>
The days when the small days were more than enough</p><p>
&#44536;&#47084;&#45912; &#50612;&#45712; &#45216; &#49464;&#49345;&#51060; &#46244;&#51665;&#54804;&#51424;</p><p>
Then one day, the world turned upside down</p><p>
&#45796;&#46308; &#44845; &#51105;&#50500;&#50836; &#51104;&#44624; &#49324;&#51060;&#50640; &#49324;&#46972;&#51648;&#51424;</p><p>
Everyone hold on tight; it all disappears in a moment</p><p>
&#51082;&#44256; &#49910;&#51652; &#50506;&#50500;&#50836; &#54616;&#51648;&#47564; &#45208;&#50640;&#44176;</p><p>
I do not want to forget; but to me</p><p>
&#49324;&#51652; &#54620; &#51109;&#46020; &#45224;&#50500;&#51080;&#51648;&#44032; &#50506;&#51424;</p><p>
Not even a single photo remained</p><p>
&#44536;&#51200; &#46104;&#45516;&#47732;&#49436; &#46104;&#45516;&#47732;&#49436; &#45208; &#44536;&#51200; &#50528;&#47484; &#50424; &#49104;&#51060;&#51424;</p><p>
I can simply try, repeating to myself, repeating to myself</p><p>
&#50500;&#51452; &#45734;&#51008; &#48164; &#54616;&#50560; &#45576;&#51060; &#50772;&#50632;&#51424;</p><p>

</p><p>
<p>
*Translation note: &#160;Although TK assigned "it all" and "we" as subjects in this sentence, in the original Korean lyrics it is unclear who is opening his/her eyes, and exactly what is disappearing. Because Korean language does not require a subject in a sentence, this type of poetic ambiguity is common.</p>
 
<p>
* &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; * &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; *</p>
 
<p>
As the questioner gleaned, Sogyeokdong [&#49548;&#44201;&#46041;, pronounced "soh-kyok-dong"] is an actual place in Seoul. Located within Jongno-gu [&#51333;&#47196;&#44396;], it is in the heart of the old Seoul, abutting the Gyeongbokgung [&#44221;&#48373;&#44417;] palace on the east side. Together with Samcheong-dong [&#49340;&#52397;&#46041;], Gahoe-dong [&#44032;&#54924;&#46041;], Jae-dong [&#51116;&#46041;], Gye-dong [&#44228;&#46041;], etc., it is a part of the neighborhood called Bukchon [&#48513;&#52492;]. Because of its quaint narrow alleyways and well-preserved traditional Korean houses, Bukchon today is a popular tourist destination.&#160;</p>
 
<p>
Due to its central location, Sogyeokdong has been at the forefront of Korea's turbulent modern history. However, Seo Taiji did not choose to sing about Sogyeokdong simply for the sake of history. He actually grew up in the neighborhood, having attended the nearby Jaedong Elementary School (which is Korea's oldest elementary school, established in 1895.) <a href="http://star.ohmynews.com/NWS_Web/OhmyStar/at_pg.aspx?CNTN_CD=A0002045411">In an interview, Seo said that he simply wanted to sing about his childhood</a>, but doing so would have been impossible without touching upon the history he had seen. The result, in TK's estimation, is a more elegant expression of the sinister sense of fear and loss that permeated the experience of Korean children at the time.</p>
 
<p>
Seo Taiji was born in 1972, which means he experienced his Sogyeokdong childhood in the early to mid-1980s. What was going on in Korea in the 1980s?</p>

<a href="https://askakorean.blogspot.com/2014/10/koreas-labor-productivity-and-how-to.html">Korea's Labor Productivity, and How to Interpret Data About Korea</a>
</h3>

 


<p>
An article&#160;<a href="http://www.businesskorea.co.kr/article/3698/insider-perspective-seven-reasons-why-korea-has-worst-productivity-oecd">titled Seven Reasons Why Korea Has the Worst Productivity in the OECD</a>, from March 2014, has been recently making rounds in TK's Facebook feed again. It was a dumb article at the time of the publication, and it remains dumb today. Regardless, the article continues to receive approving reactions--which merits pointing out exactly what is dumb about this article.</p>
<p>
First, the article itself. The author Michael Kocken, writing for Business Korea magazine, begins with this:</p><p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Korea was recently named the worst place for worker productivity in the OECD, which was featured in a recent article by this magazine. This news is not surprising for any professional previously or currently working in Korea, as the notorious overtime hours coupled with years of low growth have been a widely-discussed issue over the past few years.</blockquote>
Then the article makes the familiar, banal complaints about Korea's corporate culture: &#160;Korea's corporate structure is too rigid and hierarchical; there is no honest and direct communication; worker distraction from the Internet and smartphones; hungover workers, valuing form over substance, new workers who are poorly equipped, and the need to put in useless "face time."</p>
<p>
<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container"><tbody>
 
<tr><td class="tr-caption">Typical office scene in Korea. Is this the home of low productivity? 
(<a href="http://www.finesfc.com/150">source</a>)</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</p><p>
What's dumb about this article?</p><p>
 
First, the article's starting premise is flatly untrue.&#160;Korea's labor productivity was not the worst in the OECD.&#160;<a href="http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=101&amp;oid=021&amp;aid=0002189552">Korea's labor productivity per worker in 2012 (which was the most recent data available as of the article's writing) was at 23rd place among the 34 OECD member states</a>. Sure, 23 out of 34 is still in the lower range. But it is a far cry from being at the worst place.</p><p>
But let's be generous and make an ample allowance between the bottom third and the rock bottom. After all, it would be good for Korea to aspire to be on the above-average side of the OECD. However, even this allowance cannot save this article. The main problem with the article is that&#160;the author does not seem to understand what "labor productivity" means. This is apparent from the second sentence of the article's opening paragraph, which refers to Korea's long overtime hours. Even setting aside the factual inaccuracy that TK noted earlier, this is a strange statement.</p><p>
Why is it strange? Because OECD measures labor productivity by, essentially, dividing "output" by number of hours worked. (The precise methodology is somewhat more complicated, especially on how one defines "output." If you are interested in the actual methodology, <a href="http://www.oecd.org/std/productivity-stats/2352458.pdf">you can find it here</a>.) This necessarily means that the longer one works, the lower the labor productivity, because if you increase the denominator while holding the numerator at the same level, the result is always a smaller number. In other words, Korea's labor productivity is low because of long overtime hours, not despite the overtime, as Kocken appears to imply.</p><p>
This leads us to the most important lesson: &#160;what OECD means by "labor productivity" is not what an ordinary person would think. When OECD states Korea has low labor productivity, the word "productivity" is not being used in the same manner in which regular people talk about being "productive at work." But the latter is exactly how the author Michael Kocken uses the term "productivity." Then the article simply runs with the incorrect understanding of the term, and make the trite, stereotypical complaints about Korea's corporate culture.</p><p>

<p>
Dear Korean,</p><p>
Since the centennial anniversary of the First World War (1914-2014) is upon us, it would be worthwhile to ask: (1) How did the First World War affect Korea? (2) Is the "War to End All Wars" studied in any detail by Korean students today?</p><p>
Trenchman</p>
</p><p>
 
<p>
For the centennial anniversary of World War I, TK recommends everyone to visit Kansas City, Missouri, a deeply underrated city in his opinion. There, after having some of the world's finest barbecue, visit <a href="https://theworldwar.org/">the National World War I Museum</a>, which houses a relatively small but all-around-awesome collection related to the Great War. Fans of history and military equipment can easily spend an entire day there. TK had a wonderful time visiting.</p>

</tbody></table>
 
<p>
But enough gratuitous plugging. How did the First World War affect Korea? Short answer: &#160;it didn't. Speaking of World War I is a bit like speaking of the World Series--we all know what the terms are trying to say, but they do not really mean what they say. The supposed "World" War barely grazed East Asia. Sure, Australia and New Zealand engaged in some land battles in the then-German Samoa, and the Japanese laid siege to the German base in Tsingtao, China. (Fortunately, the Germans stuck around just long enough to teach the locals how to make proper beer.) But in East Asia, World War I was never an all-out war that affected the daily lives of most people. This was true in Korea as well.</p>
 
<p>
The aftermath of World War I, however, did play a significant role in Korea. On January 8,1918, toward the end of the war, President Woodrow Wilson gave the famous Fourteen Points speech, in which he advocated for (among other things) national self-determination, i.e. the right of the colonized people to free themselves from imperialism and form their own national government.&#160;</p>

<p>
 
 In 15 words or less:&#160; The most significant Korean rock musician of the 1990s.</p>
 
<p>
Maybe he should should be ranked higher because...&#160; Both in terms of music and in terms of social participation, how many K-pop artists tried more different things than Shin did?</p>
 
<p>
Maybe he should be ranked lower because...&#160; How much direct influence did Shin have? How much in the current K-pop scene can be definitively traced back to Shin Hae-cheol, like the way in which one can definitively trace Korean hip hop back to Drunken Tiger?</p>
 
<p>
Why is this artist important?</p>
<p>
As we climb higher into the rarefied heights of Korean pop music history, a concise statement of an artist's importance is approaching ever closer to impossible. One could easily write a book about Shin Hae-cheol's career; unfortunately, we can only spare a few paragraphs here.</p><p>
From the beginning, Shin Hae-cheol's musical career portended a daring, experimental musical vision. Shin debuted with his band&#160;<span>Muhan'gwedo ("Infinite Track")</span><span>&#160;on the Campus Song Festival, the scene-defining audition show at the time. The crackdown from Korea's dictatorship (which ended only a year before Shin Hae-cheol's debut) has neutered K-pop, making the saccharine and brain-dead soft rock (locally referred to as "ballads") the mainstream genre. But&#160;</span><span>Muhan'gwedo</span><span>&#160;would have none of it. Reversing the conventional pop progression that gradually built up to a climax, To You opens with a dramatic, synthesizer-induced flair and rushes full speed toward the finish line.</span></p><p>
 

<p>
Shin Hae-cheol then debuted as a solo artist, engaging in a brief (and embarrassing-in-hindsight) stint of idol pop at the insistence of his record company. Then Shin finally found his musical homeland by forming N.Ex.T. (pronounced "next",) the most significant Korean rock band of the 1990s. Looking at the current K-pop scene in which idol pop has overrun the market, it is difficult to believe that a rock band like N.Ex.T. used to top the K-pop charts. But it is true. Led by Shin Hae-cheol, N.Ex.T stood firm on the foundation of progressive rock yet struck in all directions: heavy metal, thrash rock, electronica and Korean traditional music. Shin also put project albums as an individual (taking on a separate stage name of "Crom",) trying ever more daring sound and demanding the audience to simply get used to it.</p><p>
But Shin Hae-cheol's musical achievement is only half of his story, as Shin is arguably one of the most socially active pop musician in K-pop history. Perhaps betraying his elite education (Shin attended Sogang University, one of Korea's top five colleges,) Shin maintained a sharp tongue that relentlessly criticized the Korean society's irrationality and hypocrisy as a proper rocker should. Shin Hae-cheol led the charge in the movement to repeal the Korean law that prohibited two people with the same last name from getting married. Shin was also the leader of the now-infamous concert in 2002, in which Psy (of the Gangnam Style fame) performed an anti-American rap number, to express his anger at the death of two young Korean girls who were run over and killed by an USFK armored car.</p><p>
The best pop artists do not simply influence the artists who come after them; they change the society around them. By that measure, Shin Hae-cheol is about as influential as any in K-pop history.</p>

</p>
 
<p>
Interesting trivia:<span><span>&#160; Shin Hae-cheol is often mistaken as being related to the legendary Shin Jung-hyeon [&#49888;&#51473;&#54788;], as the name of Shin Jung-hyeon's oldest son is <a href="http://askakorean.blogspot.com/2011/04/50-most-influential-k-pop-artists-30.html">Shin Dae-cheol, leader of the influential heavy metal band Sinawi</a>. Shin Hae-cheol, however, bears no relation to Shin Jung-hyeon. Shin Hae-cheol is, however, a blood relative to a different K-pop legend: Shin is the second cousin of Seo Taiji. Reportedly, the two are close, often seen together fishing or skiing.</span></span></p><p>

</h3>

 

<p class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-6243525627723546920">
Dear Korean,</p><p>
 
<p>
I am living in the southern part of South Korea. One of the things I love about Korea is the street vendors selling food. Do these street vendors get a license or do they just set up shop? Also the 'shops' tend to close in the summer. For instance, I love &#48533;&#50612;&#48757;, but they only sell during the winter. Why? Meanwhile in Seoul the street meat people are out all year long, usually at night. Why do they wait to set up at night? Why isn't street meat seasonal?</p>
 
<p>
Debbie</p>
</p><p>
<span>Long before the American hipsters turned the food truck into a fad, Asians have figured out the romance associated with eating on a mobile platform.</span></p><p>
 
<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container"><tbody>
 
<tr><td class="tr-caption">Typical street cart food setup in Korea. 
(<a href="http://cfile2.uf.tistory.com/image/21209335520B217E019C6A">source</a>)</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>
But behind the delicious, delicious hunger-inducing facade, the legality and economics of street vendors in Korea are pretty complex. Conclusion first: technically, one must obtain a license--which comes with regular health inspections--to open up a street cart. But it is fair to say that the law is observed only in select parts of Korean cities. Street carts in areas with huge foot traffic, and those that sell alcohol tend to invite more scrutiny, because of the various potential public hazard (mass-scale food poisoning, drunken brawls) they pose. In areas with regulation, the street cart owners often form an association to conduct their businesses in an orderly manner. There is even a secondary market in which the license-holders buy and sell the government licenses.</p><p>
Outside of those areas, however, anything goes. This is directly related to the character of street vending as a business. Street vending has very low entry barrier. At the lowest possible end, one only needs a floor mat and some home-made gimbab [&#44608;&#48165;] to be a street vendor. Even a more sophisticated street food vendor rarely requires more than a truck carrying a makeshift kitchen which, in the grand scheme of business, is not a huge capital investment. In fact, there are many businesses that rent out the street-vending equipment, and provide the mass-produced, half-cooked food that the street vendors only have to heat up and serve. (Oh come on, don't act all surprised.) This serves to further lower the entry barrier into the street-vending business by lowering the cost, and by eliminating the need to learn whatever technical expertise necessary to cook up the food.</p><p>
Because the entry barrier is low, street vending is an attractive option for numerous Koreans, many of whom are economically down-and-out. This makes the government reluctant to crack down on them very strongly. The local government will act if a street vendor creates any issue that causes complaints from the residents. But most vendors are wise enough to fly under the radar, and the locals are generally happy to pick up some &#48533;&#50612;&#48757;--a fish-shaped pastry with sweet red bean filling--on the way home from work. (In fact, the people who file the most complaints against street vendors are other street vendors, who frequently use government regulation as another weapon in turf war.)</p><p>
Why are some types of street food seasonal, and others available year-around? Much of it has to do with the fluctuating demand. The demand for chicken on a stick, for example, remains the same year-around. But certain types of street food--like &#48533;&#50612;&#48757;, roasted chestnuts, roasted sweet potatoes--are strongly associated with autumn and winter. Because there is more demand for such food during a limited time frame, many street vendors jump into selling these cold-weather snacks to make a quick profit, and exit the business when the weather warms up.</p><p>
A world with little to no regulation, in which entrepreneurs freely enter and exit to precisely meet the dynamic demand of the market? Maybe Korean street cart market is the dream of the laissez-faire capitalist.</p><p>

Dear Korean,</p><p>
<p>
I am Chinese American, immigrated at 4 years old.  I identify very much as an American and while I want China to do well in competition, I will generally root for the USA over China head to head. A Korean American friend of mine <a href="http://www.kamerican.com/GNC/new/secondary_contents.php?article_no=13&amp;no=1210">shared this article</a>, which I thought was very interesting. It advocates that Korean immigrants, as immigrants and people assimilating into American culture, have an obligation to not root against their new home country. What do you think?</p>
 
<p>
John L.</p>

<p>
Given the recent duel between Team Seoul and Team Chicago in the Little League Word Series, TK figured this would be a good topic to address. As immigrants, where should our sports loyalty lie?</p><p>
<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container"><tbody>
 
<tr><td class="tr-caption">Give it up for the good-lookin' World Champions. 
(<a href="http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/140824203303-05-little-league-horizontal-gallery.jpg">source</a>)</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
The article that John L. shared outlines a common perspective. An excerpt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
When we as Korean Americans don Korea shirts and wave Korean flags during Korea-USA games, we are not choosing a team, we are choosing a nation. We are very deliberately and purposely choosing to support a foreign nation against the one we call our home and protector. It&#8217;s true that issues of identity are more complex &#8211; many of us feel just as much at home in Seoul as we do in San Diego or Daegu as in Dallas, but there are times when we cannot conveniently declare that we are &#8220;citizens of the world&#8221;, or &#8220;both Korean and American.&#8221; There are hard choices to be made.</p><p>
It is ironic and inconsistent for us to complain of being seen as &#8220;perpetual foreigners&#8221; and having to struggle to be accepted as Americans, and then turn and root against America when the choice comes. And we cannot be truthful to ourselves and say that Korea&#8217;s games against the US are only sport when we consider Korea&#8217;s games against Japan as so much more. Culture plays an enormous role in setting the framework for people&#8217;s understanding of the world around them.</p><p>
During World War II Asian Americans proudly and publicly made efforts to support America, despite the outrageous Executive Order 9066. Many, facing discrimination, wore buttons that read: &#8220;I am an American.&#8221; Still others, like Colonel Young Oak Kim, wore America&#8217;s uniform and served abroad. The Asian American 442nd Infantry continues to be the most highly-decorated military unit in the history of the American armed forces.</p>
</blockquote>
Undoubtedly, many people take this view, as many people take sports quite seriously--as does TK. So what does he think about this case of "divided loyalty"?</p><p>

In 15 words or less:&#160; Undisputed king Korean hip hop (they still call him Tiger you fucking haterz)</p>
 
<p>
Maybe they should should be ranked higher because...&#160; Made hip hop a mainstream genre. What more is necessary?</p>
 
<p>
Maybe they should be ranked lower because...&#160; At the end of the day, how big is hip hop (in its purest form) in Korea?</p>
 
<p>
Why is this artist important?</p>
<p>
Development of Korean hip hop is a fascinating story that deserves a closer chronicling. It is a modern case study of how an utterly foreign musical genre spread, took root, and eventually integrated itself into an essential part of the local pop music scene. This process, of course, did not happen by itself. Korean hip hop can be considered a forest, with many a skilled hand that planted, tended and lovingly nurtured each tree. And the credit to the tallest, most majestic tree goes to Tiger JK and Drunken Tiger.</p>
 
<p>
The history of hip hop in Korea arguably dates back to 1989, when a mid-major singer named Hong Seo-beom [&#54861;&#49436;&#48276;] included a rap track in his album. However, it would take a decade before Korean pop musicians to produce any music that the international audience would recognize as hip hop. The hip hop-esque music from the transitional period of 1990s is sometimes referred to as "rap dance," a genre that is still alive and well in Korea. "Rap dance" is chiefly a dance number, of which varying portions are dedicated to rapping. (This format can easily be seen in the contemporary K-pop idol music.) Although rap dance did much to introduce the Korean audience to hip hop, it still had some distance from hiphop proper, characterized by the rhyme and flow of mostly spoken words over rhythmic beats.</p>
 
<p>
Drunken Tiger was the group that bridged that gap. Tiger JK grew up in Miami and Los Angeles; DJ Shine, New York and Los Angeles. Having cut their musical teeth during the hip hop's "golden age," the two Korean American youngsters were eager to flash their authenticity in the music scene that, in their view, peddled dance music with a false label of hip hop. The provocative title song said it all: "You Think You Know Hip Hop" [&#45320;&#55148;&#44032; &#55193;&#54633;&#51012; &#50500;&#45712;&#45264;].</p>
 
<p>
Sure, the early attempts were often cringe-inducing in their cheesiness. Drunken Tiger's early emulation of American black culture frequently fell flat. It would take years, and many interceding talents such as Verbal Jint and Leessang, for Korean hip hop to completely overcome the language barrier and create a rhyme and flow in the Korean language--a critical development that finally allowed Korean hip hop to convey a new level of authentic emotion.&#160;</p>
 
<p>
But why does any of that matter? For a very long time, Drunken Tiger was the only K-pop hip hop artist who refused to compromise, releasing album after album filled only with rap rather than taking the easy path of rap dance. It is an overstatement to say that Drunken Tiger single-handedly made hip hop mainstream in Korea. But they did raise a forest from what seemed to be a hostile, infertile land--a feat that required no less fearlessness than any of their American counterparts.</p>
 
<p>
Interesting trivia: Tiger JK comes from a storied musical heritage. Tiger JK's father Seo Byeong-hu [&#49436;&#48337;&#54980;] is considered Korea's first pop music critic. <a href="http://tvshowdictionary.tistory.com/2038">The elder Seo founded Pops Koreana, Korea's first pop music magazine.</a> He was also the Korea correspondent for the Billboard magazine. Tiger JK's mother Kim Seong-ae [&#44608;&#49457;&#50528;] was a leader of a band called the Wild Cats. Tiger JK then married Yoon Mirae [&#50980;&#48120;&#47000;], the best female rapper in Korea's rap scene.</p><p>
Further Listening:&#160; Observe Drunken Tiger's evolution into incorporating parallel rhyming with both Korean and English by listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CQkyLDlSKg">Die Legend 2, from Feel Ghood Muzik</a>.</p>

<a href="https://askakorean.blogspot.com/2014/08/what-makes-good-korean-restaurant.html">What Makes a Good Korean Restaurant?</a>
</h3>

 


<p>
TK has been on a vacation for the last week, during which TK and TKWife made a giant circle driving around Colorado, Utah, Arizona and New Mexico, and visited numerous national parks. Overall, it was an amazing experience. What was not amazing, however, was the one Korean restaurant that TKCouple visited, which inspired <a href="https://www.facebook.com/thekorean/posts/801908913172799">this Facebook update:</a></p>

<blockquote class="tr_bq">
New blog concept: You tell me your favorite Korean restaurant in your town, and I will visit, eat, and tell you everything that's wrong with the food served there. 
Inspired by a crappy Korean restaurant in middle America that I'm sitting in. Its walls are covered with awards from local papers, which makes me want to disband those papers.</blockquote>

<p>
As TK said in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/thekorean/posts/801908913172799?comment_id=801933273170363&amp;offset=0&amp;total_comments=33">a comment to the update</a>, he won't actually do this. He is a lover, not a fighter, and he certainly knows better than to mess with people's livelihood. However, there is still a teachable moment here. Many people--including many Koreans!--do not really know what separates good Korean restaurants from bad ones. These people simply do not have enough experience to form a frame of reference as to what elements good Korean restaurants have.</p><p>
Don't just criticize; show the alternative. So TK will give the alternative. Here is a list of things that you should look for in a Korean restaurant in order to tell if it is a good one.</p><p>
Geographic Location</p><p>
In U.S.:&#160; Let's be straight. Korean food is not yet at the place where, say, sushi is--that is to say, Korean food is not yet mainstream enough for one to expect a dependable taste for it, outside of the people who grew up eating it constantly. This necessarily means the ceiling for the quality of Korean food sold in areas sparsely populated by Koreans will be rather low. In the U.S., Koreans mostly live in Southern California, New York/North New Jersey and D.C./Maryland/Northern Virginia. (The next tier of Korean American population centers are Northern California, Atlanta, Chicago and Seattle, but the drop-off is significant after the top three.) The quality of Korean food tends to track that order.</p><p>
In Korea:&#160; Korea is surrounded by seas on three sides, with each side producing different types of fish. Korea's terrain also ranges from mountains to fertile and flat fields, each yielding different types of crops. In short, Korean food is highly diverse based on geography. Because everything in Korea tends to eventually flow to Seoul, the restaurants in Seoul tend to maintain a certain level of quality. But for the real deal, look for the restaurants that sell the food that is made from the local ingredients.</p><p>
<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container"><tbody>
 
<tr><td class="tr-caption">Freshly made soft tofu from Sokcho. This ended up in TK's stomach within minutes.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</p><p>
For example, tofu requires sea water to make. (Bet you did not know that.) Thus, the best tofu comes from Korea's eastern seaboard, in which soy beans grow and the sea water is readily available. Port cities, obviously, are the best places to have fish and seafood. Jeju Island is not only known for its seafood, but also for pork from its native black pigs. Since each locality in Korea loudly advertises its specialty food, it is hard to miss the local delicacy.</p><p>
Two additional points: (1) in the City of Jeonju, every dish is good; (2) in Daegu, every dish is awful. Just trust me on this. Jeonju is the birthplace of bibimbap, one of the most iconic Korean dishes. In Daegu, locals say the best food available is McDonald's.</p><p>

</h3>

 


<p>
Dear Korean,</p>
 
<p>
<p>
Why do Korean eat hard boiled eggs in trains? Every time I took a train with my Korean wife, she always says that we should eat hard boiled eggs. But why? What is it with trains and hard boiled eggs?</p>
 
<p>
Damien G.</p>
 
</p><p>
<p>
Boiled eggs on a train is a tradition of sorts. Korea operated its first train line in 1899, and train has been the dominant mode of long distance travel in Korea all the way until the late 1970s. Trains are extremely popular even today, as the high-speed KTX (traveling at 190 mph) covers Seoul-Busan under three hours.&#160;</p>
 
<p>
Riding a certain mode of transportation for a century would inevitably engender some associated habits. In case of a train, the habit is to have boiled eggs and a soda--either cola or lemon-lime (known in Korea as &#49324;&#51060;&#45796; [saida]). Why boiled eggs? Why not? Especially when one considers the early days of train travel, boiled eggs make perfect sense as a snack on a moving train. They are delicious, filling, portable and not overly odorous. Plus, eggs come in their own casing. They are a far sight better than <a href="http://img.koreatimes.co.kr/upload/newsV2/images/988223_559837294058502_1333286369_n-450.jpg">those black protein blocks that certain other train passengers eat</a>.</p>
 
<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container"><tbody>
 
<tr><td class="tr-caption">Re-enactment of a snack vendor on a steam engine train. Boiled eggs are wrapped in red mesh sacks. 
Near Seomjin-gang River, a restored steam engine train running on old tracks,  
with old school trappings, is now a tourist attraction. 
(<a href="http://tong.visitkorea.or.kr/upload/traveli/fileup/1369742799983.jpg">source</a>)</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>
To be sure, boiled eggs are hardly the only popular snacks on a train trip. Gimbab [&#44608;&#48165;], a rice roll, is a perennial favorite picnic food and also very popular on a train.</p><p>
There are other associations of travel and food. The rest stops on Korea's freeways tend to (but does not always) have a uniform look, and the menus tend to be standardized as well. The mainstays of freeway rest stops are udon noodles, "hot bar" (fried fish cake on a stick,) and the walnut cookies (a bite-sized, walnut shaped pastry with sweet red bean filling and bits of walnut.) The rest stops that travel eastward from Seoul to the mountainous Gangwon-do Province also tend to serve pan-fried fingerling potatoes, as Gangwon-do is known for its delicious, chewy potatoes.</p><p>
When TK took his first long road trip in the U.S.--from Los Angeles to Grand Canyon--he was incredibly disappointed at the West Coast freeway rest stops, which are nothing more than a bathroom in the desert flanked by a few dingy vending machines. The East Coast rest stops are marginally better, but they don't serve udon noodles. Pity, because rest stop udon is fantastic.</p><p>

</h3>

 


<p>
As some of you may have noticed, TK has been in Korea for the last couple of weeks. One of the pleasures of visiting Korea is to observe the changes. Because Korea is such a fast-changing society, even one year in between the visits (as was the case with TK's) is enough to produce noticeable, interesting changes. Here are three things that TK noticed in his visit:</p>
 
<p>
(1) Beer.&#160; &#160;Good beer is mainstream. Good beer is mainstream! In Korea! In the land of horse piss beer! Yes, it is true, good beer is available in Korea to a degree that has never been seen before. <a href="http://askakorean.blogspot.com/2013/06/good-korean-beer-is-just-around-bend.html">As TK previously predicted</a>, the microbrewery movement in Korea is finally taking off. Even the big boys--i.e. Hite and OB--improved their default beer and came out with more drinkable stuff. Microbreweries are now opening their own restaurants and pubs all over Seoul; it will be a matter of time before they spread to other large cities of Korea.</p>
 
<p>
(2) Public Bathrooms.&#160; &#160;Once upon a time--say, 10 years ago--using a public bathroom in Korea was a serious gamble. You had to avoid the dreaded "squat toilet" (and no, TK is not going to put up a picture here.) In about 90 percent of the times, there was no toilet paper. Cleanliness? Pfft, people tossed the dirty toilet paper into an open-faced trash can.</p>
 
<p>
Not so any more. In no case was TK in any danger of not finding toilet paper in a public toilet. All of them were reasonably clean--even the ones in incredibly crowded subway stations. The bathrooms in the Gangnam station smelled less of urine than the elevator of the Penn Station subway stop in New York. This is true.</p>
 
<p>
(3) Chinese people.&#160; &#160;There are more Chinese folks in Korea than ever. Tourist districts of Seoul have huge banners in Chinese. Thanks to a new investment visa, Jeju Island has a massive increase in Chinese folks in the last few years, to the point that Koreans are joking about how they need to learn Chinese if they want to retire in the island.</p>

First, the answers to the trivia:</p><p>
1. &#160;SM Entertainment is the management company of the pioneering female idol star, BoA.</p><p>
2. &#160;Shin Dae-cheol is the guitarist for the band Sinawi, whose bassist at one point was the legendary Seo Taiji.</p><p>
3. &#160;Kim Min-gi is the artist whose best known song is the Morning Dew.</p><p>
Somehow, Question 2 tripped up a big number of entrants. The question asked for the name of the guitarist of the band, but many submitted "Sinawi" as the answer.</p><p>
Many people still got all three questions correct, and sent terrific stories that made TK's heart all warm and fuzzy. TK picked the best three. Congratulations, Evan T., Michael L. and Larissa F.! You will receive an email from TK soon. For everyone, thank you so much for reading!</p><p>

<p>
Dear Korean,</p>
</p><p>
<p>
Reading&#160;<a href="http://www.espnfc.com/team/south-korea/451/blog/post/1923270/wright-south-korea-fans-pelt-players-with-toffee">this article</a>, I was wondering whether the statement "The popular pumpkin toffees have become a shorthand for an insult in South Korea, where  'Go eat toffee' means a ruder version of 'get lost'" is true. Is there even a "tradition" to throw toffee? In my culture we throw sweets and candies as a sign of good luck and happiness.</p>
</p><p>
<p>
Curious Reader</p>
</p><p>
 
<p>
A bit of background first. <a href="http://askakorean.blogspot.com/2014/06/world-cup-thoughts.html">As this blog (unfortunately) predicted</a>, Korean national soccer team returned from the Brazil World Cup with a disappointing result of two losses and one draw.</p>
 
<p>
Upon their return, they were greeted with a toffee shower:</p>
 
<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container"><tbody>
 
<tr><td class="tr-caption">Note the toffees on the floor. 
(<a href="http://dimg.donga.com/wps/NEWS/IMAGE/2014/06/30/64812810.2.jpg">source</a>)</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
 
<p>
So yes, it's true: throwing toffee is an insult. But why? That question becomes fairly easy to understand when one sees what a traditional Korean toffee looks like. It looks like this:</p>
 
<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container"><tbody>
 
<tr><td class="tr-caption">Sweet and delicious. 
(<a href="http://dimg.donga.com/wps/NEWS/IMAGE/2014/06/30/64812810.2.jpg">source</a>)</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>
This is called &#50687; [yeot] in Korean. "Toffee" is a solid translation, because that's what yeot is--it is a candy created by solidifying thin strands of syrup. The insult is to say &#50687; &#47673;&#50612;&#46972;, or "eat yeot." Hm, put this long, sticky thing into your mouth? Wonder what that could possibly mean?</p>
 
<p>
(For those lacking in imagination, it means: "Eat a dick.")</p>
 
<p>
Interestingly, this insult is more often delivered with words rather than with the actual candy. In the right context, gifting the candy is not an insult at all. For example, someone who is preparing for an exam often receives yeot as a gift, as an encouragement to "stick" the exam (=pass the exam.) But of course, there is no mistaking the intent behind the toffee shower that the the national team received.</p>
 
<p>
Several of you also emailed to ask how the Korean felt about the way in which the players were received. His feeling is: they probably don't deserve it, but it is part of the job description. Certain players--Son Heung-min comes to mind--played their hearts out, and definitely did not deserve to be told to "fuck off." Ideally, one should be able to focus-fire the insult. If one threw the yeot only to those who deserved the most blame, striker Park Chu-young and goalie Jung Sung-ryong would be getting a cannonball of candies to their faces.&#160;</p>
 
<p>
(And Jung won't be able to catch a single one of them. Hey-oh!)&#160;</p>
 
<p>
But that's what sports stars are. They are not paid big money to put a ball through a goal or a hoop or into the end zone. They are paid to serve as the vessel into which we project our desire. In this instance, Korean people's desire was hardly unreasonable; it is not as if there was an expectation that the team would win the whole thing. The team was expected to play hard, and play competently. More than a few players on the team failed at this. And if all they receive in return is some candies thrown at their face, that is not a huge injustice.</p><p>
-UPDATE: July 3, 2014-</p><p>
1. &#160;Renowned food blogger Joe McPherson, who blogs at <a href="http://zenkimchi.com/">Zenkimchi</a>, lodged this objection: &#160;"Yeot is more like a taffy than toffee." Truth be told, TK did not even realize there was a difference between taffy and toffee. Alrighty then.</p><p>
2. &#160;<a href="http://screamer.deadspin.com/the-reason-koreans-threw-toffees-at-their-soccer-team-i-1599068912/+kylenw">This post was featured on Deadspin</a>, in which some of Deadspin's commenters questioned why the yeot showing in the photos taken at the airport does not look like the yeot photo in this post. The reason is actually pretty simple: in the era of commercialization, the traditional long yeot has been re-packaged into a bite-sized candy. The bite-size yeot is still quite enough to convey the insulting message, and has the bonus of being a better aerial projectile.</p><p>
3. &#160;Now, for the really fun part. Since this post went up, a number of Korean readers provided several alternate theories as to why "eat yeot" is an insult. The theory that TK presented in the post is the prevailing theory: that yeot looks like penis, and "eat yeot" means "eat a dick." But the alternate theories are plenty interesting in their own right, so here they are:</p><p>
- Probably the most colorful theory is that "eat yeot" comes from a botched exam in 1969. In the middle school entrance exam of 1969 (yes, Korea used to have an entrance exam for middle schools,) there was a question about the appropriate coagulating agent in the yeot-making process. Because of a mistake, there were two possible answers, but the testing authorities only recognized one of the answers. The enraged parents of the students then mobbed the testing authorities, shoving a homemade yeot made with the alternate substance into the faces of the befuddled testing authorities, screaming: "Eat this yeot! Eat it!"</p><p>
This event actually did happen, but it is almost certainly not the origin of the phrase "eat yeot" because there are examples of "eat yeot" usage that pre-dates 1969. But it's a fun story.</p><p>
- One alternate theory says: &#160;"eat yeot" means "shut up," because apparently there is a Western tradition in which the dead's mouth was filled with thick syrup to keep it closed. This is most likely a wild speculation.</p><p>
- Another alternate theory says: &#160;"eat yeot" is a bastardization of "eat yeom" [&#50684; &#47673;&#50612;&#46972;]. "Yeom" is a process by which Koreans prepare the dead body for the funeral. That is to say--the theory is that "eat yeot" really means "go die." TK does not think this is particularly compelling, because yeom is a process rather than a substance that actually goes into one's mouth.</p><p>
- There is even a dispute as to whether "yeot" refers to a man's genitalia. One of the leading theories is that "eat yeot" is a slang term originating from Namsadangpae [&#45224;&#49324;&#45817;&#54056;], a famed circus/clown act in Korea that has survived for centuries. According to the Namsadangpae lingo, yeot actually refers to vagina rather than penis.</p>

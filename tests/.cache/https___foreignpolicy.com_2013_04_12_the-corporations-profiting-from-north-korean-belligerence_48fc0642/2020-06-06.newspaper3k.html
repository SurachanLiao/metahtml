    <h1 class="hed">The corporations profiting from North Korean belligerence</h1>
</p><p> North Korean aggression is a <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/2013/04/05/south-korean-stocks-slammed-by-north-korea-jitters-boj-policy/">drain on</a> South Korea&#8217;s economy, but it&#8217;s a boon for the defense contractors looking to flood the peninsula with new weapons systems.  </p>
<p> As Seoul awaits a possible North Korean missile launch this week, the country is watching its benchmark KOSPI become Asia&#8217;s <a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/72e10336-a273-11e2-9b70-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2QAVRKdxD">worst-performing index this year</a>. At the same time, stocks for defense contractors with existing business ties with Seoul are surging.  </p>
<p> These firms are currently vying to equip South Korea with a mix of radar systems, fighter jets, drones, and missile defense systems, and include everyone from Boeing to Lockheed Martin to Northrop Grumman to Raytheon to BAE Systems. While the South&#8217;s major acquisition decisions are made with a long-term view, Pyongyang&#8217;s apocalyptic rhetoric doesn&#8217;t exactly hurt the efforts of silver-tongued weapons salesmen. We took a quick glance at the market valuation of the firms we&#8217;re talking about on Thursday.  </p>

<p> Not bad. And how about the stock peformance since Pyongyang&#8217;s belligerence began in March? </p>
<p> <i>Even better. </i>The below graph features a blue line representing the above defense stocks and a red line representing the S&amp;P 500. Despite the fact that the S&amp;P is having a <a href="http://www.money.cnn.com/2013/04/11/investing/stocks-markets/">record-breaking month</a>, it&#8217;s no match for surging investor interest in defense stocks in the wake of Pyongyang threats:  </p>

<p> So what do these companies have to gain? Here&#8217;s a breakdown of the existing and future bids these firms are trying to lock down with South Korea: </p>
<p> <b>Fighter Jets</b>

        </p>
<p> Currently the biggest names in defense contracting are vying to provide Seoul with 60 new fighter jets in a global competition worth billions of dollars. Last week, the Pentagon <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/04/03/us-korea-usa-fighters-idUSBRE93210220130403">approved</a> the potential sale of Lockheed Martin&#8217;s F-35 stealth fighter and Boeing&#8217;s F-15 Silent Eagle fighter to Korea. But Lockheed and Boeing don&#8217;t just have themselves to compete with: The pan-European aerospace and defence corporation EADS and BAE Systems are also offering the Eurofighter Typhoon. To get a sense of the kind of coin we&#8217;re talking about, the Pentagon says the proposed sale of Lockheed&#8217;s F-35 fighters would be worth as much as $10.8 billion. On Tuesday, Dave Scott, a senior Lockheed executive, <a href="http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/national/2013/04/09/30/0301000000AEN20130409011000315F.HTML">renewed his pitch</a> for the F-35 in light of Pyongyang&#8217;s belligerence, saying the actions of the regime &#8220;have reinforced the need to be strong and to be recognized.&#8221;  </p>
<p> According to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/04/03/us-korea-usa-fighters-idUSBRE93210220130403">Reuters</a>, Seoul will announce the winner of the competition sometime between June and November.  </p>
<p> <b>Drones </b> </p>

        </p>
<p> Though a proposed deal between Seoul and Northrop Grumman for a fleet of $215 million Global Hawk drones is still at an &#8220;<a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate/2013/04/01/a-spy-plane-alliance/">early stage</a>,&#8221; the contract could pay off hugely for the Virginia-based contractor. The drone is the size of an airliner and, according to weapons expert<a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate/2013/04/01/a-spy-plane-alliance/"> David Axe</a>, could become a lynchpin of the &#8220;burgeoning robotic alliance&#8221; between Tokyo, Washington, Seoul, and Canberra. It&#8217;s also quite a valuable contract: In December, the Pentagon pegged the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/30/opinion/sunday/drones-for-south-korea.html?_r=0">proposed</a> sale of four Global Hawks by Northrop at a cool $1.2 billion.  </p>
<p> <b>Radar </b> </p>

<p> Hot off the presses, Massachusetts-based contractor Raytheon <a href="http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Security-Industry/2013/04/11/South-Korea-picks-Raytheon-radar/UPI-44901365691129/?spt=hs&amp;or=si">announced</a> the sale of its Raytheon Advanced Combat Radar (RACR) to South Korea on Thursday. The radar, an &#8220;active electronically scanned array system,&#8221; is built specifically for use on F-16 Fighting Falcons, and is part of a planned <a href="http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/04/10/raytheon-wins-part-of-11-billion-south-korean-cont.aspx">$1.1 billion upgrade</a> to South Korea&#8217;s fighter jet fleet. &#8220;RACR will keep the Republic of Korea&#8217;s KF-16 combat-relevant in a constantly evolving threat environment,&#8221; said Raytheon Space and Airborne Systems President Rick Yuse. Previously, South Korea has also made<a href="http://www.haaretz.com/news/south-korea-to-buy-israeli-radar-system-in-215-million-deal-1.270231"> large purchases</a> of radar equipment from Israel Aerospace Industries.  </p>
<p> <b>Missiles and Missile Defense</b> </p>
<p>             
        <img alt="" class="image  -fit -lazy">

        </p>
<p> In terms of raw missiles, Raytheon also benefits from a South Korean defensive buying spree. Seoul is a major customer of Raytheon&#8217;s newest incarnation of the Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM). As recently as December, South Korea <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-12-21/raytheon-storing-missiles-awaiting-motors-air-force-says.html">ordered</a> AMRAAM missiles from Raytheon, although the shipment was delayed because the missiles were missing their motors. Additionally, the Israeli defense firm Rafael has expressed a strong interest in selling its sometimes vaunted, sometimes pooh-poohed Iron Dome technology to South Korea. But as <a href="http://e-ring.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2013/04/09/why_doesn_t_seoul_have_iron_dome">Kevin Baron reported</a> on Monday, previous deals have met with resistance due to the system&#8217;s steep price tag among other things: Each Iron Dome battery costs an estimated $50 million and the interceptor rockets cost between $50,000 and $80,000 each. In sum, there&#8217;s a lot of money to be made&#160;on the Korean Peninsula.  </p>

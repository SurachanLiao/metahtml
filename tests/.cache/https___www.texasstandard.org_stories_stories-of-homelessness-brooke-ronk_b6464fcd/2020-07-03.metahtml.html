<p>Brooke Ronk was about 4 years old when her parents split up. Since then, she and her mother have bounced around, living with relatives or at a hotel. They finally had their own home in Dallas. But then she discovered her mother&#8217;s drug problem. Ronk dropped out of high school. Three months later, the 18-year&#173;-old enrolled at the Lewisville Learning Center. She&#8217;s graduating from high school this summer and wants to become a forensic psychologist. She lives with her sister in The Colony.</p>
<p>A year ago, when my mom and I had been living in an apartment on our own, she had started up drug use. Things got really rough. I could see my mom going downhill. She pretty much lost everything we had owned all together, and I always ended up trying to have to find a place.</p>
<p>My mom is the one who actually took me away from school and decided that I wouldn&#8217;t be able to get back into high school. I didn&#8217;t think I would graduate; I didn&#8217;t think I would have a good job. I thought everything was disappearing. It was a really difficult time. It kind of hurt a lot being unenrolled, not knowing what was going to happen next or who I was going to be around.</p>
<p>I started going to the Lewisville Learning Center the day that I turned 18. It was actually a really great thing; it was nice to start school again. I was still having issues finding where to live when I started at the Learning Center. It was iffy about where I was staying; it would either be at my sister&#8217;s house or between friends from Lewisville across from where the school is.</p>
<p>I did have a lot of anxiety problems whenever I couldn&#8217;t figure out where I was going to stay on certain nights or how I was going to be getting to school or if I would even being going home that night&#8212;to a home&#8212;and I always had to come up with something&#8212;like make 1,000 phone calls, any family that I could stay with possibly.</p>
<p>Knowing that I&#8217;m going through school now and going to get a diploma is really calming, knowing that I&#8217;m probably going to be able to get in a better place. After all that&#8217;s happened with my mom, I still want to help her because she&#8217;s my mom, and no matter what, she&#8217;s always going to be my mom.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t push her out of my life even though she had tried to push me and my sister out of hers. It&#8217;s nice knowing that&#8217;s she&#8217;s going to have someone there.</p>

Brooke Ronk was about 4 years old when her parents split up. Since then, she and her mother have bounced around, living with relatives or at a hotel. They finally had their own home in Dallas. But then she discovered her mother’s drug problem. Ronk dropped out of high school. Three months later, the 18-year­-old enrolled at the Lewisville Learning Center. She’s graduating from high school this summer and wants to become a forensic psychologist. She lives with her sister in The Colony.

A year ago, when my mom and I had been living in an apartment on our own, she had started up drug use. Things got really rough. I could see my mom going downhill. She pretty much lost everything we had owned all together, and I always ended up trying to have to find a place.

My mom is the one who actually took me away from school and decided that I wouldn’t be able to get back into high school. I didn’t think I would graduate; I didn’t think I would have a good job. I thought everything was disappearing. It was a really difficult time. It kind of hurt a lot being unenrolled, not knowing what was going to happen next or who I was going to be around.

I started going to the Lewisville Learning Center the day that I turned 18. It was actually a really great thing; it was nice to start school again. I was still having issues finding where to live when I started at the Learning Center. It was iffy about where I was staying; it would either be at my sister’s house or between friends from Lewisville across from where the school is.

I did have a lot of anxiety problems whenever I couldn’t figure out where I was going to stay on certain nights or how I was going to be getting to school or if I would even being going home that night—to a home—and I always had to come up with something—like make 1,000 phone calls, any family that I could stay with possibly.

Knowing that I’m going through school now and going to get a diploma is really calming, knowing that I’m probably going to be able to get in a better place. After all that’s happened with my mom, I still want to help her because she’s my mom, and no matter what, she’s always going to be my mom.

I can’t push her out of my life even though she had tried to push me and my sister out of hers. It’s nice knowing that’s she’s going to have someone there.

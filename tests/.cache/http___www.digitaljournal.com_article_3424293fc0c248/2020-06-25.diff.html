</ins> The agency went on to write: "Those hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership of the nation should not expect any mercy or leniency. Time will clearly show what dear price the human scum and media in the service of traitors of South Korea, slaves of capital, will have to pay."
 
Interestingly though the traitors were not just the usual culprits of South Korea and the U.S. Included in the category of enemies was North Korean ally China.

Section 1 of E.O. 13628 provides that the Secretary of the Treasury, pursuant to authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), shall take action to implement certain sanctions set forth in Section 6 of the Iran Sanctions Act of 1996, as amended (ISA), when the President, the Secretary of State, or the Secretary of the Treasury imposes such sanctions on a person pursuant to provisions of ISA, the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010, as amended, or the TRA. Section 6 of ISA includes both blocking and non-blocking sanctions. In order to implement the non-blocking provisions of Section 6 of ISA, OFAC developed the NS-ISA List. OFAC implements the blocking sanction under Section 6 of ISA by adding persons subject to that sanction to the List of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons with the identifying tag “[ISA]”

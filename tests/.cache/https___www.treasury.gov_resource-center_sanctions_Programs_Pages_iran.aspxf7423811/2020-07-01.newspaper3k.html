<a name="isa" class="external" id="isa"><strong> </strong><p>On October 9, 2012, the President signed Executive Order (E.O.) 13628, which provides for, among other things, the implementation of certain sanctions set forth in the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 (TRA). Section 1 of E.O. 13628 provides that the Secretary of the Treasury, pursuant to authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), shall take action to implement certain sanctions set forth in Section 6 of the Iran Sanctions Act of 1996, as amended (ISA), when the President, the Secretary of State, or the Secretary of the Treasury imposes such sanctions on a person pursuant to provisions of ISA, the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010, as amended, or the TRA.&#160; Section 6 of ISA includes both blocking and non-blocking sanctions. In order to implement the non-blocking provisions of Section 6 of ISA, OFAC developed the NS-ISA List. OFAC implements the blocking sanction under Section 6 of ISA by adding persons subject to that sanction to the List of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons with the identifying tag &#8220;[ISA]&#8221; </p></a>

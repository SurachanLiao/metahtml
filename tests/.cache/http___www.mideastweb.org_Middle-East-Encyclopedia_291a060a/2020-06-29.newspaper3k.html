<p><b><i>Spelling - </i></b>Spelling of words in Middle-Eastern languages is 
often arbitrary. There may be many variants of the same name or word such as <i>Hezbollah, Hizbolla, Hisbolla</i> or <i>
Husayn and Hussein</i>. There are some conventions for converting words from Semitic languages such as Arabic and Hebrew<i><b>.&#160; </b></i>

There are numerous variant renderings of the same Arabic or Hebrew words, such as "Hizbollah," "Hisbulla" etc. It is not possible to find exact equivalents for 
several letters.&#160;  </p>
<p><b><i>Pronunciation </i></b>- Arabic and 
Hebrew vowels are pronounced differently than in English. "o" is very short. The "a" is usually pronounced like the "a" 
in m<i>a</i>rket, sometimes as the "a" in "Arafat."&#160; The " 'A " is guttural.&#160; " 'H "- 
the 'het ('Hirbeh, 'Hebron, 'Hisbollah') 
designates a sound somewhat similar to the <i>ch</i> in "loch" in Scots pronunciation, but made by touching 
the back of your tongue to the roof of your mouth. The <b>CH</b> should be pronounced like Loch, a more assertive consonant 
than 'het. </p>
<p>The "Gh" combination, and sometimes the "G," designate a deep guttural 
sound that Westerners may hear approximately as "r." The "r" sound is always formed with the back of the tongue, and is 
not like the English "r." </p>

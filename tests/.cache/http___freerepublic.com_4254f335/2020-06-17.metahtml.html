      The status of a Christopher Columbus statue outside the Ohio State Capitol is likely to come up at a future meeting of the agency that manages the Statehouse grounds, after support has grown in Columbus to remove the city&#146;s other prominent statues of the Italian explorer. Laura Battocletti, executive director of the Capitol Square Review and Advisory Board, said she&#146;s not aware of discussion about removing the statue among CSRAB board members, a mixture of state lawmakers, legislative staff and governor appointees.

Only eight months after the first U.S.-North Korea summit, President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un met again on Wednesday in Vietnam but walked away from negotiations about 24 hours later.

A lunch and signing ceremony that had been scheduled for Thursday was canceled and Trump departed for Washington several hours ahead of schedule. Trump remained non-committal about a third summit.

Read on to see what happened in Vietnam and how the relationship between Trump and Kim has evolved since their historic meeting in June.

Feb. 27: No deal

Trump told reporters he was unable to reach a deal with North Korea because Kim wanted U.S. sanctions to be completely removed before he promised to shut down North Korea's Yongbyon nuclear facility.

“It was about the sanctions,” Trump said. “Basically, they wanted the sanctions lifted in their entirety, and we couldn’t do that. They were willing to denuke a large portion of the areas that we wanted, but we couldn’t give up all of the sanctions for that.”

Despite the lack of progress, the president said he trusted Kim's promise he would not resume nuclear and missile testing, but that the current U.S. sanctions would stay in place.

March 2018 - June 1, 2018: US and North Korean leaders go back and forth on meeting

In the months leading up to the first summit between Trump and Kim, the leaders continued to go back and forth on whether they would meet. Though Trump accepted Kim’s invitation to meet in early March, the date and location of the meeting (June 12 in Singapore) weren’t set until May.

However, North Korean leaders threatened to cancel the talks midway through May and Trump himself said he would back out.

Leaders from both sides eventually said they would be willing to talk after South Korean president stepped in to talk with North Korean leaders and aides from both North Korea and the U.S. met in North Korea, Singapore and New York City to finalize details ahead of the actual summit.

The summit was officially confirmed again by Trump on June 1 after he received a personal letter from Kim, delivered by a North Korean official to the White House.

<p id="dsk-box-ad-c"></p><p></p><p>This is a breaking news story and of course a difficult one, given the exceptional dearth of reliable information from North Korea.&#160; Multiple news sites in Washington confirm they are receiving reports on it from U.S. officials, however.&#160; There appears to be something to it; the question is exactly what.</p>
<p>CNN <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/20/politics/kim-jong-un-north-korea/index.html">reported</a> a short time ago that Kim Jong Un was said by an unnamed U.S. official to be &#8220;in grave danger after surgery.&#8221;&#160; The CNN report indicated that this came from U.S. intelligence.</p>
<p>CNN says another U.S. official tells them &#8220;the concerns about Kim&#8217;s health are credible but the severity is hard to assess.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kim Jong-Un reportedly had heart surgery on 12 April and has been in recovery in the 8 days since.&#160; He missed appearing at the official commemoration of his grandfathers&#8217;s (Kim Il-Sung) birthday on 15 April.</p>

</p>
<p>Fox News <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/kim-jong-un-cardiovascular-procedure-north-korea">has much the same information</a>, but doesn&#8217;t attribute it to U.S. intelligence monitoring.&#160; Says Fox: &#8220;Sources told Fox News that the White House is aware of the reports of Kim&#8217;s health, but there is no confirmation.&#8221;</p>
<p id="dsk-box-ad-d"></p><p>All kinds of speculation is rampant in the media, both among the cable news talking heads and on social media.&#160; OAN says officials have told them a Chinese doctor was called in to attend Kim Jong-Un, and ended up infecting him with COVID-19.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s possible, although the likelihood of U.S. intelligence making such a disclosure with confidence is low.&#160; I suggest not running with it.&#160; It&#8217;s just something to be aware of.&#160; Apparently someone wants to have the &#8220;disclosure&#8221; out there, at any rate, so it&#8217;s not worthless as a data point.</p>

<p>Obviously the implications of this would be significant if Kim Jong-Un&#8217;s health were at such grave risk that he might not (or did not) survive.&#160; South Korea has been downplaying the matter, declining to add to the speculation frenzy.&#160; Rather than rewrite it at unnecessary length, I&#8217;ll just post my tweet on that point.</p>

<p>Beyond that, there is limited utility in spinning out scenarios from a position of ignorance.&#160; We don&#8217;t really know how bad it is, although if we&#8217;re hearing about it at all, it&#8217;s legitimate to assume Kim&#8217;s life is, in fact, at stake.&#160; It&#8217;s CNN giving the worst report of Kim&#8217;s health (&#8220;grave danger&#8217;), which is a red flag for me.&#160; CNN is one of several outlets that make themselves the path of least resistance for &#8220;leaks&#8221; targeting the Trump administration&#8217;s foreign policy.&#160; Perhaps U.S. intelligence thinks it&#8217;s as bad as CNN says.&#160; Perhaps not.</p>
<p>That said, if it is that bad, and Kim may not survive, it&#8217;s not actually obvious what would happen next.&#160; Most mainstream media have come out speculating about Kim&#8217;s sister, Kim Yo Jong.&#160; &#160;Maybe.&#160; It may depend on who from outside North Korea can manage the fanciest footwork.&#160; Don&#8217;t discount the possibility that this could be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to influence the successor regime in Pyongyang and set history on a new course.&#160; President Trump has already set the key condition for that: decoupling North Korean relations in general from the exclusive brokerage of Beijing.</p>
<p>Nothing like that would be done in the open, at least not initially.&#160; But the U.S. has the friends for it in the neighborhood.&#160; There&#8217;s never a time so unpropitious for correcting the longstanding situation on the Korean peninsula that it shouldn&#8217;t be tried.</p>
<p id="dsk-box-ad-f"></p><p>South Korea&#8217;s Moon Jae-In has a very solid governing mandate after <a href="https://nationalinterest.org/blog/korea-watch/president-moon-jae-wins-big-mandate-historic-south-korean-elections-144677">a massive victory</a> for the Democrats in last week&#8217;s election; I don&#8217;t have enough of a sense of him to predict whether he&#8217;s up to the job of grabbing the reins and going for reunification.&#160; Any such move has to be spearheaded by Seoul.&#160; They&#8217;ll keep their cards close to the vest, and they won&#8217;t want to aggressively alienate China, even if they have the courage, with U.S. backing, to act independently.</p>
<p>At any rate, it&#8217;s early days yet.&#160; We&#8217;ll see where this goes.</p>

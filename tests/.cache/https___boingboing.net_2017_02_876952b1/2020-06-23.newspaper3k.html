One of the products that Snapchat owner Snap Inc. is developing as &#8220;a modern-day camera company&#8221; is a drone, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/28/technology/snapchat-drone.html">reports the New York Times</a> today. </p>

Sources for this bold claim are &#8220;three people briefed on the project who asked to remain anonymous because the details are confidential.&#8221; </p>

Snap is scheduled to go public later this week in a long-anticipated IPO. <a href="https://boingboing.net/2017/02/28/snap-drone.html" class="read-more">Read the rest </a></p>

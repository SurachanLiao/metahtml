The Star/Asia News Network:

The woman with shoulder-length hair approaches Jong-nam with what could be a cloth or a hood and lunges from behind, reaching over his head and covering his face with the cloth. The woman resembles Doan Thi Huong, who was later arrested as a suspect.

It takes only seconds and both women walked back to the directions they came from.

The woman who was seen attacking him glances back furtively as she walked quickly away from the scene.

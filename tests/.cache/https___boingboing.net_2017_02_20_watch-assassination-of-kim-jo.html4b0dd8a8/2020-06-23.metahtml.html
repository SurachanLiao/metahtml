<p>The woman with shoulder-length hair approaches Jong-nam with what could be a cloth or a hood and lunges from behind, reaching over his head and covering his face with the cloth. The woman resembles Doan Thi Huong, who was later arrested as a suspect.</p>

<p>"North Korea is wiping out all the pro-Chinese regime elements -- although this murder seems especially cruel."</p>

<p>Such a move would be a dramatic miscalculation by Pyongyang, according to Zhao.</p>

<p>"If this murder is confirmed (as being ordered by Kim Jong Un), that will deal a major blow to China's hopes about the North Korean leadership's ability to open up," he said.</p>

<p>This could fundamentally change how Beijing -- a long advocate of diplomatic talks between Pyongyang and its rivals -- deals with North Korea and its nuclear program.</p>

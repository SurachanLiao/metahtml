                    Kim Jong-un has had speculation about his health before this<br>
                </p><br>
            
<p class="story-body__introduction">Reports that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un is seriously ill after heart surgery are not true, officials in South Korea have said.</p>
<p>Headlines that Kim Jong-un was &#8220;gravely ill&#8221;, &#8220;brain-dead&#8221; or &#8220;recovering from an operation&#8221; were always going to be impossible to verify.  </p>
<p>But the presidential office in Seoul has said there have been no particular signs from the North to indicate the 36-year-old is &#8220;gravely ill&#8221;. </p>
<p>It is also not the first time rumours about his health have fired up intense flurries of speculation &#8211; only to be later dismissed.</p>
<h2 class="story-body__crosshead">When did speculation start?</h2>
<p>Kim Jong-un recently missed the celebration of his grandfather&#8217;s birthday on 15 April. This is one of the biggest events of the year, marking the birth of the nation&#8217;s founder. </p>
<p>Kim Jong-un has never missed it &#8211; and it seemed very unlikely that he would simply choose not to turn up.</p>
<p>Inevitably, his absence prompted speculation and rumour, none of which is easy to substantiate.</p>
<p>Kim Jong-un last appeared in state media on 12 April &#8220;inspecting a pursuit assault plane group&#8221; in a handout that is undated. As ever, the images portrayed him as relaxed and at ease. </p>
<p>We know he chaired a key political meeting the day before, from state media&#8230;</p>

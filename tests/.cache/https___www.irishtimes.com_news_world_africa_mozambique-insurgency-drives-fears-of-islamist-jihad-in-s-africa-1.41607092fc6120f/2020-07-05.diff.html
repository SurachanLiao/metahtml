But Opperman believes it is crucial to establish if their ties run deeper.</p> <p class="no_name">She also warned that Mozambique, itself a post-war state, appears ill-equipped to deal with the insurgency and that the Southern African Development Community (SADC) – the main regional intergovernmental body in southern Africa – has yet to outline how it might deal with a jihadist threat in the region.</p> <p class="no_name">“We have a serious situation on our hands in Cabo Delgado, but SADC has been silent about it so far. I can’t understand it, because we need a regional structure and strategy to deal with this [conflict].” Mozambique’s Frelimo-led government, which was re-elected last year, has so far revealed little about the group since it emerged, only saying the insurgents comprise local unemployed “criminals” and that the attacks are linked to global jihadists.</p> <p class="no_name">Efforts to find out more about the extremists and their motives have also been hampered by the government’s decision in 2018 to ban journalists and researchers from working in areas targeted by the insurgents.</p> <h4 class="crosshead">Radicalisation research</h4><p class="no_name">However, a study last September by the Maputo-based Institute of Social and Economic Studies titled, “Islamic Radicalisation in Northern Mozambique: The Case of Mocímboa da Praia” provides insights into how and why extremism has emerged in the province.</p> <p class="no_name">According to Cabo Delgado residents interviewed for the study, the men who initially launched the insurgency came to the fore in 2014 in a religious group who wanted locals to adhere to an extreme form of Islamic law.</p> <p class="no_name">When this was opposed by local religious leaders, who expelled the extremists from their mosques, the group began to incorporate military cells into its structures in 2015, training recruits in military camps hidden in local forests.</p> <p class="no_name">“At first, the group’s members were mainly young people from Mocímboa da Praia, but their leaders had links with certain religious and military circles – fundamentalist Islamic cells in Tanzania, <a class="search" href="/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Kenya">Kenya</a>, <a class="search" href="/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Somalia">Somalia</a> and the Great Lakes region,” the study states.</p> <p class="no_name">The researchers also found the young people who joined the group were motivated by poverty or unemployment; the need for camaraderie; a desire for adventure; or a compulsion to create a new order in the province that would benefit them.</p> <p class="no_name">“Al-Shabaab gave young recruits from Mocímboa da Praia and other districts a sense of security, support and community – they satisfied the youth’s emotional needs,” the study found.</p> <p class="no_name">There is no reference to Islamic State or its militants being involved in the Cabo Delgado insurgency in the report.</p> <p class="no_name"><a class="search" href="/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Joseph+Hanlon">Joseph Hanlon</a>, a UK-based academic and journalist who has followed Mozambique’s development for decades, believes that poverty rather than an extremist ideology is the insurgency’s main driver.</p> <p class="no_name">In the December edition of his Mozambique Bulletin, he wrote that rather than Islamic State being the hidden hand behind the insurgency, “all the evidence is that this is a local uprising fuelled by growing poverty and inequality – most of the land has been taken [from the people] for mining so there is no free farmland, and inequality is increasing”.</p> </section></article>

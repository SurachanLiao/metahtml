<h3>Executive Summary:</h3>

<p>Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) is a Palestinian Islamist terrorist group sponsored by Iran and Syria. Founded in 1979 as an offshoot of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, PIJ is the second-largest terrorist group in Gaza today (after Hamas). The U.S. State Department claims that PIJ has fewer than 1,000 members, though in 2011 the group claimed to have at least 8,000 battle-ready fighters in Gaza.</p>

<p>PIJ is dedicated to eradicating Israel and establishing an autonomous Islamic Palestinian state in the lands currently comprising Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza. PIJ believes that the land of Palestine is consecrated for Islam, that Israel usurped Palestine, and, therefore, that Israel is an affront to God and Islam and that Palestine&#8217;s re-conquest is a holy task. Accordingly, PIJ refuses to negotiate with Israel, rejects a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and carries out numerous terror attacks against Israeli targets and interests. Unlike Hamas, PIJ does not participate in the political process or provide social services.</p>

<p>PIJ&#8217;s primary sponsor is Iran, which has provided the group with millions of dollars in direct funding, as well as training and weapons. PIJ has partnered with Iranian- and Syrian-sponsored Hezbollah in carrying out joint operations.</p>

<p>Based in Gaza until 1987, PIJ&#8217;s leadership was then exiled to Lebanon, where it reportedly began cooperating with Hezbollah and began receiving training from Iran&#8217;s Islamic Revolutionary Guard&#160;Corps.  PIJ&#8217;s leadership relocated to Syria in 1989, but left a small group in Lebanon that launched joint attacks with Hezbollah in the 1990s.  Syria has also provided military aid and sanctuary to PIJ, allowing the terrorist group&#8217;s leadership to occupy a Syrian Army base from 1989 until 2012.</p>

<p>According to the U.S. State Department, PIJ&#8217;s senior leadership continues to reside in Syria and some other leaders live in Lebanon, though most PIJ members live in Gaza.  International Arabic-language newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat reported in 2012 that PIJ&#8217;s Syria-based leadership had relocated to Iran but continued to enjoy positive ties with their Syrian patrons. However, a PIJ official denied that report, claiming &#8220;relations between [PIJ] and the Syrian government are excellent, unlike Hamas,&#8221;  whose leadership left Syria after refusing to support the Assad regime during the Syrian civil war. Official representatives of the group are also stationed elsewhere in the Middle East,  including Iran.</p>

<h3>Doctrine:</h3>

<p>PIJ seeks to create a state based on sharia (Islamic law) in all the land between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River&#8212;including Israel, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip. Like Hamas, PIJ portrays the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as a religious clash, not merely a territorial dispute. PIJ believes that the land of Palestine is consecrated for Islam and that, therefore, Israel usurped Palestine. Consequently, Israel&#8217;s very existence is an affront to God and Islam, and destroying Israel and reconquering Palestine are religious obligations.</p>

<p>In PIJ&#8217;s ideology, an Islamic state of Palestine can be established only through jihad (holy war) and the destruction of Israel. According to the &#8220;Manifesto of the Islamic Jihad in Palestine,&#8221; a document discovered by federal authorities investigating a Florida man with suspected PIJ ties, the group rejects &#8220;any peaceful solution to the Palestinian cause&#8221; and affirms &#8220;the Jihad solution and the martyrdom style as the only choice for liberation.&#8221;  Accordingly, PIJ completely rejects negotiations with Israel or a two-state solution.</p>

<p>PIJ&#8217;s founders, Fathi Shaqaqi and Abd al-Aziz Awda, drew initial inspiration from the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood. However, both men left the Brotherhood in the late 1970s, feeling the group had become too moderate and did not focus enough on the plight of the Palestinians.  Inspired by Ayatollah Khomeini&#8217;s Islamic Revolution in Iran, Shaqaqi and Awda founded PIJ on the principles Khomeini advocated, with the goal of creating an Islamic state within the land that constituted the Palestine mandate prior to Israel&#8217;s creation in 1948.</p>

<p>PIJ is dedicated singularly to violent jihad. While Hamas has engaged in indirect talks with Israel (including on prisoner exchanges and ceasefires), PIJ refuses to negotiate with Israel (though the group has participated in pan-Palestinian ceasefires negotiated by Egypt). Also unlike Hamas, PIJ generally does not provide social services.  However, in 2013, when Iran and Hamas were estranged due to Hamas&#8217;s abandonment of the Iranian-allied Assad regime in Syria&#8217;s civil war, Iran tasked PIJ with distributing $2 million in Iranian food aid in Gaza from the Imam Khomeini Relief Foundation, a Beirut-based Iranian charity. The New York Times interpreted the move as an attempt to extend Iran&#8217;s influence in Gaza while undermining Hamas and strengthening the rival PIJ.</p>

<h3>Organizational Structure:</h3>

<p>Ramadan Shallah served as PIJ&#8217;s secretary-general from 1995 until 2018. That September, PIJ&#8217;s leadership council elected Ziad al-Nakhalah to be the new secretary-general.  PIJ is governed by a leadership council. PIJ elected nine new members to the council in September 2018 in the group&#8217;s first international elections since 1980. The political council is made up of 15 members, nine of whom are elected by balloted voting. The secretary-general appoints two members, and the remaining four are approved by the council. The council represents PIJ members in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, Israeli prisons, and abroad. Elections are reportedly to be held every four years.</p>

<p>PIJ&#8217;s leadership has operated from Syria since 1989, when they relocated from Lebanon after Israel expelled them a year earlier. In 2012, rumors circulated that the group&#8217;s leadership had relocated to Iran, but a PIJ official denied that.  According to the U.S. State Department, PIJ operates primarily in the Gaza Strip but its leaders also live in Lebanon and elsewhere in the Middle East.</p>

<p>The al-Quds Brigades, PIJ&#8217;s armed wing, carries out violent attacks against Israel. The Brigades has regional staff commands. Each member within a command oversees a cell within that command&#8217;s region. The PIJ leadership issues orders and staff commanders carry out PIJ operations and coordinate cells.  The U.S. State Department claims that PIJ has fewer than 1,000 members,  though the group claimed in 2011 to have at least 8,000 battle-ready fighters in Gaza.</p>

<h3>Financing:</h3>

<p>Iran is PIJ&#8217;s primary source of financial support, according to the U.S. State Department.  A 1998 lawsuit against Iran in U.S. federal court revealed that the Islamic Republic allocated $2 million in its annual budget to PIJ.  That number has since skyrocketed&#8212;in late 2013, PIJ sources revealed that the terror group received about $3 million per month from Iran.  During the 2012 war between Israel and Hamas, PIJ fired rockets into Israeli territory and hung banners across Gaza streets with the phrase, &#8220;Thank you, Iran.&#8221;  A February 2014 report by Ali Nourizadeh, director of the Center for Iranian Studies in London, stated that Iran provides PIJ with $100 to $150 million annually.</p>

<p>In mid-2015, a senior PIJ leader said the group was suffering from its worst financial crisis in history. One PIJ leader attributed the crisis to Egypt&#8217;s closure of the smuggling tunnels beneath the Gaza-Egypt border. The same source also said Iran had cut back its funding to the group.  Iran reportedly cut funding because PIJ refused to issue a statement supporting Iran in its conflict against Saudi Arabia in Yemen.  Iran had reportedly cut PIJ&#8217;s funding by 90 percent as of January 2016. The loss in funding allegedly forced PIJ to slash salaries of its employees. According to media reports, Iran still considered PIJ a &#8220;friend&#8221; but one the country is unable to continue to support financially. PIJ&#8217;s leaders insisted the group still had good relations with Iran.</p>

<p>In May 2016, the Iranian government reportedly restored its relations with PIJ with an annual allocation of $70 million. The allocation followed visit to Tehran by a PIJ delegation the previous month.  As of August 2018, Iran reportedly transferred $30 million annually to PIJ and $70 million to Hamas.  In February 2019, PIJ spokesman Abu Hamza told Iran&#8217;s Al-Alam TV that &#8220;since the day of its establishment, the Islamic Republic [of Iran] has been supporting the Palestinian fighters financially, militarily, in raining, and in all aspects.&#8221;</p>

<p>A U.S. lawsuit filed in June 2020 alleged Qatar provided funding to Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) through three Qatari financial institutions, the Qatar Charity, Masraf Al Rayan, and Qatar National Bank. The Qatar Charity is a member of the U.S.-sanctioned Union of Good charity network. All three institutions have links to members of the Qatari royal family. The plaintiffs are friends and family members of 10 victims who died in terror attacks in Israel carried out by Hamas and PIJ. The lawsuit accuses Qatar of coopting &#8220;several institutions that it dominates and controls to funnel coveted U.S. dollars (the chosen currency of Middle East terrorist networks) to Hamas and PIJ under the false guise of charitable donations.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Recruitment and Training:</h3>

<p>Recruitment</p>

<p>Fathi Shaqaqi founded PIJ after being jailed for his involvement in the Palestine Liberation Force.  Original PIJ recruits included ex-prisoners Shaqaqi met in jail, upon their return to the Gaza Strip.  Shaqaqi was also able to recruit in the early 1980s through early PIJ member Abdul Aziz Awda, a popular preacher and professor of Islamic law. Awda attracted many to the PIJ cause through his sermons at one of Gaza&#8217;s largest mosques.</p>

<p>Since PIJ&#8217;s goal has always been to execute strategic military operations against Israel, the group has focused on targeted recruiting rather than simply gaining a large membership. For example, PIJ recruited students to demonstrate at Bir Zeit University in the early 1980s. An April 1987 incident resulted in Israeli forces opening fire on demonstrators, resulting in the death of one student.</p>

<p>PIJ&#8217;s leadership began recruiting suicide bombers in the early 1990s and originally did not permit women to serve in that role. However, PIJ officially began recruiting female suicide bombers in 2003, justifying women bombers as defending their honor against Israeli invaders. PIJ&#8217;s first female suicide bomber, a 19-year-old student named Hiba Daraghmeh, attacked a shopping mall, killing three.  The next such bomber, Hanadi Jaradat, a 29-year-old lawyer, blew herself up in a restaurant in October 2003, killing 21.  Selection and persuasion methods for women suicide bombers are similar to those employed for men. Recruiters of female suicide bombers &#8220;take advantage of the candidates&#8217; innocence, enthusiasm, personal distress, and thirst for revenge,&#8221; according to U.S. Army civilian professional Debra Zedalis.</p>

<p>In 2015, PIJ reportedly recruited 200 men between the ages of 19 and 22. According to a 2018 estimate by the U.S. State Department, PIJ has almost 1,000 members.</p>

<p>Training</p>

<p>Like other violent Islamist groups, PIJ uses training methods and tactics such as exercises in suicide operations and battlefield tactics against Israeli soldiers. PIJ has boasted of opening its ranks to children as young as six years old. PIJ &#8220;summer camps&#8221; draw as many as 10,000 participants per session.  The camps&#8217; activities include wielding AK-47s, planting land mines, and mock operations to kidnap Israeli soldiers.  PIJ spokesman Daoud Shihab describes such training of children as a way to ensure &#8220;a generation strong [in] resistance.&#8221;</p>

<p>These &#8220;Generation of Faith&#8221; camps are not restricted to combat training, however. Recruits are &#8220;educated intellectually, militarily, and politically.&#8221;  Ahmad al-Moudalal, a PIJ leader who helps to train children fighters, explained, &#8220;We are resistance movements. It is therefore normal for us to want to attract young people, instill the culture of resistance in their minds and prepare them to bear arms against the Israeli enemy.&#8221;</p>

<p>According to the U.S. State Department, members recruited in 2015 were subjected to training programs between 36 days and six months.</p>

          <h2 id="violent_history" class="threat_title" name="designations">Violent Activities</h2>
      <p>A key component of PIJ&#8217;s doctrine is the belief in violent jihad in order to liberate Palestine. PIJ has been responsible for numerous suicide attacks and hundreds of rockets against Israeli civilian centers, resulting in the deaths of dozens of Israeli civilians and soldiers. While PIJ has signed on to wider Palestinian ceasefires with Israel, it is highly unlikely the group will ever renounce terrorism, which has become an integral part of PIJ&#8217;s raison d&#8217;etre. PIJ believes its goal of creating an Islamic Palestine can be achieved only through the destruction of Israel, and so jihad has become a central tenant of PIJ&#8217;s ideology. In pursuit of its jihadist ideology, PIJ has launched numerous bombing attacks against Israeli civilian targets.</p>

Most of the rockets are intercepted or fall in open areas, but at least 50 rockets reportedly hit Israeli population centers. Israel retaliates with airstrikes on more than 350 targets in Gaza. The airstrikes kill at least 29, including fighters from Hamas and PIJ, as well as civilians, according to Hamas, though Israeli military officials say some Palestinian civilians were actually killed by misfired Hamas rockets. It is reportedly the most violent conflict between the two sides since the 2014 war. PIJ threatens to launch a full-scale war with Israel. On May 5, Israel restarts its tactic of targeted assassinations after a five-year lull and kills Hamed Ahmed al-Khodary, a senior Hamas finance official accused of funneling Iranian money to PIJ and Hamas. Egypt negotiates a new ceasefire that goes into effect that night. Hamas claims that though this round of violence is over, the conflict will continue.</li>
<li><strong>November 2019: </strong>PIJ declares it is going to war and launches more than 350 rockets into Israel beginning on November 12 after Israel assassinates Baha Abu al-Ata, PIJ&#8217;s military commander in northern Gaza. Israel responds with airstrikes targeting rocket positions along the Gaza border. At least 23 Palestinians are killed, including PIJ field commander Khaled Moawad Faraj. Israel reports injuries but no fatalities. The PIJ-Hamas joint command issues a statement that it will not allow Israel to return to a policy of targeted assassinations. Nakhalah reportedly arrives in Egypt on November 13 for ceasefire talks.</li>
<li><strong>February 2020: </strong>On February 19, a PIJ sniper team fires on a group of Israeli soldiers and police officers along the Gaza-Israel border. There are no casualties. The IDF returns fire and &#8220;identified a hit,&#8221; though the Palestinians report no casualties. On February 23, Israeli forces kill a PIJ member attempting to plant explosives along the Gaza-Israel border fence. PIJ launches more than 21 rockets into Israel from Gaza in retaliation. In response to the rocket fire, Israeli forces strike multiple PIJ targets in Syria, killing at least two PIJ members. On February 24, PIJ continues to launch dozens of rockets toward Israel&#8217;s southern communities in response. Israel&#8217;s defense systems intercept most of the rockets but there are reports of damage to homes and minor injuries. Israel launches airstrikes on PIJ rocket positions in Gaza. PIJ pledges to fire on Tel Aviv.</li>

		<img src="/sites/default/themes/bricktheme/stylesheets/images/flag-iran.jpg">Iran and the <a href="http://www.counterextremism.com/threat/islamic-revolutionary-guards-corps">Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC)</a><br>PIJ&#8217;s founders modeled the group&#8217;s Islamist objectives under the influence of Iran&#8217;s 1979 Islamic Revolution. Iran is PIJ&#8217;s primary source of financial support, according to the U.S. State Department.  A 1998 lawsuit against Iran in U.S. federal court revealed that the Islamic Republic allocated $2 million in its annual budget to PIJ.  That number has since skyrocketed&#8212;in late 2013, PIJ sources revealed that the terror group received about $3 million per month from Iran.  A February 2014 report by Ali Nourizadeh, director of the Center for Iranian Studies in London, stated that Iran provides PIJ with $100 to $150 million annually.<br><br>According to PIJ spokesman Daoud Shihab, &#8220;all of the weapons in Gaza are provided by Iran,&#8221; and &#8220;everyone knows that Iran is financing&#8221; PIJ.  In February 2014, a group of PIJ leaders, including Ramadan Shallah, made what Shihab called a &#8220;routine visit&#8221; to Tehran, which &#8220;still supports resistance factions.&#8221;<br><br>PIJ also receives aid through Iran&#8217;s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC).  The IRGC is Iran&#8217;s primary instrument for spreading the Islamic Revolution abroad and has acted as a conduit between the Iranian regime and PIJ. The IRGC provides PIJ with weapons, training, and funding. It reportedly began sending support after the PIJ was exiled to Lebanon in 1987.<br><br>Since the beginning of the 2011 Syrian civil war, Iran has reportedly increased its support of PIJ at the expense of Hamas. Unlike Hamas, Iran supports Syria&#8217;s Assad regime and PIJ has noticeably maintained its base in Damascus, Syria (although PIJ otherwise appears to be neutral).  In 2013, Iran sent $2 million worth of food aid to Gaza during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, entrusting members of PIJ with distribution. This aid bore stamps with the Palestinian flag alongside the PIJ logo and the Iranian flag.<br><br>International Arabic-language newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat reported in 2012 that PIJ&#8217;s Syria-based leadership had relocated to Iran but continued to enjoy positive ties with their Syrian patrons. However, a PIJ official denied that report, claiming &#8220;relations between [PIJ] and the Syrian government are excellent, unlike Hamas,&#8221;  whose leadership left Syria after refusing to support the Assad regime during the Syrian civil war. Official representatives of the group are also stationed elsewhere in the Middle East,  including Iran.<br><br>After a year of decreased funding, the IRGC reportedly restored its relations with PIJ in May 2016 with an annual allocation of $70 million. The allocation followed a visit to Tehran by a PIJ delegation the previous month. As part of the agreement, Qasem Soleimani, head of the IRGC&#8217;s Quds Force, reportedly appointed Khaled Mansour commander of PIJ&#8217;s Quds Brigades in Gaza.

During the first and second Palestinian intifadas, Hamas and PIJ claimed joint responsibility for a handful of attacks, including an April 9, 1995 suicide bombing that killed seven Israeli soldiers and an American.  The groups continued coordinated attacks after the end of the second intifada and after Hamas seized control of the Gaza Strip in 2007. In November 2012, for example, PIJ and Hamas jointly bombed a Tel Aviv bus, wounding 29 people.<br><br>After Hamas&#8217;s falling out with Iran in 2012, relations between Hamas and PIJ also degraded. Fighters from the two organizations clashed amid accusations that Hamas was targeting PIJ. In September 2013, however, the two terror groups announced plans to form a new joint command to create a better political atmosphere in Gaza.<br><br>In March 2014, PIJ fired a round of mortars into Israel, prompting an Israeli strike that killed three PIJ commanders. In retaliation, PIJ launched at least 130 locally made rockets into Israel as part of a military operation called Breaking the Silence, reportedly in coordination with Hamas.  PIJ and Hamas also jointly launched rockets at Israel during Israel&#8217;s summer 2014 conflict with Hamas.  PIJ and Hamas have since continued to coordinate politically and militarily.  The two groups announced in December 2019 they would join forces against Israel in the next round of conflict with the Jewish state.

There, the group reportedly began cooperating with Hezbollah and began training under Iran&#8217;s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.<br><br>In July 2014, masked members of PIJ were filmed thanking Hezbollah, particularly its Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah, for Hezbollah&#8217;s &#8220;stance and support, be it with financial, military or moral support.&#8221;
		<img src="/sites/default/files/flag-aambrigade2.jpg">Al Aqsa Martyrs&#8217; Brigade<br>PIJ and the Al Aqsa Martyrs&#8217; Brigade, the armed faction of Fatah, have carried out a handful of joint terror attacks against Israeli civilians. Examples include an April 2006 suicide bombing at a Tel Aviv sandwich stand that killed 11 people  and a January 2007 suicide attack on an Eilat bakery that killed three.

		<img src="/sites/default/themes/bricktheme/stylesheets/images/flag-syria.jpg">Syria<br>PIJ has been based in Damascus since 1989. An anonymous PIJ source told London&#8217;s Asharq Al-Awsat in July 2012 that the PIJ leadership fled Syria for Iran,  though PIJ officially denied that it had abandoned its base in Syria.  Despite Iranian support for PIJ and Syria, PIJ has otherwise appeared to remain neutral in the Syrian civil war.  According to PIJ spokesperson Daoud Shihab, &#8220;Palestine is greater than all axes, and we do not accept to be part of the [Syria] conflict.&#8221;  PIJ has, however, threatened to respond if Israel involves itself in the Syrian civil war.
		<img src="http://www.counterextremism.com/sites/default/themes/bricktheme/stylesheets/images/flag-qatar.jpg">Qatar<br>A U.S. lawsuit filed in June 2020 alleged Qatar provided funding to PIJ and Hamas through three Qatari financial institutions, the Qatar Charity, Masraf Al Rayan, and Qatar National Bank. The Qatar Charity is a member of the U.S.-sanctioned Union of Good charity network. All three institutions have links to members of the Qatari royal family. The plaintiffs are friends and family members of 10 U.S. citizens who died in terror attacks in Israel carried out by PIJ and Hamas. The lawsuit alleges Qatar Charity allegedly worked with Masraf Al Rayan bank and Qatar National Bank to forward Hamas and PIJ millions of dollars. It further accuses the Qatari government of coopting &#8220;several institutions that it dominates and controls to funnel coveted U.S. dollars (the chosen currency of Middle East terrorist networks) to Hamas and PIJ under the false guise of charitable donations.&#8221;

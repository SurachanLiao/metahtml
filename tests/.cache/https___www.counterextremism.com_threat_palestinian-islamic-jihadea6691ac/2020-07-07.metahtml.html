<h3>Executive Summary:</h3>

<p>Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) is a Palestinian Islamist terrorist group sponsored by Iran and Syria. Founded in 1979 as an offshoot of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, PIJ is the second-largest terrorist group in Gaza today (after Hamas). The U.S. State Department claims that PIJ has fewer than 1,000 members, though in 2011 the group claimed to have at least 8,000 battle-ready fighters in Gaza.</p>

<p>PIJ is dedicated to eradicating Israel and establishing an autonomous Islamic Palestinian state in the lands currently comprising Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza. PIJ believes that the land of Palestine is consecrated for Islam, that Israel usurped Palestine, and, therefore, that Israel is an affront to God and Islam and that Palestine&#8217;s re-conquest is a holy task. Accordingly, PIJ refuses to negotiate with Israel, rejects a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and carries out numerous terror attacks against Israeli targets and interests. Unlike Hamas, PIJ does not participate in the political process or provide social services.</p>

<p>PIJ&#8217;s primary sponsor is Iran, which has provided the group with millions of dollars in direct funding, as well as training and weapons. PIJ has partnered with Iranian- and Syrian-sponsored Hezbollah in carrying out joint operations.</p>

<p>Based in Gaza until 1987, PIJ&#8217;s leadership was then exiled to Lebanon, where it reportedly began cooperating with Hezbollah and began receiving training from Iran&#8217;s Islamic Revolutionary Guard&#160;Corps.<span class="footnote">Holly Fletcher, &#8220;Palestinian Islamic Jihad,&#8221; Council on Foreign Relations, April 10, 2008, <a href="http://www.cfr.org/israel/palestinian-islamic-jihad/p15984">http://www.cfr.org/israel/palestinian-islamic-jihad/p15984</a>.</span> PIJ&#8217;s leadership relocated to Syria in 1989, but left a small group in Lebanon that launched joint attacks with Hezbollah in the 1990s.<span class="footnote">Holly Fletcher, &#8220;Palestinian Islamic Jihad,&#8221; Council on Foreign Relations, April 10, 2008, <a href="http://www.cfr.org/israel/palestinian-islamic-jihad/p15984">http://www.cfr.org/israel/palestinian-islamic-jihad/p15984</a>.</span> Syria has also provided military aid and sanctuary to PIJ, allowing the terrorist group&#8217;s leadership to occupy a Syrian Army base from 1989 until 2012.<span class="footnote">&#8220;Country Reports on Terrorism 2013: Chapter 6.

<p>According to the U.S. State Department, PIJ&#8217;s senior leadership continues to reside in Syria and some other leaders live in Lebanon, though most PIJ members live in Gaza.<span class="footnote">&#8220;Country Reports on Terrorism 2013: Chapter 6.

<h3>Doctrine:</h3>

<p>PIJ seeks to create a state based on sharia (Islamic law) in all the land between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River&#8212;including Israel, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip. Like Hamas, PIJ portrays the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as a religious clash, not merely a territorial dispute. PIJ believes that the land of Palestine is consecrated for Islam and that, therefore, Israel usurped Palestine. Consequently, Israel&#8217;s very existence is an affront to God and Islam, and destroying Israel and reconquering Palestine are religious obligations.</p>

<p>In PIJ&#8217;s ideology, an Islamic state of Palestine can be established only through jihad (holy war) and the destruction of Israel. According to the &#8220;Manifesto of the Islamic Jihad in Palestine,&#8221; a document discovered by federal authorities investigating a Florida man with suspected PIJ ties, the group rejects &#8220;any peaceful solution to the Palestinian cause&#8221; and affirms &#8220;the Jihad solution and the martyrdom style as the only choice for liberation.&#8221;<span class="footnote">&#8220;Statement of the Attorney General Indictments,&#8221; U.S. Department of Justice, February 20, 2003, <a href="http://www.justice.gov/archive/ag/speeches/2003/02202003pressconference.htm">http://www.justice.gov/archive/ag/speeches/2003/02202003pressconference.htm</a>.</span> Accordingly, PIJ completely rejects negotiations with Israel or a two-state solution.</p>

<p>PIJ&#8217;s founders, Fathi Shaqaqi and Abd al-Aziz Awda, drew initial inspiration from the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood. However, both men left the Brotherhood in the late 1970s, feeling the group had become too moderate and did not focus enough on the plight of the Palestinians.<span class="footnote">Holly Fletcher, &#8220;Palestinian Islamic Jihad,&#8221; Council on Foreign Relations, April 10, 2008, <a href="http://www.cfr.org/israel/palestinian-islamic-jihad/p15984">http://www.cfr.org/israel/palestinian-islamic-jihad/p15984</a>.</span> Inspired by Ayatollah Khomeini&#8217;s Islamic Revolution in Iran, Shaqaqi and Awda founded PIJ on the principles Khomeini advocated, with the goal of creating an Islamic state within the land that constituted the Palestine mandate prior to Israel&#8217;s creation in 1948.<span class="footnote">Holly Fletcher, &#8220;Palestinian Islamic Jihad,&#8221; Council on Foreign Relations, April 10, 2008, <a href="http://www.cfr.org/israel/palestinian-islamic-jihad/p15984">http://www.cfr.org/israel/palestinian-islamic-jihad/p15984</a>.</span></p>

<p>PIJ is dedicated singularly to violent jihad. While Hamas has engaged in indirect talks with Israel (including on prisoner exchanges and ceasefires), PIJ refuses to negotiate with Israel (though the group has participated in pan-Palestinian ceasefires negotiated by Egypt). Also unlike Hamas, PIJ generally does not provide social services.<span class="footnote">Holly Fletcher, &#8220;Palestinian Islamic Jihad,&#8221; Council on Foreign Relations, April 10, 2008, <a href="http://www.cfr.org/israel/palestinian-islamic-jihad/p15984">http://www.cfr.org/israel/palestinian-islamic-jihad/p15984</a>.</span> However, in 2013, when Iran and Hamas were estranged due to Hamas&#8217;s abandonment of the Iranian-allied Assad regime in Syria&#8217;s civil war, Iran tasked PIJ with distributing $2 million in Iranian food aid in Gaza from the Imam Khomeini Relief Foundation, a Beirut-based Iranian charity. The New York Times interpreted the move as an attempt to extend Iran&#8217;s influence in Gaza while undermining Hamas and strengthening the rival PIJ.<span class="footnote">Fares Akram, &#8220;In Gaza, Iran Finds an Ally More Agreeable Than Hamas,&#8221; New York Times, July 31, 2013, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/01/world/middleeast/in-gaza-iran-finds-a-closer-ally-than-hamas.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/01/world/middleeast/in-gaza-iran-finds-a-closer-ally-than-hamas.html</a>.</span></p>

<h3>Organizational Structure:</h3>

<p>Ramadan Shallah served as PIJ&#8217;s secretary-general from 1995 until 2018. That September, PIJ&#8217;s leadership council elected Ziad al-Nakhalah to be the new secretary-general.<span class="footnote">Susan Aschoff, &#8220;Jihad Leader Emerged from Shadows of USF,&#8221;&#160;St. Petersburg Times, February 21, 2003,&#160;<a href="http://www.sptimes.com/2003/02/21/TampaBay/Jihad_leader_emerged_.shtml">http://www.sptimes.com/2003/02/21/TampaBay/Jihad_leader_emerged_.shtml</a>; Iran-backed Palestinian Islamic Jihad names new leader,&#8221; Associated Press, September 28, 2018, <a href="https://apnews.com/d14e7e6a4a68481980b6db8052853f03">https://apnews.com/d14e7e6a4a68481980b6db8052853f03</a>.</span> PIJ is governed by a leadership council. PIJ elected nine new members to the council in September 2018 in the group&#8217;s first international elections since 1980. The political council is made up of 15 members, nine of whom are elected by balloted voting. The secretary-general appoints two members, and the remaining four are approved by the council. The council represents PIJ members in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, Israeli prisons, and abroad. Elections are reportedly to be held every four years.<span class="footnote">Ahmad Abu Amer, &#8220;Has Iran&#8217;s influence increased in Palestinian arena?&#8221; Al-Monitor, October 16, 2018, <a href="https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2018/10/palestinian-islamic-jihad-elections-iran-influence.html">https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2018/10/palestinian-islamic-jihad-elections-iran-influence.html</a>.</span></p>

<p>PIJ&#8217;s leadership has operated from Syria since 1989, when they relocated from Lebanon after Israel expelled them a year earlier. In 2012, rumors circulated that the group&#8217;s leadership had relocated to Iran, but a PIJ official denied that.<span class="footnote">Holly Fletcher, &#8220;Palestinian Islamic Jihad,&#8221; Council on Foreign Relations, April 10, 2008, <a href="http://www.cfr.org/israel/palestinian-islamic-jihad/p15984">http://www.cfr.org/israel/palestinian-islamic-jihad/p15984</a>; &#8220;Islamic Jihad Leadership Relocates to Iran,&#8221; Asharq Al-Awsat (London), July 22, 2012, <a href="https://eng-archive.aawsat.com/theaawsat/news-middle-east/islamic-jihad-leadership-relocates-to-iran">https://eng-archive.aawsat.com/theaawsat/news-middle-east/islamic-jihad-leadership-relocates-to-iran</a>.</span> According to the U.S. State Department, PIJ operates primarily in the Gaza Strip but its leaders also live in Lebanon and elsewhere in the Middle East.<span class="footnote">&#8220;Country Reports on Terrorism 2017,&#8221; U.S. Department of State, September 2018, 322, <a href="https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/283100.pdf">https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/283100.pdf</a>.</span></p>

<p>The al-Quds Brigades, PIJ&#8217;s armed wing, carries out violent attacks against Israel. The Brigades has regional staff commands. Each member within a command oversees a cell within that command&#8217;s region.

The plaintiffs are friends and family members of 10 victims who died in terror attacks in Israel carried out by Hamas and PIJ.

<h3>Recruitment and Training:</h3>

<p>Recruitment</p>

<p>Fathi Shaqaqi founded PIJ after being jailed for his involvement in the Palestine Liberation Force.<span class="footnote">Stephen E. Atkins, Encyclopedia of Modern Worldwide Extremists and Extremist Groups (Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2004), 239.</span> Original PIJ recruits included ex-prisoners Shaqaqi met in jail, upon their return to the Gaza Strip.<span class="footnote">Stephen E. Atkins, Encyclopedia of Modern Worldwide Extremists and Extremist Groups (Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2004), 239.</span> Shaqaqi was also able to recruit in the early 1980s through early PIJ member Abdul Aziz Awda, a popular preacher and professor of Islamic law. Awda attracted many to the PIJ cause through his sermons at one of Gaza&#8217;s largest mosques.<span class="footnote">Stephen E. Atkins, Encyclopedia of Modern Worldwide Extremists and Extremist Groups (Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2004), 239.</span></p>

<p>Since PIJ&#8217;s goal has always been to execute strategic military operations against Israel, the group has focused on targeted recruiting rather than simply gaining a large membership. For example, PIJ recruited students to demonstrate at Bir Zeit University in the early 1980s. An April 1987 incident resulted in Israeli forces opening fire on demonstrators, resulting in the death of one student.<span class="footnote">Stephen E. Atkins, Encyclopedia of Modern Worldwide Extremists and Extremist Groups (Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2004), 239.</span></p>

<p>PIJ&#8217;s leadership began recruiting suicide bombers in the early 1990s and originally did not permit women to serve in that role. However, PIJ officially began recruiting female suicide bombers in 2003, justifying women bombers as defending their honor against Israeli invaders. PIJ&#8217;s first female suicide bomber, a 19-year-old student named Hiba Daraghmeh, attacked a shopping mall, killing three.<span class="footnote">Debra D. Zedalis, &#8220;Female Suicide Bombers,&#8221; Strategic Studies Institute, June 2004, <a href="http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/pub408.pdf">http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/pub408.pdf</a>.</span> The next such bomber, Hanadi Jaradat, a 29-year-old lawyer, blew herself up in a restaurant in October 2003, killing 21.<span class="footnote">Debra D. Zedalis, &#8220;Female Suicide Bombers,&#8221; Strategic Studies Institute, June 2004, <a href="http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/pub408.pdf">http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/pub408.pdf</a>.</span> Selection and persuasion methods for women suicide bombers are similar to those employed for men. Recruiters of female suicide bombers &#8220;take advantage of the candidates&#8217; innocence, enthusiasm, personal distress, and thirst for revenge,&#8221; according to U.S. Army civilian professional Debra Zedalis.<span class="footnote">Debra D. Zedalis, &#8220;Female Suicide Bombers,&#8221; Strategic Studies Institute, June 2004, <a href="http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/pub408.pdf">http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/pub408.pdf</a>.</span></p>

<p>In 2015, PIJ reportedly recruited 200 men between the ages of 19 and 22. According to a 2018 estimate by the U.S. State Department, PIJ has almost 1,000 members.<span class="footnote">&#8220;Country Reports on Terrorism 2017,&#8221; U.S. Department of State, September 2018, 322, <a href="https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/283100.pdf">https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/283100.pdf</a>.</span></p>

<p>Training</p>

<p>Like other violent Islamist groups, PIJ uses training methods and tactics such as exercises in suicide operations and battlefield tactics against Israeli soldiers. PIJ has boasted of opening its ranks to children as young as six years old. PIJ &#8220;summer camps&#8221; draw as many as 10,000 participants per session.<span class="footnote">Harriet Sherwood, &#8220;Playing Politics: Summer Camp for Gaza&#8217;s Children,&#8221; Guardian (London), July 29, 2010, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/29/gaza-children-militant-summer-camps">http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/29/gaza-children-militant-summer-camps</a>.</span> The camps&#8217; activities include wielding AK-47s, planting land mines, and mock operations to kidnap Israeli soldiers.<span class="footnote">&#8220;Following Hamas Lead, PIJ Opens Camps to Train Child Soldiers,&#8221; Tower, June 13, 2013, <a href="http://www.thetower.org/following-hamas-lead-palestinian-islamic-jihad-opens-camps-to-train-child-soldiers/">http://www.thetower.org/following-hamas-lead-palestinian-islamic-jihad-opens-camps-to-train-child-soldiers/</a>.</span> PIJ spokesman Daoud Shihab describes such training of children as a way to ensure &#8220;a generation strong [in] resistance.&#8221;<span class="footnote">&#8220;Following Hamas Lead, PIJ Opens Camps to Train Child Soldiers,&#8221; Tower, June 13, 2013, <a href="http://www.thetower.org/following-hamas-lead-palestinian-islamic-jihad-opens-camps-to-train-child-soldiers/">http://www.thetower.org/following-hamas-lead-palestinian-islamic-jihad-opens-camps-to-train-child-soldiers/</a>.</span></p>

<p>These &#8220;Generation of Faith&#8221; camps are not restricted to combat training, however. Recruits are &#8220;educated intellectually, militarily, and politically.&#8221;<span class="footnote">Hazem Balousha, &#8220;Islamic Jihad, Hamas Hold Military Training Camps for Children,&#8221; Al-Monitor, June 21, 2013, <a href="http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2013/06/gaza-summer-camps-children-islamic-jihad.html#">http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2013/06/gaza-summer-camps-children-islamic-jihad.html#</a>.</span> Ahmad al-Moudalal, a PIJ leader who helps to train children fighters, explained, &#8220;We are resistance movements. It is therefore normal for us to want to attract young people, instill the culture of resistance in their minds and prepare them to bear arms against the Israeli enemy.&#8221;<span class="footnote">Hazem Balousha, &#8220;Islamic Jihad, Hamas Hold Military Training Camps for Children,&#8221; Al-Monitor, June 21, 2013, <a href="http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2013/06/gaza-summer-camps-children-islamic-jihad.html#">http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2013/06/gaza-summer-camps-children-islamic-jihad.html#</a>.</span></p>

<p>According to the U.S. State Department, members recruited in 2015 were subjected to training programs between 36 days and six months.<span class="footnote">&#8220;Country Reports on Terrorism 2017,&#8221; U.S. Department of State, September 2018, 322, <a href="https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/283100.pdf">https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/283100.pdf</a>.</span></p>

      <section class="violent_history"><p>A key component of PIJ&#8217;s doctrine is the belief in violent jihad in order to liberate Palestine. PIJ has been responsible for numerous suicide attacks and hundreds of rockets against Israeli civilian centers, resulting in the deaths of dozens of Israeli civilians and soldiers. While PIJ has signed on to wider Palestinian ceasefires with Israel, it is highly unlikely the group will ever renounce terrorism, which has become an integral part of PIJ&#8217;s raison d&#8217;etre. PIJ believes its goal of creating an Islamic Palestine can be achieved only through the destruction of Israel, and so jihad has become a central tenant of PIJ&#8217;s ideology. In pursuit of its jihadist ideology, PIJ has launched numerous bombing attacks against Israeli civilian targets.</p>

<li>May 3-5, 2019: On May 3, PIJ snipers wound two Israeli soldiers along the Gaza border during weekly protests. Israeli forces retaliate with a strike on a Hamas post near the border, killing two. PIJ and Hamas launch almost 700 rockets into Israel over the course of three days, killing at least four Israeli civilians and wounding dozens more. Most of the rockets are intercepted or fall in open areas, but at least 50 rockets reportedly hit Israeli population centers. Israel retaliates with airstrikes on more than 350 targets in Gaza. The airstrikes kill at least 29, including fighters from Hamas and PIJ, as well as civilians, according to Hamas, though Israeli military officials say some Palestinian civilians were actually killed by misfired Hamas rockets. It is reportedly the most violent conflict between the two sides since the 2014 war. PIJ threatens to launch a full-scale war with Israel. On May 5, Israel restarts its tactic of targeted assassinations after a five-year lull and kills Hamed Ahmed al-Khodary, a senior Hamas finance official accused of funneling Iranian money to PIJ and Hamas. Egypt negotiates a new ceasefire that goes into effect that night. Hamas claims that though this round of violence is over, the conflict will continue.<span class="footnote">Jacob Magid, &#8220;Two soldiers wounded by gunfire on Gaza border; IDF hits Hamas post, killing 2 ,&#8221; Times of Israel, May 3, 2019, <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/idf-nabs-gazan-armed-with-knife-who-breached-border-fence-into-israel/">https://www.timesofisrael.com/idf-nabs-gazan-armed-with-knife-who-breached-border-fence-into-israel/</a>; &#8220;As ceasefire goes into effect, Netanyahu says Gaza campaign not over,&#8221; Times of Israel, May 6, 2019, <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/as-ceasefire-goes-into-effect-netanyahu-says-gaza-campaign-not-over/">https://www.timesofisrael.com/as-ceasefire-goes-into-effect-netanyahu-says-gaza-campaign-not-over/</a>; &#8220;Islamic Jihad threatens to escalate Gaza violence to all-out war,&#8221; Times of Israel, May 5, 2019, <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/islamic-jihad-threatens-to-escalate-gaza-violence-to-all-out-war/">https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/islamic-jihad-threatens-to-escalate-gaza-violence-to-all-out-war/</a>; Felicia Schwartz, &#8220;Gaza, Israel Reach Cease-Fire After Days of Deadly Clashes,&#8221; Wall Street Journal, May 6, 2019, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/gaza-israel-reach-cease-fire-after-days-of-deadly-clashes-11557133042?mod=hp_lead_pos5">https://www.wsj.com/articles/gaza-israel-reach-cease-fire-after-days-of-deadly-clashes-11557133042?mod=hp_lead_pos5</a>; Richard Spencer, &#8220;Israel and Gaza reach ceasefire after days of violence,&#8221; The Times (London), May 6, 2019, <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/world/israel-on-brink-of-war-after-gaza-rocket-strikes-g3mh57md9">https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/world/israel-on-brink-of-war-after-gaza-rocket-strikes-g3mh57md9</a>; &#8220;The Latest: Hamas says it doesn&#8217;t want a new war with Israel,&#8221; Associated Press, May 5, 2019, <a href="https://www.apnews.com/7965a592ba4b4e79ad93276ff97a1159">https://www.apnews.com/7965a592ba4b4e79ad93276ff97a1159</a>.</span></li>

<h3>Executive Summary:</h3>

<p>Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) is a Palestinian Islamist terrorist group sponsored by Iran and Syria. Founded in 1979 as an offshoot of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, PIJ is the second-largest terrorist group in Gaza today (after Hamas). The U.S. State Department claims that PIJ has fewer than 1,000 members, though in 2011 the group claimed to have at least 8,000 battle-ready fighters in Gaza.</p>

<p>PIJ is dedicated to eradicating Israel and establishing an autonomous Islamic Palestinian state in the lands currently comprising Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza. PIJ believes that the land of Palestine is consecrated for Islam, that Israel usurped Palestine, and, therefore, that Israel is an affront to God and Islam and that Palestine&#8217;s re-conquest is a holy task. Accordingly, PIJ refuses to negotiate with Israel, rejects a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and carries out numerous terror attacks against Israeli targets and interests. Unlike Hamas, PIJ does not participate in the political process or provide social services.</p>

<p>PIJ&#8217;s primary sponsor is Iran, which has provided the group with millions of dollars in direct funding, as well as training and weapons. PIJ has partnered with Iranian- and Syrian-sponsored Hezbollah in carrying out joint operations.</p>

<p>Based in Gaza until 1987, PIJ&#8217;s leadership was then exiled to Lebanon, where it reportedly began cooperating with Hezbollah and began receiving training from Iran&#8217;s Islamic Revolutionary Guard&#160;Corps.<span class="footnote">Holly Fletcher, &#8220;Palestinian Islamic Jihad,&#8221; Council on Foreign Relations, April 10, 2008, <a href="http://www.cfr.org/israel/palestinian-islamic-jihad/p15984">http://www.cfr.org/israel/palestinian-islamic-jihad/p15984</a>.</span> PIJ&#8217;s leadership relocated to Syria in 1989, but left a small group in Lebanon that launched joint attacks with Hezbollah in the 1990s.<span class="footnote">Holly Fletcher, &#8220;Palestinian Islamic Jihad,&#8221; Council on Foreign Relations, April 10, 2008, <a href="http://www.cfr.org/israel/palestinian-islamic-jihad/p15984">http://www.cfr.org/israel/palestinian-islamic-jihad/p15984</a>.</span> Syria has also provided military aid and sanctuary to PIJ, allowing the terrorist group&#8217;s leadership to occupy a Syrian Army base from 1989 until 2012.<span class="footnote">&#8220;Country Reports on Terrorism 2013: Chapter 6.

<p>According to the U.S. State Department, PIJ&#8217;s senior leadership continues to reside in Syria and some other leaders live in Lebanon, though most PIJ members live in Gaza.<span class="footnote">&#8220;Country Reports on Terrorism 2013: Chapter 6.

<h3>Doctrine:</h3>

<p>PIJ seeks to create a state based on sharia (Islamic law) in all the land between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River&#8212;including Israel, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip. Like Hamas, PIJ portrays the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as a religious clash, not merely a territorial dispute. PIJ believes that the land of Palestine is consecrated for Islam and that, therefore, Israel usurped Palestine. Consequently, Israel&#8217;s very existence is an affront to God and Islam, and destroying Israel and reconquering Palestine are religious obligations.</p>

<p>In PIJ&#8217;s ideology, an Islamic state of Palestine can be established only through jihad (holy war) and the destruction of Israel. According to the &#8220;Manifesto of the Islamic Jihad in Palestine,&#8221; a document discovered by federal authorities investigating a Florida man with suspected PIJ ties, the group rejects &#8220;any peaceful solution to the Palestinian cause&#8221; and affirms &#8220;the Jihad solution and the martyrdom style as the only choice for liberation.&#8221;<span class="footnote">&#8220;Statement of the Attorney General Indictments,&#8221; U.S. Department of Justice, February 20, 2003, <a href="http://www.justice.gov/archive/ag/speeches/2003/02202003pressconference.htm">http://www.justice.gov/archive/ag/speeches/2003/02202003pressconference.htm</a>.</span> Accordingly, PIJ completely rejects negotiations with Israel or a two-state solution.</p>

<p>PIJ&#8217;s founders, Fathi Shaqaqi and Abd al-Aziz Awda, drew initial inspiration from the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood. However, both men left the Brotherhood in the late 1970s, feeling the group had become too moderate and did not focus enough on the plight of the Palestinians.<span class="footnote">Holly Fletcher, &#8220;Palestinian Islamic Jihad,&#8221; Council on Foreign Relations, April 10, 2008, <a href="http://www.cfr.org/israel/palestinian-islamic-jihad/p15984">http://www.cfr.org/israel/palestinian-islamic-jihad/p15984</a>.</span> Inspired by Ayatollah Khomeini&#8217;s Islamic Revolution in Iran, Shaqaqi and Awda founded PIJ on the principles Khomeini advocated, with the goal of creating an Islamic state within the land that constituted the Palestine mandate prior to Israel&#8217;s creation in 1948.<span class="footnote">Holly Fletcher, &#8220;Palestinian Islamic Jihad,&#8221; Council on Foreign Relations, April 10, 2008, <a href="http://www.cfr.org/israel/palestinian-islamic-jihad/p15984">http://www.cfr.org/israel/palestinian-islamic-jihad/p15984</a>.</span></p>

<p>PIJ is dedicated singularly to violent jihad. While Hamas has engaged in indirect talks with Israel (including on prisoner exchanges and ceasefires), PIJ refuses to negotiate with Israel (though the group has participated in pan-Palestinian ceasefires negotiated by Egypt). Also unlike Hamas, PIJ generally does not provide social services.<span class="footnote">Holly Fletcher, &#8220;Palestinian Islamic Jihad,&#8221; Council on Foreign Relations, April 10, 2008, <a href="http://www.cfr.org/israel/palestinian-islamic-jihad/p15984">http://www.cfr.org/israel/palestinian-islamic-jihad/p15984</a>.</span> However, in 2013, when Iran and Hamas were estranged due to Hamas&#8217;s abandonment of the Iranian-allied Assad regime in Syria&#8217;s civil war, Iran tasked PIJ with distributing $2 million in Iranian food aid in Gaza from the Imam Khomeini Relief Foundation, a Beirut-based Iranian charity. The New York Times interpreted the move as an attempt to extend Iran&#8217;s influence in Gaza while undermining Hamas and strengthening the rival PIJ.<span class="footnote">Fares Akram, &#8220;In Gaza, Iran Finds an Ally More Agreeable Than Hamas,&#8221; New York Times, July 31, 2013, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/01/world/middleeast/in-gaza-iran-finds-a-closer-ally-than-hamas.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/01/world/middleeast/in-gaza-iran-finds-a-closer-ally-than-hamas.html</a>.</span></p>

<h3>Organizational Structure:</h3>

<p>Ramadan Shallah served as PIJ&#8217;s secretary-general from 1995 until 2018. That September, PIJ&#8217;s leadership council elected Ziad al-Nakhalah to be the new secretary-general.<span class="footnote">Susan Aschoff, &#8220;Jihad Leader Emerged from Shadows of USF,&#8221;&#160;St. Petersburg Times, February 21, 2003,&#160;<a href="http://www.sptimes.com/2003/02/21/TampaBay/Jihad_leader_emerged_.shtml">http://www.sptimes.com/2003/02/21/TampaBay/Jihad_leader_emerged_.shtml</a>; Iran-backed Palestinian Islamic Jihad names new leader,&#8221; Associated Press, September 28, 2018, <a href="https://apnews.com/d14e7e6a4a68481980b6db8052853f03">https://apnews.com/d14e7e6a4a68481980b6db8052853f03</a>.</span> PIJ is governed by a leadership council. PIJ elected nine new members to the council in September 2018 in the group&#8217;s first international elections since 1980. The political council is made up of 15 members, nine of whom are elected by balloted voting. The secretary-general appoints two members, and the remaining four are approved by the council. The council represents PIJ members in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, Israeli prisons, and abroad. Elections are reportedly to be held every four years.<span class="footnote">Ahmad Abu Amer, &#8220;Has Iran&#8217;s influence increased in Palestinian arena?&#8221; Al-Monitor, October 16, 2018, <a href="https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2018/10/palestinian-islamic-jihad-elections-iran-influence.html">https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2018/10/palestinian-islamic-jihad-elections-iran-influence.html</a>.</span></p>

<p>PIJ&#8217;s leadership has operated from Syria since 1989, when they relocated from Lebanon after Israel expelled them a year earlier. In 2012, rumors circulated that the group&#8217;s leadership had relocated to Iran, but a PIJ official denied that.<span class="footnote">Holly Fletcher, &#8220;Palestinian Islamic Jihad,&#8221; Council on Foreign Relations, April 10, 2008, <a href="http://www.cfr.org/israel/palestinian-islamic-jihad/p15984">http://www.cfr.org/israel/palestinian-islamic-jihad/p15984</a>; &#8220;Islamic Jihad Leadership Relocates to Iran,&#8221; Asharq Al-Awsat (London), July 22, 2012, <a href="https://eng-archive.aawsat.com/theaawsat/news-middle-east/islamic-jihad-leadership-relocates-to-iran">https://eng-archive.aawsat.com/theaawsat/news-middle-east/islamic-jihad-leadership-relocates-to-iran</a>.</span> According to the U.S. State Department, PIJ operates primarily in the Gaza Strip but its leaders also live in Lebanon and elsewhere in the Middle East.<span class="footnote">&#8220;Country Reports on Terrorism 2017,&#8221; U.S. Department of State, September 2018, 322, <a href="https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/283100.pdf">https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/283100.pdf</a>.</span></p>

<p>The al-Quds Brigades, PIJ&#8217;s armed wing, carries out violent attacks against Israel. The Brigades has regional staff commands. Each member within a command oversees a cell within that command&#8217;s region.

<h3>Financing:</h3>

<p>Iran is PIJ&#8217;s primary source of financial support, according to the U.S. State Department.<span class="footnote">&#8220;Country Reports on Terrorism 2013: Chapter 6.

<p>In mid-2015, a senior PIJ leader said the group was suffering from its worst financial crisis in history.

<p>A U.S. lawsuit filed in June 2020 alleged Qatar provided funding to Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) through three Qatari financial institutions, the Qatar Charity, Masraf Al Rayan, and Qatar National Bank.

The plaintiffs are friends and family members of 10 victims who died in terror attacks in Israel carried out by Hamas and PIJ. The lawsuit accuses Qatar of coopting &#8220;several institutions that it dominates and controls to funnel coveted U.S. dollars (the chosen currency of Middle East terrorist networks) to Hamas and PIJ under the false guise of charitable donations.&#8221;<span class="footnote">Ray Hanania, &#8220;Lawsuit names Qatar&#8217;s royal family in killings of 10 Americans in Israel,&#8221; Arab News, June 11, 2020, <a href="https://www.arabnews.com/node/1688051/middle-east">https://www.arabnews.com/node/1688051/middle-east</a>; Adam Kredo, &#8220;Lawsuit Alleges Qatar Secretly Financed Terror Attacks that Killed Americans,&#8221; Washington Free Beacon, June 10, 2020, <a href="https://freebeacon.com/national-security/lawsuit-alleges-qatar-secretly-financed-terror-attacks-that-killed-americans/">https://freebeacon.com/national-security/lawsuit-alleges-qatar-secretly-financed-terror-attacks-that-killed-americans/</a>.</span></p>

<h3>Recruitment and Training:</h3>

<p>Recruitment</p>

<p>Fathi Shaqaqi founded PIJ after being jailed for his involvement in the Palestine Liberation Force.<span class="footnote">Stephen E. Atkins, Encyclopedia of Modern Worldwide Extremists and Extremist Groups (Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2004), 239.</span> Original PIJ recruits included ex-prisoners Shaqaqi met in jail, upon their return to the Gaza Strip.<span class="footnote">Stephen E. Atkins, Encyclopedia of Modern Worldwide Extremists and Extremist Groups (Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2004), 239.</span> Shaqaqi was also able to recruit in the early 1980s through early PIJ member Abdul Aziz Awda, a popular preacher and professor of Islamic law. Awda attracted many to the PIJ cause through his sermons at one of Gaza&#8217;s largest mosques.<span class="footnote">Stephen E. Atkins, Encyclopedia of Modern Worldwide Extremists and Extremist Groups (Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2004), 239.</span></p>

<p>Since PIJ&#8217;s goal has always been to execute strategic military operations against Israel, the group has focused on targeted recruiting rather than simply gaining a large membership. For example, PIJ recruited students to demonstrate at Bir Zeit University in the early 1980s. An April 1987 incident resulted in Israeli forces opening fire on demonstrators, resulting in the death of one student.<span class="footnote">Stephen E. Atkins, Encyclopedia of Modern Worldwide Extremists and Extremist Groups (Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2004), 239.</span></p>

<p>PIJ&#8217;s leadership began recruiting suicide bombers in the early 1990s and originally did not permit women to serve in that role. However, PIJ officially began recruiting female suicide bombers in 2003, justifying women bombers as defending their honor against Israeli invaders. PIJ&#8217;s first female suicide bomber, a 19-year-old student named Hiba Daraghmeh, attacked a shopping mall, killing three.<span class="footnote">Debra D. Zedalis, &#8220;Female Suicide Bombers,&#8221; Strategic Studies Institute, June 2004, <a href="http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/pub408.pdf">http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/pub408.pdf</a>.</span> The next such bomber, Hanadi Jaradat, a 29-year-old lawyer, blew herself up in a restaurant in October 2003, killing 21.<span class="footnote">Debra D. Zedalis, &#8220;Female Suicide Bombers,&#8221; Strategic Studies Institute, June 2004, <a href="http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/pub408.pdf">http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/pub408.pdf</a>.</span> Selection and persuasion methods for women suicide bombers are similar to those employed for men. Recruiters of female suicide bombers &#8220;take advantage of the candidates&#8217; innocence, enthusiasm, personal distress, and thirst for revenge,&#8221; according to U.S. Army civilian professional Debra Zedalis.<span class="footnote">Debra D. Zedalis, &#8220;Female Suicide Bombers,&#8221; Strategic Studies Institute, June 2004, <a href="http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/pub408.pdf">http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/pub408.pdf</a>.</span></p>

<p>In 2015, PIJ reportedly recruited 200 men between the ages of 19 and 22. According to a 2018 estimate by the U.S. State Department, PIJ has almost 1,000 members.<span class="footnote">&#8220;Country Reports on Terrorism 2017,&#8221; U.S. Department of State, September 2018, 322, <a href="https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/283100.pdf">https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/283100.pdf</a>.</span></p>

<p>Training</p>

<p>Like other violent Islamist groups, PIJ uses training methods and tactics such as exercises in suicide operations and battlefield tactics against Israeli soldiers. PIJ has boasted of opening its ranks to children as young as six years old. PIJ &#8220;summer camps&#8221; draw as many as 10,000 participants per session.<span class="footnote">Harriet Sherwood, &#8220;Playing Politics: Summer Camp for Gaza&#8217;s Children,&#8221; Guardian (London), July 29, 2010, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/29/gaza-children-militant-summer-camps">http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/29/gaza-children-militant-summer-camps</a>.</span> The camps&#8217; activities include wielding AK-47s, planting land mines, and mock operations to kidnap Israeli soldiers.<span class="footnote">&#8220;Following Hamas Lead, PIJ Opens Camps to Train Child Soldiers,&#8221; Tower, June 13, 2013, <a href="http://www.thetower.org/following-hamas-lead-palestinian-islamic-jihad-opens-camps-to-train-child-soldiers/">http://www.thetower.org/following-hamas-lead-palestinian-islamic-jihad-opens-camps-to-train-child-soldiers/</a>.</span> PIJ spokesman Daoud Shihab describes such training of children as a way to ensure &#8220;a generation strong [in] resistance.&#8221;<span class="footnote">&#8220;Following Hamas Lead, PIJ Opens Camps to Train Child Soldiers,&#8221; Tower, June 13, 2013, <a href="http://www.thetower.org/following-hamas-lead-palestinian-islamic-jihad-opens-camps-to-train-child-soldiers/">http://www.thetower.org/following-hamas-lead-palestinian-islamic-jihad-opens-camps-to-train-child-soldiers/</a>.</span></p>

<p>These &#8220;Generation of Faith&#8221; camps are not restricted to combat training, however. Recruits are &#8220;educated intellectually, militarily, and politically.&#8221;<span class="footnote">Hazem Balousha, &#8220;Islamic Jihad, Hamas Hold Military Training Camps for Children,&#8221; Al-Monitor, June 21, 2013, <a href="http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2013/06/gaza-summer-camps-children-islamic-jihad.html#">http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2013/06/gaza-summer-camps-children-islamic-jihad.html#</a>.</span> Ahmad al-Moudalal, a PIJ leader who helps to train children fighters, explained, &#8220;We are resistance movements. It is therefore normal for us to want to attract young people, instill the culture of resistance in their minds and prepare them to bear arms against the Israeli enemy.&#8221;<span class="footnote">Hazem Balousha, &#8220;Islamic Jihad, Hamas Hold Military Training Camps for Children,&#8221; Al-Monitor, June 21, 2013, <a href="http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2013/06/gaza-summer-camps-children-islamic-jihad.html#">http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2013/06/gaza-summer-camps-children-islamic-jihad.html#</a>.</span></p>

<p>According to the U.S. State Department, members recruited in 2015 were subjected to training programs between 36 days and six months.<span class="footnote">&#8220;Country Reports on Terrorism 2017,&#8221; U.S. Department of State, September 2018, 322, <a href="https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/283100.pdf">https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/283100.pdf</a>.</span></p>

PIJ has been responsible for numerous suicide attacks and hundreds of rockets against Israeli civilian centers, resulting in the deaths of dozens of Israeli civilians and soldiers. While PIJ has signed on to wider Palestinian ceasefires with Israel, it is highly unlikely the group will ever renounce terrorism, which has become an integral part of PIJ&#8217;s raison d&#8217;etre. PIJ believes its goal of creating an Islamic Palestine can be achieved only through the destruction of Israel, and so jihad has become a central tenant of PIJ&#8217;s ideology. In pursuit of its jihadist ideology, PIJ has launched numerous bombing attacks against Israeli civilian targets.</p><ul>

		<td>Qatar A U.S. lawsuit filed in June 2020 alleged Qatar provided funding to PIJ and Hamas through three Qatari financial institutions, the Qatar Charity, Masraf Al Rayan, and Qatar National Bank. The Qatar Charity is a member of the U.S.-sanctioned Union of Good charity network. All three institutions have links to members of the Qatari royal family. The plaintiffs are friends and family members of 10 U.S. citizens who died in terror attacks in Israel carried out by PIJ and Hamas. The lawsuit alleges Qatar Charity allegedly worked with Masraf Al Rayan bank and Qatar National Bank to forward Hamas and PIJ millions of dollars. It further accuses the Qatari government of coopting &#8220;several institutions that it dominates and controls to funnel coveted U.S. dollars (the chosen currency of Middle East terrorist networks) to Hamas and PIJ under the false guise of charitable donations.&#8221;<span class="footnote">Ray Hanania, &#8220;Lawsuit names Qatar&#8217;s royal family in killings of 10 Americans in Israel,&#8221; Arab News, June 11, 2020, <a href="https://www.arabnews.com/node/1688051/middle-east">https://www.arabnews.com/node/1688051/middle-east</a>; Adam Kredo, &#8220;Lawsuit Alleges Qatar Secretly Financed Terror Attacks that Killed Americans,&#8221; Washington Free Beacon, June 10, 2020, <a href="https://freebeacon.com/national-security/lawsuit-alleges-qatar-secretly-financed-terror-attacks-that-killed-americans/">https://freebeacon.com/national-security/lawsuit-alleges-qatar-secretly-financed-terror-attacks-that-killed-americans/</a>.</span></td>

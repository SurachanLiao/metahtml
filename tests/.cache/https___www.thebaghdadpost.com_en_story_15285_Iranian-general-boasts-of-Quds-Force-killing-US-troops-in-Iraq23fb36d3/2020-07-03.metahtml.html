deputy commander of Iran&#8217;s notorious Quds Force bragged at a recent ceremony
that his operatives have killed more Americans than US troops have killed
Iranian fighters, the Washington Times reported.</p><p>
Brig. Gen. Ismail Ghaani
was referring to Iran&#8217;s major intervention in the Iraq war to supply Shiite
militias with supercharged explosives that could penetrate US armored vehicles.
The Pentagon has estimated the Quds Force, an arm of the Islamic Revolutionary
Guard Corps, killed 500 Americans that way.</p><p>&#8220;Americans have suffered
more losses from us then we have suffered losses from them,&#8221; Gen. Ghaani said,
according to an article by Admad Majidyar, director of the Iran Observed
Project at the Middle East Institute.</p><p>Majidyar wrote that the
boasting came at a ceremony honoring the &#8220;martyred of the defenders of shrines&#8221;
&#8212; Iran&#8217;s term for the militias it financed and trained in Iraq to fight the ISIS
and in Syria to support President Bashar Assad.</p><p>An Iranian opposition group
has accused Iran of committing atrocities in Syria, particularly in the city of
Aleppo, where thousands died under constant attacks by Syrian, Russian and Iranian
forces.</p><p>&#8220;This, of course, is not
only a confession but also outright bragging about how the Quds Force murdered
Americans in Iraq,&#8221; said Michael Rubin, a Middle East analyst at the American
Enterprise Institute. &#8220;It was the Quds Force, after all, that smuggled in
explosively formed, armor-penetrating projectiles into Iraq for insurgents to
incorporate in improved explosive devices.</p><p>Gen.
Ghaani repeated Tehran propaganda that America carried out the 9/11 attacks in
New York and the Pentagon, not al Qaeda.</p><p>&#8220;America, under the pretext
of Sept. 11 attacks, which it carried out itself, invaded Afghanistan and
mobilized young Muslims and deployed them to Afghanistan so that they can later
attack Iran,&#8221; he said.</p><p>The Quds Force leader
contended that the US has spent $6 trillion to curtail Iran, but failed.</p><p>The ceremony occurred amid Iranian expansion in the region,
military moves financed in part by the 2015 nuclear deal with the US. The Obama
administration lifted economic sanctions that freed billions of dollars in
frozen assets and directly delivered $1.4 billion in cash.</p><p>Rubin writes in Commentary
Magazine that the largesse prompted Tehran to increase the Quds Force budget by
$300 million.</p><p>&#8220;Unilateral surrender in
the name of diplomacy does tend to embolden enemies,&#8221; Rubin said.</p><p>Quds Force stands as the
ruling mullahs&#8217; expeditionary special operations force that, working with
Lebanese Hezbollah, another Iran-created group, fought anti-Assad rebels in
Syria.</p></article>

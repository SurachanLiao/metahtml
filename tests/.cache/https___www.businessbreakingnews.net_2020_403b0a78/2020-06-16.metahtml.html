When the friend first read Tolstoy&#8217;s novel as a young man, he was enthralled by Anna&#8217;s tragic fate. Re-reading it in middle age, he appreciated Levin&#8217;s efforts to simplify matters and live off the land. When he read it again years later, he was apt to throw up his hands at the shenanigans of all these young people. &#8230; <a href="https://www.businessbreakingnews.net/2020/05/how-re-reading-reveals-more-about-the-reader-than-the-book/" class="more-link">[Read more...] <span class="screen-reader-text">about How re-reading reveals more about the reader than the book</span></a></p></article><article class="post-74062440 post type-post status-publish format-standard entry"><p>Fine dines have evolved DIY kits which, most believe, will find customers even after the lockdown opens.

So, to understand this process better, I tried to understand how Draupadi and Radha, popular pan-Indian figures, had evolved over the centuries. And it became clear that they were also subjected to a form of censorship over time, their idiosyncrasies and transgressively assertive challenges morphed into a much more acceptable vision of Indian womanhood. &#8230; <a href="https://www.businessbreakingnews.net/2020/05/mythological-women-revered-stories-of-historical-women-censored-in-india-says-historian-ira-mukhoty/" class="more-link">[Read more...] <span class="screen-reader-text">about Mythological women revered, stories of historical women censored in India, says historian Ira Mukhoty</span></a></p></article><article class="post-74068467 post type-post status-publish format-standard entry"><p>Road to Credit Guarantee CorporationThe government formed a working group comprising custodians of the nationalised banks. In its report, the group said while the objective of giving loans to neglected areas was noteworthy, it will also lead to risks for the banking system. The best way would be to pool these risks and cover them under a common guarantee scheme. To avoid moral hazard, guarantees would be capped at 75 percent of the losses so that banks do proper loan appraisal. The guarantee fee was pegged at 0.25 percent of the loans, open to review. Interestingly, the government credit guarantee scheme had a fee of 0.1 percent for SSIs. &#8230; <a href="https://www.businessbreakingnews.net/2020/05/credit-guarantees-of-1970s-make-a-comeback/" class="more-link">[Read more...] <span class="screen-reader-text">about Credit guarantees of 1970s make a comeback</span></a></p></article><article class="post-74068470 post type-post status-publish format-standard entry"><p>Now that payment deadlines have been relaxed due to COVID-19, the Moneycontrol Ready Reckoner will help keep your date with insurance premiums, tax-saving investments and EMIs, among others. &#8230; <a href="https://www.businessbreakingnews.net/2020/05/pseb-5th-8th-and-10th-result-2020-declared-here-s-how-to-check/" class="more-link">[Read more...] <span class="screen-reader-text">about PSEB 5th, 8th and 10th result 2020 declared: Here&#8217;s how to check</span></a></p></article></main>

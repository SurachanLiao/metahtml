<p>During Tuesday&#8217;s coronavirus pep rally at the White House, Donald Trump expressed concern for North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, whose health is <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/20/politics/kim-jong-un-north-korea/index.html">reportedly</a> in &#8220;grave danger&#8221; after undergoing surgery.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look, I just hope he&#8217;s doing fine,&#8221; the president said. &#8220;I mean, I&#8217;ve had a very good relationship with Kim Jong Un.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Aaron Rupar of Vox noted on Twitter, &#8220;Trump expressed more concern about Kim Jong Un&#8217;s health than he did about John McCain&#8217;s when McCain had cancer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Video of Trump&#8217;s well-wishes for the North Korean dictator:</p>

<p>Trump said:</p><p id="ld-2771-6855"></p> 
<blockquote><p>Look, I just hope he&#8217;s doing fine. I mean I&#8217;ve had a very good relationship with Kim Jong Un and that&#8217;s to the benefit of the country. That&#8217;s not a bad thing, that&#8217;s a good thing. And I&#8217;d like to see him be well. And we&#8217;ll see how he does. Again, I don&#8217;t know that the reports are true. &#8230; You know, I hope he does well.</p></blockquote>
<h2><strong>Trump treats murderous dictators better than war heroes</strong></h2>
<p>Since early in his presidential campaign, Donald Trump has shown a complete lack of respect for John McCain, a man who fought and nearly died for his country.</p>
<p>When McCain passed away in 2018, <a href="https://www.politicususa.com/2018/08/26/trump-refused-to-release-prepared-white-house-statement-calling-john-mccain-a-hero.html">Trump refused</a> to release an official White House statement that referred to the late Arizona senator as a &#8220;hero.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nearly a year after McCain&#8217;s death, Trump kept his attacks up. During a speech to the Faith and Freedom Coalition, he <a href="https://www.politicususa.com/2019/06/26/trump-john-mccain-hell.html">suggested that McCain was in hell</a> because he didn&#8217;t vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Trump has consistently heaped praise on Kim Jong Un, a man who has <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2016/12/29/asia/kim-jong-un-executions/index.html">executed hundreds</a> of his own people since taking power, all because the North Korean leader stroked his ego in a <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/11/trump-touts-beautiful-letter-from-kim-jong-un-1360138">love letter</a>.</p>
<p>Donald Trump has always hated John McCain because he knows he&#8217;ll never be as revered as the late senator was and still is. And Trump has always expressed admiration for Kim Jong Un because &#8211; deep down &#8211; he aspires to be that type of strongman.</p>

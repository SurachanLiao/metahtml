Milton, professor of environmental health at the University of Maryland, “generate infectious aerosols (tiny droplets that stay suspended in the air for a long time) even when they are not coughing, and especially during the first days of illness.” The common belief is that flu is spread through coughs and sneezes from infected individuals and from touching surfaces contaminated with the virus.

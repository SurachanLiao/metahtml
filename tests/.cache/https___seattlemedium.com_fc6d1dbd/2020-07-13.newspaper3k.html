                    <p class="td-excerpt">For many black teenagers in my generation, the JET magazine photo of 14-year old Emmett Till&#8217;s brutalized body after he was lynched by white supremacists was a wake-up call about the true nature of race in the United States.  The August 1955 horrific photo gave us a searing memory that still lingers in our souls.  Unfortunately, that memory did not lead us to create a strong black national unity organization designed to promote and protect our human rights in this country.</p>

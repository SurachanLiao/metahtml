<div><p>Those who are elderly or have pre-existing medical conditions are most at risk with COVID-19, so battling crowds of shoppers to pick up groceries or medications can be especially daunting.</p>
<p>Dennis Maxwell, head of marketing for the Oklahoma-based company Homeland, said that&#8217;s why he implemented specialty hours at all Homeland locations.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a responsibility not only for our health but for those of us that may be in the high-risk group,&#8221; Maxwell said. &#8220;We have an opportunity to provide a space for people who are at high risk to shop where they are not congested and they feel a little bit safer to get the items they need.&#8221;</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Gov. Kevin Stitt said many grocery stores were committed to leaving the first hour of operation open for those who need to take additional precautions.</p>

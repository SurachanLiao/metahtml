Those who are elderly or have pre-existing medical conditions are most at risk with COVID-19, so battling crowds of shoppers to pick up groceries or medications can be especially daunting.

Dennis Maxwell, head of marketing for the Oklahoma-based company Homeland, said that’s why he implemented specialty hours at all Homeland locations.

“We have a responsibility not only for our health but for those of us that may be in the high-risk group,” Maxwell said. “We have an opportunity to provide a space for people who are at high risk to shop where they are not congested and they feel a little bit safer to get the items they need.”

On Tuesday, Gov. Kevin Stitt said many grocery stores were committed to leaving the first hour of operation open for those who need to take additional precautions.

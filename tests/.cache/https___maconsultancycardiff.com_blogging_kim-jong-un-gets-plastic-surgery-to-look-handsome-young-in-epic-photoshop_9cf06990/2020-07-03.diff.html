An edit of the North Korean leader shows him with a slimmer face, sharper jawline—and weirdly, a kinder gaze even though his eyes still look the same.</p> <p>The details in the <a href="http://ow.ly/TEGu4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">photoshopped</a> version are incredible, especially when placed next to the original portrait of Kim. His nose is smaller, his lips are rosier, his eyebrows are more extended, the creases on his face are gone, and he now has an elongated neck.</p> <p>The longer you look, the more remarkable the edited image gets. You’ll find that he even has a visible Adam’s apple and lower shoulders.</p> <p>The only way of identifying the man is by looking at his iconic haircut, which has been retained in the edit.</p> <p>The side-by-side photos, shared by Facebook page <a href="https://www.facebook.com/exorbitantmemes/photos/a.219141492000787/582521028996163/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exorbitant Memes</a>, have inadvertently amused thousands of social media users.</p> <p>A while ago, the internet revelled in a <a href="https://designtaxi.com/news/396050/Photoshopper-Imagines-A-Slimmer-Kim-Jong-Un-Ends-Up-Looking-More-Intimidating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">slimmed-down picture</a> of Kim that somehow made him look more intimidating. This edit makes him appear a lot more endearing.</p> <p><del>Posted by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/exorbitantmemes/">Exorbitant Memes Link: https://www.facebook.com/exorbitantmemes/ </a> on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/exorbitantmemes/photos/a.219141492000787/582521028996163/?type=3">Tuesday, February 25, 2020 Link: https://www.facebook.com/exorbitantmemes/photos/a.219141492000787/582521028996163/?type=3 </a></del></p><del> [via </del><del><a></a></del><p id="jp-relatedposts" class="jp-relatedposts"><del></del></p><del> [via</del> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/exorbitantmemes/photos/a.219141492000787/582521028996163/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exorbitant Memes</a>, images via various sources] http://www.designtaxi.com/news/408818/Kim-Jong-Un-Gets-Plastic-Surgery-To-Look-Handsome-Young-In-Epic-Photoshop/

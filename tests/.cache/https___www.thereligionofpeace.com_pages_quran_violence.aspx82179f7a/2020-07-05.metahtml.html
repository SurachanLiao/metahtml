                <a href="/pages/articles/bible-quran-violence.aspx">Old 
                Testament verses of violence</a>, most verses of violence in the Quran 
                are open-ended, meaning that they are not necessarily restrained by historical context 
                    contained in the 
                surrounding text (although many Muslims choose to think of them that way). They are part of the eternal, 
                unchanging word of Allah, and just as relevant or subject to interpretation as anything else in 
                the Quran. 
                </p><p>The context of violent passages is more ambiguous than might be expected of a 
                perfect book from a loving God. Most contemporary Muslims exercise a personal choice to interpret their holy 
                book's call to arms according to their own moral preconceptions about justifiable 
                violence. Islam's apologists cater to these preferences with tenuous 
                arguments that gloss over historical fact and generally don't stand up to 
                scrutiny.&#160; Still, it is important to note that the problem is <span class="bi">not</span> 
                bad people, but bad ideology.</p><p>Unfortunately, there are very few <a href="../articles/quran-peaceful.aspx">verses of tolerance and peace</a> to 
                    balance out those calling for nonbelievers to be fought 
                and subdued until they either accept humiliation, convert to Islam, or are 
                killed. Muhammad's own martial legacy, along with the remarkable emphasis on 
                violence found in the Quran, have produced a trail of blood and tears across world history.

                    Does the Quran really contain over a hundred verses that sanction violence?</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                The Quran contains at least 109 verses that 
                speak of war with nonbelievers, usually on the basis of their status as non-Muslims. Some are quite graphic, with commands to chop off heads and 
                fingers and kill infidels wherever they may be hiding. Muslims who do 
                not join the fight are 
                <a class="pages" href="/quran/noble/sura3.html#167" target="_blank">called</a> &#39;hypocrites&#39; and warned that Allah will send them 
                to Hell if they do not join the slaughter.<p>Unlike nearly all of the
                <a href="/pages/articles/bible-quran-violence.aspx">Old 
                Testament verses of violence</a>, most verses of violence in the Quran 
                are open-ended, meaning that they are not necessarily restrained by historical context 
                    contained in the 
                surrounding text (although many Muslims choose to think of them that way). They are part of the eternal, 
                unchanging word of Allah, and just as relevant or subject to interpretation as anything else in 
                the Quran. 
                <p>The context of violent passages is more ambiguous than might be expected of a 
                perfect book from a loving God. Most contemporary Muslims exercise a personal choice to interpret their holy 
                book&#39;s call to arms according to their own moral preconceptions about justifiable 
                violence. Islam&#39;s apologists cater to these preferences with tenuous 
                arguments that gloss over historical fact and generally don&#39;t stand up to 
                scrutiny.&nbsp; Still, it is important to note that <b>the problem is </b><span class="bi">not</span><b> 
                bad people, but bad ideology</b>.<p>Unfortunately, there are very few <a href="../articles/quran-peaceful.aspx">verses of tolerance and peace</a> to 
                    balance out those calling for nonbelievers to be fought 
                and subdued until they either accept humiliation, convert to Islam, or are 
                killed. Muhammad&#39;s own martial legacy, along with the remarkable emphasis on 
                violence found in the Quran, have produced a trail of blood and tears across world history.<br/>

                only does this verse establish that violence can be virtuous, but it also 
                contradicts the myth that fighting is intended only in self-defense, since the

                criticizes &quot;peaceful&quot; Muslims who do not join in the violence, letting 
                them know that they are less worthy in Allah&#39;s eyes. It also 
                demolishes the modern myth that &quot;Jihad&quot; doesn&#39;t mean holy war in the

                rather a spiritual struggle. Not only is this Arabic word (mujahiduna) used in this 
                passage, but it is clearly <i>not</i> referring to anything spiritual, since the 
                physically disabled are given exemption. (The Hadith reveals the context 
                of the passage to be in response to a blind man's protest that he is unable to

                unbelief)<i> and religion is all for Allah&quot; </i>Some translations interpret &quot;fitna&quot; as 
                &quot;persecution&quot;, but the traditional understanding of this word is not supported 
                by the historical context (See notes for 2:193). The Meccans were simply refusing 
                Muhammad access to their city during the pilgrimage. Other Muslims were allowed 
                to travel there - but not as an armed group, since Muhammad had declared war on 
                Mecca prior to his eviction. The Meccans were also acting in defense of 
                their religion, as it was Muhammad&#39;s intention to destroy their idols and 
                establish Islam by force (which he later did). Hence the critical part of 
                this verse is to fight until <i>&quot;religion is only for Allah&quot;</i>, 
                meaning that the true justification of violence was the unbelief of the 
                opposition. 
                According to the Sira (Ibn Ishaq/Hisham 324) Muhammad further explains that <i>&quot;Allah must have no rivals.&quot; </i> (See also: <a href="../games/discover-truth/verses/8-39.aspx">Response to Apologists</a>)<br />

                wherever you find them, and take them captive and besiege them and lie in wait 
                for them in every ambush, then if they repent and keep up prayer and pay the 
                poor-rate, leave their way free to them.&quot; </i>According to this 
                verse, the best way of staying safe from Muslim violence at the time of Muhammad was to convert to Islam: prayer (<i>salat</i>) and the poor tax (<i>zakat</i>) are among the religion&#39;s 
                Five Pillars. The popular claim that the Quran only inspires violence 
                within the context of self-defense is seriously challenged by this passage as 
                well, since the Muslims to whom it was written were obviously not under attack. 
                Had they been, then there would have been no waiting period (earlier verses make 
                it a duty for Muslims to fight in self-defense, even during the sacred months). 
                The historical context is Mecca <i>after</i> the idolaters were subjugated by 
                Muhammad and posed no threat. Once the Muslims had power, they 
                violently evicted those unbelievers who would not convert.&nbsp;

                [Note: The verse says to 
                fight unbelievers &quot;<i>wherever you find them</i>&quot;.  Even if the context is a time
                of battle (which it was not) the reading appears to sanction attacks against those "unbelievers"
                who are not on the battlefield.&nbsp; In 2016, the Islamic State referred to this verse in urging the faithful to commit terror 
                attacks: <i>Allah did not only command the 'fighting' of disbelievers, as if to say He only 
                wants us to conduct frontline operations against them. Rather, He has also ordered that they be
                 slain wherever they may be – on or off the battlefield.</i> (<a href="https://pjmedia.com/homeland-security/2016/09/07/isis-magazine-to-jihadists-target-young-adults-engaged-in-sports-activities-in-the-park/" target="_blank">source</a>)]<br />

                people.&quot;</i> Humiliating and hurting non-believers not only has the 
                blessing of Allah, but it is ordered as a means of carrying out his punishment 
                and even "heals" the hearts of Muslims.<br />

                Dehumanizing those who reject Islam, by reminding Muslims that unbelievers are merely

                - This parable lays the theological groundwork for honor killings, in which a 
                family member is murdered because they brought shame to the family, either 
                through apostasy or perceived moral indiscretion. The story (which is not 
                found in any Jewish or Christian source) tells of Moses encountering a man with 
                &quot;special knowledge&quot; who does things which don&#39;t seem to make sense on the 
                surface, but are then justified according to later explanation. One such 
                action is to murder a youth for no apparent reason (v.74). However, the wise 
                man later explains that it was feared that the boy would &quot;grieve&quot; his parents by 
                &quot;disobedience and ingratitude.&quot; He was killed so that Allah could provide 
                them a &#39;better&#39; son. [Note: This parable along with verse <a href="/quran/noble/sura58.html#22" target="_blank">58:22</a> is a major reason that honor killing is sanctioned by Sharia. Reliance of the Traveler (Umdat al-Saliq) says that punishment for murder is not applicable when a parent or grandparent kills their offspring (o.1.12).] (See also: <a href="../games/discover-truth/verses/18-65.aspx">Response to Apologists</a>)<br />

                - <i>&quot;O You who believe! Shall I guide you to a commerce that will save you 
                from a painful torment. That you believe in Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad), 
                and that you strive hard and fight in the Cause of Allah with your wealth and 
                your lives, that will be better for you, if you but know! (If you do so) He will 
                forgive you your sins, and admit you into Gardens under which rivers flow, and 
                pleasant dwelling in Gardens of'Adn- Eternity ['Adn(Edn) Paradise], that is 
                indeed the great success.&quot;</i> This verse refers to physical battle 
                waged to make Islam victorious over other religions (see verse 9). It uses 
                the Arabic root for the word Jihad.<br />

                - <i>&quot;And kill them wherever you find them, and turn them out from where 
		                they have turned you out. And Al-Fitnah </i>[disbelief or 
		                unrest] <i>is worse than 
		                killing... but if they desist, then lo! 
                Allah is forgiving and merciful. And fight them until there is no 
		                more Fitnah</i> [disbelief and worshipping of others along with Allah]
		                <i>and worship is for Allah alone. But if they cease, let there be 
		                no transgression except against Az-Zalimun(the polytheists, and 
		                wrong-doers, etc.)"</i> (Translation is from the Noble Quran) 
		                The verse prior to this (190) refers to <i>"fighting for the cause of 
		                Allah those who fight you"</i> leading some to claim that the entire 
		                passage refers to a defensive war in which Muslims are defending their 
		                homes and families.&nbsp; The 
                <a href="../muhammad/persecution-medina.aspx">historical context</a> 
                of this passage is <b>not</b> defensive warfare, however, since Muhammad and his Muslims 
                had just relocated to Medina and were <i>not</i> under attack by their Meccan 
                adversaries.&nbsp; In fact, the verses urge <i>offensive</i> warfare, in that 
                Muslims are to drive Meccans out of their own city (which they
                <a href="/pages/muhammad/mecca-more-tolerant.aspx">
                later did</a>).&nbsp; Verse 190 thus means to fight those who offer resistance 
		                to Allah's rule (ie. Muslim conquest).&nbsp; The use of the word 
		                "persecution" by some Muslim translators is disingenuous - the actual 
		                Arabic words for persecution (<i>idtihad</i>) - and 
                oppression are not used instead of <i>fitna</i>.&nbsp; <i>Fitna</i> can mean disbelief, or the disorder that results from unbelief or temptation.&nbsp; A strict translation is &#39;sedition,&#39; meaning rebellion against authority (the authority being Allah).&nbsp; This is certainly what is meant in this context since the violence is 
		                explicitly commissioned <i>&quot;until religion is for Allah&quot;</i> - ie. unbelievers desist in their 
                unbelief.&nbsp; [Editor&#39;s note: these notes have been modified slightly after a critic misinterpreted our language. Verse 193 plainly says that &#39;fighting&#39; is sanctioned even if the <i>fitna</i> &#39;ceases&#39;.&nbsp; This is about religious order, not real persecution.] (See also: <a href="../games/discover-truth/verses/2-191.aspx">Response to Apologists</a>)<br />

                Other than the fact that Muslims haven&#39;t killed every 
                non-Muslim under their domain, there is very little else that they can point to 
                as proof that theirs is a peaceful, tolerant religion. Where Islam is dominant (as in the Middle East and Pakistan) religious minorities suffer brutal 
                persecution with scant introspection. Where Islam is in the minority (as in 
                Thailand, the Philippines and Europe) there is the threat of violence if 
                Muslim demands are not met. Either situation seems to provide a 
                justification for religious terrorism, which is persistent and endemic to 
                Islamic fundamentalism.<br />
                <br />
                This begins with the Quran. Few 
                verses of Islam&#39;s most sacred text can be construed to fit the contemporary virtues of religious tolerance 
                and universal brotherhood. Those that do are earlier &quot;Meccan" verses 
                which are abrogated by later ones. The example of Muhammad is 
                that Islam is a religion of peace when Muslims do not have the power and numbers 
                on their side. Once they do, things change.<br />
		                <br />
		                Many Muslims are peaceful and do not want to 
		                believe what the Quran really says. They prefer a more narrow 
		                interpretation that is closer to the Judeo-Christian ethic. Some just 
		                ignore harsher passages. Others reach for "textual context" across different suras to 
		                subjectively mitigate these verses with others so that the message 
		                fits their personal moral preference. Although the Quran itself 
		                claims to be clear and complete, these apologists speak of the "risks" 
		                of trying to interpret verses without their "assistance." <br />
                <br />
                The 
                violent verses of the Quran have played a key role in massacre and 
                genocide. This includes the brutal slaughter of tens of millions of 
                Hindus for five centuries beginning around 1000 AD with Mahmud of Ghazni&#39;s 
                bloody conquest. Both he and the later Tamerlane (Islam&#39;s Genghis Khan) 
                slaughtered an untold number merely for defending their temples from 
                destruction. Buddhism was nearly wiped off the Indian 
                subcontinent. Judaism and Christianity met the same fate (albeit more 
                slowly) in areas 
                conquered by Muslim armies, including the Middle East, North Africa and parts of Europe, 
                including today&#39;s Turkey. Zoroastrianism, the ancient religion of a proud Persian 
                people is despised by Muslims and barely survives in modern Iran.<br />
                <br />
                Violence is so ingrained in Islam that it has 
                never really stopped being at war, either with other religions or with itself. <br />
                <br />
                Muhammad was a military leader, laying siege to towns, 
                <a href="/pages/muhammad/qurayza.aspx">massacring</a> the men, 
                <a href="/pages/muhammad/rape.aspx">raping</a> their women, enslaving their children, and taking 
                the property of others as his own. On several occasions he 
                rejected offers of surrender from the besieged inhabitants and even butchered
                <a href="/pages/muhammad/captives-kill.aspx">
                captives</a>. He inspired his followers to battle when they 
                did not feel it was right to fight,  
                promising them slaves and booty if they did and threatening them with Hell if 
                they did not. Muhammad allowed his men to 
                rape traumatized women captured in battle, usually on the very day their 
                husbands and family members were slaughtered. <br />
                <br />
                The popular apologist argument that many verses of violence apply to war is shaded by the fact that war was started by Muslims, both in Muhammad&#39;s time and since.&nbsp; For the most part, Islamic armies waged <i>
                aggressive</i> campaigns, and the religion&#39;s most dramatic military conquests 
                were made by actual companions of Muhammad in the decades following his death.<br />
		                <br />
		                The 
                early Islamic principle of warfare was that the civilian population of a town was 
                to be destroyed (ie. men executed, women and children taken as slaves) if they 
                defended themselves and resisted Islamic hegemony. Although modern apologists claim that 
                Muslims are only supposed to "attack in self-defense", this oxymoron 
		                is 
                <a href="/pages/muhammad/self-defense.aspx">
                flatly contradicted</a> by the accounts of Islamic historians and others that go back 
                to the time of Muhammad.<br />
		                <br />
		                Some modern-day scholars are more candid than 
		                others. One of the most respected Sunni theologians is al-Qaradawi, 
		                who justifies terror attacks against Western targets by <a href="https://www.memri.org/reports/al-qaradhawi-speaks-favor-suicide-operations-islamic-conference-sweden" target="_blank">noting</a> that 
		                there is no such thing as a civilian population in a time of war:<br />
		                <blockquote><em>"It has been determined by Islamic law that 
		                the blood and property of people of Dar al-Harb </em><i>[ie. non-Muslim 
		                people who resist Islamic conquest]</i><em> is not protected... In modern 
		                war, all of society, with all its classes and ethnic groups, is 
		                mobilized to participate in the war, to aid its continuation, and to 
		                provide it with the material and human fuel required for it to assure 
		                the victory of the state fighting its enemies. Every citizen in society 
		                must take upon himself a role in the effort to provide for the battle. 
		                The entire domestic front, including professionals, laborers, and 
		                industrialists, stands behind the fighting army, even if it does not 
		                bear arms."</em></blockquote>Consider the example of the
                <a href="/pages/muhammad/qurayza.aspx">Qurayza</a> Jews, who were completely 
                obliterated only five years after Muhammad arrived in Medina. Their leader 
                opted to stay neutral when their town was besieged by a Meccan army that 
                was sent to 
                take revenge for Muhammad&#39;s deadly caravan raids. The tribe killed no one 
                from either side and even surrendered peacefully to Muhammad after the Meccans 
                had been turned back. Yet the prophet of Islam had every male member of 
                the Qurayza beheaded, and every woman and child enslaved, even raping one of the 
                captives himself (what Muslim apologists might refer to as &quot;same day marriage&quot;). <br />
                <br />
                One of Islam&#39;s most revered modern scholars, Sheikh Yusuf 
                al-Qaradawi, openly sanctions offensive Jihad: <i>&quot;In the Jihad which you are 
                seeking, you look for the enemy and invade him. This type of Jihad
                takes place only when the Islamic state is 
                invading other </i>[countries]<i><b> in</b></i><i><b> order to spread the word of Islam</b> 
                and to remove obstacles standing in its way.&quot; 
                <br />
                <br /></i>
                Qutb wrote: <i> &quot;Islam has the right to take the initiative…this is God’s religion and it is for the whole 
                world. It has the right to destroy all obstacles in the form 
                of institutions and traditions … it attacks institutions and 
                traditions to release human beings from their poisonous 
                influences, which distort human nature and curtail human freedom.  Those who say that Islamic Jihad was merely for the 
					                defense of the &#39;homeland of Islam&#39; diminish the greatness of 
					                the Islamic way of life.&quot;

                The widely respected
                <a href="https://www.answering-islam.org/Books/Hughes/j.htm" target="_blank">Dictionary of Islam</a> 
                defines Jihad as <i>&quot;A religious war with those who are unbelievers in the 
                mission of Muhammad. It is an incumbent religious duty, established in the 
                Quran and in the Traditions as a divine institution, and enjoined specially for 
                the purpose of advancing Islam and of repelling evil from Muslims…[Quoting from 
                the Hanafi school, Hedaya, 2:140, 141.], &quot;<b>The destruction of the sword is 
                incurred by infidels, although they be not the first aggressors</b>, as appears 
                from various passages in the traditions which are generally received to this 
                effect.&quot;</i><br />
		                <br />
		                Dr. Salah al-Sawy, the chief member of the Assembly 
		                of Muslim Jurists in America, stated in 2009 that <i>"the Islamic 
		                community does not possess the strength to engage in </i><strong><em>
		                offensive</em></strong><em> jihad <strong>at this time</strong>,"</em> 
		                tacitly affirming the legitimacy of violence for the cause of Islamic 
		                rule - bound only by the capacity for success. (<a href="http://pjmedia.com/blog/congressman-king-subpoena-the-assembly-of-muslim-jurists-of-america-amja/?singlepage=true" target="_blank">source</a>)<br />
		                <br />
                Muhammad&#39;s failure to leave a clear 
                line of succession resulted in perpetual internal war following his death. 
                Those who knew him best first fought afterwards to keep remote tribes from leaving Islam 
                and reverting to their preferred religion (the Ridda or &#39;Apostasy wars&#39;). Then 
                the violence turned within. Early Meccan converts battled later ones as hostility developed between those 
                immigrants who had traveled with Muhammad to Mecca and the Ansar at Medina who 
                had helped them settle in. Finally there was a violent struggle within 
                Muhammad&#39;s own family between his favorite wife and favorite daughter - a jagged 
                schism that has left Shias and Sunnis at each others&#39; throats to this day. <br />
                <br />
                The strangest and most untrue thing that can be said about 
                Islam is that it is a religion of peace. If every standard by which the 
                West is judged and condemned (slavery, imperialism, intolerance, misogyny, 
                sexual repression, warfare...) were applied equally to Islam, the verdict would be devastating. Islam never gives up what it conquers, be it religion, 
                culture, language or life. Neither does it make apologies or any real 
                effort at moral progress. It is the least open to dialogue and the most 
                self-absorbed. It is convinced of its own perfection, yet brutally shuns 
                self-examination and represses criticism.<br />
                <br />
                This is what makes the Quran&#39;s verses of violence so dangerous. 
                They are given the weight of divine command. While Muslim terrorists take them literally, and understand that Islam is incomplete without Jihad, moderates offer little to 
                contradict them - outside of personal opinion. Indeed, what do they have? Speaking of peace and 
                love may win over the ignorant, but when every twelfth verse of Islam&#39;s holiest 
                book either speaks to Allah&#39;s hatred for non-Muslims or calls for their death, 
                forced conversion, or subjugation, it is little wonder that sympathy for 
                terrorism runs as <a href="../articles/opinion-polls.aspx" target="_blank">deeply</a> as it does in the broader community - even if most 
                Muslims prefer not to interpret their personal viewpoint of Islam in this way.<br />
                <br />
                Although scholars like Ibn Khaldun, one of Islam&#39;s most 
                respected philosophers, understood that <i>&quot;the holy war is a religious duty, 
                because of the universalism of the Muslim mission and (the obligation to) 
                convert everybody to Islam either by persuasion or by force&quot;, </i>many other Muslims are either unaware or willfully 
                ignorant of the Quran&#39;s 
                near absence of verses that preach universal non-violence. Their 
                understanding of Islam comes from what they are taught by others. Believers in the 
                West are often led to think that their religion is like Christianity - preaching the New Testament virtues of peace, love, and tolerance. They are somewhat surprised and embarrassed to find that the Quran and the bloody history of Islam&#39;s genesis say otherwise.<br />
                <br />
                Others simply accept the violence. In 1991, a 
                Palestinian couple in America was convicted of stabbing their daughter to death 
                for being too Westernized. A family friend came to their defense, 
                excoriating the jury for not understanding the &quot;culture&quot;, claiming that the 
                father was merely following &quot;the religion&quot; and saying that the couple had to 
                &quot;discipline their daughter or lose respect.&quot; (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/28/us/terror-and-death-at-home-are-caught-in-fbi-tape.html?pagewanted=1" target="_blank">source</a>). 
                In 2011, unrepentant Palestinian terrorists, responsible for the brutal

                in the name of Allah were treated to a luxurious &quot;holy pilgrimage&quot; to Mecca by 
                the Saudi king - <a href="../articles/ahlam-tamimi-haj.aspx">without a single Muslim voice raised in protest</a>.<br />
                <br />
                The most prestigious Islamic university in the world today is Cairo&#39;s al-Azhar.&nbsp; While the university is
                 very quick to condemn secular Muslims who critique the religion, it has never 
                condemned ISIS as a group of infidels despite horrific carnage in the name of
                 Allah.&nbsp; When asked why, the university&#39;s Grand Imam, 
                Ahmed al-Tayeb <a href="http://www.meforum.org/blog/2015/12/alazhar-isis" target="_blank">explained</a>: &quot;
                <i>Al Azhar cannot accuse any [Muslim] of being a kafir [infidel], as long as 
                    he believes in Allah and the Last Day—even if he commits every atrocity.</i>&quot;<br />

                <br />
                For their part, Western liberals would do well not to 
                sacrifice critical thinking to the god of political correctness, or 
                look for reasons to bring other religion down to the level of Islam merely to 
                avoid the existential truth that it is both different and dangerous.<br />
                <br />
                There are just too many Muslims who take the Quran 
                literally... and too many others who couldn&#39;t care less about the 
                violence done in the name of Islam.<br />

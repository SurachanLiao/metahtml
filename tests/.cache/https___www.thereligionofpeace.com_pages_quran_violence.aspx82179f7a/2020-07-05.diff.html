                are open-ended, meaning that they are not necessarily restrained by historical context 
                    contained in the

                violence. Islam's apologists cater to these preferences with tenuous

                killed. Muhammad's own martial legacy, along with the remarkable emphasis on 
                violence found in the Quran, have produced a trail of blood and tears across world history.

                non-Muslim under their domain, there is very little else that they can point to 
                as proof that theirs is a peaceful, tolerant religion. Where Islam is dominant (as in the Middle East and Pakistan) religious minorities suffer brutal 
                persecution with scant introspection. Where Islam is in the minority (as in 
                Thailand, the Philippines and Europe) there is the threat of violence if 
                Muslim demands are not met. Either situation seems to provide a 
                justification for religious terrorism, which is persistent and endemic to 
                Islamic fundamentalism.</del><del><br> </del><del><br> This begins with the Quran. Few 
                verses of Islam's most sacred text can be construed to fit the contemporary virtues of religious tolerance 
                and universal brotherhood. Those that do are earlier "Meccan" verses 
                which are abrogated by later ones. The example of Muhammad is 
                that Islam is a religion of peace when Muslims do not have the power and numbers 
                on their side. Once they do, things change.</del><del><br> </del><del><br> Many Muslims are peaceful and do not want to 
		                believe what the Quran really says. They prefer a more narrow 
		                interpretation that is closer to the Judeo-Christian ethic. Some just 
		                ignore harsher passages. Others reach for "textual context" across different suras to 
		                subjectively mitigate these verses with others so that the message 
		                fits their personal moral preference. Although the Quran itself 
		                claims to be clear and complete, these apologists speak of the "risks" 
		                of trying to interpret verses without their "assistance." </del><del><br> </del><del><br> The 
                violent verses of the Quran have played a key role in massacre and 
                genocide. This includes the brutal slaughter of tens of millions of 
                Hindus for five centuries beginning around 1000 AD with Mahmud of Ghazni's 
                bloody conquest. Both he and the later Tamerlane (Islam's Genghis Khan) 
                slaughtered an untold number merely for defending their temples from 
                destruction. Buddhism was nearly wiped off the Indian 
                subcontinent. Judaism and Christianity met the same fate (albeit more 
                slowly) in areas 
                conquered by Muslim armies, including the Middle East, North Africa and parts of Europe, 
                including today's Turkey. Zoroastrianism, the ancient religion of a proud Persian 
                people is despised by Muslims and barely survives in modern Iran.</del><del><br> </del><del><br> Violence is so ingrained in Islam that it has

                defended themselves and resisted Islamic hegemony. Although modern apologists claim that

                opted to stay neutral when their town was besieged by a Meccan army that 
                was sent to 
                take revenge for Muhammad's deadly caravan raids. The tribe killed no one 
                from either side and even surrendered peacefully to Muhammad after the Meccans 
                had been turned back. Yet the prophet of Islam had every male member of

                al-Qaradawi, openly sanctions offensive Jihad: <i>"In the Jihad which you are

                <br> <br></i> Qutb wrote: <i>"Islam has the right to take the initiative…this is God’s religion and it is for the whole 
                world. It has the right to destroy all obstacles in the form 
                of institutions and traditions … it attacks institutions and 
                traditions to release human beings from their poisonous 
                influences, which distort human nature and curtail human freedom.  Those who say that Islamic Jihad was merely for the 
					                defense of the 'homeland of Islam' diminish the greatness of 
					                the Islamic way of life."

                mission of Muhammad. It is an incumbent religious duty, established in the 
                Quran and in the Traditions as a divine institution, and enjoined specially for 
                the purpose of advancing Islam and of repelling evil from Muslims…[Quoting from 
                the Hanafi school, Hedaya, 2:140, 141.], "<b>The destruction of the sword is 
                incurred by infidels, although they be not the first aggressors</b>, as appears 
                from various passages in the traditions which are generally received to this 
                effect."</i><br> <br> Dr. Salah al-Sawy, the chief member of the Assembly 
		                of Muslim Jurists in America, stated in 2009 that <i>"the Islamic 
		                community does not possess the strength to engage in </i><strong>offensive</strong> jihad <strong>at this time</strong>," 
		                tacitly affirming the legitimacy of violence for the cause of Islamic 
		                rule - bound only by the capacity for success.

                line of succession resulted in perpetual internal war following his death. 
                Those who knew him best first fought afterwards to keep remote tribes from leaving Islam 
                and reverting to their preferred religion (the Ridda or 'Apostasy wars'). Then 
                the violence turned within. Early Meccan converts battled later ones as hostility developed between those 
                immigrants who had traveled with Muhammad to Mecca and the Ansar at Medina who 
                had helped them settle in. Finally there was a violent struggle within 
                Muhammad's own family between his favorite wife and favorite daughter - a jagged 
                schism that has left Shias and Sunnis at each others' throats to this day. <br> <br> The strangest and most untrue thing that can be said about 
                Islam is that it is a religion of peace. If every standard by which the 
                West is judged and condemned (slavery, imperialism, intolerance, misogyny, 
                sexual repression, warfare...) were applied equally to Islam, the verdict would be devastating. Islam never gives up what it conquers, be it religion, 
                culture, language or life. Neither does it make apologies or any real 
                effort at moral progress. It is the least open to dialogue and the most 
                self-absorbed. It is convinced of its own perfection, yet brutally shuns 
                self-examination and represses criticism.<br> <br> This is what makes the Quran's verses of violence so dangerous. 
                They are given the weight of divine command. While Muslim terrorists take them literally, and understand that Islam is incomplete without Jihad, moderates offer little to 
                contradict them - outside of personal opinion. Indeed, what do they have? Speaking of peace and 
                love may win over the ignorant, but when every twelfth verse of Islam's holiest 
                book either speaks to Allah's hatred for non-Muslims or calls for their death, 
                forced conversion, or subjugation, it is little wonder that sympathy for 
                terrorism runs as <a href="../articles/opinion-polls.aspx" target="_blank">deeply Link: ../articles/opinion-polls.aspx </a> as it does in the broader community - even if most 
                Muslims prefer not to interpret their personal viewpoint of Islam in this way.<br> <br> Although scholars like Ibn Khaldun, one of Islam's most 
                respected philosophers, understood that <i>"the holy war is a religious duty, 
                because of the universalism of the Muslim mission and (the obligation to) 
                convert everybody to Islam either by persuasion or by force", </i>many other Muslims are either unaware or willfully 
                ignorant of the Quran's 
                near absence of verses that preach universal non-violence. Their 
                understanding of Islam comes from what they are taught by others. Believers in the 
                West are often led to think that their religion is like Christianity - preaching the New Testament virtues of peace, love, and tolerance. They are somewhat surprised and embarrassed to find that the Quran and the bloody history of Islam's genesis say otherwise.<br> <br> Others simply accept the violence. In 1991, a 
                Palestinian couple in America was convicted of stabbing their daughter to death 
                for being too Westernized. A family friend came to their defense, 
                excoriating the jury for not understanding the "culture", claiming that the 
                father was merely following "the religion" and saying that the couple had to 
                "discipline their daughter or lose respect."

<p class="MsoBodyText2"><span lang="EN-GB">The comparison between modern British girls and
modern Iranian girls living less than 3,000 miles apart could hardly be more
stark. 
In Britain,
a young woman can wear pretty clothes and makeup in public, talk on her mobile,
smoke, go for a drink and have a boyfriend. If she gets pregnant, the state
will look after her. If she commits a crime, the worst that can happen to her
is imprisonment in a humanely run prison. 
In Iran,
she must cover her head at all times and may not wear makeup or do anything to
display her femininity in public. She
may not drink alcohol or associate with boys and if she gets caught, she will
be flogged. If she gets caught having
sex or gets pregnant outside marriage, she can be sentenced to death for
adultery or moral crimes. If she commits murder or is involved in drug
trafficking, she can expect to feel the hangman&#146;s noose, perhaps in public.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">It is claimed by feminist and human
rights groups that Iran
is one big prison for women.</span></p>

 

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The 1979 Revolution and
the 1980&#146;s.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Under
the rule of the former Shah, a small number of women were hanged, mostly for
murder. The Shah was deposed in 1979 and replaced by a fundamentalist Muslim
regime led by Ayatollah Khomeini. He won a huge democratic majority for the
formation of an Islamic Republic, on April the 1st, 1979. Under the new government, women were
required to wear the veil, western music and alcohol were banned, and the
punishments prescribed by Sharia law came into force.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Male
and female executions became frequent &#150; often for refusing to convert to or
recognise Islam or for being a member of an anti-regime political group. </span></p>

 

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">There are no accurate records of
just how many men, women and girls were executed in the first years of the
Revolution. There is a credible list of 14,028 names available and some sources
claim figures of several tens of thousands, although these are not
substantiated with names. A</span><span lang="EN-GB">ccording to a report published by the Organisation of Women Against
Execution in Iran,
at least 2,000 women were executed between June 1981 and 1990. They have been
able to prepare a list containing 1,428 names. 187 of these women were under
the age of 18, with nine girls under the age of 13 and 14 between the ages of
45 and 70. The youngest girl executed was just 10 years old. Thirty two of
these women were reported to have been pregnant at the time of their execution.
Many of those executed were high school and college students. Hanging was the
most common method of execution for women, although some were shot. (Large
numbers of men were shot during this period.) Men and women were hanged in large groups in Tehran prisons from cranes and forklift
trucks. Each crane jib or forklift had a wooden or steel beam to which the
nooses was attached and when the preparations were complete, the prisoners were
simply hoisted into the air.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Under Revolutionary law, young girls who were
sentenced to death could not be executed if they were still virgins. Thus, they
were "married off" to Revolutionary Guards and prison officials in
temporary marriages and then raped before their execution, to prevent them
going to heaven. The Mullahs believed that these women were ungodly and did not
deserve paradise in the next life and that if they were deprived of their
virginity, it would ensure that they went to hell.&#160; Therefore, on the
night prior to execution, the condemned girl was injected with a tranquilliser
and then raped by her guard(s). After the execution, the religious judge at the
prison would write out a marriage certificate and send it to the victim's
family along with a box of sweets.</span></p>

 

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Generally
details of executions from the early years of the Revolution are hard to find,
the Borumand website lists 123 female hangings in Iran between 1980 and 1999,
together with 171 executions by shooting and eight by stoning. To search this website <a href="http://www.abfiran.org/english/memorial-search.php">click here</a>.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The case
of the ten women hanged in Shiraz
in 1983 is well documented, however.</span><span lang="EN-GB">The &#147;crime&#148; of these women was to
believe in the Bah&#225;'&#237; religion instead of Islam and to believe in the equality
of men and women. These were considered to be very dangerous concepts by the
Revolutionary regime who had them arrested and tortured in an effort to
persuade them to convert into Islam. Several of them were subjected to the
"bastinado" - beating on the soles of their feet.&#160; They were all
given the opportunity to avoid execution by recanting their faith and
converting to Islam but none of them chose to. 
On the night of June the
 18th,1983, they were driven in a bus to a polo field on the
outskirts of Shiraz
where a gallows had been set up. The bus driver who took them there reported
that they seemed to be in good spirits, singing on the way and prepared to meet
their fate.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The
youngest prisoner was Mona Mahmudnizhad, who was just 17 years old. Her father
had been hanged some months earlier for his beliefs. At the execution ground,
she asked to be hanged last so that she could pray for all the other women.
Reportedly, she kissed the noose and recited a prayer before she was
suspended.&#160;  
The other nine members of the group were :  
23 year old Roya Ishraqi, a promising veterinary student, was executed with her
50 year old mother, Izzad Janami Ishraqi.&#160;  
20 year old Akhtar Sabit, a graduate nurse, who had taught children&#146;s religious
classes. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">28 year old
Mahshid Nirumand was a physics graduate from the University of Shiraz. She is
said to have remained resolute in prison and to have shared her food with the
others and encouraged them to remain firm. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Shirin
Dalvand was 25 years old and held a degree in sociology from the University of
Shiraz. Shirin was an expert in the Baha'i faith. Under interrogation, she was
asked whether she would ever give up her religion - she told her questioner
that she would hold to her faith. "Until my death, I hope that the divine
mercy will enable me to remain firm to the last breath of my life ". </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Tahirih
Siyavushi was a 32 year old nurse, who had been a member of the Local Spiritual
Assembly of Shiraz. Her husband, Jamshid, had been hanged two days earlier. As
a nurse, Tahirih helped to look after the other prisoners. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">20 year old
Simin Sabiri, who had been a member of the Committee of Studies Baha' ies of
Shiraz.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Zarrin
Muqimi was 28 years old and also very knowledgeable about her faith, defending
it vigorously under interrogation. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The oldest
of the group was 54 year old Mrs Nosrat Yalda'I who had belonged to the
Spiritual Local Assembly of Shiraz and whose house was regarded as the
"nerve centre" of the Baha' ie Community in Shiraz. She had been
viciously whipped during her time in prison and her wounds were still visible
after her hanging. Both her husband and her son, Bahram had also been executed.
</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The town&#146;s
people of Shiraz groups brought flowers to the mortuary to honour the bravery
of these women, despite the dangers of such a protest. The Bah&#225;'&#237; religion is
still considered dangerous by the regime and is suppressed.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Dina
Parnabi was an Iranian high school student, accused of smuggling forbidden
literature and criticising the regime in her talks with her classmates. She was
hanged on the 10th of July 1984 in a Teheran prison. The hanging was done in
private and after the execution was over, her body was stripped, washed and
delivered for dissection at the medical school. In Iran, female bodies
delivered for medical studies often showed rope burns around their necks,
indicating that they were all executed by hanging.</span></p>

 

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Hangings of
women, mostly in their 20&#146;s and 30&#146;s, seemed to reach a peak in 1988, with no
less than 95 traced by the <span>Borumand Foundation.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Iran</span><span lang="EN-GB"> is a signatory both to the
International Convention on Human Rights and the Convention on the Rights of
the Child, both of which explicitly forbid the execution of minors, however,
Iranian law allows the death penalty for boys from age 15 and for girls from
age nine. Girls and women can be sentenced to hanging either in private or in
public, or to stoning to death. Under external pressure, minors now tend to be
kept in prison until they are 18 and then have their death sentence carried
out. </span></p>

 

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Let us have a look at the individual cases of
these women.  
Everyone of them died a painful and humiliating death, there being no effort
made to minimise their suffering or make their execution in any way humane.
Pictures of Fariba Tajiani-Emamqoli&#146;s hanging and those of male prisoners show
that an American style coiled noose made from modern nylon rope is used and
that the prisoner is either stood on a bench or a box which is pulled from
under them or hoisted into the air by a crane jib as happened with Fariba and
16 year old Atefeh Rajabi. </span></p>

 

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">On the 26th
of January 2000 when Masoumeh Fathi was hanged in the north western city of
Tabriz for killing a prison warder during an escape attempt. On the same day,
Alieh Moradi and her male accomplice, Farhang Moradi, were hanged in Kermanshah
in western Iran, for the murder of Alieh&#146;s husband. Her children were present
in the prison grounds to watch their mother die.&#160; Both executions took
place within the prisons.</span></p>

 

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The first
Iranian public hanging in the 21st century took place at dawn on the 19th of
March 2001 when 30 year old Fariba Tajiani-Emamqoli and four men were put to
death for drug trafficking in Tehran. Fariba was attended by a woman prison
officer and was blindfolded and had her hands tied behind her back.&#160; Like
most public hangings nowadays, the hydraulic crane of a small recovery vehicle
was used to hoist her into the air.&#160; The whole process took 25 minutes,
with the bodies being left hanging for 10 minutes before being taken down. A crowd of about 200 gathered to witness the
event and chanted "Allah akbar" - God is great and "death to the
traffickers, death to the traffickers." </span></p>

Parvin Mirzaei suffered a similar fate in public in Kouhdasht in south western
Iran on the 3rd of July 2001, having been convicted of killing a 65 year old
woman in 1997. It said Mirzaei attacked the woman because she was afraid she
had learned of her decision to run away from home. Mirzaei then fled to
Nahavand, a city in western Iran, before she was arrested. </span></p>

 

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Iran also

out to 32 year old Maryam Ayoubi, who was stoned on Wednesday, the 11th of July 2001, within Tehran's Evin

stabbing him to death with the assistance of her lover, who was hanged on the
same day.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Women who
are to be stoned are buried up to their shoulders in the ground and their head

January 2004, an unnamed woman who had been convicted of running a brothel, was
hanged in the city of Qazvin. She was given 80 lashes prior to her execution.
It was claimed that she had been luring young girls and women into

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">A truly scandalous execution took place on
Sunday, August the 15th, 2004, when 16 year old Atefeh Rajabi was hanged in
public in the town of Neka.&#160; Atefeh was executed for &#147;engaging in acts
incompatible with chastity.&#148;  
Atefeh was not represented by a lawyer at her trial and efforts by her family
to get her a lawyer were to no avail. She had to defend herself and told the
religious judge, Haji Rezaie, that he should punish the main perpetrators of
moral corruption and not the victims. She further enraged the judge by removing
some of her clothing (probably just her headscarf) and he accused her of having
a &#147;sharp tongue.&#148; It is claimed that he
pursued her execution beyond all normal procedures and finally gained the
approval of the Supreme Court and the chief of the nation&#146;s &#147;judiciary branch.&#148;
Her age was given in official court documents as 22 but her birth certificate
has been viewed by reliable sources and shows she really was just 16. <a href="atefeh.jpg">Click here</a> for her prison photo. 
At the place of execution in the town&#146;s square, the judge personally put the
rope around the girl&#146;s neck and gave the signal to the crane operator to begin
her hanging. 
Witnesses reported that she begged for mercy and had to be dragged kicking and
screaming to the execution truck. She repeatedly shouted,
"repentance" which, according to Islamic law, is supposed to grant
the accused the right to an immediate stay of execution while an appeal is
heard. 
Judge Haji Rezaie said he was pleased to hang her and is quoted as saying,
"Society has to be kept safe from acts against public morality." Her
body was left dangling from the crane for some time so people could see what
happened to teenagers who committed acts incompatible with chastity. 
It should be noted that, according to the Islamic Republic&#146;s penal code, the
presence of an attorney for the defense is mandatory regardless of the
defendant&#146;s ability to afford one. Nevertheless, Atefeh did not get an attorney, despite the efforts of her
father to raise money for one.&#160; Atefeh&#146;s boyfriend, who had been arrested
as well, received 100 lashes and was afterwards released.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">So what was
Atefeh&#146;s &#147;crime&#148;? It would seem that it amounted to having sex with her
boyfriend.&#160; According to judicial records, Atefeh had five previous
convictions for having sex with unmarried men. For each offence, she had been
jailed and flogged.&#160; She confided in her friends that she had been abused
by the guards in prison. A lawsuit was brought by Shadi Sadr, a lawyer representing
the Rajabi family, against the judiciary for wrongful execution.&#160; Sadr was
also trying to bring a murder charge against the judge, Haji Rezaie.</span></p>

Apparently, Roya had agreed to a "temporary marriage," permitted

contract expired, she married another man, also called Mohammad. Roya demanded
that her former husband return some photos but he refused, and she and her new

<p><span lang="EN-GB">There seems to be
considerable contradictions between the Iranian government&#146;s &#147;official line&#148;
and the allegations of human rights groups as to what is actually happening in
the country. There have been reports of death sentences passed on juveniles and
of stoning sentences passed on women, despite assurances to the International
Community that this horrific practice had ended in 2002.&#160; In January 2005,
at a <span>weekly briefing for journalists to which some
foreign media correspondents were invited, judiciary spokesman Jamal Karimirad,
dismissed the allegations saying that, "in the Islamic Republic, we no
longer face such verdicts and implementation of such verdicts." "I do
not know how they get such baseless information and then make a fuss over it.
The aim of such news is to harm Iran's image." There also seems to be a
dichotomy between what senior ministers are saying for foreign consumption and
what is going on at &#147;ground level&#148; with Islamic judges.</span>  
The head of Iran's judiciary, Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi Shahrudi, quashed a

prison for being an accomplice in her husband's murder. Her husband had been
murdered by her lover. Shahrudi also reprieved a woman convicted of murdering
and chopping up her husband in the same month.</span></p>

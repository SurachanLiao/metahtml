EN-GB'>ccording to a report published by the Organisation of Women Against
Execution in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Iran</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
at least 2,000 women were executed between June 1981 and 1990. They have been
able to prepare a list containing 1,428 names. 187 of these women were under
the age of 18, with nine girls under the age of 13 and 14 between the ages of
45 and 70. The youngest girl executed was just 10 years old. Thirty two of
these women were reported to have been pregnant at the time of their execution.
Many of those executed were high school and college students. Hanging was the
most common method of execution for women, although some were shot. (Large
numbers of men were shot during this period.)<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Men and women were hanged in large groups in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Tehran</st1:place></st1:City> prisons from cranes and forklift
trucks. Each crane jib or forklift had a wooden or steel beam to which the
nooses was attached and when the preparations were complete, the prisoners were
simply hoisted into the air.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span lang=EN-GB
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>Under Revolutionary law, young girls who were
sentenced to death could not be executed if they were still virgins. Thus, they
were &quot;married off&quot; to Revolutionary Guards and prison officials in
temporary marriages and then raped before their execution, to prevent them
going to heaven. The Mullahs believed that these women were ungodly and did not
deserve paradise in the next life and that if they were deprived of their
virginity, it would ensure that they went to hell.&nbsp; Therefore, on the
night prior to execution, the condemned girl was injected with a tranquilliser
and then raped by her guard(s). After the execution, the religious judge at the
prison would write out a marriage certificate and send it to the victim's
family along with a box of sweets.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>The crime of these women was to
believe in the Bahá'í religion instead of Islam and to believe in the equality
of men and women. These were considered to be very dangerous concepts by the
Revolutionary regime who had them arrested and tortured in an effort to
persuade them to convert into Islam. Several of them were subjected to the
&quot;bastinado&quot; - beating on the soles of their feet.&nbsp; They were all
given the opportunity to avoid execution by recanting their faith and
converting to Islam but none of them chose to.<br>
On the night of <st1:date Month="6" Day="18" Year="1983" w:st="on">June the

youngest prisoner was Mona Mahmudnizhad, who was just 17 years old. Her father
had been hanged some months earlier for his beliefs. At the execution ground,
she asked to be hanged last so that she could pray for all the other women.
Reportedly, she kissed the noose and recited a prayer before she was
suspended.&nbsp; <br>

23 year old Roya Ishraqi, a promising veterinary student, was executed with her
50 year old mother, Izzad Janami Ishraqi.&nbsp; <br>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span lang=EN-GB
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>A truly scandalous execution took place on
Sunday, August the 15th, 2004, when 16 year old Atefeh Rajabi was hanged in
public in the town of Neka.&nbsp; Atefeh was executed for engaging in acts
incompatible with chastity. <br>
Atefeh was not represented by a lawyer at her trial and efforts by her family
to get her a lawyer were to no avail. She had to defend herself and told the
religious judge, Haji Rezaie, that he should punish the main perpetrators of
moral corruption and not the victims. She further enraged the judge by removing
some of her clothing (probably just her headscarf) and he accused her of having
a sharp tongue.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It is claimed that he
pursued her execution beyond all normal procedures and finally gained the
approval of the Supreme Court and the chief of the nations judiciary branch.
Her age was given in official court documents as 22 but her birth certificate
has been viewed by reliable sources and shows she really was just 16. <a
href="atefeh.jpg">Click here</a> for her prison photo.<br>
At the place of execution in the towns square, the judge personally put the
rope around the girls neck and gave the signal to the crane operator to begin
her hanging.<br>
Witnesses reported that she begged for mercy and had to be dragged kicking and
screaming to the execution truck. She repeatedly shouted,
&quot;repentance&quot; which, according to Islamic law, is supposed to grant
the accused the right to an immediate stay of execution while an appeal is
heard.<br>
Judge Haji Rezaie said he was pleased to hang her and is quoted as saying,
&quot;Society has to be kept safe from acts against public morality.&quot; Her
body was left dangling from the crane for some time so people could see what
happened to teenagers who committed acts incompatible with chastity.<br>
It should be noted that, according to the Islamic Republics penal code, the
presence of an attorney for the defense is mandatory regardless of the
defendants ability to afford one.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Nevertheless, Atefeh did not get an attorney, despite the efforts of her
father to raise money for one.&nbsp; Atefehs boyfriend, who had been arrested
as well, received 100 lashes and was afterwards released.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>So what was
Atefehs crime? It would seem that it amounted to having sex with her
boyfriend.&nbsp; According to judicial records, Atefeh had five previous
convictions for having sex with unmarried men. For each offence, she had been
jailed and flogged.&nbsp; She confided in her friends that she had been abused
by the guards in prison. A lawsuit was brought by Shadi Sadr, a lawyer representing
the Rajabi family, against the judiciary for wrongful execution.&nbsp; Sadr was
also trying to bring a murder charge against the judge, Haji Rezaie.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>There seems to be
considerable contradictions between the Iranian governments official line
and the allegations of human rights groups as to what is actually happening in
the country. There have been reports of death sentences passed on juveniles and
of stoning sentences passed on women, despite assurances to the International
Community that this horrific practice had ended in 2002.&nbsp; In January 2005,
at a <span style='color:black'>weekly briefing for journalists to which some
foreign media correspondents were invited, judiciary spokesman Jamal Karimirad,
dismissed the allegations saying that, &quot;in the Islamic Republic, we no
longer face such verdicts and implementation of such verdicts.&quot; &quot;I do
not know how they get such baseless information and then make a fuss over it.
The aim of such news is to harm Iran's image.&quot; There also seems to be a
dichotomy between what senior ministers are saying for foreign consumption and
what is going on at ground level with Islamic judges.</span> <br>
The head of Iran's judiciary, Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi Shahrudi, quashed a
stoning sentence for a woman convicted of adultery on October the 18th, 2004.
Seema had been sentenced to stoning and 100 lashes for adultery and 15 years in
prison for being an accomplice in her husband's murder. Her husband had been
murdered by her lover. Shahrudi also reprieved a woman convicted of murdering
and chopping up her husband in the same month.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

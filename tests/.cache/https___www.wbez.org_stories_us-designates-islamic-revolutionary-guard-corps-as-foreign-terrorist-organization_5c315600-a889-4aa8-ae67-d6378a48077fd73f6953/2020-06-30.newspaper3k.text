Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced, this week, that the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) will be designated as a foreign terrorist organization. The IRGC is a branch of Iran’s armed forces. Pompeo’s announcement marks the first time that U.S. has given that designation to part of another country’s government. Just prior to Israel’s elections on April 9, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tweeted his gratitude, writing in Hebrew, “Thank you, my dear friend, President Donald Trump, for answering another one of my important requests.” Worldview producer Julian Hayda went to Chicago's Lincoln Park neighborhood this morning to ask people on the street whether they'd heard of any terrorist attacks conducted by the Revolutionary Guards.

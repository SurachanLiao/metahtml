<h1><strong>CAKAP SAJA</strong></h1>
<p>*</p>
<p>Like talking its way into Regime Change, like Democracy, like Elections&#8230;</p>
<p>USA talks to Virus to talk its way out, like yada-yada Indians, like Anglophiles. They know only how to talk because that&#8217;s all they have, from an Indian hole between a pair of Indian legs to the tip of a White man&#8217;s crown. Keep it up&#8230; brother, sister!</p>
<p>Below are some cakap saja cases.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p></p>
<p>*</p>
<p></p>
<p>*</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE&#8230;UPDATE&#8230;UPDATE</strong></p>
<p>We Chinese let the Virus do the talking back to USA</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Keep it up, America! We Chinese virus are right behind you. Right behind!</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>US Dollar Hegemony is a Wimp</strong></h3>
<p>The US has a lot and a lot and a lot of money, as much as it can print them because its people and countries elsewhere, <strong>it is assumed</strong>, need US dollars more than anything else in the world; can&#8217;t do without it. US can even use money, its US dollar, to punish poor people and to cripple countries it doesn&#8217;t like, such as Venezuela, Iran, Cuba, Syria, like it had tried on Russia and China and Nicaragua.</p>
<p>But that &#8212; money &#8212; is not the <strong>fundamental problem</strong> facing American life and death today nor is it the most powerful thing in the world. What Covid-19 shows is that, that thing called money, US dollar, is not the power nor the most important thing in life! What is?</p>
<p>For the answer, see below, though that&#8217;s not spelled out &#8212; reporters are just that.</p>
<p>What you see and hear in the clip is pure, utterly pure manifestation of that &#8216;fundamental problem&#8217; inside America and in its hold on its outside paid agents, and on countries and in stupid people like Steven Gan, Rais Hussin, and in other Anglophiles in Damansara, and like those Indians shitting in New Delhi sidewalks even today.</p>
<p>Rachel Maddow below is describing the manifestation of that problem. But, stupid as White people are, she imagines that if the US stop manifesting the problem, then the problem is resolved. That&#8217;s exactly the attitude the US had in dealing with Covid-19 &#8212; first, they begin by talking to the virus.</p>
<p>Pompeo, Trump call that virus the Chinese virus in the belief that, since this is a Chinese virus, the Chinese needs to answer back, perhaps even provide US the solution to its fundamental problem and the manifestations of that problem.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t. Even if &#8212; and that&#8217;s a big if &#8212; America wants solutions, don&#8217;t ask us. Ask <a href="https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/517116">Phlip Rodrigues</a> at Mkini, India&#8217;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_gUM8rL-Lrg6O3adPW9K1g">WION</a>, Australia&#8217;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/skynews">Sky</a>, they are so clever, they have so much of spittle, surely they know the answers.</p>
<p>Even the virus doesn&#8217;t have to answer back.</p>
<p>But, when it did so, it was done without talking. How? Go back to top of post and to the charts above.</p>

<p>Rachel! You just don&#8217;t get it!</p>

On Monday night, the South Korean newspaper The Daily NK reported that North Korean Dictator Kim Jong Un has been absent from major national events after undergoing heart surgery on April 12.

Later, both CNN and Bloomberg news cited United States government officials who said that Kim is in “grave danger” and had taken “a turn for the worse,” respectively.

South Korean and Chinese officials have been doubtful about such reports, saying that they have not seen anything out of the ordinary from North Korea.

Still, U.S. National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien said the White House is following these reports “very closely.”

Kim Reported To Be in Poor Condition

The White House says it’s looking “very closely” into reports that North Korean Dictator Kim Jong Un is in critical condition following an alleged heart surgery, but South Korea says it doesn’t believe those reports are true.

“We’re monitoring these reports very closely, and as you know North Korea is a very closed society,” National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien said on Fox and Friends Tuesday morning. “There is not a free press there, they are parsimonious with the information they provide on many things, including the health of Kim Jong Un, so we’re monitoring those developments closely.”

Currently, nothing is truly known about Kim’s condition. The speculation around his status began Monday night when the South Korean newspaper The Daily NK reported that Kim Jong Un underwent heart surgery on April 12th.

When it was first published, that article said multiple sources from inside North Korea had told the outlet that Kim had received that surgery. The paper’s sources went on to say that Kim has been suffering from inflammation of blood vessels involving the heart since last August and that the surgery was likely due to a number of factors, including obesity, smoking habits, and overwork.

Later, The Daily NK later issued a correction saying that this article was based on a single source, but still, the questions around Kim’s health persisted.

That’s for a few reasons. First, on April 12, the same day as his reported surgery, North Korean state media reported that Kim had visited an airbase and observed drills by fighter planes. Notably, that’s nothing out of the ordinary for the dictator.

On April 14, however, state media did not mention Kim as having attended a weapons test, even though he normally supervises those events. Then, the next day on April 15, North Korea observed its most important national holiday: The Day of the Sun.

That holiday, which is comparable in scale to Christmas in the United States, commemorates the birthday of Kim’s grandfather, Kim Il-sung, who founded North Korea.

Again, state media did not mention whether Kim had attended that ceremony. It also didn’t publish any pictures of him there, even though it did publish photos of other top leaders.

All of that is extremely odd because Kim has never missed that event before.

More Media Outlets Pick Up the Story

After The Daily NK, more news outlets picked up the story Monday night, including CNN, which reported that the United States was monitoring intelligence that Kim is now in “grave danger” following his surgery.

Notably, that’s according to a U.S. official “with direct knowledge.”

CNN also said that a second source familiar with the intelligence told them the U.S. has been closely monitoring reports on Kim’s health. According to a third source, concerns about Kim’s health are “credible but the severity is hard to assess.”

In addition to that, Bloomberg News reported that a U.S. official said Kim had taken a turn for the worse after his surgery.

Later in the night, MSNBC anchor Katy Tur tweeted, “North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is brain dead, according to two US officials. He recently had cardiac surgery and slipped into a coma, according to one US current and one former US official.

If true, Tur had just tweeted massive news that raised multiple questions about the reclusive country’s relationship with other nations, as well as questions about who would succeed Kim.

It turns out, however, that Tur’s claim may not be as confirmed as she originally thought.

“I’ve deleted that last tweet out of an abundance of caution,” she later tweeted. “Waiting on more info. Apologies.”

South Korea and China Doubtful of Reports of Kim

South Korean officials have also said that they’ve seen nothing that indicated Kim was in poor condition.

“No unusual signs have been identified inside North Korea,” presidential spokesman Kang Min-seok told the Yonhap News Agency. There is nothing we can confirm with regard to Chairman Kim’s alleged health problem.”

Another anonymous government official told Yonhap, “There is nothing unusual going on in North Korea. It’s not true.”

That official also said that Kim appears to be acting “normally.”

Reuters has also reported that South Korean and Chinese officials are doubtful of reports that Kim is in critical condition.

Speaking to BuzzFeed News, North Korea expert Andray Abrahamian from George Mason University in South Korea said, “The Daily NK report that started this is underground, single source reporting from within the most opaque country in the world. That isn’t useless but also faces limitations.”

“Then CNN went with a dramatic headline and anonymous sourcing from the United States that was also very vague but made it seem as if there was more credible information than there probably is,” Abrahamian added. “Then the world’s media is compelled to write something lest they be missing out on a major story.”

If, in fact, something is wrong with Kim and he ultimately ends up dying, it’s very likely that information wouldn’t be known until North Korea decides to tell the world. When his father Kim Jong-il died in 2011, even South Korea didn’t know about it until days later when the North Korean state media announced it.

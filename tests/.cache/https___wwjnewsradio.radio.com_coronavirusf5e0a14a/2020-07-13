            <div class="item__body">Sometimes you have to see how the experts do it.
  Dr. Anthony Fauci has become one of the most trusted authorities on coronavirus and our country’s response to the respiratory illness.
  Dr. Fauci, who is the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), has advised Americans and officials on the state of the outbreak and risks to look out for.
  But how does he handle COVID-19 in his day-to-day life?
  Fauci recently spoke to the Washington Post about how he is going about routine everyday activities amid the pandemic.
  Based on his responses, these are a few measures Fauci takes regularly to keep safe against the virus.

    Frequent testing

  A major plus of his role on the White House coronavirus task force and his close work with Trump is that the health expert is tested regularly.
  Fauci told the Post that he is tested for COVID-19 every time he goes to the White House.

    Wearing a face mask

  Fauci is a staunch advocate of facial coverings, and is careful to wear them whenever necessary in his personal life.
  “It dominates everything I do,” he told the Post when asked when and where he wears masks.
  He continued: “The only time I don’t wear one is when I am alone, when I am home with my wife, or when I am speaking in public — provided there is 6 feet between me and the people to whom I am speaking, as was the case when I answered questions at the recent Congressional hearings.”

    Quarantining from at-risk family

  One of the most difficult parts of adhering to safety guidelines amid the coronavirus lockdown is the need to restrict interaction with those closest to you. And the rule is no exception, even for a top official like Fauci.
  The health expert explained the measures his family took when his daughter, a teacher from New Orleans, stayed at home with him and his wife when she was allowed to teach her classes online.
  “When she got here she went straight through the back entrance into the basement. She stayed in our basement, which has a room with a bed, a shower, electricity, and she did not come upstairs for 14 days. My wife brought food down to her on paper dishes.”
  Fauci admits that he had the urge to greet his daughter with a hug, but she wouldn’t let him out of prudence.
  He explained: “She lives in a very high risk city, and she wouldn’t let us near her. I wanted to hug her when she arrived, but she said: ‘No way, dad.’ She came upstairs after 14 days, and then stayed with us for several months.”

    Not hugging or shaking hands

  While the temptation to hug his own daughter was significant, Fauci is overall reluctant to physically greet people and thinks it might be long before that becomes normal again.
  “I think it’s going to be a while,” he said when asked if he’ll ever shake hands again, or hug or kiss someone.
  “The infection rate will have to be extremely low or nonexistent, or we have to have a vaccine. Right now, I don’t even think about doing it.”

    Grocery shopping at odd times

  Like many of us, Fauci goes grocery shopping. But he takes certain precautions.
  “I do physically go to the grocery store, but I wear a mask and keep my distance,” he explained.
  He also said that he goes at times when there might be less people around.
  “I usually go at odd times. I spend half the day alone in my office, and I’m part-time at the White House. In the late afternoon or evening, when I’m finished with the White House, I go shopping for groceries, or to drugstores.”
  Fauci did say that he doesn’t wipe down packaging when he gets back, opting instead to give his hands a thorough washing when everything it put away.
  “I don’t disinfect the bags. In general, I will take the materials out of the bags, then wash my hands with soap and water, and then use Purell, and let everything sit for a day.”

    Not dining at restaurants

  Even as establishments have begun to reopen, Fauci is strict on not dining at restaurants — either inside or outside. But he does order out.
  “We don’t do anything inside,” he said frankly when asked. “I don’t eat in restaurants. We do get takeout.”

    Not flying or using public transportation

  Fauci is also steadfast in his refusal to fly or use public transportation, based on his age and past experience getting sick on commutes.
  “I’m 79 years old. I am not getting on a plane,” he said when asked. “I have been on flights where I’ve been seated near people who were sneezing and coughing, and then three days later, I’ve got it. So, no chance. No Metro, no public transportation. I’m in a high risk group, and I don’t want to play around.”

    Skipping the gym

  Fauci’s still getting exercise — just not at the gym, which he deems too risky.
  I wouldn’t go to a gym. I need to be so careful,” he told the Post. “I don’t want to take a chance. I have a pool at home, so I swim in that.”
  He also gets physical activity from walking, sometimes on his own and sometimes with his wife, Christine Grady.
  “I do power-walking with Chris. I was running until about a year ago, but every time I went running, my back would tighten up the next morning. So now I walk the same distance. It just takes longer. We go every day with few exceptions, 3.5 miles per day during the week, four miles over the weekend. Prior to covid-19, I did it at lunch alone in the parks near NIH. Now, I do it in the evening with Chris around the neighborhood. On the weekends, Chris and I do it together on the C&amp;O canal.”

    Holding off on seeing the doctor unless necessary

  The doctor may be ready to see him, but Fauci isn’t quite ready for a check-up with his doctor or dentist unless it is necessary, which he says it may be soon.
  When asked if he’s making routine trips to his physicians, he said: “No, not yet, although I might check in within the next few weeks with my physician to get some soothing meds for my throat since I have a hoarse voice from so many briefings and interviews. He will probably take a look and say: ‘Just stop talking so much.’”

            <div class="item__body">As we continue to navigate these unprecedented times, KCBS Radio is getting the answers to your questions about the coronavirus pandemic.
  We took a look at the rising cases across the country and ways we can all limit the spread of disease with Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, infectious disease specialist at UCSF.

    

  Let me start by asking you to give us your broad assessment of where we stand right now, vis-a-vis where, maybe a month ago, you might have thought things would be today.
  Totally. A month ago I was looking forward to a haircut, I was looking forward to reopening and may be venturing forth, to maybe trying out some outside dining. But right now I scaled back my expectations. I'm starting to feel nervous and a little bit anxious.
  So what happened here?
  So there was the Memorial Day effect in California. I think people were tired, you know? We were really good, we were unified for a long time. People were being really good. California was a miracle. California, we looked at the other states and people were looking at us for advice and how we did it. And now, Memorial Day was a nice weekend and people just let loose. They went out, particularly starting in Southern California with the beaches and that's what prompted Governor Newsom to close down some of the Orange County/Huntington Beach areas. And I think it just took off from there.
  The challenge for a lot of laypeople is to figure out what the message really is. We're told outdoors is better, but then the beach isn't good. You need exercise, but you can't go on the beach. So what is the best way to sum up what we really want people to hear?
  Totally, I think part of the problem is somewhat confusing messaging and the mixed messaging. Part of it is because as we moved on in the epidemic, we understood more about the science, and I think we have a better understanding now. Although I would say that every hour is a new day with COVID-19.
  I'd summarize it by the three W's in terms of the ways we can protect ourselves, and forget about the laundry list of 20 things that I think people came out with originally. You boil it down to three things to ward off COVID-19. You wear masks, you wash your hands and you watch your distance. And if you had to choose one thing, I would wear my mask.
  That does distill it down, now you've got it down to a phrase like "click it or ticket" or "don't drink and drive" or "don't mess with Texas," right?
  I know, exactly.
  Why has it been so hard, though, for the health establishment and the political establishment to do that?
  Well, I think because within our highest echelons of leadership there was one feeling and then there was the public health officials that were saying something else, so I think nationally we didn't have a very consistent message. And I think in the state we did a lot better. There was a better alignment between science, public health and leadership. And I think in California that's why we probably did much better. And, of course, the Bay Area was the most conservative. I think London Breed was really prescient in closing down or sheltering in place, the first in the country. And then three days later, California followed generally. So I think the alignment between science and leadership sounds like a no brainer, but it hasn't been the case nationally.
  Okay, let's get to questions sent in by our listeners to askus@kcbsradio.com. First one: are we able to determine where these new cases are coming from? By that I mean, are they from workplaces or bars or gyms or... ???
  Yeah, that's a great question. I think we get some information from contact tracers. Contact tracers are like the gumshoe detectives in this whole business. They get alerted about the positive cases, then they go and investigate. They asked the positive cases, who have you been around in the last week or so?
  So I think we've been getting some answers in our area. And I think some of the most compelling outbreaks that we've seen from these contact tracers were around graduation parties and a lot of indoor celebrations that multigenerational families were having behind closed doors. And I think it's a little bit insidious because you know, you're seeing your uncles or your aunts - you don't think of them as high risk - probably for the first time in a long time. And you put 50 people close together having a barbecue, and even though you know these people, nobody is necessarily obviously ill and the nature of this disease is such that you can't tell who has disease or not, because there's a lot of asymptomatic spread. So that was the focus of a lot of transmissions recently in the Sacramento area in particular, Solano, I think.
  And then there were work parties as well. And then we got some information from other parts of the country from contact investigators as well. Like in Texas and Mississippi, they were associated with frat parties and pledge parties, so a lot of indoor activities. And certainly the biggest and scariest example of an indoor situation is what's happening in San Quentin now, with over 1,000 prisoners infected.
  In fact, that gets to one of the questions we had here. Would it be possible to conduct a stat comparative vaccine trial at San Quentin? Coordinate with Moderna, Pfizer, Roche and other major vaccine research companies to set up a comparative trial among those staff and inmates who volunteer and who are testing negative for the virus and with negative IGG and IGM antibodies?
  I think that would be a great situation from a scientific or epidemiological perspective, but there are a lot of protections from an ethical perspective around doing studies in the prison population. So I think because of these challenges, even though there's a captive audience there with disease, it will be hard to implement versus volunteers in the general population.
  I've heard a lot of reports about mutations in the coronavirus and how that might be affecting the spread. Can you ask your guest to address that?
  Yeah. So I think there's a lot of talk about mutations, there's this mutation that's being circulated on media. But I think right now my gut feeling is that there hasn't been great evidence for increased human transmission. There's a lot of lab evidence that this protein, this spike on COVID is a little stickier to hit the receptor. And we can use these minor differences in proteins to tell the origin of a virus. For example, this is the Europe virus, this is the Chinese virus, this came from Washington state. But beyond that, there isn't convincing evidence that it's worse or better and most importantly, I think the vaccine is going to be kind of robust because it's a relatively simple virus compared to influenza or even HIV.
  San Francisco has a higher population density than the rest of the Bay Area but death rates appear higher outside of San Francisco. Why is that?
  That's a great question, and I think it's multi-factorial. I think the proportion of people wearing masks in the San Francisco area, just anecdotally and me walking around, compared to other places that I visited recently like wine country seems to be higher. The population of San Francisco is generally older and the new epidemiology of this particular surge is in the younger population, kind of like the graduation, getting together, beach party kind of population. So I think San Francisco has been a little bit more protected.
  Also, it's very enriched with contact tracers because the program started here, so there are a lot more per population. They can go out quickly, identify people who are infected and ask them to quarantine from others. And then finally, I think there's been a lot of initiatives to target vulnerable populations in San Francisco, like in the Bayview and in the Mission so that you not just wait for people to come and ask to be tested, you actually go out and to the community and and test the entire population.
  A coworker told me that her sister-in-law is positive for COVID-19. My coworkers sees her family a couple of times a month. The last time she was around them was on June 27th. I don't work in an enclosed office with my co worker, but I've talked with her a few times from a few feet away. Should I be concerned about having my small family over for a Fourth of July barbecue?
  So it depends on when she had disease. We know from studies that even though you continue to detect virus, it probably isn't alive anymore after about, I would say, six to seven days. So generally speaking, you're going to be less at risk, particularly if everyone wears masks. And try to maintain social distance, but the most important thing again is wearing masks.
  If you're not really sure then definitely have as many people wear masks as possible and the longer you get away from the initial infection, the less risky that person is going to be in general. The biggest bang for the buck is the person who is infected wearing a mask, but the more people that wear a mask the better it is for the group.
  And this gets to a question I've heard a lot of variations of from people who want to do some traveling, want to catch up with family, trying to figure out the best way time-wise to figure out if they're clean. In other words, when do I get a test? How do I know how long that test is valid? How safe can I feel before I plan a trip or before I go see Grandpa?
  So I would see that if you can get a test and you can quarantine yourself or stay relatively safe in a bubble for about a week, we generally say two weeks of quarantine but that gives a buffer. But if you want a general time from when you can get exposed to when you develop symptoms, that's usually about a week. So you say you get a test, which is a snapshot, and you wait a week later or you feel relatively protected for a week from the rest of society in whatever way. Then I would say that time is relatively safe for you, and I would believe that you would be safe to see Grandma or Grandpa.
  You mentioned a bubble, and that's in the minds of a lot of people who are trying to figure out, how do I expand my circle here and how do I verify safety? How do people maintain a safe bubble? Can you create a safe bubble without testing?
  Well it's challenging, I think people already did their bubbles early on in the pandemic here in the Bay Area, and it was generally in several settings, like either in the family unit or a couple of families living in the same house on different floors. Or for child care, even essential workers I knew and healthcare workers had no choice but to make their own bubble because nobody was able to take care of the kids. So they had to go into work, so they made friends with a family. And I think if your COVID values were the same and people had generally the same ideas about how to maintain less risky behaviors, that's the original bubble.
  I think in terms of expanding the bubble, I will be very cautious. Maybe do it by one or two, try to see people outdoors if you could. Those will be ways to do it in a less risky way. But certainly not having a class reunion, it's probably the ultimate un-bubble, so to speak.
  (laughs) That's a good way to put it, I like that. There's a bubble and then there's the un-bubble. Okay, next question. People see a lot of numbers these days and this question asks, what defines a case of COVID? Does it mean a positive test with a person suffering from at least one symptom? Or do the numbers include people who have tested positive but are asymptomatic?
  Yes, so the case definition is relatively straightforward. With COVID you have a positive RNA, or a virus test, and that's the way it counted. Certainly there are people who - because it's just a snapshot - may not turn positive for a while. There are other ways of looking at how much disease is in our community and there are very clever ways of doing it. They don't count from the public health perspective, but there are smart thermometers and citizen scientists with people calling in with the symptoms to centralized numbers so you can get a snapshot of the community. And these smart thermometers have been distributed, they kind of feed into some centralized database, and then you can see what fevers look like in the community.
  And they've been used in very interesting ways. Yesterday I saw this really cool study where they show that as Bay Area residents and California residents drove more, temperatures increase in the community. It just means that you're going to increase risk by just being more mobile.
  We are actually expecting to interview the CEO of one of these smart thermometer companies tomorrow morning, and it is fascinating the leading edge or early warning data that can come out of just fever. Do we know that fever is always present with COVID?
  No, it definitely isn't always present, but it's a pretty good marker. I would say that at some point more than 75% of people would develop a fever as an indication that they have COVID as opposed to other kinds of respiratory infections like the common cold where fever isn't usually a feature. And of course, this time of year, the only thing going for fever is generally COVID at this time. But in the winter it'll be more challenging because, of course, influenza can also cause fevers.
  Why did I just receive a disclaimer/qualifier with my negative COVID test results that asymptomatic carriers might get false negatives? How is the virus transmitted if tests cannot detect it in the transmitter?
  Well I think the idea is that the virus test is just a snapshot, and it may take some time for people who have no symptoms or very mild symptoms to progress to more full-blown disease. So your negative test may be 1/4 negative, even not thinking about the test characteristics but just from the ark of the disease. And then there's a second issue, which is a test characteristic itself. It's probably about 80% sensitive for a general population. Of course in the hospital population the test is pretty good, because by the time you come to the hospital, your pre-test probability of disease is higher so the test is going to perform better.
  But, you know, in the worst case scenario the test is still a pretty good test, it's just looking for fragments of the virus. But again, you may not have symptoms and you may have a negative test, but like two days later, you may get symptoms and then if you did the test again, you may be positive. But of course, statistically speaking, that's not likely in most people unless you increase your risk. So those are some nuances about the test and the disclaimer about the test.
  In the United States, infections have been level or up for the last eight weeks yet deaths have steadily gone down, why is this?
  Because I think the information we've been getting about this new second wavelet - because the first wave never really went away - is that it's in younger individuals, and it kind of goes around with graduation parties and the frat parties and the pledge parties and the beach situations. So in these young people, we know from data that they may get sick, but not in the same proportion as older individuals. And they certainly don't die in the same proportion as older individuals. That's the general feeling and that's what I believe myself, but others think that it's still early and you may have a lag in deaths. But there have been enough weeks of risky behaviors where we should have seen an uptick in deaths by now if it was a real uptick.
  The second issue, of course, is that we've been better at treating COVID. Since the end of February to now we have remdesivir, which is an antiviral, we have convalescent plasma, we have dexamethasone, which is a steroid shown to decrease mortality. And we've been getting better at ICU care. So as long as we keep in step with the number of beds that we have available and the number of ICU beds, we're taking care of patients in a much better way.
  Are Marin residents at higher risk because of the San Quentin outbreak, or is it somewhat contained?
  Undeniably Marin residents are at increased risk because of the San Quentin outbreak. Prison care is public health for several reasons. There are more than 1,000 prisoners now infected and I think about 100 staff, if not more. And not everybody has been tested yet because they've run out of tests. So the reason why it affects community health is because, first of all, a lot of people in community work in the prison system - guards, concessions, administrators - and they go back and forth between the community and the prison system.
  The second issue is of course, the prison doesn't have an ICU, the prison doesn't have an acute hospital. So when the prisoners get sick - and they're starting to get sick now in larger numbers - they flood the regional hospitals. So for example at UCSF, this week we admitted several prisoners because we're helping to decompress the Marin hospitals because they don't have the capacity for all of these sick prisoners.
  This one kind of goes back to the mutation question from earlier but a little more specific. Do you know anything about the D614G mutation to the SARS virus?
  So I don't know too much about that specific mutation to the SARS virus, if you're talking about the SARS-CoV-2 virus. If this is the gene mutation that people have been talking about recently, that's associated with increased transmission, but not necessarily increased mortality. But again, there isn't convincing human transmission data. It's all sort of like theoretical and in the lab based on a model. So I guess I would say, take caution with these laboratory pronouncements without having convincing human data.
  I think really the main risk factor still is old fashioned, which is getting a bunch of mouths and noses together in close confined spaces, indoors more than outdoors.
  And one last time, lay out the three W's?
  The three W's: to ward off COVID-19, wear your mask, wash your hands and watch your distance.

            <div class="item__body">Many individuals are not aware of the financial assistance options available to them during the coronavirus pandemic.
  A recent survey from Credit Karma found that 80% of unemployed Americans haven’t pursued relief measures, reports CNBC.
  For the survey, the website polled 1,037 adults in April about the relief options available to them from the federal government during the pandemic.
  While many people are aware of the stimulus checks from the CARES Act which are still being issued this month, there are other ways to access financial help during this time. These are some of the options that might still be available to you.

        Paid leave
      
      
Some individuals who are out-of-work may be eligible for two weeks of paid leave through the Families First Coronavirus Response Act. The bill grants full pay to individuals who qualify for various reasons, including the inability to work because:
—you are under a stay-home order;—you are exhibiting coronavirus symptoms and are seeking a diagnosis; and—you must care for a child whose school or daycare is closed amid the pandemic.
Individuals caring for a sick family member may also qualify for a portion of pay through the act.

        Utility bill relief
      
      
Several utility companies like Con Edison are suspending service disconnections during the turbulent time of the pandemic. Check with your provider about what other relief options may be available, such as setting up payment plans or waiving late fees. Additionally, the Department of Housing and Urban Development outlines programs for relief during coronavirus.

        Health insurance extensions
      
      
Some unemployed individuals without health coverage may be able to obtain insurance if their state is holding ACA special enrollments. Refer to AARP, which is continually updating a running list of states offering extensions on their health exchanges. You can also check if you ad your family qualify for Medicaid by using the Healthcare.gov calculator.

        Rent and mortgage relief
      
      
The CARES Act offers aid for homeowners who are unable to keep up on their federally-backed mortgages. Many states and cities are also currently putting a pause on evictions; these stop orders are being continually updated on this document maintained by a Columbia law school professor.

        Tax deadline extensions
      
      
In March, the federal government announced that the tax day deadline is being postponed until July 15. Many states are also delaying filing and payments; these are being tracked here by the American Institute of CPAs. Refer to this guide to see the tax ramifications of coronavirus relief.

            <div class="item__body">Is it possible to contract both coronavirus and the flu at once?
  Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease professor at Vanderbilt University in Nashville and medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, told Today that while it is quite unusual, it is possible.
  Dr. Schaffner reported that there have been cases of individuals who have contracted both illnesses at once.
  "There has been a handful or less of such instances reported,"  Schaffner said. "We would anticipate that, if anything, you’re likely to get more severe disease."
  When tests for coronavirus were not available, doctors would test people for other illnesses.
  “If you were to test first for flu and the flu was positive, you would not test further,” Schaffner said.
  This means that some people who had the flu and the coronavirus were not captured.
  While COVID-19 initially spread across the country, flu season was winding down.
  Dr. David Cennimo, an infectious disease expert at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, said that early data from China showed that people only had the coronavirus with no other illnesses.
  He explained the reason for this is because COVID-19 dominated other infections.
  A study by JAMA found that in the U.S., about 20% of patients had coronavirus while having another viral infection. The report also mentioned that having the coronavirus and flu infection is rare.
  “We don’t know if someone would do worse infected with both viruses at the same time, but it is certainly possible,” Cennimo said.
  In the future, the doctor said it is going to be essential to try to minimize the cases of influenza.

            <div class="item__body">Over two million people and counting have tested positive for coronavirus in the United States, according to the World Health Organization.
  As Americans navigate the virus amid rising case numbers, health officials say it's important to know which symptoms to look out for.
  In addition to more common symptoms specified by the CDC, health experts have seen the virus manifest in a number of rarer, odder and more unique ways.
  Below are some lesser known symptoms to look out for.

    Nausea, diarrhea and other digestive symptoms

  Early in the outbreak of the virus, researchers reported that nearly half of COVID-19 patients complained of diarrhea and other digestive issues.
  "Clinicians must bear in mind that digestive symptoms, such as diarrhea, may be a presenting feature of COVID-19, and that the index of suspicion may need to be raised earlier in these cases rather than waiting for respiratory symptoms to emerge," wrote investigators from the Wuhan Medical Treatment Expert Group for COVID-19.
  According to findings, these patients with digestive symptoms exhibited various issues, including loss of appetite (nearly 84%), diarrhea (29%), vomiting (0.8%) and abdominal pain (0.4%).
  The research also showed that patients with these symptoms waited longer to be admitted to the hospital — 9 days versus 7.3 days — suggesting they took longer to seek care because they didn't display more typical respiratory issues.

    Pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome

  A dangerous inflammation of the heart and other organs has been detected in child patients with COVID-19 across the country.
  Just this week, doctors dubbed the symptoms with an official name: pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome.
  Children exhibiting the rare but dangerous complication have been identified across the country, in at least seven states and the Washington, D.C. area, according to a May 7 report from NBC.
  The outlet reports at least 85 such cases in children across the U.S., with the majority out of New York State.
  The symptoms, which can inflame blood vessels in the heart, were first reported in late April.
  Doctors say that the increased occurrences do not necessarily suggest that the number of cases has grown. Rather, they surmise that it is likely the result of an increased awareness of the strange symptoms.
  The syndrome mirrors symptoms of other inflammatory illnesses, such as Kawasaki disease and toxic shock-like syndrome.
  "All the kids have some sort of severe inflammation," said Dr. Michael Bell, head of critical care medicine at Children's National Hospital in Washington, D.C., where two cases have been reported, with 15 more children in intensive care displaying some kind of massive inflammatory response to COVID-19.
  "I think it's all part of some spectrum of disease that's evolving as we learn more and more about this infection and its consequences,” Bell added.
  The new syndrome seems to be the result of a children’s immune systems going into overdrive following a coronavirus infection, although it is too soon to pin all of the cases on the virus.
  "We're all still waiting for the smoking gun to be sure it is associated with COVID-19," said Dr. Audrey John, chief of pediatric infectious diseases at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.
  However, the occurrences are "certainly suspicious," John added.

    'Happy hypoxia'

  Doctors have been confounded by an odd new coronavirus symptom referred to by some as "happy hypoxia."
  Also dubbed with the more neutral term "silent," the symptom is observed in some COVID-19 patients who are talking and in no discernible distress, yet exhibit oxygen levels low enough to cause unconsciousness or death, reports The Guardian.
  While a person of normal health can be expected to have an oxygen saturation of 95% or more, doctors who have observed the strange effect have reported coronavirus patients with levels in the 80s, 70s and even 50s or lower in some extreme cases.
  It's no wonder that this symptoms is raising serious questions about what physicians know about the virus's effects on the lungs, and whether there could be more effective ways of treating it.
  “It’s intriguing to see so many people coming in, quite how hypoxic they are,” said Dr Jonathan Bannard-Smith, a critical care and anaesthesia consultant at Manchester Royal Infirmary in the UK.
  He added: “We’re seeing oxygen saturations that are very low and they’re unaware of that. We wouldn’t usually see this phenomenon in influenza or community-acquired pneumonia. It’s very much more profound and an example of very abnormal physiology going on before our eyes.”
  Dr. Mike Charlesworth, an anaesthetist at Wythenshawe hospital in Manchester, said that low oxygen levels caused by lung conditions that manifest as hypoxia typically leave patients feeling significantly ill. But this is not necessarily the case with individuals who suffer this strange COVID symptom.
  “With pneumonia or a pulmonary embolism they wouldn’t be sat up in bed talking to you,” Charlesworth said. “We just don’t understand it. We don’t know if it’s causing organ damage that we’re not able to detect. We don’t understand if the body’s compensating.”
  In fact, Charlesworth lived through the symptom when he was suffering from the virus himself back in March. Sick, with a fever and cough, the doctor spent 48 bed-ridden hours exhibits signs of hypoxia.
  “I was sending very strange messages on my phone. I was essentially delirious," he said. "Looking back I probably should’ve come into hospital. I’m pretty sure my oxygen levels were low. My wife commented that my lips were very dusky. But I was probably hypoxic and my brain probably wasn’t working very well.”
  Conventional medical wisdom states that as oxygen levels in the body decrease, vital organs like the heart and brain are at risk, with patients typically losing consciousness at sub-75% level saturation.
  In such cases, the body is left feeling breathless as higher levels of carbon dioxide make it harder for the lungs to clear oxygen. But in the cases of "happy hypoxia" seen in coronavirus patients, this vital response does not kick in.

    Foot sores

  One strange side effect of coronavirus could be foot sores, according to a team of Spanish physicians.
  The Spanish General Council of Official Podiatrist Colleges has warned experts that some patients have experienced lesions on their feet, the New York Post reports.
  The researchers say that the marks are "similar to chickenpox or measles."
  “They are purple lesions (very similar to those of chickenpox, measles or chilblains) which usually appear on the toes and normally heal without leaving a mark,” the organization stated.
  While the so-called "COVID toe" symptoms have mainly appeared in children and adolescent with COVID-19, it has also been detected in some adult patients.
  The council clarified that despite reports, there have been no scientific studies to back up the findings.

    'Fizzing'

  Some COVID-19 patients have warned of a peculiar symptom referred to as "fizzing."
  The side effect — a buzzing sensation felt throughout the body — has been reported by patients describing symptoms on Twitter.
  One user, @miafia, described the "electric feeling on my skin" that she felt from her first day of COVID-19 symptoms.
  While doctors who have treated virus patients say it's not common, they surmise it may be an autoimmune response that effects patients’ nervous system.
  Dr. Daniel Griffin, who estimates that he’s seen about 50 coronavirus patients daily since the illness gripped New York, says he’s heard mention of the reaction.
  “Clearly it’s been identified, but we’re just not sure yet how widespread it is,” Griffin, who is chief of infectious disease at ProHealth Care Associates, told New York Post.
  Griffin ponders whether the feeling may result from disease-fighting “antibodies interfering with the way nerves work,” but says neurologists still aren’t sure if it’s the body’s response to the virus or the virus itself causing the feeling.

    Loss of smell

  “Significant numbers” of known coronavirus patients with lost or reduced sense of smell have been reported by South Korea, Italy and China, according to USA Today.
  In a joint statement, Claire Hopkins, president of the British Rhinological Society, and Nirmal Kumar, president of ENT UK, wrote about the occurrence of anosmia (the loss of smell) in patients around the world, including those who otherwise don’t exhibit major symptoms.
  "In Germany it is reported that more than 2 in 3 confirmed cases have anosmia,” they wrote. “In South Korea, where testing has been more widespread, 30% of patients testing positive have had anosmia as their major presenting symptom in otherwise mild cases.”

    Loss of taste

  In addition to loss of smell, COVID-19 patients have reported loss of taste.
  NBA player Rudy Gobert of the Utah Jazz revealed he experienced both loss of taste and smell after testing positive for the virus in March.
Just to give you guys an update, loss of smell and taste is definitely one of the symptoms, haven’t been able to smell anything for the last 4 days. Anyone experiencing the same thing?— Rudy Gobert (@rudygobert27) March 22, 2020“Just to give you guys an update, loss of smell and taste is definitely one of the symptoms, haven’t been able to smell anything for the last 4 days. Anyone experiencing the same thing?” Gobert tweeted.
  While both loss of taste and smell can be symptomatic of the seasonal flu, they strike a very specific demographic of coronavirus victims, according to Dr. Gregory Levitin, an otolaryngologist at New York Eye and Ear Infirmary of Mount Sinai.
  "What is most unusual about this new finding is that the loss of smell or taste was the only presenting symptom in a group of patients under the age of 40 who ultimately tested positive for the COVID-19 virus," Levitin wrote in an email to USA TODAY.

    Pink eye

  This week it was revealed that coronavirus can spread to the eyes.
  On March 24, the American Academy of Ophthalmology shared an alert warning that COVID-19 may cause conjunctivitis, or pink eye, in about 1-3% of infected people, reported TODAY.
  Pink eye is inflammation of the clear tissue covering the white part of the eye.
  While virus particles have been found in eye secretions, the AAO suggested that the risk of being infected with the virus via tears is low.
  The Life Care Center in Kirkland, Washington has been described as “ground zero for the West Coast's coronavirus outbreak.” In an interview with CNN, one nurse from the center described the symptom in her patients.
  “They have, like ... allergy eyes,” the nurse said. “The white part of the eye is not red. It's more like they have red eye shadow on the outside of their eyes.”

            <div class="item__body">The days of painting your own nails are coming to an end as nail salons are opening back up after months of stay-at-home orders due to the COVID-19 outbreak.
  But as many states begin to ease restrictions, you may find yourself wondering if it's safe to go to the nail salon. Regardless of where you go, experts say you need to be cautious.
  Good Morning America reported that several states, including New York, California, Texas, and Colorado, have begun reopening nail salons.
  Nicole Hallett, an associate clinical professor of law at the University of Chicago Law School, said salons need a plan to make sure that their business can reopen with being safe.
  While the coronavirus pandemic has changed normalcy, nail salons will look different than they did before the global outbreak.
  Base Coat Nail Salon, a Denver-based chain salon, has reopened with specific guidelines. The rules include using plastic chair coverings while keeping stations six feet apart.
         View this post on Instagram           Denver- we are doing everything possible to assure a safe reopening this Monday. ✨ Here is a look into our employee COVID-19 employee training. All stations have been set 6 feet apart, acrylic guards set in place made for us by @ten23designs, and all cloth chairs have plastic covers for easy sanitation. We ask again that you please read our guidelines before booking. We can’t wait to see you soon 💞💅🏿💅🏾💅🏽💅🏼💅🏻💅 A post shared by  BASE COAT™️ (@basecoatnailsalon) on May 29, 2020 at 2:45pm PDT"I was definitely taken back when the Colorado shelter at-home order was lifted on May 8 for nail and hair salons, especially before restaurants," co-founder Trans Wills said.
  The company decided to delay opening on June 1. Before opening its doors, employees also went through "COVID-19 employee training."
  Each guest will now have to go through a symptom screening and going to a sink to watch their hands with soap and water before meeting with their nail technician.
  Many salons are also requiring masks to be worn at all times by employees.
  Infectious disease specialist Dr. Simone Wildes shared the following tips with GMA on how to keep safe at nail salons amid COVID-19.

    Safety tips if you plan to visit a nail salon

  —Make an appointment ahead of time as there will be limits on how many people can be in salons at a time—Wear your mask for the duration of your visit—Wash your hands before and after salon services—Practice social distancing while visiting salons

    Red flags to watch out for

  —Overcrowding—Individuals not wearing masks—Surfaces not being cleaned thoroughly between each client—Staff not washing hands or sanitizing between customers

            <div class="item__body">While the coronavirus pandemic still continues, many will eventually have to return to normal life.
  Whether you are taking the subway, bus, or train in major cities, your commute will look very different after COVID-19.
  As the deadly virus created chaos, public transit throughout the nation slowed or paused travel, reported Today.
  While states slowly reopen, services throughout the country has been restored while many follow social distancing rules.
  Doctors are now giving tips on how to keep yourself safe on public transit. To keep yourself safe, health officials advise carrying hand sanitizer and wearing face masks while commuting on public transportation.
  Dr. Josh Sharfstein, the Vice Dean for Public Health Practice and Community Engagement at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said that it is essential that people stay off public transit if they experience any coronavirus symptoms.
  While commuting to work, Sharfstein said people should make sure that they are not touching their nose, mouth, and eyes. As soon as a person gets off public transit, it is essential to wash your hands with soap and water quickly.
  Sharfstein said that employees should try to commute when fewer people are using public transit systems.
  "Hopefully, employers will have some flexibility so that people can commute on off-hours," he said. "Also, hopefully, a transit agency will be able to run more trains and buses at peak hours, so there aren't as many people on an individual car."
  When riding a train, people should avoid sitting next to a stranger. If you are on a subway, you should avoid touching as few surfaces as possible. Cities across the country have already marked spots on platforms for people to social distance.

            <div class="item__body">Millions of Americans are wondering where they face the highest risk of contracting coronavirus.
  On the brink of summer and amid reopenings throughout the country, many states are seeing spikes in COVID-19 infection rates.
  MLive spoke to four public health experts from Michigan to create a list of public spaces and the level of risk they pose.
  According to the site, the doctors took into account five factors in weighing the risk of any given place:
  —Whether it’s inside or outside—Proximity to others—Exposure time—Likelihood of compliance—Personal risk level
  These are the locations ranked on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 posing the highest risk.

        Bars and large music venues
      
      
Risk level: 9
Bars and large music venues both pose a significant risk of contracting COVID-19, according to experts.
And one of the riskiest factors common to both? The presence of alcohol.
"After a couple of drinks, they're starting to feel a little more invincible," said Dr. Nasir Husain, Henry Ford Macomb medical director for infection prevention. "And that's when the trouble starts."
In addition to drinking, a high-risk activity common at large venues is singing.
"Singing is a really effective way of spreading the virus," said Dr. Mimi Emig, a retired infectious disease specialist with Spectrum Health. According to the expert, speaking or singing loudly has the potential to emit more of the virus into the surrounding area.

        Gyms, stadiums, amusement parks, churches, buffets
      
      
Risk level: 8
A common feature of these locations is that they include gatherings of large groups of people that includes talking, singing and, in the case of the gym, even breathing.
According to Husain, people emit more respiratory secretions when working out and breathing heavily. Gyms are also places where it may be difficult to work out while wearing a mask, or to adequately distance the necessary amount.
At buffets, people run the risk of sharing utensils. While they are not as risky as bars for COVID, according to the experts, they still certainly pose a significant risk without redesigns aimed at limiting the flow of traffic.

        Public pools, schools, contact sports
      
      
Risk level: 7
Interestingly, the experts who participated in this poll agreed that many outdoor recreational activities are low risk.
However, contact sports like basketball can elevate participants' chances of contracting the virus.
"You're banging into each other," Sims said. "There's a chance for masks to be ripped off. People may not want to use masks, because as you start breathing harder, the masks become more and more uncomfortable."
Since masks aren't waterproof, pools certainly pose a threat as well. Additionally, it is unclear how effective chlorine in pool water is against the virus.
"We don't have good data to show how the virus would behave in a pool," Husain said. "Pool water does have chlorine in it, but I don't think it's high enough to be very effective in completely reducing risk to zero."
For the sheer volume of students who are typically within six feet of each other for hours at a time, schools pose a definite risk as well, according to the experts polled.

        Casinos, restaurants, playgrounds, salons, barbershops, movie theaters
      
      
Risk level: 6
While these locations certainly include large gatherings of people, there is potential to space visitors out, as in restaurants, movie theaters, or casinos with open floor plans.
By their very nature, hair salons and barbershops pose a significant risk. But according to the experts, they can be made somewhat less risky if everyone is required to wear masks and measures like closing the waiting area off, making guests wait outside or in their cars.

        Planes, malls, beaches, backyard barbecues and bowling alleys
      
      
Risk level: 5
The experts questioned for this poll differed on projects risk level of planes, with two calling them medium risk, one calling them low risk and another calling them high risk.
"That's actually pretty safe, the air is very well filtered on airplanes," said Dr. Dennis Cunningham, McLaren Health Care medical director for infection prevention. "As long as someone's not obviously sick, I'm going to give that a 3."
But Emig said there are other factors to consider, including the fact that planes can gather large groups of people for hours, and that may don't know how to wear face masks correctly.

        Offices, doctor's offices, outside dining, busy downtown areas
      
      
Risk level: 4
While offices can be adjusted by enforcing mask requirements and distancing measures, the experts agree that working from home is still safest.
Doctors' and dentists' offices both hold a level of risk. Moving forward, waiting rooms will likely need to instate distancing protocol to reduce risk. One expert even warns of she perceived as significant risk at the dentist.
"Dental cleaning aerosolizes what's in your mouth," Emig said. "If somebody unknowingly has the infection, that virus is going to get aerosolized."
Additionally, outside dining and busy downtown areas still pose risk, even despite being outside. As long as there are gatherings of large crowds, there are risks.
"Anything with crowds is bad. Try to avoid crowds," Sims said. "We're going to need to learn to thin out the crowds."

        Grocery stores, hotels, museums, libraries, campsites
      
      
Risk level: 3
As grocery stores are one of the businesses that stayed open and had to adapt to the virus, they are relatively lower on risk — as long as safety protocol is maintained. Masking in groceries is key, according to Sims. If customers aren't wearing masks, the risk is higher.
While certain factors — like how well your room was cleaned or who stayed in it before you — aren't so significant in hotels, visitors should take care during check-in and hotel dining. Emig suggests opting for contactless check-in and skipping the breakfast if you can.
Emig also said that libraries with museums, with their open spaces, high ceiling and ability to enforce mask requirements and distancing protocols, exhibit lower COVID risk.

        Gas station, exercising outside
      
      
Risk level: 2
As coronavirus mainly spread through the air or through close contact with other people, the gas station is relatively safe, the experts agreed. There, customers are outdoors, not close to others and not present in the location for long — all good news when it comes to coronavirus risk.
And don't feel the need to use social distancing as an excuse not to exercise. According to the experts, walking, running and biking on trails are low risk because you don't come into contact with many people, and when you do, it isn't for long. Still, Husain advises keeping a distance when you pass an individual running in the other direction.

        Getting takeout, playing tennis
      
      
Risk level: 1
Ordering grub for takeout is low risk, the experts, especially as more restaurant are enforcing safety measures like contactless delivery.
They also say that tennis, which is played outdoors, spaced apart, with 2 to 4 players, is not a big deal.

            <div class="item__body">(WWL) — Summer activities are here and ramping up as many people look to enjoy fun activities outdoors such as swimming, hiking and camping.
  But, do these summer activities pose a risk of spreading the coronavirus?
  “Camping by itself is great, very low risk. Fishing, is low risk, barbequing is low risk. What is risky or some element of risk is what you have to do to prepare to get there,” said Dr. Joseph Kanter, Assistant State Health Officer and Region One Medical Director of the Louisiana Department of Health.
  “Stopping at a gas station, and going shopping, anytime you go into a business that is a potential exposure," Kanter says. "Not to say you shouldn’t do it, I just think folks need to take precautions.”
  One popular summer activity is swimming. Some NORD-C public pools are now open.
  Could swimming in a swimming pool be high risk for spreading COVID-19?
  “We don’t think the virus is going to spread very easily through the water,” Dr. Kanter said. “Again whether its salt water or chlorine bath neither is very conducive to the virus living very long. So, I don’t think there is much of a risk of, I’m in the water and you are 20 feet away and you are going to get it from me because it is going to swim over there so to say.”
  Dr. Kanter echoes what the Center for Disease Control and Prevention says about being in close contact with people in a large group, whether in the water or not, is more of a risk of spreading the virus.
  The CDC says there is no evidence that the COVID-19 virus can be spread to people through water of any kind, including ocean water and chlorinated pool water.
  Here are some CDC guide lines for swimming in public pools.
  —Everyone should follow state, local, territorial, or tribal guidance that might determine when and how public pools, hot tubs, or water playgrounds may operate and might include CDC considerations.—Individuals should continue to protect themselves and others at public pools, hot tubs, and water playgrounds, both in and out of the water – for example, by staying at least 6 feet away from people you don’t live with and wearing cloth face covers when not in the water.—In addition to ensuring water quality and safety, operators of public pools, hot tubs, and water playgrounds should follow guidance on cleaning and disinfecting community facilities.

            <div class="item__body">Health officials across the nation have warned Americans about a second wave of coronavirus cases.
  Now, as stay-home orders relax and reopening plans advance to later phases, some states are seeing a rise in COVID-19 infections.
  At least 19 states are currently experiencing a trend of new increasing cases, according to a CNN report.
  One of these states, Arizona, is bracing for impact, with officials urging hospitals to activate emergency plans. Dr. Cara Christ, the state's Director of Health Services, has asked that hospitals "be judicious" in elective surgeries to guarantee bed capacity.
  While 24 U.S. states are trending downward in their COVID rates, seven states remain steady. Additionally, since Memorial Day, hospitalizations for the virus have increased in at least 12 states, including Alaska, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Kentucky, Mississippi, Montana, North Carolina, Oregon, South Carolina, Texas and Utah.
  As of Thursday morning, the U.S. surpassed 2 million cases of the virus, with more than 112,000 deaths, reports NPR.
  While many states have loosened stay-home restrictions, health officials worry that high rates may return amid a lack of vaccine and more people congregating in public, including for ongoing protests in the wake of George Floyd's death.
  This week, Dr. Anthony Fauci called the COVID-19 pandemic his “worst nightmare,” while warning that the crisis “isn’t over yet.” Speaking to biotech executives at a Biotechnology Innovation Organization conference, Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he was “almost certain” at least one of the COVID-19 vaccines being developed would be a success.
  With no one-size-fits-all federal recommendation, all 50 states are taking the lead on their own local orders. Find out what phase your state is in the reopening process below.

For older adults (those over age 65), those with underlying health conditions, and other populations at heightened risk from COVID-19, continuing to limit time in the community will be important. State and community leaders should prepare health alerts, communicate risk and symptoms, review plans, prepare for public health capacity if needed for spikes in cases."

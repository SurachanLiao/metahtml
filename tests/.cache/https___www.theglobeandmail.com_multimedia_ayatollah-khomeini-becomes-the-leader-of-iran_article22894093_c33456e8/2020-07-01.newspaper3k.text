Jubilant throngs lined Tehran’s broad boulevards to hail Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini on his triumphal return from exile. The Shah had fled, and the Shiite imam vowed to sweep aside the blasphemous remnants of a ruthless regime that lavished wealth on a few while most Iranians lived in poverty.

The aging cleric wasn’t just a revered religious leader. In exile, he’d mastered social media long before the term was invented, laying the groundwork for his Islamic revolution with thousands of cassette tapes that secretly circulated in Iran. The austere Ayatollah Khomeini was installed as Supreme Leader, ushering in a still-unfinished era of theocratic rule and international isolation that transformed the region’s most powerful state into an international pariah.

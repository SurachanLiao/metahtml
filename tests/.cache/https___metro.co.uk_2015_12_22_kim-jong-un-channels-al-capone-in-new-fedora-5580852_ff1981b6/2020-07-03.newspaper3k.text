Now we don’t normally write fashion pieces, but for the cheese-loving leader of everyone’s favourite hermit kingdom we’ll make an exception.

North Korean leader Kim Jong-un was spotted sporting a new fedora as he inspected a machinery plant in Pyongyang this weekend in what has been described as a ‘hipster-style power move’ by GQ and the beginning of a ‘glorious new trend’ by Esquire.

As we’re sure Mr Kim knows, a true villain is only as villainous as their outfit, and the North Korean leader seems to be channelling Chicago crime boss Al Capone with this latest sartorial decision.

Incidentally, Kim was very pleased with the machinery plant, reports the North Korean Central News Agency.

He apparently remarked that the renovations were so fresh that traces of the past could hardly be found.

But no one cares about that.

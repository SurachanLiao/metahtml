	<h2>Encyclop&#230;dia Iranica</h2>
<p>Published in English, Encyclop&#230;dia Iranica is a multi-volume, multi-disciplinary work designed to provide a detailed and accurate picture of an important world civilization over a span of several thousand years. It is the most extensive compendium ever conceived on the past and present culture of the Iranian peoples and their contribution to the broader history of human civilization.</p>
<p>The Encyclop&#230;dia Iranica Foundation, Inc. was established in 1990 as an independent not-for-profit 501(c)(3) public foundation registered in New York State. The Foundation&#8217;s main purpose is to promote the cause of Encyclop&#230;dia Iranica and to ensure its continuation as an independent scholarly databank.</p>
<p>The Foundation has established an endowment fund to support the Encyclop&#230;dia Iranica project, and funds the majority of its costs. The Foundation&#8217;s charter empowers it to carry out the Encyclop&#230;dia Iranica project independently.</p>
<p>Encyclop&#230;dia Iranica is a non-partisan, non-political, non-religious, non-ideological, and an entirely independent compilation of objective, documented, and reliable information that has drawn on the expertise of leading scholars world-wide at major universities and academies in North America, Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>Students, scholars, and all those eager to learn more about Iranian peoples and their culture will find the Encyclop&#230;dia Iranica an indispensable source of information. Those Iranians brought up abroad, interested in learning about their cultural heritage, will particularly benefit from this objective and unbiased resource.</p> 
</p><h2>In Focus</h2><p>Zoroastrianism: A Collection of Articles from the Encyclop&#230;dia Iranica</p><p>Edited by Mahnaz Moazami, 2-volume set, Encyclop&#230;dia Iranica Foundation: New York, NY, 2016</p><p>Zoroastrian theology, cosmology and cosmogony, history of the faith, its rituals and ceremonies, Avestan and Middle Persian texts, festivals such as Nowruz, Mehregan, and Sada, and a host of other topics, hitherto dispersed amidst other entries in their alphabetical sequence in the Encyclop&#230;dia Iranica, are gathered together here in a 2-volume set.</p><h2>News</h2><p>September 16, 2019  The Encyclop&#230;dia Iranica Foundation Asserts its Ownership of Encyclop&#230;dia Iranica</p><p>New York &#8211; The Encyclop&#230;dia Iranica Foundation has filed a lawsuit against Columbia University; Dr. Elton Daniel, Director of the Ehsan Yarshater Center for Iranian Studies at Columbia University; and Brill, the global publishing firm.</p><p>The lawsuit filed in the District Court for the Southern District of New York seeks to enforce the Foundation&#8217;s legal rights, including&#160;trademark infringement, trademark counterfeiting, trademark&#160;dilution, conversion, unjust enrichment, and other acts of unfair competition under the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1501 et seq., and the New York Unfair Trade Practices Act,&#160;tortious interference with contract and prospective economic advantage, as well as other claims under the laws of the State of New York and common law.&#160; A full copy of the complaint can be viewed here: <a href="/app/webroot/uploads/pdfs/2019-09-13-complaint.pdf" target="_blank">Complaint</a></p><p>On August 9, Columbia University sued the Foundation, accusing it of falsely claiming to be the copyright owner of the Encyclop&#230;dia Iranica. Columbia&#8217;s complaint misstates the facts and lacks merit. The University filed its suit shortly after the Foundation rightly asserted its legal ownership to the copyright in the Encyclop&#230;dia, to the trademark in the Encyclop&#230;dia Iranica name, and to iranicaonline.com. The Foundation intends to start a new chapter in the publication of the Encyclop&#230;dia; it will defend itself vigorously as it presses forward with its own complaint against the University.</p><p>Until his retirement in 2016, Dr. Ehsan Yarshater had been Director of the Center for Iranian Studies at Columbia University and Editor-in-Chief of the Encyclop&#230;dia for more than four decades. He founded the Encyclop&#230;dia Iranica Foundation in 1990 to ensure the permanent, uninterrupted publication of the Encyclop&#230;dia by providing funding through its endowment and donor gifts.</p><p>Since its inception, the Foundation has legally owned the Encyclop&#230;dia&#8217;s intellectual property and has contributed more than $40 million to Columbia University for its production and publication. As per its by-laws, the Foundation is&#160;solely responsible for selecting, at its own discretion, the institutional base of the Encyclop&#230;dia Iranica, whether that is Columbia University or any other reputable educational institution.&#160;</p><p>Dr. Daniel, the Center&#8217;s current director and until recently the Encyclop&#230;dia&#8217;s Editor-in-Chief, spearheaded a campaign to force the Foundation to endow the Center, which would ensure financial independence from the Foundation with no accountability. In retaliation for the Foundation&#8217;s decision not to endow, Columbia University denied the Foundation access to its collection of artwork and books, as well as documents and financial records, stored on its premises. The University warned the Foundation that its ability to continue the Encyclop&#230;dia&#8217;s production would be blocked, internationally.</p><p>The University&#8217;s August 9 complaint against the Foundation is an attempt to further coerce the Foundation into relinquishing its intellectual property rights to the Encyclop&#230;dia, so that the University can consummate a contract with Brill for the print and online distribution of the Encyclop&#230;dia, a misappropriation of more than forty years of academically renowned work to which it has not made a single contribution.</p><p>The Foundation does not intend to allow the University to bully it into walking away from the Encyclop&#230;dia. The Foundation is keen to keep its financial supporters, academic contributors and users of the Encyclopaedia informed as this matter moves forward and will continue to post updates on this web page.</p><p>Please contact Steve DiMattia at 646-695-2881 with any questions or concerns about this matter.</p></div>

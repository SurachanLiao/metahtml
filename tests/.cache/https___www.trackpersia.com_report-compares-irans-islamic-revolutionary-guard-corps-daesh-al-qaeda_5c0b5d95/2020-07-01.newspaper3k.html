<p>Western governments and international bodies, including the EU, should designate Iran&#8217;s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a foreign terrorist organization, the London-based Tony Blair Institute for Global Change said in a report published on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The IRGC acts as an &#8220;institutionalized militia,&#8221; and uses its vast resources to spread a &#8220;mission of jihad&#8221; through an &#8220;ideological army&#8221; of recruits and proxies, said the report, titled &#8220;Beyond Borders: The Expansionist Ideology of Iran&#8217;s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.&#8221;</p>
<p>The IRGC&#8217;s interpretation of Islam bears a &#8220;striking&#8221; resemblance to the extremist teachings of Sunni groups such as Al-Qaeda and Daesh, the report added.</p>
<p>The institute published its findings on the back of work to translate training manuals, used and freely distributed by the IRGC online, into English from Farsi for the first time.</p>
<p>Its analysis of the material uncovered what it called a &#8220;formalized system of indoctrination that seeks to radicalize its recruits with an extremist Islamist ideology.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tony Blair, former UK prime minister and executive chairman of the institute, said the international community needs to recognize the role that the IRGC plays in spreading terrorism and extremism.</p>
<p>&#8220;The IRGC is not simply an arm of the state, it is a body dedicated to advancing an ideology based on an extreme and intolerant distortion of Islam. It is time we recognized this formally,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Extremist ideology gives rise to violent extremism. Defeating it, and calling out those groups and organizations which promote it, is a vital part of a peaceful and prosperous future for the region.&#8221;</p>
<p>The report found that the IRGC&#8217;s indoctrination process includes promoting a universal Shiite Islamist worldview that it said is &#8220;violent and absolutist,&#8221; and that &#8220;casts both non-Muslims and regime opponents (including Muslims) as enemies of Islam and calls for armed jihad against them.&#8221;</p>
<p>The report said the IRGC exists as a way of life in the way it spreads edicts on the ideal structure of society, including promoting the subjugation of women.</p>
<p>The report&#8217;s author, Kasra Aarabi, said the IRCG&#8217;s use of the internet to radicalize people is something that tech companies in the West have yet to come to terms with.</p>
<p>The IRGC is able to operate &#8220;unhindered&#8221; by safeguards normally employed to monitor and restrict propaganda by Salafist-jihadist groups, he added.</p>
<p>Recognizing this, and moving to prevent the IRGC&#8217;s dissemination of material, would be a key component of any strategy by the international community to combat its extremism, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;These internal manuals reveal how the IRGC operates as an institutionalized militia, with a formal program of indoctrination that seeks to radicalize its members and proxies in the region with a violent distortion of Islam,&#8221; Aarabi added in the report.</p>
<p>&#8220;As the new evidence in our report shows, the IRGC&#8217;s Shia extremist ideology has much in common with Salafi-jihadism and policymakers should therefore treat it with the same seriousness as Daesh (Daesh) and Al-Qaeda.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prof. Saeid Golkar, an expert on the IRGC at the University of Tennessee in the US, said: &#8220;Until now, there has been a void in any tangible evidence put to policymakers about the material and content distributed by the IRGC to its growing number of recruits.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added: &#8220;It is clear from the documents analyzed in this report that the IRGC has a comprehensive and harmful indoctrination system that seeks to radicalize its members with a violent Islamist ideology that will be hard to reverse without a concerted effort.&#8221;</p>
<p>The IRGC was formed in 1979 in the aftermath of the Iranian revolution, and has around 125,000 personnel, encompassing all areas of conventional military strength.</p>
<p>Its proxies are known to be militarily engaged in a number of conflicts across the Middle East and further afield.</p>
<p>The IRGC is known to be providing assistance to groups in Yemen, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and elsewhere.</p>
<p>It is thought to have been behind attacks on oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz, and missiles launched against Saudi Aramco processing facilities at Abqaiq and Khurais in 2019.</p>
<p>The IRGC was catapulted into global news cycles at the start of 2020 when Gen. Qassem Suleimani, a senior figure and the commander of its elite Quds Force, was assassinated in a US drone strike in Baghdad.</p>
<p>The IRGC has since admitted responsibility for the downing of a Ukrainian passenger jet above Tehran in the immediate aftermath of the drone strike.</p>

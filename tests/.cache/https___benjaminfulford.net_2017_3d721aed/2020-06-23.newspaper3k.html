<div><p>I would like to let you know that my&#160;<a href="https://quantumantigravity.wordpress.com/nobel-prize/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>anti-</b>gravity experiments</a>&#160;have been&#160;<b>successfully replicated</b>&#160;by the&#160;Aerospace Engineering&#160;Department&#160;at the&#160;<a href="http://ut.ac.ir/en/page/467/faculty-of-new-sciences-and-technologies" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New Sciences &amp; Technologies</a> Faculty&#160;of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Tehran" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> University of Tehran</a>&#160;in the Islamic Republic of Iran.&#160;I have developed&#160;<b>complete</b>&#160;quantum anti-gravity hypothesis with direct testable predictions that are simple,&#160;clear,&#160;easy, and inexpensive.</p>
<p>As you know, present-day quantum gravity theories&#160;suffer from&#160;<b>too many</b>&#160;mathematical space dimensions, and from&#160;<b>too few</b>&#160;conclusive experimental results.</p>
<p>My hypothesis is simple, clear, and subject to easy empirical verification.&#160; I offer clear explanation of the principles of quantum gravity, and also precisely describe how to perform simple and&#160;<b>inexpensive</b>&#160;experiments to verify it.</p>
<p>In order to clearly understand quantum anti-gravity,&#160;please follow these 8 steps:</p>
 
<p>The following are&#160;<b>the 10 &#8220;mysteries&#8221;</b>&#160;that my hypothesis sheds new light upon:</p>
 
<p>I have designed 4 progressively more complex experiments,&#160;and we have successfully performed one of them, the one&#160;of medium difficulty, which&#160;constitutes:</p>
<p>The empirical discovery of hitherto unknown physical interaction&#160;between angular momentum of a spinning gyroscope&#160;and Earth&#8217;s magnetic and electric fields.</p>
<p>To perform this experiment, we need a gyroscope with a vertical support,&#160;and magnetic and electric shielding cages.</p>
<p>According to&#160;<b><a href="https://quantumantigravity.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my </a><a href="https://quantumantigravity.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hypothesis</a>,</b>&#160;there will be a&#160;measurable time difference&#160;between a freely spinning gyroscope inside,&#160;and outside the cages. &#160;A gyroscope freely spinning inside both cages will come to rest&#160;in less time&#160;than when spinning outside them.</p>
<p>The experiment was&#160;<b><a href="https://quantumantigravity.wordpress.com/nobel-prize/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">performed&#160;successfully</a></b> and was recorded in the following two videos:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Inside: </b>51.87 seconds<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcwSTiZ8hhA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.youtube.com/watch?vrcwSTiZ8hhA</a></li>
<li><b>Outside:&#160;</b>55.54 seconds<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcwlOkueGKs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcwlOkueGKs</a></li>
<li>Time difference&#160; &#8212;&#160;&#160;<b>6.6%</b></li>
</ul>
<p>To have a clear idea what is involved in the experiment,&#160;please take a closer look at&#160;the above two videos&#160;first.</p>
<p>For the experiment, we used the following small and light gyroscope&#160;at&#160;10,000&#160;rpm:</p>
 
<p>It would be much better to use a&#160;heavier&#160;gyro, because&#160;the heavier the gyro, the stronger the effect, at the same rate of rpm.</p>
<p>The value of angular velocity (rpm) is important&#160;only&#160;insofar as to generate sufficient angular momentum to allow the gyro&#160;to spin freely for a longer time before it comes to rest.</p>
<p>The objective of the experiment was to obtain two values&#160;of the gyro&#8217;s run time:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Outside</b> the shielding;</li>
<li><b>Inside</b>&#160;the shielding.</li>
</ul>
<p>In my experiment, the two sample values are, respectively:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>55.54 seconds</b></li>
<li><b>51.87 seconds</b></li>
</ul>
<p>There was a&#160;<b>3.67 second</b> difference, which amounts to&#160;<b>6.6%.&#160; </b>The time difference is directly proportional to the quality&#160;and quantity&#160;of&#160;<b>electrostatic</b>&#160;shielding of the Faraday cage. Applying the&#160;<b>magnetic</b>&#160;shielding in addition to the electric one would further increase the time difference.</p>
<p>As you can see in the video,&#160;it is important that the gyro&#160;is elevated&#160;by means of a vertical support.&#160; Ideally, gyro should start spinning&#160;as close to a vertical position&#160;as possible,&#160;and also be able to pass lower, while still spinning,&#160;than its horizontal position.</p>
<p>The reason for this effect is that the gyroscope inside the cages&#160;will be spinning in&#160;<b>reduced strength</b>&#160;of&#160;Earth&#8217;s magnetic and electric fields, which in turn reduces the strength of&#160;the&#160;<a href="https://quantumantigravity.wordpress.com/biefeld-brown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Biefeld-Brown effect</a>&#160;acting upon it.</p>
<p>The&#160;gyroscope outside the cages,&#160;spinning in the&#160;<b>undiminished&#160;strength</b>&#160;of&#160;Earth&#8217;s magnetic and electric fields, is subject to the full influence of&#160;the&#160;<a href="https://quantumantigravity.wordpress.com/biefeld-brown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Biefeld-Brown effect</a>&#160;that causes the gyroscope to resist Earth&#8217;s gravity pull, which happens to be none other than pure&#160;<a href="https://quantumantigravity.wordpress.com/quantum-gravity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">natural antigravity effect</a>.</p>
<p><b>OBJECTIONS</b></p>
<ul>
<li>All conductors, like the brass gyro, exhibit an effective diamagnetism when they experience a changing magnetic field.&#160; The&#160;Lorentz force&#160;on electrons causes them to circulate around forming&#160;eddy currents.&#160; The eddy currents then produce an induced magnetic field that opposes the applied field and resist the conductor&#8217;s motion.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>&#8212;&#160;&#160;</b>That is true for both, the gyro spinning inside and outside the Faraday cage in Earth&#8217;s magnetic field.&#160; It does not make any difference.</p>
<ul>
<li>But the gyro&#8217;s&#160;induced magnetic field will generate eddy currents in the Faraday cage and the resultant magnetic field will slow down gyro&#8217;s spin (magnetic breaking), and hence the whole effect.&#160; It is like dropping a magnet down a copper pipe: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dFFL8TDt2Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dFFL8TDt2Q</a></li>
</ul>
<p><b>&#8212;&#160;</b>&#160; The analogy in the video applies, but&#160;<b>only in principle.</b>&#160; Spinning brass gyro is not a&#160;<b>strong</b>&#160;neodymium magnet, and if,&#160;<b>in principle,</b>&#160;it generates any magnetic field, it is so weak that it will not even affect a needle of a compass.&#160; As opposed to the copper pipe in the video, the enamel-coated copper mesh&#160;Faraday cage has much larger diameter (the inverse-square law), so it is enough to drop a&#160;<b>strong</b>&#160;neodymium magnet down the Faraday cage to see how much it would slow down, if at all.&#160; As you can see in the above video, even few empty slits in the copper pipe greatly weaken the eddy currents, this being the reason for using enamel-coated copper mesh.&#160; Diamagnetic materials, like brass, or copper, have a relative magnetic permeability that is less than or equal to 1, and therefore a&#160;magnetic susceptibility&#160;less than or equal to 0, since susceptibility is defined as&#160;&#967;v=&#956;v&#8722;1.&#160; This means that diamagnetic materials,&#160;<b>in principle,&#160;</b>are repelled by magnetic fields.&#160; However, since diamagnetism is such a weak property, its effects are not observable in everyday life.&#160; Moreover, there is a big difference between Faraday cage made of solid copper, and one made of enamel-coated copper mesh.&#160; The&#160;magnetic field induced in the gyro is weak, because&#160;Earth&#8217;s magnetic field is weak, so whatever little eddy currents could be induced by the gyro in&#160;solid copper&#160;Faraday cage will become irrelevant in&#160;the enamel-coated copper mesh&#160;Faraday cage, as you can&#160;see in the following two videos:</p>
 
<p>Even though it is true that the experiment,&#160;<b>in principle,</b>&#160;is open to influences from various phenomena, including the&#160;<a href="https://quantumantigravity.wordpress.com/carnegie-curve/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Carnegie curve</a>, the overall result is clearly well beyond being attributed exclusively to these other phenomena.</p>
<p>To completely&#160;<b>eliminate above objections,</b>&#160;magnetic shielding needs to be applied in addition to the Faraday cage, and the gyro should be custom-made from a material which does not allow for eddy currents to flow in it.</p>
<p>Naturally,&#160; I will be happy to answer any&#160;questions&#160;that you may have for me&#160;regarding&#160;the&#160;<a href="https://quantumantigravity.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">theoretical foundations</a> as well as&#160;<a href="https://quantumantigravity.wordpress.com/nobel-prize/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">replication of the experiment</a>.</p>
<p>With respect and much gratitude, &#160;I am<br>
Sincerely yours,</p>

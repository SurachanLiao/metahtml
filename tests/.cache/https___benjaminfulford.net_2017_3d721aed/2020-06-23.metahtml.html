</ol><p>I have designed 4 progressively more complex experiments,&#160;and we have successfully performed one of them, the one&#160;of medium difficulty, which&#160;constitutes:</p><p>The empirical discovery of hitherto unknown physical interaction&#160;between angular momentum of a spinning gyroscope&#160;and Earth&#8217;s magnetic and electric fields.</p><p>To perform this experiment, we need a gyroscope with a vertical support,&#160;and magnetic and electric shielding cages.</p><p>According to&#160;<a href="https://quantumantigravity.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my </a><a href="https://quantumantigravity.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hypothesis</a>,&#160;there will be a&#160;measurable time difference&#160;between a freely spinning gyroscope inside,&#160;and outside the cages. &#160;A gyroscope freely spinning inside both cages will come to rest&#160;in less time&#160;than when spinning outside them.</p><p>The experiment was&#160;<a href="https://quantumantigravity.wordpress.com/nobel-prize/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">performed&#160;successfully</a> and was recorded in the following two videos:</p><ul>
<li>Inside: 51.87 seconds 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcwSTiZ8hhA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.youtube.com/watch?vrcwSTiZ8hhA</a></li>
<li>Outside:&#160;55.54 seconds 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcwlOkueGKs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcwlOkueGKs</a></li>
<li>Time difference&#160; &#8212;&#160;&#160;6.6%</li>
</ul><p>To have a clear idea what is involved in the experiment,&#160;please take a closer look at&#160;the above two videos&#160;first.</p><p>For the experiment, we used the following small and light gyroscope&#160;at&#160;10,000&#160;rpm:</p><ul>
<li><a href="https://www.gyroscope.com/d.asp?product=SUPER2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.gyroscope.com/d.asp?product=SUPER2</a></li>
<li><a title="dsafgsdfgsdfg" href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/QQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQ/32662105265.html?spm=2114.10010108.1000014.3.joPhRk&amp;scm=1007.13338.79672.000000000000000&amp;pvid=046cb5bd-bda9-4deb-bf12-10840a8adb9e&amp;tpp=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AliExpress Metal Gyro Toy</a></li>
</ul><p>It would be much better to use a&#160;heavier&#160;gyro, because&#160;the heavier the gyro, the stronger the effect, at the same rate of rpm.</p><p>The value of angular velocity (rpm) is important&#160;only&#160;insofar as to generate sufficient angular momentum to allow the gyro&#160;to spin freely for a longer time before it comes to rest.</p><p>The objective of the experiment was to obtain two values&#160;of the gyro&#8217;s run time:</p><ul>
<li>Outside the shielding;</li>
<li>Inside&#160;the shielding.</li>
</ul><p>In my experiment, the two sample values are, respectively:</p><ul>
<li>55.54 seconds</li>
<li>51.87 seconds</li>
</ul><p>There was a&#160;3.67 second difference, which amounts to&#160;6.6%.&#160; The time difference is directly proportional to the quality&#160;and quantity&#160;of&#160;electrostatic&#160;shielding of the Faraday cage. Applying the&#160;magnetic&#160;shielding in addition to the electric one would further increase the time difference.</p><p>As you can see in the video,&#160;it is important that the gyro&#160;is elevated&#160;by means of a vertical support.&#160; Ideally, gyro should start spinning&#160;as close to a vertical position&#160;as possible,&#160;and also be able to pass lower, while still spinning,&#160;than its horizontal position.</p><p>The reason for this effect is that the gyroscope inside the cages&#160;will be spinning in&#160;reduced strength&#160;of&#160;Earth&#8217;s magnetic and electric fields, which in turn reduces the strength of&#160;the&#160;<a href="https://quantumantigravity.wordpress.com/biefeld-brown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Biefeld-Brown effect</a>&#160;acting upon it.</p><p>The&#160;gyroscope outside the cages,&#160;spinning in the&#160;undiminished&#160;strength&#160;of&#160;Earth&#8217;s magnetic and electric fields, is subject to the full influence of&#160;the&#160;<a href="https://quantumantigravity.wordpress.com/biefeld-brown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Biefeld-Brown effect</a>&#160;that causes the gyroscope to resist Earth&#8217;s gravity pull, which happens to be none other than pure&#160;<a href="https://quantumantigravity.wordpress.com/quantum-gravity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">natural antigravity effect</a>.</p><p>OBJECTIONS</p><ul>
<li>All conductors, like the brass gyro, exhibit an effective diamagnetism when they experience a changing magnetic field.&#160; The&#160;Lorentz force&#160;on electrons causes them to circulate around forming&#160;eddy currents.&#160; The eddy currents then produce an induced magnetic field that opposes the applied field and resist the conductor&#8217;s motion.</li>
</ul><p>&#8212;&#160;&#160;That is true for both, the gyro spinning inside and outside the Faraday cage in Earth&#8217;s magnetic field.&#160; It does not make any difference.</p><ul>
<li>But the gyro&#8217;s&#160;induced magnetic field will generate eddy currents in the Faraday cage and the resultant magnetic field will slow down gyro&#8217;s spin (magnetic breaking), and hence the whole effect.&#160; It is like dropping a magnet down a copper pipe: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dFFL8TDt2Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dFFL8TDt2Q</a></li>
</ul><p>&#8212;&#160;&#160; The analogy in the video applies, but&#160;only in principle.&#160; Spinning brass gyro is not a&#160;strong&#160;neodymium magnet, and if,&#160;in principle,&#160;it generates any magnetic field, it is so weak that it will not even affect a needle of a compass.&#160; As opposed to the copper pipe in the video, the enamel-coated copper mesh&#160;Faraday cage has much larger diameter (the inverse-square law), so it is enough to drop a&#160;strong&#160;neodymium magnet down the Faraday cage to see how much it would slow down, if at all.&#160; As you can see in the above video, even few empty slits in the copper pipe greatly weaken the eddy currents, this being the reason for using enamel-coated copper mesh.&#160; Diamagnetic materials, like brass, or copper, have a relative magnetic permeability that is less than or equal to 1, and therefore a&#160;magnetic susceptibility&#160;less than or equal to 0, since susceptibility is defined as&#160;&#967;v=&#956;v&#8722;1.&#160; This means that diamagnetic materials,&#160;in principle,&#160;are repelled by magnetic fields.&#160; However, since diamagnetism is such a weak property, its effects are not observable in everyday life.&#160; Moreover, there is a big difference between Faraday cage made of solid copper, and one made of enamel-coated copper mesh.&#160; The&#160;magnetic field induced in the gyro is weak, because&#160;Earth&#8217;s magnetic field is weak, so whatever little eddy currents could be induced by the gyro in&#160;solid copper&#160;Faraday cage will become irrelevant in&#160;the enamel-coated copper mesh&#160;Faraday cage, as you can&#160;see in the following two videos:</p><ul>

</ul><p>Even though it is true that the experiment,&#160;in principle,&#160;is open to influences from various phenomena, including the&#160;<a href="https://quantumantigravity.wordpress.com/carnegie-curve/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Carnegie curve</a>, the overall result is clearly well beyond being attributed exclusively to these other phenomena.</p><p>To completely&#160;eliminate above objections,&#160;magnetic shielding needs to be applied in addition to the Faraday cage, and the gyro should be custom-made from a material which does not allow for eddy currents to flow in it.</p><p>Naturally,&#160; I will be happy to answer any&#160;questions&#160;that you may have for me&#160;regarding&#160;the&#160;<a href="https://quantumantigravity.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">theoretical foundations</a> as well as&#160;<a href="https://quantumantigravity.wordpress.com/nobel-prize/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">replication of the experiment</a>.</p></article>

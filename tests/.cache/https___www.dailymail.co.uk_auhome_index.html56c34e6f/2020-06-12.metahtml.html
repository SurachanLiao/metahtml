            Melania Trump used her position as first lady to renegotiate her prenup with Donald Trump, ensured Barron would be treated the same as the eldest Trump children, and has had plastic surgery, a new book reveals. 'The Art of Her Deal: The Untold Story of Melania Trump,' by Washington Post reporter Mary Jordan, 'draws an unprecedented portrait of the first lady' based on interviews with more than 100 people in five countries. Out on Tuesday, excerpts from the 286-page book appeared in The Washington Post on Friday, confirming a longtime rumor that Melania renegotiated her marital agreement with Donald Trump before she moved into the White House after he won the presidency.

            Thousands of protesters will mass in Sydney and Melbourne this weekend for a second round of rallies after 90,000 took to the streets a week ago. The first is protest against Aboriginal deaths in custody on Friday night in Sydney,&#160;with hundreds of police showing up to break up the demonstration (left and centre). This will be followed by separate events on Saturday calling for the release of refugees in detention around Australia. Protest leaders include Melbourne schoolteacher Lucy Honan, University of Sydney academic Nick Riemer, and student activist Bridget Harilaou.

        <p>
            
            Virginia Roberts, 36, tweeted from her hospital bed early Friday (left) saying she's been ill with bacterial meningitis for the past three days after returning from a trip to the rainforest. 'Back in the hospital - again. This time bacterial meningitis. 'Went to the rainforest for the weekend with the fam and came back with something from the jungle. Day 3 - just had to get a spinal tap- talk about pain! Pls send me some love vibes from all my friends on Twitter,' she wrote. It comes two months after she was tested for coronavirus after she developed symptoms. Roberts is one of a slew of women to accuse Jeffrey Epstein of sex trafficking and claims she was trafficked to Prince Andrew (pictured together right) at least three times - a claim he has vehemently denied.

The palace is particularly 'furious' about claims that the duchess (pictured right with Meghan) feels 'exhausted and trapped' by the increased workload following Harry and Meghan's decision to step back from royal life. Lawyers for William and Kate have contacted Tatler, which hit back saying that any complaint is 'without merit'.

        <p>
            
            It appears Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are finally on the same page about co-parenting as they raise their six kids at their respective LA homes just five minutes away from each other. Exclusive new aerial photos obtained by DailyMail.com show how Brad and Angie have adopted a noticeably similar approach when it comes to their brood's recreational habits. Photos show both homes now have trampolines, a basketball hoop and pools, while Brad has installed a four-person swing set and Angie has added fun pool toys. This comes as reports say the pair are getting along much better after agreeing on a new set-up for their six kids, Maddox, 18, Pax, 16, Zahara, 15, Shiloh, 14 and twins Vivienne and Knox, 11. A source told Entertainment Tonight last week: 'He and Angie have been getting along so much better since the custody rules have been worked out. They have come so far'.

            A young Liberal who was fired as an MP's staffer over 'racist' social media posts has said his sacking was 'unfair' and political correctness has 'gone mad'. University of Queensland economics student Barclay McGain (left and right with Scott Morrison), 20, said he reached a 'mutual agreement' to leave Coalition MP Andrew Laming's office this week after two offensive social media posts were unearthed. One was a snapchat which he sent to friends and family showing him holding a money box featuring a picture of an indigenous person with exaggerated features.

            A woman has revealed how strangers would question whether she was pregnant when she was in her final trimester, as she was a small size six and weighed just over eight stone. Samantha Ball, 23, a content creator, who lives with partner Dylan Yarborough 24, a recruiter, in Sheffield, welcomed their son Leo in February 2017.&#160; But her pregnancy was far from an easy ride, and Samantha says she fought cruel jibes throughout her pregnancy about her lack of a bump.&#160; The mother-of-one remembers how commuters refused to get up for her when she was seven months pregnant, and says it continued after birth, when she felt so excluded from a mother and baby group that she refused to go back. Seen left to right at seven months, nine months, with Leo, now three, and inset with baby Leo.

    </h2>
    <p class="articletext">
         
        
        <p>
            
            An Australian personal trainer has shared her incredible toning transformation five years after losing her period and living off 1,000 calories a day. Lauren Simpson weighed a slight 50 kilos in 2015 after following a range of 'extreme' dieting techniques and taking her 'obsession' with fitness too far (middle). The 29-year-old was severely under eating and over training, which led to violent mood swings, 'horrible' skin and brittle hair. Another photo of her body at the start of 2020 showcases her 10 kilogram weight gain as a result of eating more than 2,000 calories a day (right).

            Charles Vallow (pictured top inset) was killed in Phoenix, Arizona in July 2019 in a shooting which Lori Vallow's brother Alex Cox admitted to carrying out but claimed was in self-defense. Before his death, Charles was estranged from Lori (top right) and described her as a cult believer who claimed to be a god with 144,000 followers. Lori's two children JJ Vallow and Tylee Ryan (bottom right, with JJ on the left) were last seen in September and their bodies were found in rural Idaho this week, in a tangled case which involves investigations into five deaths. Charles's previous wife&#160;Kimberly Friedmutter (left) claims that the grim discovery 'confirms a hundred percent' that Charles Vallow was murdered.

Tiger King star Joe Exotic reveals in letter to 29-year-old pen pal his torment of spending 'two years' in solitary confinement</a>

    <p class="articletext">
         
        
        <p>
            
            Joe Exotic told a pen pal he has been in solitary&#160;confinement for two years, a letter obtained exclusively by DailyMail.com reveals. The former zoo owner wrote: 'My soul dies a little each day. Not long and my heart will stop like an animal that morns [sic] itself to death.' The letter was dated May 5 and sent to Kathleen Lafferty, who felt sympathy for Exotic after watching Tiger King and decided to write to him. Joe begged&#160;Lafferty to be his voice to the public, writing: 'No email, 4 calls per month, no commissary like others get, unable to buy shampoo-conditioner or basic health care needs.' Joe's lawyer, Francisco Hernandez, corroborated the claims, saying: 'He is in the Special Handling Unit for unexplained reasons. It's unprecedented. [Solitary] is supposed to be a maximum of 14 days. He hasn't seen the sun in two years.' Joe was convicted of the murder-for-hire plot to kill Carole Baskin and 17 charges of animal abuse in 2019 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison this January.

            Olga Shirnina from Moscow, Russia, said a series of photos, bought to life and posted to her 23,000 followers, were removed by Facebook for breaching 'Community Standards'. One photo shows a striking picture of a side profile of Nazi leader Adolf Hitler dressed in a black suit at a New Year's reception (inset), and another shows the iconic scene of Russian Soviet soldiers lifting the 'Red Banner' over the Reichstag on 2 May 1945 (centre) as they celebrated their victory in the Battle of Berlin. Olga, a world expert in transforming historic black and white images into colour, said the first picture to be removed was a portrait of Hermann Goering (right), one of the most powerful figures in the Nazi Party. Other colourised images include Soviet hero Natalya Meklin-Kravtsova (left), a flight commander in the 46th Taman Guards Night Bomber Aviation Regiment, who flew 980 night missions by the end of the war.

            An Australian wellness blogger has created a DIY headboard out of timber she purchased at Bunnings, sharing the exact process with fans of the coastal piece of furniture. Keira Rumble, who is CEO of Krumbled Foods, decided to make a soft cream coloured headboard to match her woven bedside table and terracotta bedsheets, using 30mm Tasmanian Oak half-round dowels from Porta Timber. 'This DIY bedhead is perfect for those that are renting, as you don't need to fix anything to the wall, and you can bring it with you when you move (although, it is a little heavy and you'll need two people to help carry it),' The Sydneysider wrote on her blog.

In her new book Mum's the Word (inset), she gets brutally honestly about the ugly truth of motherhood - including aching nipples and weight gain.

            Jorges Arantes (left today and right with his ex-wife on their wedding day) stepped out from his modest flat in the Portuguese city of Porto wearing a face mask and glasses. The former TV journalist was still unrepentant about admitting to a slapping his former wife (inset). He told MailOnline: 'She is not saying anything new. There is nothing new in this and there is nothing more to say on the matter. There is not point in speaking any more as there is nothing to say on what happened.' Arantes made a brief appearance outside his flat in the centre of Porto before stepping back inside.

            Fans of The Castle looking to escape for some serenity can now spend a weekend away in the iconic Bonnie Doon holiday house. The home which sits around 200km north-east of Melbourne is exactly how it was in the popular 1997 film - and even has Eric Bana's punching bag. The three-bedroom home is now available on AirBnb for $196 a night complete with a 'serenity' sign hung across the front gate.

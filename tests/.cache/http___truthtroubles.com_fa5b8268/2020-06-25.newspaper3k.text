The Testing Of Our Very Own Faith

Most of us were raised in a family of some sort

Structure or the lack their of was always known

Faith comes with the familiar things that we love

That which we can see we understand much better

Having Faith in the Unseen, is so much more powerful

Too see a Heart is to have it bared unto their own Soul

We choose to have no Faith can we choose too have no sin

The War of this World is fought for the Mind and the Soul

What we choose in life we will reap the bounty thereafter

Every Trial of life is The Testing Of Our Very Own Faith

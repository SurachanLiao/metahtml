<div><h4><p>The Testing Of Our Very Own Faith</p></h4>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Most of us were raised in a family of some sort</p>
<p>Structure or the lack their of was always known</p>
<p>Faith comes with the familiar things that we love</p>
<p>That which we can see we understand much better</p>
<p>Having Faith in the Unseen, is so much more powerful</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Too see a Heart is to have it bared unto their own Soul</p>
<p>We choose to have no Faith can we choose too have no sin</p>
<p>The War of this World is fought for the Mind and the Soul</p>
<p>What we choose in life we will reap the bounty thereafter</p>
<p>Every Trial of life is The Testing Of Our Very Own Faith</p>
<p>&#160;</p>

While the South’s major acquisition decisions are made with a long-term view, Pyongyang’s apocalyptic rhetoric doesn’t exactly hurt the efforts of silver-tongued weapons salesmen. We took a quick glance at the market valuation of the firms we’re talking about on Thursday.  </p> <p><del><img alt="" class="image  -fit -lazy"> <img src="https://foreignpolicy.com/files/fp_uploaded_images/130411_Screen%20shot%202013-04-11%20at%2010.48.02%20AM.png" alt="" class="image  -fit"> </del></p> <p>Not bad.

Last week, the Pentagon <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/04/03/us-korea-usa-fighters-idUSBRE93210220130403">approved</a> the potential sale of Lockheed Martin’s F-35 stealth fighter and Boeing’s F-15 Silent Eagle fighter to Korea. But Lockheed and Boeing don’t just have themselves to compete with: The pan-European aerospace and defence corporation EADS and BAE Systems are also offering the Eurofighter Typhoon. To get a sense of the kind of coin we’re talking about, the Pentagon says the proposed sale of Lockheed’s F-35 fighters would be worth as much as $10.8 billion. On Tuesday, Dave Scott, a senior Lockheed executive, <a href="http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/national/2013/04/09/30/0301000000AEN20130409011000315F.HTML">renewed his pitch</a> for the F-35 in light of Pyongyang’s belligerence, saying the actions of the regime “have reinforced the need to be strong and to be recognized.”  </p><p>According to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/04/03/us-korea-usa-fighters-idUSBRE93210220130403">Reuters</a>, Seoul will announce the winner of the competition sometime between June and November.  </p><p>Drones  </p> <p><del><img alt="" class="image  -fit -lazy"> <img src="https://foreignpolicy.com/files/fp_uploaded_images/130411_97996634.jpg" alt="" class="image  -fit"> </del></p> <p>Though a proposed deal between Seoul and Northrop Grumman for a fleet of $215 million Global Hawk drones is still at an “<a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate/2013/04/01/a-spy-plane-alliance/">early stage</a>,” the contract could pay off hugely for the Virginia-based contractor. The drone is the size of an airliner and, according to weapons expert<a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate/2013/04/01/a-spy-plane-alliance/">David Axe</a>, could become a lynchpin of the “burgeoning robotic alliance” between Tokyo, Washington, Seoul, and Canberra. It’s also quite a valuable contract: In December, the Pentagon pegged the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/30/opinion/sunday/drones-for-south-korea.html?_r=0">proposed</a> sale of four Global Hawks by Northrop at a cool $1.2 billion.  </p><p>Radar  </p> <p><del><img alt="" class="image  -fit -lazy"> <img src="https://foreignpolicy.com/files/fp_uploaded_images/130411_Screen%20shot%202013-04-11%20at%204.26.24%20PM.png" alt="" class="image  -fit"> </del></p> <p>Hot off the presses, Massachusetts-based contractor Raytheon <a href="http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Security-Industry/2013/04/11/South-Korea-picks-Raytheon-radar/UPI-44901365691129/?spt=hs&amp;or=si">announced</a> the sale of its Raytheon Advanced Combat Radar (RACR) to South Korea on Thursday. The radar, an “active electronically scanned array system,” is built specifically for use on F-16 Fighting Falcons, and is part of a planned <a href="http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/04/10/raytheon-wins-part-of-11-billion-south-korean-cont.aspx">$1.1 billion upgrade</a> to South Korea’s fighter jet fleet. “RACR will keep the Republic of Korea’s KF-16 combat-relevant in a constantly evolving threat environment,” said Raytheon Space and Airborne Systems President Rick Yuse. Previously, South Korea has also made<a href="http://www.haaretz.com/news/south-korea-to-buy-israeli-radar-system-in-215-million-deal-1.270231">large purchases</a> of radar equipment from Israel Aerospace Industries.  </p><p>Missiles and Missile Defense </p> <p><del><img alt="" class="image  -fit -lazy"> <img src="https://foreignpolicy.com/files/fp_uploaded_images/130411_77009341.jpg" alt="" class="image  -fit"> </del></p> <p>In terms of raw missiles, Raytheon also benefits from a South Korean defensive buying spree. Seoul is a major customer of Raytheon’s newest incarnation of the Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM). As recently as December, South Korea <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-12-21/raytheon-storing-missiles-awaiting-motors-air-force-says.html">ordered</a> AMRAAM missiles from Raytheon, although the shipment was delayed because the missiles were missing their motors. Additionally, the Israeli defense firm Rafael has expressed a strong interest in selling its sometimes vaunted, sometimes pooh-poohed Iron Dome technology to South Korea. But as <a href="http://e-ring.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2013/04/09/why_doesn_t_seoul_have_iron_dome">Kevin Baron reported</a> on Monday, previous deals have met with resistance due to the system’s steep price tag among other things: Each Iron Dome battery costs an estimated $50 million and the interceptor rockets cost between $50,000 and $80,000 each. In sum, there’s a lot of money to be made on the Korean Peninsula.  </p></article>

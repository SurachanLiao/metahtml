The satellite delivered to the orbit (by a Fregat booster) will join the space-based segment of the early-warning system.</p>

<p>The satellite was designated Cosmos-2546. Its international designation is 2020-031A.</p>

<p>The satellite is the fourth spacecraft of the new early-warning system, known as EKS or Kupol. The first satellite of the system, Cosmos-2510, was launched <a href="http://russianforces.org/blog/2015/11/first_launch_of_the_tundra_ear.shtml">in November 2015</a>. The second and third, Cosmos-2518 and Cosmos-2541, were launched in <a href="http://russianforces.org/blog/2017/05/launch_of_the_second_satellite.shtml">May 2017</a> and <a href="http://russianforces.org/blog/2019/09/launch_of_cosmos-2541_the_thir.shtml">September 2019</a> respectively. Satellites are deployed on Molniya-type highly elliptical orbits and are said to be capable of detecting launches from all potential missile launch areas. The complete system is <a href="https://function.mil.ru/news_page/country/more.htm?id=12066125@egNews">expected to include ten satellites</a> on HEO and GEO orbits.</p>

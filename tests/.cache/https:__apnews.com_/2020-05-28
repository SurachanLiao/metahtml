Tim Walz called in the National Guard on Thursday as looting broke out in St. Paul and a wounded Minneapolis braced for more violence after rioting over the death of a handcuffed black man in police custody reduced parts of one neighborhood to a smoking shambles.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Minneapolis unrest ravaged several blocks in the Longfellow neighborhood, with scattered rioting reaching for miles across the city. It was the second consecutive night of violent protests following the death of George Floyd, who gasped for breath during a Monday arrest in which an officer kneeled on his neck for almost eight minutes. In footage recorded by a bystander, Floyd can be heard pleading that he can’t breathe until he slowly stops talking and moving.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Another protest was announced for Thursday evening near county offices in downtown Minneapolis. Some stores in Minneapolis and the suburbs closed early, fearing more strife. The city shut down its light-rail system and planned to stop all bus service out of safety concerns.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Around midday Thursday, the violence spread a few miles away to a Target in St. Paul's Midway neighborhood, where police said 50 to 60 people rushed the store attempting to loot it. Police and state patrol squad cars later blocked the entrance, but the looting then shifted to shops along nearby University Avenue, one of St. Paul’s main commercial corridors, and other spots in the city.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id='7244f22dde854455a4edd9efb01efa24' class='media-placeholder'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>St. Paul spokesman Steve Linders said authorities have been dealing with unrest in roughly 20 different areas throughout the city. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“Please stay home. Please do not come here to protest. Please keep the focus on George Floyd, on advancing our movement and on preventing this from ever happening again. We can all be in that fight together,” St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter tweeted. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Walz called for widespread changes in the wake of Floyd's death.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\"It is time to rebuild. Rebuild the city, rebuild our justice system, and rebuild the relationship between law enforcement and those they’re charged to protect. George Floyd’s death should lead to justice and systemic change, not more death and destruction,” Walz said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>By Thursday morning in Minneapolis, smoke rose from smoldering buildings in the Longfellow neighborhood, scene of the worst violence. In a strip mall across the street from the police's 3rd Precinct station, the focus of the previous night's protests, the windows in nearly every business had been smashed, from the large Target department store at one end to the Planet Fitness gym at the other. Only the 24-hour laundromat appeared to have escaped unscathed.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“WHY US?” demanded a large expanse of red graffiti scrawled on the wall of the Target. A Wendy’s restaurant across the street was charred almost beyond recognition.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We’re burning our own neighborhood,” said a distraught Deona Brown, a 24-year-old woman standing with a friend outside the precinct station, where a small group of protesters were shouting at a dozen or so stone-faced police officers in riot gear. “This is where we live, where we shop, and they destroyed it.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“What that cop did was wrong, but I’m scared now,” Brown said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But others in the crowd saw something different in the wreckage.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Protesters destroyed property \"because the system is broken,” said a young man who identified himself only by his nickname, Cash, and who said he had been in the streets during the violence. He dismissed the idea that the destruction would hurt residents of the largely black neighborhood.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“They’re making money off of us,” he said angrily of the owners of the destroyed stores. He laughed when asked if he had joined in the looting or violence: “I didn’t break anything.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>The protests that began Wednesday night and extended into Thursday were more violent than Tuesday's, which included skirmishes between offices and protesters but no widespread property damage or looting.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Mayor Jacob Frey appealed for calm. “Please, Minneapolis, we cannot let tragedy beget more tragedy,” he \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/MayorFrey/status/1265876660093685761\">said on Twitter\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"related-story-embed\" id=\"2cb0cfa0-91f0-11ea-ed7a-05550120b6bd\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Protests also spread to other U.S. cities.

Memphis police blocked a main thoroughfare after a racially mixed group of protesters gathered outside a police precinct. The situation intensified later in the night, with police donning riot gear and protesters standing shoulder-to-shoulder in front of officers stationed behind a barricade.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Amid the violence in Minneapolis, a man was found fatally shot Wednesday night near a pawn shop, possibly by the owner, authorities said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Fire crews responded to about 30 intentionally set blazes during the protests, including at least 16 structure fires, and multiple fire trucks were damaged by rocks and other projectiles, the fire department said. No one was hurt by the blazes.\u003c/p>\u003cp>There was no sign of police at the destroyed shopping center, though a couple dozen were outside the precinct house. One man standing outside the building was using a bullhorn to shout. “I can’t breathe, I can’t breathe. Mama, I can’t breathe,” repeating some of Floyd’s pleas for relief.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Across from the precinct, someone had spray-painted the sidewalk in red: “Where’s humanity?”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/5300d052a24cc050aabe9b370f865e56\">46-year-old Floyd died\u003c/a> as police arrested him outside a convenience store after a report of a counterfeit bill being passed. The U.S. Attorney’s Office and the FBI in Minneapolis said Thursday they were conducting “a robust criminal investigation” into the death and making the case a priority. The announcement came a day after President Donald Trump tweeted that he had asked an investigation to be expedited.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The FBI is also investigating, with a probe focused on whether Floyd’s civil rights were violated.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"hub-link-embed\" id=\"afs:Content:8996550054\">Full Coverage: Minneapolis\u003c/div>\u003cp>The officer who kneeled on Floyd and three others were fired Tuesday.

The governor’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Walz \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/GovTimWalz/status/1265849420035301384\">tweeted for calm\u003c/a> Wednesday night, calling the violence “an extremely dangerous situation” and urging people to leave the scene.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The last time the Minnesota National Guard was called out to deal with civil unrest was in a backup role during the 2008 Republican National Convention in St. Paul. The most comparable situation to the current disturbances happened when the Guard was called up to deal with the riots in Minneapolis in 1967, a summer when anger over racial inequalities came to a boil in many cities across the country.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Minnesota National Guard was also called out during protests against the Vietnam War in the 1960s and early 1970s and during a 1986 strike by Hormel meatpackers in Austin.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Associated Press writers Steve Karnowski and Jeff Baenen in Minneapolis, and Gretchen Ehlke in Milwaukee, contributed to this report.\u003c/p>","embedCaption":null,"sequenceNumber":null,"title":"US--Minneapolis Police-Death-Protests","headline":"National Guard called to respond to Minneapolis violence","localMemberName":null,"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:7013997bc5633f3113d65901ddb7e85e","notificationId":"urn:publicid:ap.org:7013997bc5633f3113d65901ddb7e85e","videoContext":"windows of California Highway Patrol cruisers.\u003c/p>","embedLinkURL":null,"bylines":"By TIM SULLIVAN and AMY FORLITI","mediumIds":["33c4aa0299fa4f45a76ebaf738b2c964","7700ab1585a14d658bfcc0d5df1fb0d7","593d0ef56dd7491a9c03620938841c17","2c53f7fe1c7a460698477e524699eb85","57221a2141a345b386050a0b6532b8e9","0464e5074f394fa4831a80757237d7c5","35cb6fdc1459400191c32295b977a619","176e0186dc4c454f9cd2e9057f9d4c74","660cef4fb3b94cfa922ab30960eabf71","7244f22dde854455a4edd9efb01efa24","04747bfe1a334a0d893562d92c4906bf","d5085359ae034111a748211e516843fe","c88aa5af048b4462b91a6faf28bfe062","a868206a5b4b404abd97654ba6fb718f","db4ce2608df04f33af2b9b0c379cd0b5","4b285ddcf27d4a5e8b553bf2c68e67b6","a01a337cf91c4e0c99831f2ad20a614b","1b7465830c6b41aa95e59396a213da17","c6948344dbf54f9684bc620c556ff409"],"media":[{"altText":null,"imageFileExtension":".jpeg","videoMimeType":null,"gcsBaseUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/33c4aa0299fa4f45a76ebaf738b2c964/","imageMimeType":"image/jpeg","externalId":null,"type":"Photo","imageRenderedSizes":[3000,2000,1000,800,600,400],"aspectRatio":1.5,"id":"33c4aa0299fa4f45a76ebaf738b2c964","videoRenderedSizes":[]}],"updated":"2020-05-28 22:02:13","mediaCount":19,"contentType":"text","gcsUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/contents/urn:publicid:ap.org:7013997bc5633f3113d65901ddb7e85e","shortId":"7013997bc5633f3113d65901ddb7e85e","firstWords":"\u003cp>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Minnesota Gov.

The confirmed U.S. death toll topped 100,000, the highest in the world, on Wednesday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The latest job-loss figures from the U.S. Labor Department bring to 41 million the running total of Americans who have filed for unemployment benefits since the coronavirus shutdowns took hold in mid-March.\u003c/p>\u003cp>There were some encouraging signs: The overall number of Americans currently drawing jobless benefits dropped for the first time since the crisis began, from 25 million to 21 million. And first-time applications for unemployment have fallen for eight straight weeks, as states gradually let stores, restaurants and other businesses reopen and the auto industry starts up factories again.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But the number of U.S. workers filing for unemployment is still extraordinarily high by historical standards, and that suggests businesses are failing or permanently downsizing, not just laying off people until the crisis can pass, economists warn.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“That is the kind of economic destruction you cannot quickly put back in the bottle,” said Adam Ozimek, chief economist at Upwork.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"related-story-embed\" id=\"a1114140-91f0-11ea-bb82-edc0c0bf9392\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The U.S. unemployment rate was 14.7% in April, a level not seen since the Depression, and many economists expect it will be near 20% in May.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The figures come amid an intensifying debate in Congress over whether to extend $600 in extra weekly federal unemployment benefits, provided under rescue legislation passed in March but set to expire July 31. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Democrats have proposed extending the payments, while Republicans have argued that the extra money could discourage laid-off workers from returning to jobs that pay less than they are getting on unemployment.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"hub-link-embed\" id=\"afs:Content:9000200772\">Full Coverage: Business\u003c/div>\u003cp>Kelly Kelso, a 30-year-old roadie from Nashville for the rock group Foreigner, got her first unemployment check last week after more than eight weeks of waiting. She said she is still receiving far less in benefits than the $1,250 per week or more that she made on tour.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Though she is reluctant to leave the music industry, she said, “I have a cosmetology license. If all else fails, I could go back to doing hair.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>Another looming storm cloud: Economists say the sharp loss of tax revenue for state and local governments is likely to compound the damage from the shutdowns by forcing additional public-sector layoffs in the coming weeks. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Those layoffs have just recently started showing up in the weekly jobless claims report. Washington state, for example, reported layoffs of government employees.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Job cuts are also appearing far beyond the initially hit industries such as restaurants and stores, a sign that the damage is spreading even as businesses reopen. Washington state said it saw layoffs in insurance, and New York state reported job cuts by information technology companies.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Economists say many of the jobs lost are never coming back, and double-digit unemployment could persist through 2021. \u003c/p>\u003cp>And as discouraging as the numbers are, the real picture may be worse. The government counts people as unemployed only if they’re actually looking for a job, and many Americans probably see no point in trying when so many businesses are shut down.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Airlines and aircraft manufacturers are struggling after air travel plummeted early in the outbreak. Boeing is cutting more than 12,000 U.S. jobs through layoffs and buyouts, many expected to be in the Seattle area. European budget airline Easyjet said it will cut up to a third of its 15,000 employees.

The risk rose with age and other health problems such as high blood pressure.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The studies have big implications: More than 1.6 million new cancers are diagnosed in the United States each year, several million Americans are in treatment now and about 20 million are cancer survivors. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Dr. Jeremy Warner, a Vanderbilt University data scientist who led the larger study, said the results show the wisdom of measures that many hospitals have taken to delay or modify care for many cancer patients, and the need for people treated in the past to be extra careful now. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“If they don’t have COVID-19, they want to do anything they can to avoid getting it,” he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>For Luciano Orsini, that meant postponing surgery at Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia for about a month to avoid having it when virus cases were rising there. Orsini lost one kidney to cancer last year and was eager for this surgery to remove tumors on his sole remaining one. He was tested for the virus several times, including the night before his April 29 surgery. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“It was a little daunting” waiting, he said. “I was constantly watching the clock.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>He’s now recovering at home in Sicklerville, New Jersey, and tested negative for the virus as recently as last week. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“The pandemic is posing incredible demands on the cancer care system” and the new studies show good reason for concern, said Dr. Howard Burris. He is president of the cancer society and heads the Sarah Cannon Research Institute in Nashville, Tennessee.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“We’re trying to minimize trips to the clinic” and telling older cancer patients and those with lung problems “to be extra vigilant, extra isolated, to stay at home, be careful with family members,” Burris said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Nearly half of the patients in Warner's study were receiving cancer treatment when diagnosed with COVID-19. The others either completed treatment, had not started it, been under observation or had cancer in the past. Researchers included all of these groups because some cancer treatments can affect the lungs or immune system years later and impact the odds of surviving coronavirus, he explained.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Men seemed to fare worse — 17% of them died versus 9% of women. That might be because breast cancer was the most common tumor type in this group, and women with it tend to be younger and with fewer health problems versus many cancers seen in men that are typically diagnosed at later ages. Smoking also is more common among men. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The risk of death also seemed higher for patients taking the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine plus the antibiotic azithromycin, but this could be because sicker patients were given those drugs. Of the 928 study participants, 89 took hydroxychloroquine and 181 took the combination. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The rate of death in patients getting both drugs was 25%, about double the 13% for the group as a whole, Warner said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We do not know if this is cause and effect,” and studies like this can’t prove such a link, he stressed. Use of hydroxychloroquine alone was not tied to a significantly higher risk of death, but there were fewer patients taking it this way. The study now has more than 2,000 patients enrolled and the next analysis will see if the trends stay the same, Warner said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Only two of the 270 took the drugs as part of a clinical trial, which “really stood out to me” because of the potential side effects, Warner said. Unless cancer patients are in one of the carefully designed studies that are testing hydroxychloroquine now, “don’t take that drug” on your own, he advised. \u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Marilynn Marchione can be followed on Twitter at \u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/MMarchioneAP\"> http://twitter.com/MMarchioneAP \u003c/a>\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives \u003ca href=\"https://www.ap.org/press-releases/2018/ap-hhmi-expand-collaboration-to-bolster-health-science-coverage\">support\u003c/a> from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

At least 2.1 million Americans lost their jobs last week, meaning an astonishing 41 million Americans have filed for unemployment benefits since shutdowns intended to prevent the spread of the coronavirus began in mid-March. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Trump argues that the economy will rebound later this year or in 2021 and that voters should give him another term in office to oversee the expansion.

That has dipped over the last two months, from 56% who said so in March. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Still, the economy remains a particular strong point for Trump. Before the outbreak began, and even as the virus started sending shock waves through the economy, approval of how he had handled the issue was the highest it’s been over the course of his presidency.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Since then, views on the economy have reversed dramatically. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The May poll found that 70% of Americans call the nation’s economy poor, while just 29% say it’s good. In January, 67% called the economy good. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, and liberal economists swiftly seized on the report's delay to argue that Trump is seeking to avoid putting his administration's imprint on bad economic news in the months before the Nov. 3 vote.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“This desperate attempt to keep the American people in the dark about the economy’s performance is not only an acknowledgement that Trump knows he’s responsible for some of the most catastrophic economic damage in American history, but also a sign of how stunningly out of touch he is with hard working Americans,” said Andrew Bates, a Biden campaign spokesman.\u003c/p>\u003cp>While the economic forecast is being delayed, updated information about the nation’s budgetary situation will still be released as expected this summer, the senior administration official said. A significant decline in tax receipts, as well as outlays from almost $3 trillion in coronavirus-related aid bills, is sure to produce a multitrillion-dollar government deficit for the budget year ending Sept. 30. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Paul Winfree, a former Trump White House director of budget policy, doubted that the holdup on the economic update was on Trump's radar.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Honestly, I don't think the president thinks about the publication of the mid-session review and the politics around it,” Winfree said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, noted that the law requires the White House to update its budget forecast. That responsibility is even more important given the uncertainty in the economy and the trillions of dollars in aid that have already changed the trajectory of government spending, she said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“By staying silent on how to reallocate those federal dollars under an unprecedented economic downturn, the executive branch is doing a disservice to taxpayers and avoiding tough discussions we need to have about the new fiscal reality,” she said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Jason Furman, who led the White House Council of Economic Advisers during the Obama administration, said the Trump administration pointing to economic uncertainty as the reason to put off the forecast doesn't hold weight. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump has repeatedly predicted improvement in the third and fourth quarters of this year, and the president just this week predicted 2021 is going to be “one of the best years we’ve ever had.” White House senior adviser Kevin Hassett said earlier this week that a double-digit unemployment rate was possible in November.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“You have to make decisions on incredibly uncertain information right now,” Furman said. “They are out on TV every day making economic forecasts and predictions about what's going to happen in the economy.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Trump team's economic projections, like those from earlier administrations, have tended to be overly optimistic. Last year’s review estimated that the economy would grow more than 3% last year, but the actual gains were a far more lukewarm 2.3%. \u003c/p>\u003cp>It similarly claimed that growth under Trump would cause the budget deficit to fall as a share of the economy. That estimate could never have anticipated the outbreak of the coronavirus that forced more than $3 trillion in aid as the deficit is on course to reach new highs.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In 2017, the Trump administration criticized the Obama administration for rosy expectations of growth during the Great Recession more than a decade ago. An updated forecast in the mid-session review could make the Trump White House a similar target for criticism.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Jared Bernstein, a former economic adviser to Biden, said a timely update on the state of the economy is more important than ever.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The idea that you'd abrogate that responsibility now is pretty serious fiscal malpractice,” Bernstein said. “They don't like the numbers they'd have to write down.

All over the world people are suffering, 186 countries. All over the world they’re suffering. We’re not happy.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>Although the student expulsions aren't directly related to Hong Kong and China’s move to assert full control over the former British territory, potential sanctions against officials involved in that effort would be a result of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's determination that Hong Kong can no longer be considered autonomous from mainland China.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Pompeo notified Congress on Wednesday that Hong Kong is no longer deserving of the preferential trade and commercial status it has enjoyed from the U.S. since it reverted to Chinese rule in 1997. Under a joint Sino-British agreement on the handover, Hong Kong was to be governed differently than the mainland for 50 years under a “one country, two systems” policy.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Pompeo's determination opened the door to possible sanctions and the loss of special perks Hong Kong has received from the United States. But neither Pompeo nor other officials were able Wednesday to describe what action the administration might take, an uncertainty related to the impact that such sanctions would have on U.S. companies that operate in Hong Kong and the city's position as Asia's major financial hub. Trump's comments sparked a drop in U.S. financial markets.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Serious consideration of the visa revocation proposal, first reported by The New York Times, has faced opposition from U.S. universities and scientific organizations who depend on tuition fees paid by Chinese students to offset other costs. In addition, those institutions fear possible reciprocal action from Beijing that could limit their students' and educators' access to China. \u003c/p>\u003cp>In a nod to those concerns, the officials said any restrictions would be narrowly tailored to affect only students who present a significant risk of engaging in espionage or intellectual property theft. The officials could not say how many people could ultimately be expelled, although they said it would be only a fraction of the Chinese students in the country.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Still, the possibility that the proposal may be implemented has drawn concerns from educators.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We’re very worried about how broadly this will be applied, and we’re concerned it could send a message that we no longer welcome talented students and scholars from around the globe,\" said Sarah Spreitzer, director of government relations at the American Council on Education. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“We don’t have a lot of details about how they are going to define ties to Chinese universities, what type of universities are they going to target, what would constitute a university having ties to the Chinese military,\" she said.

Massachusetts when he found himself in a front-row seat to history as a courtroom guard in Nuremberg, Germany, during the first and most famous trial of Nazi war criminals in 1945. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The 19-year-old had fought Germans on the front lines in World War II, lost friends in battle and witnessed horrors that would forever change his view of the world. Then he found himself standing guard over Adolph Hitler's top officers as they were brought to justice for atrocities committed by the Third Reich. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“To this day, I can hardly believe that any human being could do such cruel things to another,” DiPalma wrote in the memoir he published with the help of his daughter decades later.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>DiPalma died on April 8 at the age of 93 after contracting the coronavirus at the Holyoke Soldiers' Home in Massachusetts, where he was being cared for because of dementia. More than 70 other veterans sickened with the virus at the Soldiers Home have died, making it \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/e78173249b9c2cb327fc5da02fd8acad\">one of the deadliest known outbreaks at a long-term care facility in the U.S. \u003c/a>\u003c/p>\u003cp>_____\u003c/p>\u003cp>EDITOR’S NOTE: This is part of an ongoing series of stories remembering people who have died from coronavirus around the world.\u003c/p>\u003cp>____\u003c/p>\u003cp>The son of Italian immigrants, DiPalma grew up in Springfield, Massachusetts, before being drafted into the Army in 1944 at the age of 18. He left home a “happy go-lucky” kid who was gung-ho for battle, he said, but the gravity of the war quickly crashed down on him. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"33270a7ac08b4f07b08afb88f595bdae\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“It doesn’t take long that you realize this is not John Wayne movies, this is serious. And you grow up an awful lot while you’re up there,\" DiPalma said in a \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTqvsvpEx1Q&amp;t=3594s\">video interview\u003c/a> with the New York State Military Museum. \u003c/p>\u003cp>As a member of the 79th Infantry Division, DiPalma watched friends die and had close calls himself. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Once, he was climbing up an embankment when a fellow soldier stepped in front of him and \"took a hit at that very same moment, a hit that was surely meant\" for DiPalma, he wrote. Another time, medics were carrying a soldier on a stretcher, when DiPalma realized the injured man was his friend. “Death took him away as I looked back at him,\" he recalled. \u003c/p>\u003cp>After the Allies defeated Germany, DiPalma was sent to Nuremberg, where he was first tasked with making copies of documents detailing Nazi war crimes. Soon, he became a guard at the Nazi's prison cells. Eventually, he was asked to serve a guard in the courtroom, where he stood at the witness box with his arms clasped behind his back while Hitler's deputies were grilled over their atrocities. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"d42388db9b4b4687a5aca052e943a6db\">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>DiPalma found himself face to face with Nazi leaders, including the head of the German Air Force, Hermann Goering. While court was in recess, Goering would often ask DiPalma for a drink of water, so DiPalma would go get him a cup from the water bag down the hall. Goering would turn his nose up and say “Bah, Americanish,\" and give it back, DiPalma recalled. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Tired of his behavior, one day DiPalma filled Goering's cup from with toilet water instead. “Ahhh, gute vasser!\" a smiling Goering said, complimenting the drink, DiPalma wrote. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“I guess I felt it was my little contribution to the war effort,” DiPalma wrote.\u003c/p>\u003cp>DiPalma left Nuremberg in July 1946 and was discharged. Three months later, Goering killed himself hours before he was set to be hanged for his war crimes. \u003c/p>\u003cp>After the war, DiPalma met his future wife, Louise Catelotti, while on a double date. They were supposed to be dating other people but immediately hit it off, his daughter, Emily Aho, said. They raised four girls in East Longmeadow, Massachusetts, and DiPalma \"had his hands full” during their teenage years, Aho said while laughing. Louise DiPalma died of ALS – Lou Gehrig’s disease – in 2006. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"25e8fecbe3344272b427d6cd32a4338a\">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class=\"hub-link-embed\" id=\"afs:Content:8969222165\">Full Coverage: Lives Lost\u003c/div>\u003cp>DiPalma worked as a crane operator and a volunteer firefighter for their small town and enjoyed hunting, gardening, fishing and spending time at their beach house in Connecticut during the summer. He rarely talked about his days in the war, Aho said, but his wartime experiences left a lasting impact on how he saw others. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“It made me a little bit leery of everybody ... When I came back, I never trusted anybody,\" he said in the military museum interview. \"And I think that has made me a better person. It tells you what the real world is, rather than a bowl of cherries,” he said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Aho convinced her father to come with her to Germany in 2000 while she was doing research for a book she was writing. At the Palace of Justice, he excitedly showed her around and was \"like a kid again,” Aho recalled. They sat down in the courtroom and footage from the trials began playing showing a young DiPalma standing guard over Goering in the witness box. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“I just sat there and cried,” his daughter said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>After they returned home, she bought him a tape recorder for his 75th birthday and used those recordings to help him craft his memoir, titled “Just a Kid: A Guard at the Nuremberg Trials.\" \u003c/p>\u003cp>DiPalma sometimes struggled to talk about some things he saw, but he believed it was important for it not to be forgotten, Aho said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“He wanted to share his story so that this wouldn't happen again,” she said. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"021c400f9dc54cc49c31a1fa76a61d49\">\u003c/div>","dateline":null,"old_lead_video_key":null,"truncatedFirstWords":true,"etag":"879bb8b83f0e5953472c507df89beef8_0a24aza0c0","flattenedFirstWords":"Emilio DiPalma was, as he liked to say, just a kid from western Massachusetts when he found himself in a front-row seat to history as a courtroom guard in Nuremberg, Germany, during the first and...","version":null,"latestEtag":"879bb8b83f0e5953472c507df89beef8_1a9aza0c0","gcsUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/contents/urn:publicid:ap.org:879bb8b83f0e5953472c507df89beef8","revision":null,"mediumIds":["f65590d5c35f41e095514b25e2b69e4e","33270a7ac08b4f07b08afb88f595bdae","021c400f9dc54cc49c31a1fa76a61d49","f6973d33ff2941049fa14908fa03547d","60c2f414251e4809a4c12338fe929e66","25e8fecbe3344272b427d6cd32a4338a","1401ba93841140268a75d1028ec04d24","d42388db9b4b4687a5aca052e943a6db"],"media":[{"alignment":null,"audioMimeType":null,"altText":null,"videoRenderedSizes":[],"imageFileExtension":".jpeg","title":null,"type":"Photo","flattenedCaption":"Emily DiPalma Aho looks over photographs and memorabilia of her father, Emilio DiPalma, a World War II veteran, at her home in Jaffrey, N.H., Wednesday, May 13, 2020.

He listened to audiobooks constantly and closely followed the news. He devoured history and was quick with facts on U.S. presidents. He was humble. He won a Bronze Star, but his family only found out how decorated a soldier he was when he was gone. He was a longtime U.S. Postal Service employee who rose to become a town postmaster. He was sharp as a tack and liked to deem things “snazzy” or “classy.” On his last night, the nurses gave him chocolate ice cream and showed him photos of some young relatives. And by dawn, he was gone. \u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"f954aad33cf148588a2e0d92d47a117e\">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class=\"audio-embed\" id=\"afs:Medium:8961530022\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Constance Pinard, 73, had a life with struggles: A marriage gone sour, the pressures of raising two children on her own, family rifts that grew worse with an aggressive case of dementia. But there were so many joys, too: The miles she drove in her Jeep or flew in the air to reach new places as a travel nurse, the rank of captain she achieved, the thrill of meeting Barry Manilow, the musician she loved. Her sister Tammy Petrowicz remembers a woman overflowing with energy “like the Energizer Bunny,” who was 16 years older but “still could run circles around me.” The Air Force veteran loved meeting new people wherever she went. Petrowicz recalls standing in a grocery store line with her, chit-chatting with strangers like they were old friends. “She talked to anybody and everybody,” her sister says.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"1bebb1ac605d4aee990da0bda02fb735\">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class=\"audio-embed\" id=\"afs:Medium:8975830254\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>James Sullivan, 99, grew up with nothing and appreciated everything, a consummate gentleman who found joy in the small things — the Red Sox on TV, a cold Bud Light in his hand, a fresh tomato out of the garden. Sullivan was an artillery technician in the Army during World War II who won the Bronze Star. He had a mischievous side, as evidenced by the time his father told him he couldn’t play ball because he had to paint the garage. He obliged, painting it top to bottom, windowpanes and all. He was a liquor store clerk, a school custodian and a city councilman, a man who always beamed with a smile right up to the end of his life. He died four days shy of his 100th birthday. Quiet, unselfish, inquisitive about others. “How you doing, pal?” he’d ask. Whenever someone would ask him the same, he offered something similar: “Never had a bad day.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"e413cdc770ef4726b5fa233762159550\">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class=\"audio-embed\" id=\"afs:Medium:8947613482\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Charles Lowell, 78, was a missile guide technician and an IBM operations manager, a Masonic lodge master and town selectman, a volunteer firefighter and paramedic. Along the way, his life was littered with good deeds — the troubled teenager he’d take in, the hungry family he’d help with groceries — done with little notice or unmentioned altogether. “He didn’t tell people things like that,” his daughter Susan Kenney says. She remembers a father always teaching her something new and always trying to make people laugh, something his wife, Alice Lowell, says his colleagues appreciated. “It wasn’t like going to work,” she says of the man she knew since she was a child. “It was going to play with Chuck.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"08933703c58944fe99821f9afe3b684b\">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class=\"audio-embed\" id=\"afs:Medium:8966800115\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Stephen Kulig, 92, always had a smile on his face and hard candies in his pocket. The list of roles he played was long: veteran of World War II and Korea, devoted Boston sports fan, bingo caller, school dance chaperone, altar server, soup kitchen volunteer, Knights of Columbus member. His daughter Elizabeth DeForest remembers a man who was a natural caregiver — for his wife of 63 years, for his five children and for his parents and in-laws. “I use the word fierce to describe him,” DeForest says. “He was really fiercely proud of his family. He was fierce in the way that he practiced faith and he taught it to our family and to all of us. Just fierce in the way he loved and protected the people that mattered to him.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"b276a88475294aadb88572dc5c68f2e5\">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class=\"audio-embed\" id=\"afs:Medium:8991850026\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Chester LaPlante, 78, had a knack for improving things wherever he went. He restored cars and could repair just about anything, and in the lives of his three children, he was the jack-of-all-trades father who knew how to make them smile. His son Randy LaPlante remembered his father giving him “bear rides” around the living room, rubbing his beard against his little face and buying him a go-kart. Later, the elder LaPlante took his son under his wing and taught him about being a machinist, a career he holds to this day. “I don’t know where I would be without him,” LaPlante says. \u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"66fcd820e96044fc97ee77c6586b0d1f\">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class=\"audio-embed\" id=\"afs:Medium:8951570632\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Harry Malandrinos, 89, was a quiet man, but had many stories to tell: of fighting a war in Korea, of touring the U.S. as a band’s drummer, of four decades as a public school teacher. “When he spoke, you listened, because he didn’t waste his words,” his daughter-in-law Cheryl Malandrinos says. He always had a joke, was a master woodworker, avidly rooted for the Patriots, Red Sox and Bruins and would happily settle for “Family Feud” if his teams weren’t on TV. Every now and again, his son Paul Malandrinos would run into a former student of his father’s who would sing his praises. “He was pretty much the working class guy that represents so many of us,” his daughter-in-law says.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"0b3da69f27f74ce78ccfbab68d945731\">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class=\"audio-embed\" id=\"afs:Medium:8980410016\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Francis Foley, 84, never learned to read music but could play any song by ear. He loved a cup of coffee and something sweet from Dunkin’ Donuts. He kept the nurses at the home laughing. He was fiercely protective of his family. Ask his family about the man they lost, and the words flow easily about the card-carrying union carpenter, Army veteran, devoted husband of 54 years and father of four. “He was strong. He was funny. He was engaging. He was ornery. He was feisty,” his daughter Keri Rutherford says. “He was still full of life.

His daughter Robin Benson Wilson calls them “comfort sounds” that signaled “the world is good.” He was a towering 6-foot-4. He made friends easily and often, always finding a familiar face wherever he went. He was a mechanic in the Korean War and it seemed like he could fix anything. With old age, his ability to whistle faded. But during a Christmastime visit by Benson Wilson to the Soldiers’ Home, her father managed to pucker his lips and offer a bit of that familiar tune one last time.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"1385d6c64d994cdab95ae4db4f305998\">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class=\"audio-embed\" id=\"afs:Medium:8949790068\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Emilio DiPalma, 93, had gone off to war as a happy-go-lucky kid, but it didn’t take long for his Hollywood visions of battle to dissolve into the reality of watching friends die. After the Germans were defeated, DiPalma was sent to Nuremberg, where he made copies of documents detailing war crimes, watched over Nazis in their prison cells and stood guard beside the witness box in the courtroom where the evils of genocide were detailed. One time, he filled the glass of one of the most powerful Nazis — Hermann Goring — with toilet water. Back home in the U.S., he lived a life of humility, rarely talking about his service. “He did all of this in World War II and we hardly knew about it,” says his daughter Emily Aho. \u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"746f13b86f7a490caf359f37be26b31f\">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class=\"audio-embed\" id=\"afs:Medium:8978210134\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>James Mandeville, 83, had a playfulness to him that never seemed to fade. With his grandchildren, he’d swim and wrestle and play basketball, even after he started using a wheelchair. He’d play cards with his daughter Laurie Mandeville Beaudette and, if she left the table, she’d return to find the deck had been stacked. She took to calling him “Cheater Beater.” He found joy in babies and dogs and for all his fun-lovingness, he imparted something deep in those who were close to him. “He always made me feel like I was the most important person in the world,” she says. “We were best friends.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"e12cec7ae0364d24bcbbbec8f58a4597\">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class=\"audio-embed\" id=\"afs:Medium:8970210347\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Samuel Melendez, 86, would clam up and appear sad when someone would ask about his time in Korea. But he was affectionate and easygoing, a man who’d let a young relative have a seat on his lap or give them a dollar from his pocket, which made them feel rich. He loved the island of his heritage, Puerto Rico. He loved dominoes and family gatherings and would jump on a plane whenever someone needed him. When he became less independent, he went to live with his niece Janet Ramirez and when he needed more help, he moved to the Soldiers’ Home, where she is a nurse’s aide. She lost her own father when she was young and as her uncle grew sicker, Ramirez slipped away to his room to hold his hand or to play Spanish music on her phone and put it to his hear. “I felt like he was my dad,” she says. \u003c/p>","dateline":null,"old_lead_video_key":null,"truncatedFirstWords":true,"etag":"43b5a0240fdf9e091069121a2f5f66cd_0a4aza0c0","flattenedFirstWords":"Each of their stories was different, but common strains repeat: Of humility and generosity; of finding joy in the unpretentious; of a sharp mind disappearing into fog or a hale body betrayed by...","version":null,"latestEtag":"43b5a0240fdf9e091069121a2f5f66cd_1a36aza0c0","gcsUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/contents/urn:publicid:ap.org:43b5a0240fdf9e091069121a2f5f66cd","revision":null,"mediumIds":["e413cdc770ef4726b5fa233762159550","520676c02a464e0eb342d15c1e6c03dc","f954aad33cf148588a2e0d92d47a117e","1bebb1ac605d4aee990da0bda02fb735","08933703c58944fe99821f9afe3b684b","b276a88475294aadb88572dc5c68f2e5","66fcd820e96044fc97ee77c6586b0d1f","0b3da69f27f74ce78ccfbab68d945731","bf6b7b05d2b24ae09ab442e4afe6c563","1385d6c64d994cdab95ae4db4f305998","746f13b86f7a490caf359f37be26b31f","e12cec7ae0364d24bcbbbec8f58a4597"],"media":[{"alignment":"full","audioMimeType":null,"altText":null,"videoRenderedSizes":[],"imageFileExtension":".jpeg","title":null,"type":"Photo","flattenedCaption":"An image of veteran Charles Lowell is projected onto the home he shared with his wife, Alice, for 30 years as she stands at left with her daughter, Susan Kenney, in Hardwick, Mass.

His father, a decorated World War I veteran, was a prominent lawyer who was allowed to practice even after the Nazis forbade most Jews from doing so and he published poetry and wrote plays that were performed at local theaters. \u003c/p>\u003cp>But eventually he too was taken away to a concentration camp and came back three weeks later “a broken man,” according to Peter Toren. He and his wife eventually died in Auschwitz.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Toren’s great-uncle, the wealthy Jewish industrialist and art collector David Friedmann, was forced to flee and the Nazis pillaged his extensive collection. Many of the works ended up in the hands of Hildebrand Gurlitt, a notorious German art dealer who traded in what the Nazis called “degenerate art” — works deemed inferior because they were un-German, Jewish or Communist or, as is the case with Impressionist and other Modernist works, did not employ traditionally realistic forms. Still, they were happy to sell the works to help fund their war machine.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Much of Gurlitt’s collection remained unseen for decades and experts feared they had been lost or destroyed. But a vast horde resurfaced by surprise in 2012 when German authorities raided a Munich apartment belonging to his son Cornelius while investigating him for tax evasion. Paintings by artists including Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir and Henri Matisse were discovered. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"hub-link-embed\" id=\"afs:Content:8926730251\">Full Coverage: Lives Lost\u003c/div>\u003cp>The reclusive Cornelius Gurlitt, who said he had inherited much of the art from his father, kept more than 1,200 works in his Munich apartment and 250 more in Salzburg, Austria. The discovery brought renewed attention to the many unresolved cases of looted art that was never returned to original Jewish owners or their descendants. Cornelius Gurlitt died in 2014 at age 81, designating Switzerland’s Kunstmuseum Bern as the sole heir to a collection worth billions of dollars.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Friedmann’s daughter Charlotte died in Auschwitz, leaving Toren as the only descendant to stake a claim. After reclaiming “Two Riders on the Beach,” Toren tracked down another piece that had oddly made its way to Israel. After a lengthy negotiation \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/e671014a704d4311b2b2df42c651cb81/Artwork-Nazis-stole-in-WWII-returning-to-Jewish-owner's-heir\"> he got back “Basket Weavers” \u003c/a> as well, an Impressionist work depicting five boys weaving baskets out of straw. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Peter Toren said his father spent his final years pursuing the art collection and further efforts were ongoing to acquire more than 50 documented antiques seized from Friedmann’s collection.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Despite his background, Toren had no problem using his language skills to cultivate German clients in New York, even those with Nazi connections. As a patent attorney, he once represented a Bavarian farm machinery company with ties to the infamous Nazi doctor Josef Mengele. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“I asked my father how he could deal with Nazi clients and he told me that if he didn’t do the work someone else would,” Peter Toren said, before adding. “And he charged such clients an unofficial 25% Nazi surcharge.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>Toren’s grandson, Ben, said his grandfather pursued the art collection in retirement with the same “unsentimental” focus and tenacity as he did in his law career.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The artwork thing gave him a new lease on life,” he said. “He very strongly felt that these paintings were his paintings and it gave him a lot of purpose.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“But he never presented himself as being any kind of victim and he never asked for any pity,” he quickly added. “He was always fairly stoic in his demeanor, in how he carried himself.

scrubbed because of bad weather","storyHTML":"\u003cp>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — The launch of a SpaceX rocket ship with two NASA astronauts on a history-making flight into orbit was called off with less than 17 minutes to go in the countdown Wednesday because of thunderclouds and the risk of lightning. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Liftoff was rescheduled for Saturday afternoon.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The spacecraft — designed, built and owned by SpaceX — was set to blast off in the afternoon for the International Space Station, opening a new era in commercial spaceflight. It would have also marked the first time in nearly a decade that the U.S. launched astronauts into orbit from American soil.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But thunderstorms for much of the day threatened to force a postponement, and the word finally came down that the atmosphere was so electrically charged that the spacecraft was in danger of getting hit by lightning.\u003c/p>\u003cp>NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said the agency and SpaceX worked together to “make the right decision” and put safety first at a time when some were wondering whether the public attention surrounding the flight would create undue pressure to launch.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Veteran space shuttle astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken were supposed to ride into orbit aboard SpaceX's sleek, white-and-black, bullet-shaped Dragon capsule on top of a Falcon 9 rocket, taking off from the same launch pad used during the Apollo moon missions a half-century ago.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Both President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence had arrived to watch. Trump, who before the postponement marveled at the \"magnificent\" rocket on the pad, later tweeted that he will return to Florida for the next try, and the vice president did the same.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Thank you to @NASA and @SpaceX for their hard work and leadership. Look forward to being back with you on Saturday!\" Trump said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The flight — the long-held dream of SpaceX founder Elon Musk — would have marked the first time a private company sent humans into orbit.\u003c/p>\u003cp>It would have also ended a launch drought for NASA. Ever since the space shuttle was retired in 2011, NASA has relied on Russian spaceships launched from Kazakhstan to take U.S. astronauts to and from the space station.\u003c/p>\u003cp>During the day, the rumble of thunder could be heard as the astronauts made their way to the pad at NASA's Kennedy Space Center, and a tornado warning was issued moments after they climbed into their capsule.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We could see some raindrops on the windows and just figured that whatever it was, was too close to the launch pad at the time we needed it not to be,” Hurley, the spacecraft commander, said after the flight was scrubbed. “Understand that everybody’s probably a little bit bummed out. That’s just part of the deal. ... We'll do it again, I think, on Saturday.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Appreciate your resilience sitting there in the vehicle,” a controller replied.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Behnken responded: “Nothing better than being prime crew on a new spaceship.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>The astronauts had to remain strapped in their seats until all the fuel in their rocket was unloaded and the emergency escape system was disarmed.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The launch preparations took place in the shadow of the coronavirus outbreak that has killed an estimated 100,000 Americans.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"related-story-embed\" id=\"1673e7e0-91f0-11ea-854d-f76ebfe32708\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>With this mission, “everybody can look up and say, ’Look, the future is so much brighter than the present.′ And I really hope that this is an inspiration to the world,\" Bridenstine said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The flight would put Musk and SpaceX in the same league as only three spacefaring countries — Russia, the U.S. and China, all of which have sent astronauts into orbit.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“What today is about is reigniting the dream of space and getting people fired up about the future,” Musk said in a NASA interview before the postponement.\u003c/p>\u003cp>A solemn-sounding Musk said he felt his responsibilities most heavily when he saw the astronauts’ wives and young sons just before the launch attempt. He said he told them: “We’ve done everything we can to make sure your dads come back OK.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>NASA pushed ahead with the preparations despite the viral outbreak but kept the guest list at Kennedy extremely limited and asked spectators to stay at home. Still, thousands jammed area bridges and beaches to watch, many of them not wearing masks or observing the 6-foot social distancing rules.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The space agency also estimated 1.7 million people were watching the launch preparations online.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"hub-link-embed\" id=\"afs:Content:8990430523\">Full Coverage: Space Launch\u003c/div>\u003cp>Among the spectators was Erin Gatz, who came prepared for both rain and pandemic. Accompanied by her 14-year-old daughter and 12-year-old son, she brought face masks and a small tent.\u003c/p>\u003cp>She said the children had faint memories of watching in person one of the last shuttle launches almost a decade ago when they were preschoolers. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“I wanted them to see the flip side and get to see the next era of space travel,” said Gatz, who lives in Deltona, Florida. “It’s exciting and hopeful.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>NASA hired SpaceX and Boeing in 2014 to design and build spaceships to carry astronauts to the space station in a new kind of public-private partnership aimed at bringing down costs and spurring innovation. Boeing's capsule, Starliner, is not expected to fly astronauts into space until early 2021.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Ultimately, NASA hopes to rely, in part, on its commercial partners as it works to send astronauts back to the moon in the next few years, and on to Mars in the 2030s.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We’re doing it differently than we’ve ever done it before,\" Bridenstine said. \"We’re transforming how we do spaceflight in the future.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

That presented organizers with a social distancing problem that won't be solved by the fall.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“There’s no way to hold this usual race format without bringing large numbers of people into close proximity,” Walsh said. \"While our goal and our hope was to make progress in containing the virus and recovering our economy, this kind of event would not be responsible or realistic on Sept. 14 or any time this year.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The longest-running annual marathon in the world, the Boston Marathon began in 1897 when 15 men drew a starting line in the dirt in Ashland and headed for the city to commemorate the first modern Olympic Games the previous year. In 1918, the format was modified to a relay due to World War I; the 2013 race was stopped when two bombs exploded at the finish line, several hours after the winners had finished but while many recreational runners were still on the course.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"related-story-embed\" id=\"982b3240-91f0-11ea-f766-f383bbb0f23b\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Boston Athletic Association CEO Tom Grilk said the race also had to adjust when temperatures along the course approached 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 Celsius) in 2012; ten years ago, ash from a volcanic eruption in Iceland grounded air travel and prevented many European runners from coming to Boston.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“There is a pretty rich history of accommodation and addressing reality.

That, of course, would be good news for Darnold and the Jets. For Flacco, though, he envisions himself back under center as a starter.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Maybe not this year. But in years to come.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Oh, for sure,” Flacco said. \"We’re talking about all these things and that is my role, to help the team out. But, I obviously still believe that I’m a starting quarterback. And, you never know what three years down the line is going to look like. So I still have that confidence and I still have the want-to to do that. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“But, at this moment, that’s not my role. My role is to help the team get better and to help a young quarterback see things as clearly as possible and helping along his journey to being a longtime NFL quarterback.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Flacco is trying to get up to speed on coach Adam Gase’s offense by participating this week in virtual meetings. He won’t put a timetable on when he’ll be able to potentially play, but there’s a chance it might not come until sometime in September.\u003c/p>\u003cp>He’s leaving that to the doctors, though. Flacco is just happy to have another chance to continue his playing career. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“Sometimes it’s not your decision, but not playing was never never one of my choices,” Flacco said. “It was a tough decision for me to get surgery or not to get surgery in one respect because I just didn’t have a ton of symptoms telling me, ‘Hey, you need to get surgery.’ \u003c/p>\u003cp>\"But when it became evident that I probably wasn’t going to play football again unless I did get something done and a team that signed me could feel comfortable that, when I was ready to go out on the field, I was going to stay healthy, at least in terms of this (neck) area, it became very clear that this is what I had to do.\"\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Flacco spent his first 11 NFL seasons in Baltimore, where current Jets general manager Joe Douglas was a scout in 2008 and pushed for the Ravens to draft him. They did, with the 18th overall pick out of Delaware. In his fifth season, Flacco helped lead Baltimore to a Super Bowl victory and was rewarded by becoming the highest-paid quarterback in NFL history at the time with a six-year contract worth $120.6 million.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Injuries have limited Flacco to 17 games over the past two seasons. Baltimore moved on and traded him to Denver last winter, clearing the way for Lamar Jackson to take over as the Ravens' new face of the franchise. Flacco started the first eight games for the Broncos, but injured his neck in Week 8 and missed the rest of the season.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I know what it’s like to not feel like being part of a team because you really can’t have your hand in things,” said Flacco, who was \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/b263536be67c23b8fae0ee1403f92070\">waived by Denver in March\u003c/a> with a failed physical designation. “I think in the role I’m in now, you can definitely have a good, positive effect on the team.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>There had been some questions about Flacco's willingness to mentor young players, highlighted by his comments last year that he didn't think developing players — rookie Drew Lock, in particular — was part of his job. \u003c/p>\u003cp>In both Baltimore and Denver, though, Flacco was still the starter with young QBs behind him. In New York, he goes in knowing his primary role is as an experienced backup to Darnold, who has missed three games in each of his first two NFL seasons.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The two actually spoke on the phone for a few minutes before Flacco's call with reporters.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Listen, I don’t think there are any backups in this league that don’t have aspirations to be a starting quarterback,\" Flacco said. \"It’s just part of the business. It’s part of being on a team and knowing your role. And, roles can change here and there. You can be on different teams from year to year.

the garden—variety business type. During the quiz's show initial 1999-2002 run, the network milked the unexpected hit with nightly airings until its ratings crashed.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Then there was the lawsuit over the show's profits that yielded a $269 million verdict, plus interest, against ABC's parent company, Disney.\u003c/p>\u003cp>British TV, which originated the series, easily topped those corporate offenses. In 2001, a husband and wife were accused of cheating their way to the top million-pound prize — allegedly coughing up the correct multiple-choice answers by brazenly signaling with exactly that, a cough.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The headline-making chapter is the basis of AMC’s “Quiz,” a three-part drama that looks at Charles and Diana Ingram and their painful fall with a deft combination of satire and expansive humanity. Starring Matthew Macfadyen, Sian Clifford and Michael Sheen, the series debuts 10 p.m. EDT Sunday, with the concluding episodes airing at 9 p.m. EDT on June 7 and 14. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Writer James Graham said he intended to convey more than a question of whether justice was done, both in the series and in his play of the same name that debuted in London in 2017.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The story was “a vessel to explore thematically the issue of truth and reality and facts in your country and my country, both to the presidential election and the Brexit referendum, which is the time I started writing this,” he said. “I think we all became increasingly more anxious that there was a battle happening, and the battle was over whether or not anything could ever be proven to be definitely true or definitely false ever again.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The goal was to do that with a light touch, said Graham. (He also expressed hope that the “nasty cough” central to the saga doesn't cast a pandemic-era shadow.) \u003c/p>\u003cp>Like many in the U.K. and beyond, he was aware of the legal and tabloid ordeals of Charles Ingram, who was a major in the British army, and his wife, who were convicted in both forums. More than a decade later, Graham’s interest was re-ignited by a book for that argued for the pair's innocence. (Last month, an attorney for the Ingrams said they intend to appeal their conviction).\u003c/p>\u003cp>The resulting play and TV drama take a nuanced, if not necessarily exculpatory, view of events. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Graham recalls watching “Who Wants to Be a Millionaire” as a teenager and being “transfixed by what, in retrospect, seems like a relatively simple concept of questions and answers.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>He borrows a line from the series to explain why his nation might have embraced pub quizzes and trivia nights more quickly than others: They combine the “two great British loves, drinking and being right.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Then came the unlikely TV plot twist, with a “relatively ordinary couple trying to achieve this extraordinary thing of stealing a million pounds like you would from a bank vault,” Graham said. “But it was a game show, live, in front of cameras and microphones and studio lights and an audience.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Viewers share his fascination. When “Quiz” aired last month on U.K. network ITV, the home of “Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,” it drew big ratings along with enthusiastic reviews. The project teamed Graham, at age 37 already a Tony Award nominee for “Ink,” with veteran director Stephen Frears, a two-time Oscar nominee (“The Queen,” “The Grifters”).\u003c/p>\u003cp>Macfadyen, star of “Succession” and 2005's “Pride &amp; Prejudice,” and Clifford, who played Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s sibling in “Fleabag,” portray the Ingrams, with Sheen (“Masters of Sex”) as the quiz show’s longtime host, Chris Tarrant.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Clifford said she dismissed everything she had heard and read about the couple after she received the script.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“You don’t have to dig very deep into this story to realize there has been an injustice of sorts,\" she said, \"whether or not you think they’re guilty, but certainly in terms of fair treatment as human beings by the media and by the public and even the way they were treated in the courtroom, which I think is appalling.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Graham approached the couple's portrayal with “care and grace” and examines events in a balanced way, one that “raises more questions than it gives us answers,” she said. “I think that’s exciting.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Macfadyen said portraying the Ingrams and their relationship became more important than whether they scammed the show, although he and Clifford did go back and forth on the issue. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“As to his guilt or innocence, I don’t know,\" the actor said of Charles Ingram. \"I really don’t know, is the honest answer.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>—-\u003c/p>\u003cp>AP Writer Alicia Rancilio in New York contributed to this report.\u003c/p>\u003cp>—-\u003c/p>\u003cp>Lynn Elber can be reached on Twitter at \u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/lynnelber\">http://twitter.com/lynnelber\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>","dateline":null,"old_lead_video_key":null,"truncatedFirstWords":false,"etag":"6b34facbc87ed279ae3add85b3ba53f8_1a4aza0c0","flattenedFirstWords":"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Any misconduct that attached to ABC's “Who Wants to Be a Millionaire” was of the garden—variety business type.

escalates war on Twitter, social media protections","storyHTML":"\u003cp>WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump escalated his war on Twitter and other social media companies Thursday, signing an executive order challenging the lawsuit protections that have served as a bedrock for unfettered speech on the internet.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Announced with fanfare, the president's action yet appeared to be more about politics than substance. He aims to rally supporters after he lashed out at Twitter for applying fact checks to two of his tweets.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump said the fact checks were “editorial decisions” by Twitter amounting to political activism and that such actions should cost social media companies their liability protection for what is posted on their platforms.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump, who personally relies heavily on Twitter to verbally flog his foes, has long accused the tech giants in liberal-leaning Silicon Valley of targeting conservatives by fact-checking them or removing their posts.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We’re fed up with it,\" Trump said, claiming his order would uphold freedom of speech.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Technology industry groups disagreed, saying it would stifle innovation and speech on the internet. And the U.S. Chamber of Commerce objected, “Regardless of the circumstances that led up to this, this is not how public policy is made in the United States.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The executive order directs executive branch agencies to ask independent rule-making agencies including the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Trade Commission to study whether they can place new regulations on the companies — though experts express doubts much can be done without an act of Congress.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id='ce2689ee7c70417487bfe56cfe026dfa' class='media-placeholder'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said in a statement, “This debate is an important one. The Federal Communications Commission will carefully review any petition for rulemaking filed by the Department of Commerce.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Companies like Twitter and Facebook are granted liability protection under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act because they are treated as “platforms,\" rather than “publishers,” which can face lawsuits over content. \u003c/p>\u003cp>A similar executive order was previously considered by the administration but shelved over concerns it couldn't pass legal muster and that it violated conservative principles on deregulation and free speech. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\"They’ve had unchecked power to censor, restrict, edit, shape, hide, alter virtually any form of communication between private citizens or large public audiences,\" Trump said of social media companies as he prepared to sign the order. \"There is no precedent in American history for so small a number of corporations to control so large a sphere of human interaction.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"related-story-embed\" id=\"b0fb3c80-91f0-11ea-f756-5774c2d3d08d\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Trump and his campaign reacted after Twitter added a warning phrase to two Trump tweets that called mail-in ballots “fraudulent” and predicted “mail boxes will be robbed.” Under the tweets, there’s now a link reading “Get the facts about mail-in ballots” that guides users to a page with fact checks and news stories about \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/fe3bff525afa93918f8f4f6d1843440c\">Trump’s unsubstantiated claims\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump accused Twitter of interfering in the 2020 presidential election” and declared “as president, I will not allow this to happen.” His campaign manager, Brad Parscale, said Twitter’s “clear political bias” had led the campaign to pull “all our advertising from Twitter months ago.” In fact, Twitter has \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/63057938a5b64d3592f800de19f443bc\">banned political advertising\u003c/a> since last November.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Late Wednesday, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey tweeted, \"We’ll continue to point out incorrect or disputed information about elections globally.\"\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>On the other hand, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg told Fox News his platform has “a different policy, I think, than Twitter on this.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"hub-link-embed\" id=\"afs:Content:8975020790\">Full Coverage: Donald Trump\u003c/div>\u003cp>“I just believe strongly that Facebook shouldn’t be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online,” he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The president’s critics, meanwhile, scolded the platforms for allowing him to put forth false or misleading information that could confuse voters.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat and advocate for internet freedoms said Trump was \"desperately trying to steal for himself the power of the courts and Congress. ... All for the ability to spread unfiltered lies.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump’s proposal has multiple, serious legal problems and is unlikely to survive a challenge, according to Matt Schruers, president of the Computer and Communications Industry Association, a Washington-based organization that represents computer and internet companies.\u003c/p>\u003cp>It would also seem to be an assault on the same online freedom that enabled social media platforms to flourish in the first place — and made them such an effective microphone for Trump and other politicians.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The irony that is lost here is that if these protections were to go away social media services would be far more aggressive in moderating content and terminating accounts,” Schruers said. “Our vibrant public sphere of discussion would devolve into nothing more than preapproved soundbites.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said it was “outrageous” that while Twitter had put a fact-check tag on Trump’s tweets asserting massive mail-in election fraud, it had not removed his tweets repeating a debunked conspiracy theory that a TV news host had murdered an aide years ago.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The president and fellow conservatives have been claiming, for years, that Silicon Valley tech companies are biased against them. But there is no evidence for this — and while the executives and many employees of Twitter, Facebook and Google may lean liberal, the companies have stressed they have no business interest in favoring one political party over the other. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The trouble began in 2016, two years after Facebook launched a section called “trending,” using editors to curate popular news stories. Zuckerberg met with prominent right-wing leaders at the time in an attempt at damage control, and in 2018, Facebook shut down the “trending” section,.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In August 2018, Trump accused Google of biased searches and warned the company to “be careful.” Google pushed back sharply, saying Trump’s claim simply wasn’t so, and experts suggested his comments showed a misunderstanding of how search engines work.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Last year, Trump again blasted social media companies after Facebook banned a slew of extremist figures including conspiracy peddler Alex Jones from its site and from Instagram.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Meanwhile, the companies are gearing up to combat misinformation around the November elections. Twitter and Facebook have begun rolling out dozens of new rules to avoid a repeat of the false postings about the candidates and the voting process that marred the 2016 election.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak\">The coronavirus pandemic\u003c/a> has further escalated the platforms' response, leading them to take actions against politicians — a move they’ve long resisted — who make misleading claims about the virus. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Last month, Twitter began a “Get the Facts” label to direct social media users to news articles from trusted outlets next to tweets containing misleading or disputed information about the virus. \u003c/p>\u003cp>As the White House claimed that Trump was the subject of a fact check but Chinese disinformation about the coronavirus was not, Twitter moved Thursday to add a warning to a March tweet from a Chinese government spokesman falsely claiming the U.S. military spread the virus.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Even as he and his supporters complain of bias on the platform, Trump has used Twitter to build a potent and vocal online following. The president’s account currently has more than 80 million followers. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump’s success on social media suggests that his proposal may be more about politics than an actual interest in regulation, according to Rutgers University media professor John Pavlik, who studies the impact of technology on society and government.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Pavlik said that by trying to intimidate the platforms now, he’s seeking to control how the 2020 campaign plays out online and \"about appealing to his base.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>AP writers Amanda Seitz, Barbara Ortutay and David Klepper contributed.\u003c/p>","dateline":null,"old_lead_video_key":"ce2689ee7c70417487bfe56cfe026dfa","truncatedFirstWords":true,"etag":"fc30f9ebdff9d3d33a870e7374f8ffa6_15a1aza0c0","flattenedFirstWords":"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump escalated his war on Twitter and other social media companies Thursday, signing an executive order challenging the lawsuit protections that have served as...","version":null,"latestEtag":null,"gcsUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/contents/urn:publicid:ap.org:fc30f9ebdff9d3d33a870e7374f8ffa6","revision":null,"mediumIds":["ce2689ee7c70417487bfe56cfe026dfa","328549a4282442d5a20c0242a2fd02d8","b990328049bc46e7826600f45d976ac9","07b9211738ed43e7b6ead17fbc2e278c","201cccc7b7494c14912a2d0029957081","88165893f0744d4793c98ae355469dad","94bba11b31ce463eaa2df47c1ff0e541","c9fb58f6d12f4c52b166953eacbe23e6","da1b273e228f497197341d3d92b10e9c","34ee206d5b684c878b834a24b7bb2fda","bbeda6d1d7eb46ad82f1b31a4db40d29"],"media":[{"altText":null,"imageFileExtension":".jpeg","audioMimeType":null,"id":"ce2689ee7c70417487bfe56cfe026dfa","alignment":null,"embedCaption":null,"videoRenderedSizes":[640],"title":null,"imageMimeType":"image/jpeg","state":null,"etag":"ce2689ee7c70417487bfe56cfe026dfa_0a3aza9c0","externalId":"pHJL8pqTa_8","videoMimeType":"video/mpeg","managementId":"ce2689ee7c70417487bfe56cfe026dfa","flattenedCaption":"President Donald Trump escalated his war on social media companies Thursday, signing an executive order challenging the liability protections that have served as a bedrock for unfettered speech on the internet (May 28)","videoFileExtension":".mp4","type":"YouTube","caption":"\u003cp>President Donald Trump escalated his war on social media companies Thursday, signing an executive order challenging the liability protections that have served as a bedrock for unfettered speech on the internet (May 28)\u003c/p>","imageRenderedSizes":[1920,1000,800,600,400],"aspectRatio":1.7777777777777777,"xxUpdated":"2020-05-28 22:27:01","gcsBaseUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/ce2689ee7c70417487bfe56cfe026dfa/"},{"altText":null,"imageFileExtension":".jpeg","audioMimeType":null,"id":"328549a4282442d5a20c0242a2fd02d8","alignment":null,"embedCaption":null,"videoRenderedSizes":[640],"title":null,"imageMimeType":"image/jpeg","state":null,"etag":"328549a4282442d5a20c0242a2fd02d8_0a4aza9c0","externalId":"Jn6U88Q1-fM","videoMimeType":"video/mpeg","managementId":"328549a4282442d5a20c0242a2fd02d8","flattenedCaption":"President Donald Trump on Wednesday threatened social media companies with new regulation or even shuttering a day after Twitter added fact checks to two of his tweets.

He turned to his Twitter account — where else? — to tweet his threats.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The president can’t unilaterally regulate or close the companies, and any effort would likely require action by Congress. His administration has shelved a proposed executive order empowering the Federal Communications Commission to regulate technology companies, citing concerns it wouldn't pass legal muster. But that didn't stop Trump from angrily issuing strong warnings.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Tech giants “silence conservative voices,\" he claimed on Twitter early Wednesday. “We will strongly regulate, or close them down, before we can ever allow this to happen.” Later, also on Twitter, he threatened, “Big Action to follow.” And in one more late-night tweet, he said “Big Tech” was “going absolutely CRAZY. Stay Tuned!!!”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters Trump would sign an executive order relating to social media companies but provided no further details.

Prominent Republicans, including Rep. Liz Cheney and Sen. Mitt Romney, urged Trump to drop the attack — which has not been marked with a fact check by the social media company.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump and his campaign had lashed out at the company Tuesday after \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/700c52aab0869253625b80255a397f19\">Twitter added a warning phrase to two Trump tweets \u003c/a> that called mail-in ballots “fraudulent” and predicted that “mail boxes will be robbed,” among other things. Under the tweets, there is now a link reading “Get the facts about mail-in ballots” that guides users to a Twitter “moments” page with fact checks and news stories about Trump’s unsubstantiated claims.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump replied on Twitter, accusing the platform of “interfering in the 2020 Presidential Election” and insisting that “as president, I will not allow this to happen.” His 2020 campaign manager, Brad Parscale, said Twitter’s “clear political bias” had led the campaign to pull “all our advertising from Twitter months ago.” Twitter has banned all political advertising since last November.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"social-embed\" id=\"se0:96134fa0-91f0-11ea-c71c-0d360d3cefe5\">\u003cblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">.\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/Twitter?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Twitter\u003c/a> is now interfering in the 2020 Presidential Election.

The president’s critics, meanwhile, have scolded the platforms for allowing him to put forth false or misleading information that could confuse voters. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Some Trump allies have questioned whether platforms like Twitter and Facebook should continue to enjoy liability protections as “platforms” under federal law — or be treated more like publishers, which can face lawsuits over content.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The protections have been credited with allowing the unfettered growth of the internet for more than two decades, but now some Trump allies are advocating that social media companies face more scrutiny.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Big tech gets a huge handout from the federal government,\" Republican Sen. Josh Hawley told Fox News. “They get this special immunity, this special immunity from suits and from liability that’s worth billions of dollars to them every year. Why are they getting subsidized by federal taxpayers to censor conservatives, to censor people critical of China?”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Twitter’s first-ever use of a label on Trump’s tweets comes as platforms gear up to combat misinformation around the U.S. presidential election. Twitter and Facebook have begun rolling out dozens of new rules to avoid a repeat of the false postings about the candidates and the voting process that marred the 2016 election.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The advent of the coronavirus pandemic has further escalated the platforms' response, leading them to take actions against politicians — a move they’ve long resisted — who make misleading claims about the virus. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Last month, Twitter began a “Get the Facts” label to direct social media users to news articles from trusted outlets next to tweets containing misleading or disputed information about the virus. Company leaders said at the time that the new labels could be applied to anyone on Twitter, and that it was considering using them on other topics. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Twitter has said it will decide internally when to use a label, and on which tweets, and it will draw from information curated from news outlets.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg weighed in on the matter during a Fox News interview Wednesday. “We have a different policy, I think, than Twitter on this,\" he said. \"I just believe strongly that Facebook shouldn’t be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>Meanwhile, Republicans were turning their fire on one of the Twitter executives responsible for adding the fact checks: Yoel Roth, its head of site integrity. They are pointing to tweets he sent in 2016 and 2017 railing against the president and his allies. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“From their bogus ‘fact check’ of @realDonaldTrump to their ‘head of site integrity’ displaying his clear hatred towards Republicans, Twitter’s blatant bias has gone too far,” tweeted Republican National Chairman Chair Ronna McDaniel.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Jack Balkin, a Yale University law professor and First Amendment expert, said any attempt to regulate social media companies for the content on their sites would likely need congressional input and approval — and probably face strong legal challenges.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The president can’t do very much, but that’s not the point,” he said. “This is an attempt by the president to, as we used to say in basketball, work the refs.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“He’s threatening and cajoling with the idea that these folks in their corporate board rooms will think twice about what they’re doing, so they won’t touch him.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>—-\u003c/p>\u003cp>AP writers Amanda Seitz and David Klepper contributed.\u003c/p>","dateline":null,"old_lead_video_key":"da1b273e228f497197341d3d92b10e9c","truncatedFirstWords":true,"etag":"c8898aad60175df06ebd160023285001_13a9aza0c0","flattenedFirstWords":"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump, the historically prolific tweeter of political barbs and blasts, threatened social media companies with new regulation or even shuttering on Wednesday...","version":null,"latestEtag":null,"gcsUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/contents/urn:publicid:ap.org:c8898aad60175df06ebd160023285001","revision":null,"mediumIds":["e8fe597f968346b191e833db24063441","a7f0a8c1c00b4b748119b24eb623c730","da1b273e228f497197341d3d92b10e9c","328549a4282442d5a20c0242a2fd02d8","c9fb58f6d12f4c52b166953eacbe23e6"],"media":[{"alignment":null,"audioMimeType":null,"altText":null,"videoRenderedSizes":[],"imageFileExtension":".jpeg","title":null,"type":"Photo","flattenedCaption":"President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump arrive at Andrews Air Force Base, Md., Wednesday, May 27, 2020, after traveling to Florida.

And while the Justice Department has threatened to join lawsuits against states that move too slowly, a statement of interest filed by the department in Illinois last week didn't raise any federal constitutional claims.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Even if he doesn't follow through on threats, Trump's statements still can have consequences as he uses his bully pulpit.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“He’s still trying to wield his often outrageous interpretations of the law as a cudgel to bludgeon others,” said Joshua Geltzer, founding executive director of the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection at Georgetown University Law Center.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump is now \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/fc30f9ebdff9d3d33a870e7374f8ffa6\">on a tear against Twitter\u003c/a> after the social media platform, which he uses to speak directly to his more than 80 million followers, slapped fact-check alerts on two of his tweets claiming that mail-in voting is fraudulent.\u003c/p>\u003cp>On Thursday, Trump \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/fc30f9ebdff9d3d33a870e7374f8ffa6\">signed an executive order\u003c/a> challenging the liability protections that have served as a bedrock for unfettered speech on the internet. But the order — which directs executive branch agencies to ask independent rule-making agencies, including the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Trade Commission, to study whether they can place new regulations on social media companies — appeared to be more about politics than substance. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Experts express doubts much can be done without an act of Congress and the order was far less dramatic than Trump's tweet warning social media platforms that he had the power to “strongly regulate” or “close them down.’\u003c/p>\u003cp>While Congress could pass legislation further regulating social media platforms, Trump \"has no such authority,” said former federal judge Michael McConnell, who now directs Stanford Law School’s Constitutional Law Center. \"He is just venting.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“There is absolutely no First Amendment issue with Twitter adding a label to the president’s tweets,\" added Jameel Jaffer, executive director at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, who won the case that prevents Trump from banning his critics from his Twitter feed. “The only First Amendment issue here arises from the president’s threat to punish Twitter in some way for fact-checking his statements.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>But Jack Balkin, a Yale University law professor and First Amendment expert, said that’s not Trump's point.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“This is an attempt by the president to, as we used to say in basketball, work the refs,\" he said. “He’s threatening and cajoling with the idea that these folks in their corporate board rooms will think twice about what they’re doing, so they won’t touch him.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>For Rutgers University media professor John Pavlik, who studies online misinformation, Trump is simply trying to fire up his political base.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“For Trump,\" he said, \"this is about politics.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Associated Press writer David Klepper contributed to the report from New York.\u003c/p>","embedCaption":null,"sequenceNumber":null,"title":"US--Virus Outbreak-Trump-Powers","headline":"Trump continues to claim broad powers he doesn't have","localMemberName":null,"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:d60a6b1faa40bb91d278b2a54850a6e1","notificationId":null,"videoContext":"d States, the authority is total,” he claimed.\u003c/p>","embedLinkURL":null,"bylines":"By JILL COLVIN","mediumIds":["4e5f24cb645b405b9cdb16a99ac24486","6b4800a75c904bc287e0ddd3ee6f9086","ce2689ee7c70417487bfe56cfe026dfa"],"media":[],"updated":"2020-05-28 22:23:10","mediaCount":3,"contentType":"text","gcsUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/contents/urn:publicid:ap.org:d60a6b1faa40bb91d278b2a54850a6e1","shortId":"d60a6b1faa40bb91d278b2a54850a6e1","firstWords":"\u003cp>WASHINGTON (AP) — Threatening to shut down Twitter for flagging false content.

And that's where the experience of previous, more traditional offseasons in Green Bay comes into play.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“This challenge has clearly made everyone – especially myself – take a step back,” McCarthy said. “Don’t react as fast as you may have in normal times.

Baltimore moved on and traded him to Denver last winter, clearing the way for Lamar Jackson to take over as the Ravens' new face of the franchise. Flacco started the first eight games for the Broncos, but injured his neck in Week 8 and missed the rest of the season.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I know what it’s like to not feel like being part of a team because you really can’t have your hand in things,” said Flacco, who was \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/b263536be67c23b8fae0ee1403f92070\">waived by Denver in March\u003c/a> with a failed physical designation. “I think in the role I’m in now, you can definitely have a good, positive effect on the team.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>There had been some questions about Flacco's willingness to mentor young players, highlighted by his comments last year that he didn't think developing players — rookie Drew Lock, in particular — was part of his job. \u003c/p>\u003cp>In both Baltimore and Denver, though, Flacco was still the starter with young QBs behind him. In New York, he goes in knowing his primary role is as an experienced backup to Darnold, who has missed three games in each of his first two NFL seasons.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The two actually spoke on the phone for a few minutes before Flacco's call with reporters.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Listen, I don’t think there are any backups in this league that don’t have aspirations to be a starting quarterback,\" Flacco said. \"It’s just part of the business.

The risk rose with age and other health problems such as high blood pressure.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The studies have big implications: More than 1.6 million new cancers are diagnosed in the United States each year, several million Americans are in treatment now and about 20 million are cancer survivors. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Dr. Jeremy Warner, a Vanderbilt University data scientist who led the larger study, said the results show the wisdom of measures that many hospitals have taken to delay or modify care for many cancer patients, and the need for people treated in the past to be extra careful now. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“If they don’t have COVID-19, they want to do anything they can to avoid getting it,” he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>For Luciano Orsini, that meant postponing surgery at Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia for about a month to avoid having it when virus cases were rising there. Orsini lost one kidney to cancer last year and was eager for this surgery to remove tumors on his sole remaining one.

The others either completed treatment, had not started it, been under observation or had cancer in the past. Researchers included all of these groups because some cancer treatments can affect the lungs or immune system years later and impact the odds of surviving coronavirus, he explained.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Men seemed to fare worse — 17% of them died versus 9% of women. That might be because breast cancer was the most common tumor type in this group, and women with it tend to be younger and with fewer health problems versus many cancers seen in men that are typically diagnosed at later ages. Smoking also is more common among men. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The risk of death also seemed higher for patients taking the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine plus the antibiotic azithromycin, but this could be because sicker patients were given those drugs. Of the 928 study participants, 89 took hydroxychloroquine and 181 took the combination. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The rate of death in patients getting both drugs was 25%, about double the 13% for the group as a whole, Warner said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We do not know if this is cause and effect,” and studies like this can’t prove such a link, he stressed. Use of hydroxychloroquine alone was not tied to a significantly higher risk of death, but there were fewer patients taking it this way. The study now has more than 2,000 patients enrolled and the next analysis will see if the trends stay the same, Warner said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Only two of the 270 took the drugs as part of a clinical trial, which “really stood out to me” because of the potential side effects, Warner said. Unless cancer patients are in one of the carefully designed studies that are testing hydroxychloroquine now, “don’t take that drug” on your own, he advised. \u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Marilynn Marchione can be followed on Twitter at \u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/MMarchioneAP\"> http://twitter.com/MMarchioneAP \u003c/a>\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives \u003ca href=\"https://www.ap.org/press-releases/2018/ap-hhmi-expand-collaboration-to-bolster-health-science-coverage\">support\u003c/a> from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

But there were scenes he never expected to animate until he began working on his short, “Out.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>Hunter wrote and directed \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDaZlFkr2FE\">the nine-minute Pixar film\u003c/a>, which recently debuted on Disney+. It’s about a man named Greg who, while packing up to move, temporarily switches bodies with his dog, Jim. While frantically trying to hide evidence of his boyfriend, Manuel, Greg discovers the courage to reveal his sexual orientation to his parents. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Greg, who’s loosely based on Hunter, is Pixar’s first LGBTQ protagonist. And while “Out” includes some more typically Pixar material (a pair of rainbow animals, a cameo from Wheezy of “Toy Story”), it features images never seen before in the 25 years of the studio, or in the longer history of Disney. Like when Greg and his boyfriend, Manuel, hug each other. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“The first time I drew Greg and Manuel holding each other in the bedroom, I was bawling my face off,” says Hunter. “All this emotion came welling up because I realized I had been in animation for decades and I had never drawn that in my career. It just hit me.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Out” is a small movie on a streaming service, not one of Pixar’s global blockbusters. But it has already had an outsized impact and been celebrated as a milestone for inclusion in family entertainment. GLAAD called it “a huge step forward for the Walt Disney Company.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"799fb2891f984c89942b0466ab076241\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“‘Out’ represents the best of Disney and Pixar’s legacy as a place for heartwarming stories about finding one’s own inner strength in the face of life’s challenges,” said Jeremy Blacklow, GLAAD’s director of entertainment media. \u003c/p>\u003cp>From his home in Oakland, California, Hunter, a 51-year-old animator making his directorial debut, has humbly taken in the warm responses. He managed to meet his producer, Max Sachar, for a celebratory, socially distanced glass of rose last weekend. But he’s been reluctant to talk about such a personal film. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“I felt like this was something I had to do,” said Hunter in one of his first interviews. “I didn’t come out until I was 27 and I’m 51 now, and I feel like I’m still dealing with it. You can’t hide who you are for half of your life and then not carry that baggage around. You’ve got to process it somehow. I got lucky enough to process it in the making of this movie.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>It’s part joke, part truth that “Out” is labeled “based on a true story.” The first shot is of a magical dog and cat jumping through a rainbow. Hunter has had a dog named Jim but, naturally, hasn’t experienced a canine “Freaky Friday.” But the central story is autobiographical.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The relationship of Manuel and Greg is something I went through,” he says. “I wasn’t out to my family and I was in a relationship but they didn’t know about him. It took a toll on our relationship and we ended up breaking up because of that. And that break-up led to me coming out to my family, over the phone in a conference room at Pixar.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Hunter first came up with the idea of a coming-out film five years ago. But it was the \u003ca href=\"https://www.pixar.com/sparkshorts\">Pixar SparkShorts program\u003c/a>, which is meant to discover new voices and experiment with different techniques, that presented Hunter with an opportunity. After working on the Spark short “Purl,” he pitched “Out.” It was greenlit and finished by December. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“It was cool that he was telling this coming out story but he was doing so while coming out as a filmmaker,” says Sachar. “It was really wonderful for everyone to be a part of and witness.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>LGBTQ characters have been increasingly appearing in Disney films but \u003ca href=\"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2020-03-10/onward-lgbtq-representation-disney-pixar\">often do so fleetingly\u003c/a>. Gaston’s sidekick LeFou (Josh Gad) \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/01/movies/beauty-and-the-beast-director-talks-of-exclusively-gay-moment.html\">was suggested to be gay \u003c/a> in 2017’s live-action “Beauty and the Beast.” Pixar’s “Onward,” released earlier this year, featured what many consider Disney's first outwardly gay animated character: a police officer voiced by Lena Waithe who refers to her girlfriend. Some Middle East nations \u003ca href=\"https://deadline.com/2020/03/disney-onward-banned-multiple-middle-east-markets-lesbian-lgbt-reference-1202876168/\"> banned the film.\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Out,” finally, is far more straightforward. It includes, for example, a tender kiss between Manuel and Greg. To animate it, Hunter approached Wendell Lee, the only other gay animator still at Pixar from Hunter’s early days with the company. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“I just went to him and said, ‘You’ve got to animate this.’ And he was like, ‘Heck yeah,’” says Hunter. “I said: I want a kiss. I don’t want a peck.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Hunter recently watched “Out” with his family, who live in Canada, over Zoom. It was a moment of connection that he hopes plays out similarly for others during quarantine. For young and old, gay and straight, “Out” is about being proud of who you are, whoever you are. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Reflecting on the film’s significance, Hunter on Thursday \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/9525f22e3d9c78fc46378a060bf40f36\">noted the passing of playwright and AIDS activist Larry Kramer\u003c/a>. “Out,” not coincidentally, came out on Harvey Milk Day. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“We’re just an extension of that. We’re moving toward more visibility. It doesn’t mean we’re taking over. We’re just trying to tell our stories like everyone else,” says Hunter. “And we’re not going anywhere.

The Supreme Court in a statement said Durán — who the AP learned was detained Sunday along with his brother — was suspected of crimes including treason, rebellion, conspiracy with a foreign government as well as arms trafficking and terrorism. The arrests of seven others were also ordered. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The government has yet to comment on the arrest order or explain what role Durán allegedly played in the conspiracy.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But Durán's closeness to top officials had revived allegations floated by opposition leader Juan Guaidó and U.S. officials that he was secretly working on Maduro’s behalf and had co-opted “Operation Gideon,” the name of Goudreau's foiled plot.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“There’s financing here from the dictatorship,” Guaidó said in an interview following the raid with EVTV Miami, an online media outlet run by Venezuelan exiles. “A businessman, a front man closely linked to the host of the gossip show,” he said in reference to socialist party boss Diosdado Cabello, whose weekly TV program, fed by nuggets from Venezuela’s vast intelligence network that he controls, first aired in March the accusations of a planned attack by Goudreau. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Maduro has claimed that Guaidó, whose aides signed a 42-page agreement last year with Goudreau in Miami outlining a plan to take control of the country, was behind last month's raid, with backing from the CIA or the Drug Enforcement Administration. However, Goudreau said he was never paid and the two sides angrily split. For its part, the Trump administration has denied it was behind the plot, with the president joking that had the U.S. been involved it would have gone very badly for Maduro.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The Associated Press on May 1 first \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/79346b4e428676424c0e5669c80fc310\">broke the story\u003c/a> of Goudreau's bizarre plan to train a volunteer army made up of a few dozen Venezuelan military deserters at clandestine camps along the border in neighboring Colombia. They planned to attack military bases and ignite a popular uprising. Goudreau’s partner, in what some opposition leaders called a suicide mission, was retired Venezuelan army Gen. Cliver Alcalá, who had been living in Barranquilla after fleeing his homeland in 2018. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"hub-link-embed\" id=\"afs:Content:8980863281\">Full Coverage: Venezuela\u003c/div>\u003cp>Alcalá surrendered to U.S. authorities in March after he was indicted on drug charges, just a few days after Colombian police seized a cache of weapons that the retired military officer said belonged to the rebel cadre he and Goudreau were readying to bring down Maduro.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But despite no overt U.S. support, a poorly-trained force that stood no chance against Venezuela's sizable military and indications that Maduro's spies had infiltrated the group, Goudreau nonetheless \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/5f44624bb7442d85e431cd64a4aed3a8\">pushed ahead\u003c/a> with his plans. \u003c/p>\u003cp>On May 3 — two days after the AP article — he appeared in a video from Florida claiming that a few dozen “freedom fighters\" he commanded had launched a beach raid to enter Venezuela and capture Maduro. The invaders were caught almost immediately and the embattled leader paraded on state TV the American combatants as evidence of a U.S.-backed coup attempt. The raid has been widely ridiculed on social media as the “Bay of Piglets,\" in reference to the 1961 Cuban fiasco.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Why the plan went forward remains a mystery. But much attention has now shifted to the role of Durán and his brother Pedro.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Both men were quietly arrested Sunday in Venezuela, although Pedro was later released, according to Edward Shohat, Franklin Durán's Miami-based lawyer. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The story of Goudreau's flight aboard Durán's plane was \u003ca href=\"https://panampost.com/orlando-avendano/2020/05/26/ex-green-beret-behind-venezuela-raid-traveled-to-colombia-on-private-aircraft-linked-to-chavismo/?cn-reloaded=1\">first reported by the PanAm Post\u003c/a>, a conservative online publication run by mostly Venezuelan exiles from Miami. \u003c/p>\u003cp>According to Colombian flight documents the PanAm Post shared with the AP, the Jan. 16 trip was chartered by Servicios Aereos Mineros (SERAMI), a for-hire airline that started in the gold-producing Venezuelan state of Bolivar. \u003c/p>\u003cp>An aviation industry executive confirmed the authenticity of the documents and said SERAMI was used by the Durán brothers to charter their frequent flights between Colombia and Venezuela.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The person said Franklin Durán would frequently travel to Barranquilla — passenger manifests provided to the AP show he made at least four flights between the two countries between November 2019 and January 2020 — to bring back food and other supplies to Venezuela, where U.S. sanctions and years of mismanagement have stripped store shelves of many goods. \u003c/p>\u003cp>SERAMI is partly owned by Juan Carlos Ynfante, according to two people familiar with the company. Ynfante was arrested last year in Grand Cayman island for piloting an aircraft with $135,000 in undeclared cash. Ynfante was also named as SERAMI's president in a 2008 U.S. federal forfeiture case in which a plane with the company's logo was seized in Ft. Lauderdale trying to smuggle 150 kilograms of cocaine. \u003c/p>\u003cp>In addition to Goudreau and Durán's two longtime pilots, passengers on the mid January flight included Luke Denman and Airan Berry — two of the former Army veteran's colleagues from the 10th Special Forces Group in Stuttgart, Germany, where he was based before retiring from the U.S. Army in 2016. The two Texas natives have said in videotaped confessions that they believed Goudreau's company, Silvercorp USA, had been hired by Guaidó.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Its unclear why the men traveled on the plane to Colombia or if Durán even knew about it. Goudreau hung up when contacted by the AP on Wednesday. He did not respond to a text messages asking about the flight. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Also on the flight was Yacsy Álvarez. The would-be insurgents in the Colombian camps described the 39-year-old as a trusted aide to Alcalá who also worked for Durán. \u003c/p>\u003cp>One volunteer soldier said that when he needed to fly for meetings between Bogota and Barranquilla it was Álvarez who would purchase his tickets. On other occasions, he would electronically transfer her via Zelle, the digital payments network, small amounts of money he had collected from friends and family to feed the ragtag army. Denman, in his jailhouse statement, said it was Álvarez who drove him and Berry from Barranquilla to a rustic camp where the rebels were training. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Álvarez's whereabouts are unknown. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Álvarez was named in 2017 director of Industrias Venoco de Centroamerica, two years after the company was registered in Panama. The company is a subsidiary of Industrias Venoco, a once market-leading auto lubrication manufacturer that Durán controlled before it was nationalized by Chávez in 2010. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Durán at the time he lost Venoco was serving out a 4-year sentence in the U.S. for acting as an unregistered agent of Chávez. The firebrand leader had sent Durán to pressure businessman Alejandro Antonini, who was implicated in the so-called “Suitcase Scandal” when an attempt to smuggle $800,000 in cash to the 2007 campaign of former Argentine President Cristina Fernandez aboard a chartered aircraft was caught. \u003c/p>\u003cp>During the trial, prosecutors pointed out that Durán used to carry a badge identifying him as a Venezuelan naval intelligence officer. The men urged their one-time friend to take the fall and stay quiet but unbeknownst to them Antonini was cooperating with the FBI and recorded their conversations. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Upon Durán's release in 2011 and return to Venezuela, a legal battle with the Venezuelan state to reclaim Venoco ensued. Durán maintained a low profile while he received treatment for cancer. Eventually some of Venoco assets, including the brand name, were returned to him, including a unit in Barranquilla. His brother, going by the artistic name Pedro “The Voice,” tried to develop a career singing salsa. \u003c/p>\u003cp>A woman answering the phone at the Panama-based unit listed on Venoco's website said the company is privately held and run from Barranquilla. An email sent to the Panama unit through Venoco's website went unanswered and the two phone numbers listed for the Barranquilla-based unit on Venoco's website did not work. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Durán was also the founder of Ruibal &amp; Durán, a company that used to sell bulletproof vests and other equipment to Venezuela’s security forces — gear that would've been valuable to an invading army. \u003c/p>\u003cp>He and his brother were also close to Alcalá.

(He also expressed hope that the “nasty cough” central to the saga doesn't cast a pandemic-era shadow.) \u003c/p>\u003cp>Like many in the U.K. and beyond, he was aware of the legal and tabloid ordeals of Charles Ingram, who was a major in the British army, and his wife, who were convicted in both forums. More than a decade later, Graham’s interest was re-ignited by a book for that argued for the pair's innocence. (Last month, an attorney for the Ingrams said they intend to appeal their conviction).\u003c/p>\u003cp>The resulting play and TV drama take a nuanced, if not necessarily exculpatory, view of events. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Graham recalls watching “Who Wants to Be a Millionaire” as a teenager and being “transfixed by what, in retrospect, seems like a relatively simple concept of questions and answers.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>He borrows a line from the series to explain why his nation might have embraced pub quizzes and trivia nights more quickly than others: They combine the “two great British loves, drinking and being right.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Then came the unlikely TV plot twist, with a “relatively ordinary couple trying to achieve this extraordinary thing of stealing a million pounds like you would from a bank vault,” Graham said. “But it was a game show, live, in front of cameras and microphones and studio lights and an audience.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Viewers share his fascination. When “Quiz” aired last month on U.K. network ITV, the home of “Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,” it drew big ratings along with enthusiastic reviews.

The confirmed U.S. death toll topped 100,000, the highest in the world, on Wednesday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The latest job-loss figures from the U.S. Labor Department bring to 41 million the running total of Americans who have filed for unemployment benefits since the coronavirus shutdowns took hold in mid-March.\u003c/p>\u003cp>There were some encouraging signs: The overall number of Americans currently drawing jobless benefits dropped for the first time since the crisis began, from 25 million to 21 million. And first-time applications for unemployment have fallen for eight straight weeks, as states gradually let stores, restaurants and other businesses reopen and the auto industry starts up factories again.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But the number of U.S. workers filing for unemployment is still extraordinarily high by historical standards, and that suggests businesses are failing or permanently downsizing, not just laying off people until the crisis can pass, economists warn.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“That is the kind of economic destruction you cannot quickly put back in the bottle,” said Adam Ozimek, chief economist at Upwork.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"related-story-embed\" id=\"a1114140-91f0-11ea-bb82-edc0c0bf9392\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The U.S. unemployment rate was 14.7% in April, a level not seen since the Depression, and many economists expect it will be near 20% in May.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The figures come amid an intensifying debate in Congress over whether to extend $600 in extra weekly federal unemployment benefits, provided under rescue legislation passed in March but set to expire July 31. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Democrats have proposed extending the payments, while Republicans have argued that the extra money could discourage laid-off workers from returning to jobs that pay less than they are getting on unemployment.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"hub-link-embed\" id=\"afs:Content:9000200772\">Full Coverage: Business\u003c/div>\u003cp>Kelly Kelso, a 30-year-old roadie from Nashville for the rock group Foreigner, got her first unemployment check last week after more than eight weeks of waiting.

If all else fails, I could go back to doing hair.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>Another looming storm cloud: Economists say the sharp loss of tax revenue for state and local governments is likely to compound the damage from the shutdowns by forcing additional public-sector layoffs in the coming weeks. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Those layoffs have just recently started showing up in the weekly jobless claims report. Washington state, for example, reported layoffs of government employees.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Job cuts are also appearing far beyond the initially hit industries such as restaurants and stores, a sign that the damage is spreading even as businesses reopen. Washington state said it saw layoffs in insurance, and New York state reported job cuts by information technology companies.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Economists say many of the jobs lost are never coming back, and double-digit unemployment could persist through 2021. \u003c/p>\u003cp>And as discouraging as the numbers are, the real picture may be worse. The government counts people as unemployed only if they’re actually looking for a job, and many Americans probably see no point in trying when so many businesses are shut down.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Airlines and aircraft manufacturers are struggling after air travel plummeted early in the outbreak. Boeing is cutting more than 12,000 U.S. jobs through layoffs and buyouts, many expected to be in the Seattle area. European budget airline Easyjet said it will cut up to a third of its 15,000 employees. American Airlines plans to eliminate about 5,100 jobs.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Amtrak likewise announced it will lay off about 20% of its 18,000 workers amid a collapse in train ridership.\u003c/p>\u003cp>A number of European countries have strong safety-net programs that are underwriting the wages of millions of workers and keeping them on the payroll instead of adding them to the ranks of the unemployed. But the economic damage is mounting there, too.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Nissan is rolling back production in Spain in a move the government said could lead to 3,000 direct job cuts and thousands more losses at the automaker's suppliers. And French unemployment claims jumped 22% in April, with 843,000 more people seeking work. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Elsewhere around the world, India saw another record daily jump in coronavirus cases. Russia reported a steady increase in its caseload, even as the city of Moscow and provinces across the vast country moved to ease restrictions in sync with the Kremlin’s political agenda.\u003c/p>\u003cp>And South Korea reported its biggest jump in infections in more than 50 days, a setback that could erase some of the hard-won gains that have made it a model for the rest of the world. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Worldwide, the virus has infected more than 5.7 million people and killed over 355,000, with the U.S. having the most confirmed cases and deaths, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.

Since the pandemic began, he has received a \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/01716afc8e0a746be7ded77162d25437\">major religion prize\u003c/a> for his work.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"hub-link-embed\" id=\"afs:Content:8947154580\">Full Coverage: Religion\u003c/div>\u003cp>“I see science as the most reliable way to study nature – and that includes this virus,” Collins said by email.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“But science doesn’t help me with deeper questions like why suffering exists, what we are supposed to learn from it, what is the meaning of life, and whether there is a loving God who grieves with us at a time like this,” he added. “For that, I rely on what I have learned as a person of faith.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Collins lauded the majority of American faith communities for treating the pandemic as an opportunity to live out their values by helping the vulnerable, adding that “most of that loving and altruistic behavior doesn’t get much attention.” He also offered careful criticism for the “occasional examples of churches who reject the scientific conclusions and demand the right to continue to assemble freely, even in the face of evidence that this endangers their whole community.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump on Friday called for governors to allow in-person worship, vowing that “faith leaders will make sure that their congregations are safe as they gather and pray.” The president spoke as the CDC released recommendations for safe reopening of physical religious services, and faith gatherings that occurred this week \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/8223409acb414b941b3e6feca3211c4f\">largely operated\u003c/a> with safeguards in place to help prevent the virus’ spread.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Fauci’s faith has shifted from the path of his Catholic upbringing to what he has described as a humanist belief system. The 36-year veteran chief of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases \u003ca href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?323680-1/qa-dr-anthony-fauci\">told C-SPAN\u003c/a> in 2015 that “I'm less enamored of organized religion than I am with the principles of humanity and goodness to mankind and doing the best that you can.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>While Fauci distanced himself from organized religion in that 2015 interview, he has described himself as Catholic and told C-SPAN his Jesuit education had helped develop the “principles that I run my life by.\" Those principles came into sharper view this month when Fauci recorded \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXaeP4A-6ok\">a video\u003c/a> for graduates of high schools affiliated with the Jesuits, a Catholic order that focuses on service. \u003c/p>\u003cp>After citing “precision of thought and economy of expression\" as two watchwords, he invoked “social justice” as another value instilled by his Jesuit education. Fauci graduated in 1958 from New York's Regis High School, a Jesuit institution.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“And now is the time, if ever there was one, for us to care selflessly about one another,” Fauci said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Rev. Daniel Lahart, president of Regis, hosted Fauci during \u003ca href=\"https://www.regis.org/article.cfm?id=10280\">a visit\u003c/a> to his alma mater last year. He hailed the 79-year-old scientist as a worthy example of a Jesuit education's call for students to dedicate themselves to helping the common good, becoming “men and women for others.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It is part of who we are, that we take community service, public service, as something essential to what our faith’s about,” Lahart said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>__\u003c/p>\u003cp>Associated Press religion coverage receives support from the Lilly Endowment through the Religion News Foundation.

Durán over two decades has had numerous business ties with the socialist government of Venezuela, making him an odd choice to help a band of would-be-mercenaries overthrow Maduro, the handpicked successor of the late Chávez.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Durán and his associates are now at the center of multiple investigations in the U.S., Colombia and Venezuela into how Goudreau, a combat veteran with three Bronze Stars but little knowledge of Venezuela, managed to launch a failed raid that ended with the capture and arrest of his two special forces colleagues.\u003c/p>\u003cp>A Caracas court on Thursday ordered Durán’s arrest as part of its ongoing investigation into the incursion. The Supreme Court in a statement said Durán — who the AP learned was detained Sunday along with his brother — was suspected of crimes including treason, rebellion, conspiracy with a foreign government as well as arms trafficking and terrorism. The arrests of seven others were also ordered. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The government has yet to comment on the arrest order or explain what role Durán allegedly played in the conspiracy.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But Durán’s closeness to top officials had revived allegations floated by opposition leader Juan Guaidó and U.S. officials that he was secretly working on Maduro’s behalf and had co-opted “Operation Gideon,” the name of Goudreau’s foiled plot.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“There’s financing here from the dictatorship,” Guaidó said in an interview following the raid with EVTV Miami, an online media company run by Venezuelan exiles. “A businessman, a front man closely linked to the host of the gossip show,” he said in reference to socialist party boss Diosdado Cabello, whose weekly TV program, fed by nuggets from Venezuela’s vast intelligence network that he controls, first aired the accusations of a planned attack by Goudreau in March. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Maduro has claimed that Guaidó, whose aides signed a 42-page agreement last year with Goudreau in Miami outlining a plan to take control of the country, was behind last month’s raid, with backing from the CIA or the Drug Enforcement Administration. However, Goudreau said he was never paid and the two sides angrily split. For its part, the Trump administration has denied it was behind the plot, with the president joking that had the U.S. been involved it would have gone very badly for Maduro.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The Associated Press on May 1 first \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/79346b4e428676424c0e5669c80fc310\">broke the story\u003c/a> of Goudreau’s bizarre plan to train a volunteer army made up of a few dozen Venezuelan military deserters at clandestine camps along the border in neighboring Colombia. They planned to attack military bases and ignite a popular uprising. Goudreau’s partner, in what some opposition leaders called a suicide mission, was retired Venezuelan army Gen. Cliver Alcalá, who had been living in Barranquilla after fleeing his homeland in 2018.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Alcalá surrendered to U.S. authorities in March after he was indicated on drug charges, just a few days after Colombian police seized a cache of weapons that the former Chávez aide said belonged to the rebel cadre he and Goudreau were readying to bring down Maduro.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But despite no overt U.S. support, a poorly-trained force that stood no chance against Venezuela’s sizable military and indications that Maduro’s spies had infiltrated the group, Goudreau nonetheless pushed ahead with his plans.\u003c/p>\u003cp>On May 3 — two days after the AP article — he appeared in a video from Florida claiming that a few dozen “freedom fighters” he commanded had launched a beach raid to enter Venezuela and capture Maduro. The invaders were caught almost immediately and the embattled leader denounced the assault as a U.S.-backed coup attempt. The raid has been widely ridiculed as the “Bay of Piglets,” in reference to the 1961 Cuban fiasco.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Why the plan went forward remains a mystery. But much attention has now shifted to the role of Durán and his brother Pedro.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Both men were quietly arrested Sunday in Venezuela, although Pedro was later released, according to Edward Shohat, Franklin Durán's Miami-based lawyer. The government has yet to comment on the arrests and has not indicated if it intends to charge either with a crime.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The story of Goudreau’s flight aboard Durán’s plane was \u003ca href=\"https://panampost.com/orlando-avendano/2020/05/26/ex-green-beret-behind-venezuela-raid-traveled-to-colombia-on-private-aircraft-linked-to-chavismo/?cn-reloaded=1\"> first reported \u003c/a> by the PanAm Post, a conservative online publication run by mostly Venezuelan exiles from Miami.\u003c/p>\u003cp>According to Colombian flight documents the PanAm Post shared with the AP, the Jan. 16 trip was chartered by Servicios Aereos Mineros (SERAMI), a for-hire airline that started in the gold-producing Venezuelan state of Bolivar.\u003c/p>\u003cp>An aviation industry executive confirmed the authenticity of the documents and said SERAMI was used by the Durán brothers to charter their frequent flights between Colombia and Venezuela.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The person said Franklin Durán would frequently travel to Barranquilla — passenger manifests provided to the AP show he made at least four flights between the two countries between November 2019 and January 2020 — to bring back food and other supplies to Venezuela, where U.S. sanctions and years of mismanagement have stripped store shelves of many goods.\u003c/p>\u003cp>SERAMI is partly owned by Juan Carlos Ynfante, according to two people familiar with the company. Ynfante was arrested last year in Grand Cayman island for piloting an aircraft with $135,000 in undeclared cash. Ynfante was also named as SERAMI’s president in a 2008 U.S. federal forfeiture case in which a plane with the company’s logo was seized in Ft. Lauderdale trying to smuggle 150 kilograms of cocaine.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In addition to Goudreau and Durán's two longtime pilots, passengers on the mid January flight included Luke Denman and Airan Berry — two of the former Army veteran's colleagues from the 10th Special Forces Group in Stuttgart, Germany, where he was based before retiring from the U.S. Army in 2016. The two Texas natives have said in videotaped confessions that they believed Goudreau’s company, Silvercorp USA, had been hired by Guaidó.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Its unclear why the men traveled on the plane to Colombia or if Durán even knew about it. Goudreau hung up when contacted by the AP on Wednesday. He did not respond to a text messages asking about the flight. \u003c/p>","embedCaption":null,"sequenceNumber":null,"title":"US--Venezuela-American Mercenary-ABRIDGED","headline":"Failed Maduro coup leader flew on pro-govt magnate's plane","localMemberName":null,"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:6b39dbf32283fd9c21028e62c5ee8506","notificationId":null,"videoContext":null,"embedLinkURL":null,"bylines":"By JOSHUA GOODMAN","mediumIds":["e22a7f5b72f04c92bb46fac2d267c459"],"media":[],"updated":"2020-05-28 19:21:15","mediaCount":1,"contentType":"text","gcsUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/contents/urn:publicid:ap.org:6b39dbf32283fd9c21028e62c5ee8506","shortId":"6b39dbf32283fd9c21028e62c5ee8506","firstWords":"\u003cp>MIAMI (AP) — It was mid-January and Jordan Goudreau was itching to get going on a secret plan to raid Venezuela and arrest President Nicolás Maduro when the former special forces commando flew to...\u003c/p>","interactiveLinkUrl":null,"layoutType":"Small Photo","hasTextOverlay":false,"tagIds":["Miami","apf-GeneralNews","apf-latinamerica","apf-intlnews","Colombia","apf-usnews","Venezuela"],"language":null,"interactiveLinkUrlText":null,"leadVideoId":null,"richEmbeds":null,"published":"2020-05-28 12:15:43","localLinkUrl":"https://apnews.com/6b39dbf32283fd9c21028e62c5ee8506","leadPhotoId":"e22a7f5b72f04c92bb46fac2d267c459"}],"localMemberName":null,"pollId":null,"notificationUrl":null,"collectionTagObjs":[],"notificationTitle":null,"minimizedStoryCount":null,"notificationUpdated":null,"sponsorServeAd":false,"teamLimit":null,"shortId":"6b39dbf32283fd9c21028e62c5ee8506","layoutType":"Small Photo","pollWeek":null,"textColor":null,"disclaimerText":null,"notificationText":null,"allowAd":true,"cardType":"Wire Story","teams":null,"sponsorUrl":null,"sponsorAttribution":null},{"feed":[],"bracketsSettings":null,"pollUpdated":null,"textScale":null,"headlineWidget":false,"hubPeekTagId":null,"expandedStoryCount":null,"dividerColor":null,"tagObjs":[],"hubPeekTagName":null,"cardHeadline":null,"sponsorImageUrl":null,"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:0b9c2ab734841cd3c5b7357dd2422bf8","hubPeekLinkText":null,"borderColor":null,"cardTitle":null,"contents":[{"embedHTML":null,"embedHeight":null,"contentSponsor":null,"downloadSettings":null,"tagObjs":[{"order":8,"name":"General News","isPr":false,"id":"apf-GeneralNews"},{"order":0,"name":"Legislation","isPr":null,"id":"Legislation"},{"order":2,"name":"Politics","isPr":null,"id":"apf-politics"},{"order":10,"name":"Latin America","isPr":null,"id":"apf-latinamerica"},{"order":0,"name":"National security","isPr":null,"id":"Nationalsecurity"},{"order":0,"name":"Terrorism","isPr":null,"id":"Terrorism"},{"order":0,"name":"Bills","isPr":null,"id":"Bills"},{"order":0,"name":"Nancy Pelosi","isPr":null,"id":"NancyPelosi"},{"order":0,"name":"Donald Trump","isPr":null,"id":"DonaldTrump"}],"storyHTML":"\u003cp>WASHINGTON (AP) — Democrats on Thursday pulled legislation from the House floor to extend FBI surveillance authorities after President Donald Trump and Republicans turned against the measure and ensured its defeat. The House later voted 284-122 to officially start those negotiations. \u003c/p>\u003cp>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said there instead would be a new round of negotiations with the Senate over the expired powers the FBI considers vital in fighting terrorism. The House later voted 284-122 to officially start those negotiations. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The impasse raised the potential for the surveillance powers to remain expired indefinitely. The provisions, which lapsed in March, allow the FBI to get a court order for business records in national security investigations and conduct surveillance on subjects without establishing they’re acting on behalf of an international terrorism organization. They also make it easier for investigators to continue eavesdropping on a subject who has switched cellphone providers to thwart detection.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>A bill renewing those authorities passed the Senate with 80 votes earlier this month, and it appeared on track for easy passage. The House had overwhelmingly supported a similar measure in March with the support of 126 Republicans. That bill was a compromise worked out between the two parties and Attorney General William Barr.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But the compromise crumbled this week as Trump threatened a veto and House Republicans who had once voted for the bill quickly followed his lead. \u003c/p>\u003cp>House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, who praised the bill in March and said it included “important reforms\" to guard against abuses, reversed that stance when Trump said he opposed it. On Thursday, McCarthy said Congress should “take a pause.\" \u003c/p>\u003cp>Pelosi criticized Republicans for the about-face, noting that some were praising the legislation as recently as Wednesday morning. She said that as soon as the president made his views known, “the commitment to national security disappeared.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>Without a veto-proof majority, Pelosi said, the House would not attempt to pass the measure and instead start direct negotiations. Democrats had scheduled a vote on the legislation Wednesday but adjourned without holding it as it became clear the votes were not there. Dozens of House Democrats were opposed to the bill.\u003c/p>\u003cp>McCarthy said he supported the move to renew negotiations, saying that was “the appropriate thing to do.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>In threatening a veto, Trump cited his frustration with surveillance practices during the Russia investigation, which he refers to as a witch hunt. \u003c/p>\u003cp>On Twitter Thursday, Trump praised “GREAT Republican Congressmen &amp; Congresswomen” who blocked the bill “that would just perpetuate the abuse that produced the Greatest Political Crime In the History of the U.S., the Russian Witch-Hunt. Fantastic Job!”\u003c/p>\u003cp>An inspector general report documented \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/2d46c5046088ed17e57758344c6ce1e1\">serious mistakes\u003c/a> in how the FBI used its authorities during its probe into ties between the Trump presidential campaign and Russia, though it said the FBI was justified in opening the investigation and and found no evidence that it acted with political bias. The problems documented included errors and omissions in applications the FBI submitted under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to monitor a former Trump campaign adviser.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Republicans have historically been hawkish on preserving surveillance powers in the name of national security, and the powers up for renewal aren't directly related to the errors that were uncovered during the Russia investigation. \u003c/p>\u003cp>But Trump has used the legislation to criticize the investigation, which eventually was turned over to special counsel Robert Mueller. Mueller found insufficient evidence to establish a criminal conspiracy between his campaign and Russia but said it could not exonerate Trump on obstruction of justice.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Complicating matters on the surveillance bill were new objections from the Justice Department and old divisions within the Democratic Party. The department said it opposed a Senate add to the bill that would attempt to boost protections for some surveillance subjects, and Democrats who have long opposed surveillance laws reiterated on Wednesday that they wouldn’t support the bill. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The only difference between the House and Senate bills is the amendment adopted by the Senate with 77 votes. That bipartisan language, sponsored by Sens. Mike Lee, R-Utah, and Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, would allow more third-party oversight to protect people in some surveillance cases.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Justice Department said Wednesday that the amended Senate version of the bill would “weaken national security tools while doing nothing to address the abuses” identified by the inspector general's report. \u003c/p>\u003cp>And the leaders of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, which has about 70 Democratic House members, reiterated Wednesday that they’d oppose the bill, saying the legislation doesn’t do enough to protect Americans’ privacy.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We cannot in good conscience vote for legislation that violates Americans’ fundamental right to privacy,” said the progressive caucus’ leaders, Reps.

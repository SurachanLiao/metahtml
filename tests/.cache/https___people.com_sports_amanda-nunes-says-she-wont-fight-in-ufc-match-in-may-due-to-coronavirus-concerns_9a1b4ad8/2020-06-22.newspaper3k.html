<div><p>The <a href="https://people.com/tag/ufc/">UFC</a> is planning to restart its matches on May 9 after a string of <a href="https://people.com/tag/coronavirus/">coronavirus</a>-related cancellations, but the league will have to do so without top fighter Amanda Nunes.</p>
                <p>Nunes, 31, told <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/ufc-two-division-champion-amanda-nunes-wont-fight-on-may-9-wants-full-training-camp-for-felicia-spencer/">CBS Sports</a> she will not be fighting in the match against Felicia Spencer, in which Nunes would have been defending her UFC women&#8217;s featherweight title.</p>

                          <p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think this is the right time for me right now to fight,&#8221; she said Monday. &#8220;Let this coronavirus pass a little bit so I can at least have a full camp. We can maybe see around June, let&#8217;s see what is going to happen. But I&#8217;m not fighting.&#8221;</p>
                <p>Nunes is also the UFC&#8217;s women&#8217;s bantamweight champion, making her the first woman in the league to win titles in two different weight classes. She has the most wins and most title-fight wins among women in UFC history.</p>

                          <p>Though Nunes has been able to continue training amid the coronavirus, her home gym, American Top Team in Coconut Creek, Florida, has been operating under new <a href="https://people.com/tag/social-distancing/">social distancing</a> protocols.</p>
                <p>&#8220;The gym opened just for people that has fights coming up,&#8221; said Nunes, who is <a href="https://people.com/parents/amanda-nunes-nina-ansaroff-expecting-first-child-daughter/">expecting a child</a> with her fiance&#232; and fellow fighter, Nina Ansaroff. &#8220;It&#8217;s not many people, just me and a couple guys that are going to be on the same card as me. We all have separate training with just me and my coach, one on one.&#8221;</p>

                          <p>&#8220;I keep in shape like that,&#8221; she continued. &#8220;I go to the gym only one time in the morning and do everything. I do a couple of things by myself and some things that I need a coach. Then I come home and I really do everything I need to keep in shape. I have a treadmill and some weights.&#8221;</p>

                          <p>Spencer emphasized that while she plans to be ready for June, she will not remain on the May 9 card, according to <a href="https://www.espn.com/mma/ufc/story/_/id/29073770/amanda-nunes-title-bout-not-right-fight">ESPN</a>. UFC will pivot to a new event on May 9 that has yet to be announced.</p>

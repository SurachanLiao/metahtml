STILLWATER — Friday was supposed to be a grand day at Oklahoma State University, with a former president in town and a new baseball stadium opening.

Instead, OSU baseball coach Josh Holliday was inside new O’Brate Stadium nearly alone Friday recording a message for fans.

“Obviously, times have changed and our focus and only concern is everybody’s health and well being,” Holliday said in the video. “Take this excitement and passion for Cowboy baseball, put it on hold and when everything gets back to normal we look forward to seeing you out here."

With the outbreak of the COVID-19 disease shutting down college athletics until the next school year, Friday’s scheduled opener of O’Brate Stadium was postponed until next school year.

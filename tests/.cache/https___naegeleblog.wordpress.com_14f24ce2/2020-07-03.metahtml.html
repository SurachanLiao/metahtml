					<p> &#160; By<a title="Timothy D. Naegele" href="http://www.naegele.com/attorneys.html#tdn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&#160;Timothy D. Naegele</a><a href="#_edn1">[1]</a></p><p>According to recent data, Blacks or African Americans&#8212;or those who are defined as &#8220;having origins in any of the native peoples of Sub-Saharan Africa&#8221;&#8212;constituted 13.4 percent of the U.S. population. &#160;Hispanics and Latino Americans constituted even more, at 18.3 percent of our population. &#160;Whites totaled 60.4, and Asian Americans amounted to 5.9 percent.[2] &#160;</p><p>We are all Americans. &#160;As I wrote more than ten years ago:&#160;</p><blockquote><p>The United States is . . . unlike any other [country] on the Earth. &#160;. . . &#160;Deep beneath the surface, there is love for people everywhere, and an appreciation of each person&#8217;s God-given gifts and&#160;uniqueness. &#160;In a recent interview, I said:</p><p>&#8220;I believe in this country, and I believe in Americans of all colors, faiths and backgrounds. &#160;The United States is the only true melting pot in the world, with its populace representing a United Nations of the world&#8217;s peoples. &#160;Yes, we fight and we even discriminate, but when times are tough&#8212;like after 9/11&#8212;we come together as one nation, which makes this country so great and special. &#160;Also, all of us or our ancestors came here from somewhere else. &#160;Even the American Indians are descended from those who crossed the Bering Strait&#8212;or the &#8216;Bering land bridge&#8217;&#8212;according to anthropologists.&#8221;[3]</p></blockquote><p>The notion that one group is deserving of special privileges or compensation is absurd, and must be rejected. &#160;My ancestors came from England, Germany, Ireland and Scotland. &#160;Indeed, my first paternal ancestors traveled from Rottweil, Germany to New Ulm, Minnesota in 1849&#8212;a husband and wife who had 16 kids. &#160;They braved the Atlantic, and traveled to a new and inhospitable land, the state of Minnesota. &#160;Eleven years later, the husband had assimilated enough that he served with the Minnesota Regiment of the Union Army.&#160;</p><p>I am proud of the fact that Abraham Lincoln and Generals Ulysses S. Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman defeated the South and freed the slaves and saved the nation.[4] &#160;It is galling to see the thugs, slugs, hoods and mongrels of America burn our cities, destroy businesses, attack our police, and deface or tear down our monuments. &#160;They are the dregs of America, who deserve nothing, but they are lauded as heroes by the despicable Left and their fellow travelers.[5]</p><p>Indeed, they are reincarnations of those who rioted in the Watts area of Los Angeles during the summer of 1965, and later during the Rodney King riots in the same city. &#160;They burned our nation&#8217;s capital, Washington, D.C., after Martin Luther King Jr. was killed in Memphis; and they have spread death and destruction whenever and wherever it suited them&#8212;in the United States and abroad. &#160;They are often referred to as &#8220;Black Lives Matter&#8221; or Antifa, but they are all thugs, slugs, hoods and mongrels, and they are deserving of nothing.</p><p>No reparations. No affirmative action. &#160;No governmental handouts, &#160;Nothing.[6] &#160;It is time to crush their anarchy, in no uncertain terms. &#160;Many or most are ultra-Leftists, and far-Left Democrats&#8212;the inheritors of those who brought slavery to our shores, and perpetuated it with&#160;the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) and segregation. &#160;As I have written:</p><blockquote><p>Indeed, former Democratic President Lyndon Johnson&#8217;s singular accomplishment in office&#8212;other than escalating John F. Kennedy&#8217;s Vietnam War&#8212;was his &#8220;Great Society&#8221; welfare program. It broke up or crippled black families, and made them dependent on the Federal Government&#8217;s largesse, effectively enslaving them economically to this day.[7]</p></blockquote><p>Lastly, it is worth repeating:</p><blockquote><p>George Orwell wrote of this phenomenon in his prescient &#8220;Animal Farm,&#8221; where all of the animals were equal until the Pigs reigned supreme and subjugated the other animals. &#160;Today&#8217;s &#8220;Pigs&#8221; are America&#8217;s Left, and the thugs, slugs, hoods and mongrels who burn and loot our cities.</p><p>They seek &#8220;reparations,&#8221; when in fact they or their &#8220;soul mates&#8221; have been benefiting from the Government&#8217;s&#8212;or rather the peoples&#8217;&#8212;largesse for decades, in the form of welfare payments and food stamps and the benefits of Lyndon Johnson&#8217;s &#8220;Great Society,&#8221; which was and remains a failure like his Vietnam War.</p><p>Decimated have been black families that became single-parent households, which in turn have been victimized as black-on-black crime has escalated over recent decades, and elderly black women have been preyed on and terrified by young thugs who have zero respect for anything. They are anarchists and nihilists; and yes, they are today&#8217;s Pigs who must be crushed. Nothing less will suffice. They are truly the animals that George Orwell described.[8]</p></blockquote><p>This is the legacy that the despicable un-American racist, anti-Semite and traitor Barack Obama bequeathed to our great nation.[9] &#160;Meanwhile, China&#8212;which unleashed the Coronavirus Pandemic on the world, as a bioweapon or inadvertently&#8212;and our other enemies around the world are salivating.[10]&#160;</p><p>&#169; 2020, Timothy D.

Naegele</a><a href="#_edn1">[1]</a></p><p>Pat Buchanan&#8212;an adviser to Presidents Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford, and a former GOP presidential aspirant himself&#8212;has written in an article with this title:</p><blockquote><p>Wednesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met for seven hours at Hickam Air Force Base in Hawaii with the chief architect of China&#8217;s foreign policy, Yang Jiechi.</p><p>The two had much to talk about.</p><p>As The Washington Post reports, the &#8220;bitterly contentious relationship&#8221; between our two countries has &#8220;reached the lowest point in almost half a century.&#8221; Not since Nixon went to China have relations been so bad.</p><p>Early this week, Chinese and Indian soldiers fought with rocks, sticks and clubs along the Himalayan truce line that dates back to their 1962 war. Twenty Indian soldiers died, some pushed over a cliff into a freezing river in the highest-casualty battle between the Asian giants in decades.</p><p>Among the issues surely raised with Pompeo by the Chinese is the growing bipartisan vilification of China and its ruling Communist Party by U.S. politicians the closer we come to November.</p><p>The U.S. has been putting China in the dock for concealing information on the coronavirus virus until it had spread, lying about it, and then letting Wuhan residents travel to the outside world while quarantining them inside China.</p><p>In America, it has become good politics to be tough on China.</p><p>The reasons are many.</p><p>High among them are the huge trade deficits with China that led to an historic deindustrialization of America, China&#8217;s emergence as the world&#8217;s first industrial power, and a U.S. dependency on Chinese imports for the vital necessities of our national life.</p><p>Then there is the systematic theft of intellectual property from U.S. companies in China and Beijing&#8217;s deployment of thousands of student-spies into U.S. colleges and universities to steal security secrets.</p><p>Then there is the suppression of Christianity, the denial of rights to the people of Tibet and the discovery of an archipelago of concentration camps in western China to &#8220;reeducate&#8221; Muslim Uighurs and Kazakhs to turn them into more loyal and obedient subjects.</p><p>Among the strategic concerns of Pompeo: China&#8217;s fortification of islets, rocks and reefs in the South China Sea and use of its warships to drive Vietnamese, Malaysian, Indonesian and Philippine fishing vessels out of their own territorial waters that China now claims.</p><p>Another worry for Pompeo: China&#8217;s buildup of medium- and intermediate-range ballistic missiles, a nuclear arsenal not contained or covered by the Cold War arms agreements between Russia and the United States.</p><p>Then there were those provocative voyages by a Chinese aircraft carrier through the Taiwan Strait to intimidate Taipei and show Beijing&#8217;s hostility toward the recently reelected pro-U.S. government on the island.</p><p>Finally, there are China&#8217;s growing restrictions on the freedoms the people of Hong Kong have enjoyed under the Basic Law negotiated with the United Kingdom when the territory was ceded back to Beijing in 1997.</p><p>Also on the menu at Hickam was almost surely the new bellicosity out of Pyongyang. This week, the building in Kaesong, just inside North Korea, where bilateral peace talks have been held between the two Koreas, was blown up by the North. With the explosion came threats from the North to send combat troops back into positions they had vacated along the DMZ.</p><p>The rhetoric out of the North against South Korean President Moon Jae-in, coming from the 32-year-old sister of North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, the rising star of the regime, Kim Yo Jong, has been scalding.</p><p>In a statement this week, Kim Yo Jong derided Moon as a flunky of the Americans: &#8220;It is our fixed judgment that it is no longer possible to discuss the North-South ties with such a servile partner engaging only in disgrace and self-ruin, being soaked by deep-rooted flunkyism.&#8221;</p><p>North Korea&#8217;s state media published photos of the destruction of the joint liaison office. Pyongyang is shutting off communications with Seoul, and a frustrated South looks to be ginning up and reciprocating.</p><p>The North-South detente appears dead, and President Trump&#8217;s special relationship with Kim Jong Un may not be far behind.</p><p>There are rumors of a renewal of nuclear weapons and long-range missile tests by the North, suspension of which was one of the diplomatic achievements of Trump.</p><p>Whether Trump&#8217;s cherished trade deal with China can survive the growing iciness between the two nations remains to be seen.</p><p>What the Chinese seem to be saying with their actions &#8212; against India, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Taiwan, Australia, Hong Kong and Japan &#8212; is this: Your American friends and allies are yesterday. We are tomorrow. The future of Asia belongs to us. Deal with it!</p><p>No one should want a hot war, or a new cold war, with China or North Korea.</p><p>But if Trump was relying on his special relationships with Kim Jong Un and Xi Jinping, his trade deal with China and his commitment by Kim to give up nuclear weapons for recognition, trade and aid, he will have to think again.</p><p>For the foreseeable future, Communist bellicosity out of Beijing and Pyongyang seem in the cards, if not worse.[2]</p></blockquote><p>As I have written:</p><blockquote><p>China launched the Coronavirus, intentionally (as a bioweapon) or inadvertently; and many would argue that it must pay reparations or restitution to the world for having done so, which would likely run into trillions of dollars.</p><p>Also, a global boycott of anything and everything from China may ensue, as Americans and their counterparts abroad &#8220;vote&#8221; with their pocketbooks against the suffering that China unleashed.[3]</p></blockquote><p>Second, the only thing that China and North Korea respect is power. &#160;Donald Trump has provided the leadership vis-&#224;-vis both countries that they have not witnessed in decades. &#160;Now is the time to turn the screws even tighter, not to lessen them. &#160;And American and global consumers must be galvanized to boycott China&#8217;s exports.</p><p>&#169; 2020, Timothy D.

					<p> &#160; By<a title="Timothy D. Naegele" href="http://www.naegele.com/attorneys.html#tdn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&#160;Timothy D. Naegele</a><a href="#_edn1">[1]</a></p><p>Pat Buchanan&#8212;an adviser to Presidents Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford, and a former GOP presidential aspirant himself&#8212;has written in an article entitled &#8220;Cancel the White Men&#8212;And What&#8217;s Left?&#8221;:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Can we all just get along?&#8221;</p><p>That was the plea of Rodney King after a Simi Valley jury failed to convict any of the four cops who beat him into submission after a 100-mile-an-hour chase on an LA freeway.</p><p>King&#8217;s plea came after the 1992 LA riots, the worst since the New York City draft riots in 1863 when Lincoln had to send in federal troops.</p><p>In the aftermath of today&#8217;s protests and riots after the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, we hear similar calls. President Donald Trump must &#8220;reach out&#8221; and &#8220;unify the nation.&#8221;</p><p>But how?</p><p>Many of these calls for unity come from the same elites who are all-in on tearing us apart by pulling down statues of the famous men of American history whom they most detest.</p><p>A second war on the Confederacy is underway, to disgrace and dishonor all who fought for Southern independence in the war of 1861-65. A second Reconstruction is being readied.</p><p>The St. Andrew&#8217;s Cross, the battle flag of the Confederate army, though seen as a banner of heroism and honor to millions, is henceforth to be treated like the Nazi swastika. It has been already been banned at Nascar races, where it has been widely popular.</p><p>Liberals will fight for the right of Marxist radicals to burn the American flag to show their hatred of it but cannot tolerate working folks flying the battle flag of the Confederacy to show their love of it.</p><p>A second front in the campaign to cancel history is the renaming of U.S. army bases in Southern states that bear the names of Confederate generals, such as Forts Benning and Bragg. Trump has pledged to veto any defense appropriation bill that contains such a provision.</p><p>Third is the drive led by Nancy Pelosi and her allies to remove statues in the Capitol of any of those men of &#8220;violent bigotry&#8221; who were connected to the Confederacy.</p><p>First among them is General Robert E. Lee.</p><p>Gen. David Petraeus has put succinctly the crime of which Lee is guilty. Though &#8220;West Point honors Robert E. Lee with a gate, a road, an entire housing area, and a barracks,&#8221; writes Petraeus, &#8220;Lee . . . committed treason.&#8221;</p><p>The goal here is to impose the one-sided view of American history that is now ascendant, as official truth &#8212; that the cause of Southern secession was unlike the cause of American secession from Britain. It was an act of treason rooted in the ideology of white supremacy.</p><p>To have that sole acceptable view predominate, our elites believe they must remove from public display the statues of any associated with the cause of Southern independence and stigmatize them all as traitors.</p><p>They have, however, a problem: Where do the elites stop when the radicals demand more?</p><p>If support of slavery disqualifies one from the company of decent men, does it disqualify George Washington, who owned slaves his entire life? What Washington fought for, independence, was what Lee fought for.</p><p>Lee did not challenge Lincoln&#8217;s election. He did not seek to overthrow the government Lincoln headed. He resigned from the U.S. army to go home and defend the people among whom he had been raised from an invasion to force-march them back into a Union [that] the state&#8217;s chosen rulers had voted to leave.</p><p>Not only does our national capital, Washington, bear the name of a lifelong slave owner, so does the capital of Missouri, Jefferson City. So does the capital of Mississippi, Jackson. So does the capital of Wisconsin, Madison. The capital of Ohio is Columbus. The capital of South Carolina is Columbia. Both are named for now-vilified Christopher Columbus whose statue still stands outside D.C.&#8217;s Union Station.</p><p>None of these men appears, from how they lived their lives, to have shared modernity&#8217;s belief in democracy, diversity or social equality. Yet, it was they who cobbled together the United States of America.</p><p>Washington led us to independence and ownership of all the land from the Atlantic to the Mississippi. Jefferson negotiated the Louisiana Purchase, doubling the size of the U.S. Andrew Jackson added Florida. James K. Polk added the Southwest and California. Slave owner Sam Houston won Texas&#8217; War of independence and brought his Republic of Texas into the Union in 1845.</p><p>Two of the three greatest Senate statesmen of the 19th century, Henry Clay of Kentucky and John Calhoun of South Carolina, were slave owners. Both have statues in the Capitol. Do they go, too?</p><p>The newest bridge over the Potomac, like the premier dam in the TVA, is named for Woodrow Wilson, who resegregated the government.</p><p>These were among the decisive figures of American history. If all are dishonored, with their statues pulled down and their names taken off cities, counties, towns, rivers, canals, bridges, buildings, highways, roads, streets and dams, then what is left?</p><p>Detest all those white men if you will, but they were the ones who created the nation we inherited.[2]</p></blockquote><p>All of these issues have been addressed before, in an article entitled &#8220;Let&#8217;s Remove All Evidence That Barack Obama, Martin Luther King Jr. And JFK Ever Existed,&#8221; which states in pertinent part:</p><blockquote><p>This is the legacy that the despicable un-American racist and anti-Semite Barack Obama bequeathed to our great nation.</p><p>. . .</p><p>By the same token, neither were Martin Luther King Jr. nor John F. Kennedy heroes. Quite to the contrary, their names should be removed from monuments, streets and any other places of honor; and their memories should be of shame throughout history. &#160;Nothing less will suffice.</p><p>. . .</p><p>This is not about race. It&#8217;s about the Left destroying America. And yes, lots of us began as Democrats, but will never vote for one again. They have gone off the rails completely, and have become unbridled anarchists.[3]</p></blockquote><p>Will the anarchists reign? &#160;Is this the America that we want, run by vicious thugs, slugs, hoods and mongrels, who hate white America and everything that it stands for? &#160;This is the despicable Left that must be driven from this country in shame, not deified.</p><p>George Orwell wrote of this phenomenon in his prescient &#8220;Animal Farm,&#8221; where all of the animals were equal until the Pigs reigned supreme and subjugated the other animals.[4] &#160;Today&#8217;s &#8220;Pigs&#8221; are America&#8217;s Left, and the thugs, slugs, hoods and mongrels who burn and loot our cities.</p><p>They seek &#8220;reparations,&#8221; when in fact they or their &#8220;soul mates&#8221; have been benefiting from the Government&#8217;s&#8212;or rather the peoples&#8217;&#8212;largesse for decades, in the form of welfare payments and food stamps and the benefits of Lyndon Johnson&#8217;s &#8220;Great Society,&#8221; which was and remains a failure like his Vietnam War.</p><p>Decimated have been black families that became single-parent households, which in turn have been victimized as black-on-black crime has escalated over recent decades, and elderly black women have been preyed on and terrified by young thugs who have zero respect for anything. &#160;They are anarchists and nihilists; and yes, they are today&#8217;s Pigs who must be crushed. &#160;Nothing less will suffice. &#160;They are truly the animals that George Orwell described.</p><p>&#169; 2020, Timothy D.

					<p> &#160; By<a title="Timothy D. Naegele" href="http://www.naegele.com/attorneys.html#tdn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&#160;Timothy D. Naegele</a><a href="#_edn1">[1]</a></p><p>Pat Buchanan&#8212;an adviser to Presidents Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford, and a former GOP presidential aspirant himself&#8212;has written:</p><blockquote><p>On Gen. George Washington&#8217;s orders, the Declaration of Independence, signed in Philadelphia, was read aloud to his army. On hearing it, the troops marched to Bowling Green, decapitated and pulled down the statue of George III, and sent the remnants to be melted down into musket balls.</p><p>It was a revolutionary act, a symbolic statement. These once-loyal American subjects were now rebels and no longer owed allegiance to the king. They would fight to end his rule in America.</p><p>During the recent demonstrations and disorders here, similar acts had about them an aspect of societal rebellion and a repudiation of a heritage.</p><p>In Richmond, Virginia, a statue of Christopher Columbus, who generations of American children were raised to revere as the intrepid Italian explorer who discovered the New World, was pulled down and thrown into a lake.</p><p>In Boston, the Columbus statue was beheaded.</p><p>In a half-dozen states, statues of Confederate generals and soldiers were pulled down. Gov. Ralph Northam promises to remove the huge statues of Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson from their century-old places of honor on Richmond&#8217;s Monument Avenue.</p><p>In Philadelphia, the statue of fabled Italian American cop, police commissioner and mayor, Frank Rizzo, was desecrated and hauled away.</p><p>Retired Gen. David Petraeus has written to urge that all army bases bearing the names of Confederate generals, such as Forts Benning, Bragg and Hood, be renamed. Robert E. Lee, who is everywhere at West Point, says Petraeus, was a U.S. soldier who &#8220;committed treason.&#8221;</p><p>Nancy Pelosi wants 11 statues, including those of Confederate President Jefferson Davis, Confederate Vice President Alexander Stephens, and Sen. and U.S. Vice President John Calhoun, removed from the Capitol.</p><p>The purge of historical figures has spread to Europe.</p><p>The giant statue of King Leopold II in Brussels, who was enriched by the brutalitarian plundering of his Congo colony, has been taken down.</p><p>In Bristol, England, a statue of Edward Colston, philanthropist and patron of the city but also a slave trader, was thrown into the harbor.</p><p>At Oxford, students are moving to take down the statue of Cecil Rhodes, the archimperialist and founding father of Rhodesia who created as his legacy the Rhodes scholarships for British and American students.</p><p>Resumes of all the once-admired great men who discovered, explored and colonized the New World, as well as all those who created and first led the United States, are being investigated to determine how egregiously these men violated the egalitarian and democratist dogmas of modernity.</p><p>The list of malefactors seems impressive.</p><p>Who are we talking about?</p><p>Nearly half of the signers of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution were slave owners. So, too, were five of our first seven presidents and two of the four men on Mount Rushmore.</p><p>George Washington won the war for independence. Thomas Jefferson doubled the size of the nation with the Louisiana Purchase. Andrew Jackson saved the nation from defeat by the British at the Battle of New Orleans and seized Florida. James Polk took us to war with Mexico and relieved it of what is now the American Southwest and California.</p><p>All four of these nation-builder presidents were slave owners.</p><p>The systematic dishonoring and disgracing of men once revered has only just begun. But it represents a spreading revolution in thought and belief about the origins and history of America.</p><p>How far is this going?</p><p>During the London protests in solidarity with Black Lives Matter, there was painted on the Parliament Square statue of Winston Churchill, who historians voted &#8220;the greatest man of the 20th century&#8221; for his role in leading Britain against Nazi Germany, the word &#8220;racist.&#8221; The mob wanted Churchill&#8217;s statue down.</p><p>And was Churchill a racist?</p><p>Surely, he was an archimperialist, a lifelong defender of the British Empire who believed in the supremacy of the Anglo-Saxon race and its right to rule what poet Rudyard Kipling called &#8220;the lesser breeds without the law.&#8221;</p><p>Churchill disparaged people of color whom the British ruled, from the Caribbean to Africa, to the Middle and Near East, to South Asia and the Far East, in terms that would instantly end the career of any American or British politician who used them today.</p><p>Historian Andrew Roberts writes of Churchill that he was a &#8220;white &#8230; supremacist (who) thought in terms of race to a degree that was remarkable even by the standards of his own time. He spoke of certain races with a virulent Anglo-Saxon triumphalism.&#8221;</p><p>Many Americans, especially among the young, view the history of the European exploration, the colonization of the New World, and the creation of Western empires not with pride but with shame and guilt. And they want to make expiation by canceling out all the honors accorded such men, be it in statues or the names of cities, towns, parks and streets.</p><p>And their numbers and militancy are growing. The left has the bit in its teeth and is dragging the panicked elites along.</p><p>How this ends without permanent division in the country escapes me.[2]</p></blockquote><p>This is the legacy that the despicable un-American racist and anti-Semite Barack Obama bequeathed to our great nation. &#160;If anyone has any doubts whatsoever, please read his book &#8220;Dreams from My Father.&#8221;[3] &#160;It is all there, in his own words, which will live on in history. &#160;</p><p>He was and is the greatest racist in U.S. history&#8212;who set in motion the efforts to destroy the candidacy and presidency of Donald Trump, which is treason and punishable by death. &#160;At the very least, Obama should be in prison for the rest of his life.[4]</p><p>By the same token, neither were Martin Luther King Jr. nor John F. Kennedy heroes.[5] &#160;Quite to the contrary, their names should be removed from monuments, streets and any other places of honor; and their memories should be of shame throughout history. &#160;Nothing less will suffice.</p><p>History is being destroyed by the &#8220;Black Lives Matter&#8221; and Antifa thugs, slugs, hoods and mongrels, as well as their student lackeys (who are products of America&#8217;s Leftist educational system), and by their &#8220;fellow travelers&#8221; and others on the despicable Left, which must be crushed.[6] &#160;They are targeting law enforcement, which must be met by mass arrests.[7]</p><p>This is not about race. &#160;It&#8217;s about the Left destroying America. &#160;And yes, lots of us began as Democrats, but will never vote for one again. &#160;They have gone off the rails completely, and have become unbridled anarchists.</p><p>&#169; 2020, Timothy D.

					<p> &#160; By<a title="Timothy D. Naegele" href="http://www.naegele.com/attorneys.html#tdn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&#160;Timothy D. Naegele</a><a href="#_edn1">[1]</a></p><p>Pat Buchanan&#8212;an adviser to Presidents Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford, and a former GOP presidential aspirant himself&#8212;has written:</p><blockquote><p>Newly painted in huge yellow letters on 16th Street, just north of the White House, is the slogan: &#8220;Defund the Police.&#8221;</p><p>That new message sits beside the &#8220;Black Lives Matter&#8221; slogan, also in huge letters, painted there at the direction of D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser.</p><p>She renamed that section of 16th Street &#8220;Black Lives Matter Plaza.&#8221;</p><p>Still, the messages are less ominous than the chants of protesters in New York after the takedown that resulted in the death of Eric Garner.</p><p>Protesters then chanted of the NYPD: &#8220;What do we want? Dead cops. When do we want it? Now!&#8221;</p><p>While this sudden campaign to defund and dismantle city police forces seems an absurdity, it is actually part of a thought-out radical program that has gained momentum since the sadistic public execution of George Floyd in Minneapolis two weeks ago.</p><p>Consider. On Sunday, nine members of the city council, a veto-proof majority, voted to disband the Minneapolis police department. Asked if he would support the council decision, Mayor Jacob Frey hedged, &#8220;I do not support the full abolition of the police.&#8221;</p><p>As the crowd jeered and booed, the mayor walked away alone.</p><p>The idea of defunding police departments has caught fire, and liberal politicians are scrambling to get in front of their radical constituents. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti has announced that he will reallocate up to $150 million from the LAPD budget to social programs.</p><p>New York Mayor Bill de Blasio says he will be transferring $1 billion: &#8220;We will be moving funding from the NYPD to youth initiatives and social services.&#8221;</p><p>In two weeks, there has been a sea change in attitudes toward police, with not a few coming to share the hard left&#8217;s hatred. While the criminal elements burned cop cars and showered police with bottles, rocks and bricks, even &#8220;peaceful protesters&#8221; were calling the police fascists and racists.</p><p>Two decades ago, the NYPD were celebrated &#8220;first responders&#8221; who ran toward the collapsing twin towers, many never to come back. Funerals of the cop heroes were televised. Those days are gone.</p><p>Indeed, after two weeks of seeing police decried on nightly TV as racist oppressors of African Americans, cops must realize that they are reviled and detested by some of the countrymen they have sworn to protect.</p><p>What will happen now is predictable, as it has happened before.</p><p>To pander to the militants on the left, liberal politicians will devise new restrictions on cops and more severe punishments for infractions, treating the police as potential threats to civil and constitutional rights.</p><p>The &#8220;Ferguson Effect&#8221; will take hold. Cops will back off from confronting the lawless and violent. Criminals will see an opening to seize opportunities. The urban poor who look to the police as their only protection will stay inside and lock their doors. And small businesses, realizing the cops may not be there, will sell and move out.</p><p>Where is this leading?</p><p>According to former New York City Police Commissioner Bernie Kerik, not only did New York law enforcement officers suffer many injuries in the riots, hundreds of cops, seeing how they are regarded and were treated by many whom they protect, are preparing to leave the NYPD.</p><p>As the Democrats&#8217; &#8220;police reform&#8221; bill is debated on the Hill, Republicans will largely stand with the police and Attorney General William Barr, who said Sunday that while there is racism in America, there is no &#8220;systemic racism&#8221; in the nation&#8217;s police departments.</p><p>If there were, it would be an indictment of the Democrats, who have run most of our great cities for decades.</p><p>As it rises in prominence, the issue of defunding police will divide the Democratic Party more than the GOP.</p><p>For while the hard left sees cops in ideological and class terms as racist and fascist, the right, by and large, sees the police as the last line of defense against the anarchy we saw erupt when there were not enough cops in New York and D.C. to control the mobs looting Fifth Avenue and Georgetown.</p><p>And this, too, is likely to become a forever war in America. For it is almost inevitable that we are going to see more violent collisions between white cops and black suspects, collisions that result in deaths.</p><p>For every large urban police force has daily encounters with black male criminals, who commit a disproportionate number of violent crimes. Some will end with dead cops, and the others with dead criminals.</p><p>President Donald Trump has taken his stand with the police.</p><p>It is Joe Biden who has the problem. For while Democratic mayors are unlikely to join a campaign to abolish their police forces, Biden is going to have to tell his Bernie Bro and socialist constituents that their ideas for getting rid of police departments are ridiculous.</p><p>Monday, Joe made a start. He said that defunding cops is off the table.[2]</p></blockquote><p>Next, Walter E. Williams&#8212;a professor of economics at George Mason University in Northern Virginia, and an alumnus of my alma mater, UCLA&#8212;has written in the Toronto Sun:</p><blockquote><p>While it might not be popular to say in the wake of the recent social disorder, the true plight of black people has little or nothing to do with the police or what has been called &#8220;systemic racism.&#8221; Instead, we need to look at the responsibilities of those running our big cities.</p><p>Some of the most dangerous big cities are: St. Louis, Detroit, Baltimore, Oakland, Chicago, Memphis, Atlanta, Birmingham, Newark, Buffalo and Philadelphia. The most common characteristic of these cities is that for decades, all of them have been run by liberal Democrats. Some cities &#8212; such as Detroit, Buffalo, Newark and Philadelphia &#8212; haven&#8217;t elected a Republican mayor for more than a half-century. On top of this, in many of these cities, blacks are mayors, often they dominate city councils, and they are chiefs of police and superintendents of schools.</p><p>In 1965, there were no blacks in the U.S. Senate, nor were there any black governors. And only six members of the House of Representatives were black. As of 2019, there is far greater representation in some areas &#8212; 52 House members are black. Nine black Americans have served in the Senate, including Edward W. Brooke of Massachusetts, Carol Moseley Braun and Barack Obama of Illinois, Tim Scott of South Carolina, Cory Booker of New Jersey, and Kamala Harris of California. In recent times, there have been three black state governors. The bottom line is that today&#8217;s black Americans have significant political power at all levels of government. Yet, what has that meant for a large segment of the black population?</p><p>Democratic-controlled cities have the poorest-quality public education despite their large, and growing, school budgets. Consider Baltimore, Maryland. In 2016, in 13 of Baltimore&#8217;s 39 high schools, not a single student scored proficient on the state&#8217;s math exam. In six other high schools, only 1% tested proficient in math. Only 15% of Baltimore students passed the state&#8217;s English test. That same year in Philadelphia only 19% of eighth-graders scored proficient in math, and 16% were proficient in reading. In Detroit, only 4% of its eighth-graders scored proficient in math, and 7% were proficient in reading. It&#8217;s the same story of academic disaster in other cities run by Democrats.</p><p>Violent crime and poor education is not the only problem for Democratic-controlled cities. Because of high crime, poor schools and a less pleasant environment, cities are losing their economic base and their most productive people in droves. When the Second World War ended, the population of Washington, D.C., was about 800,000; today, it&#8217;s about 700,000. In 1950, Baltimore&#8217;s population was almost 950,000; today, it&#8217;s around 590,000. Detroit&#8217;s 1950 population was close to 1.85 million; today, it&#8217;s down to 673,000. The population of Camden, New Jersey, in 1950 was nearly 125,000; today it has fallen to 74,000. St. Louis&#8217; 1950 population was more than 856,000; today, it&#8217;s less than 294,000. A similar story of population decline can be found in most of our formerly large and prosperous cities. In some cities, the population decline since 1950 is well over 50%, and that includes Detroit, St. Louis, Cleveland and Pittsburgh.</p><p>Academic liberals, civil rights advocates and others blamed the exodus on racism &#8212; &#8220;white flight&#8221; to the suburbs to avoid blacks. But blacks have been fleeing some cities at higher rates than whites. The five cities whose suburbs have the fastest-growing black populations are Miami, Dallas, Washington, Houston and Atlanta. It turns out that blacks, like whites, want better and safer schools for their kids and don&#8217;t like to be mugged or have their property vandalized. And like white people, if they have the means, black people cannot wait to leave troubled cities.</p><p>White liberals and black politicians focus most of their attention on what the police do, but how relevant is that to the overall tragedy? According to Statista, this year, 172 whites and 88 blacks have died at the hands of police. To put police shootings in a bit of perspective, in Chicago alone in 2020 there have been 1,260 shootings and 256 homicides with blacks being the primary victims. That comes to one shooting victim every three hours and one homicide victim every 15 hours. Three people in Chicago have been killed by police. If one is truly concerned about black deaths, shootings by police should figure way down on one&#8217;s list &#8212; which is not to excuse bad behaviour by some police officers.[3]</p></blockquote><p>First, the latest polling shows black voter approval for President Trump rising to 41 percent.[4] &#160;There are multiple reasons for this, among them being the recognition by America&#8217;s blacks that black-on-black crimes have reached epidemic proportions, especially in our cities and targeting elderly blacks, and elderly black women in particular who are terrified and have been for decades.</p><p>Second, I investigated complaints of police brutality in the Watts area of Los Angeles, during the summer before the riots erupted there. &#160;There is no doubt in my mind that many of the accusations were real. &#160;Riots have occurred around the nation and world in subsequent years, including those spawned by the death of George Floyd. &#160;What is the common thread that runs through all of them, or so I believe: they have accomplished nothing positive or of lasting value.</p><p>Third, as I have written previously:</p><blockquote><p>[W]ith so many rioters massed together and zero &#8220;social distancing&#8221; taking place, how many will catch and/or spread the deadly Coronavirus? There is no vaccine, and many will die, of all ages.</p><p>Lots of them may be high school and college students who are out of school because of the lockdowns, and bored. Thus, they have joined the thugs, slugs, hoods and mongrels as an &#8220;adventure,&#8221; not realizing fully the price that these lackeys (who are products of America&#8217;s Leftist educational system) might pay.</p><p>Patty Hearst did something similar years ago, but was &#8220;bailed out&#8221; by her wealthy family.[5]</p></blockquote><p>Fourth, America&#8217;s law enforcement and its military preserve order and protect all of us&#8212;blacks, &#160;whites, Asians, Christians, Jews, atheists and others&#8212;from those who would seek to destroy our great nation and its heritage. &#160;Abraham Lincoln understood this, and he gave his life to preserve our Union and, yes, to destroy slavery.[6]</p><p>Lastly, the police have been under siege in the United States and other countries for decades. &#160;Perhaps they are hated more today because they have been viciously targeted, just as they are accused of targeting blacks. &#160;Forgotten is their heroism in the wake of 9/11. &#160;Or more likely, it is the goal of the thugs, slugs, hoods and mongrels to destroy American history and the very fabric of our great nation under God&#8212;which is consistent with the defacing and destruction of our monuments, places of worship and revisionist history.[7]</p><p>&#169; 2020, Timothy D.

This is true even with respect to the vicious racist thugs, slugs and hoods. &#160;Jesus taught us this. &#160;But we do not have to tolerate their violence&#8212;or God-awful gangsta rap &#8220;music&#8221;&#8212;ever.</p><p>. . .</p><p>Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, today is D-Day, the 76th anniversary of the Normandy landings on the coast of France on June 6, 1944, which began the efforts to destroy Adolf Hitler, his Nazi regime, and end his dreams of a &#8220;Thousand Year Reich.&#8221;[7] &#160;Yet, instead of celebrating this turning point in history, American thugs, slugs and hoods have focused attention on George Floyd, a drug abuser who was killed in the process of resisting his arrest. &#160;How obscene. &#160;How truly grotesque and obscene.</p><p>&#169; 2020, Timothy D.

					<p> &#160; By<a title="Timothy D. Naegele" href="http://www.naegele.com/attorneys.html#tdn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&#160;Timothy D. Naegele</a><a href="#_edn1">[1]</a></p><p>They see black thugs, slugs and hoods igniting a firestorm of violence in cities and small towns across our great nation. &#160;They see members of law enforcement being injured and, in some cases, killed trying to do their jobs of defending law and order.[2] &#160;They see a repeat of every senseless riot in America since Watts erupted in Los Angeles during the summer of 1965.</p><p>They see black-on-black crimes being trivialized if not ignored completely, even though elderly blacks have been terrified of the young thugs (or their predecessors) for decades. &#160;This is especially true of elderly black women who have been victimized, instead of being treated with the love and respect that they have earned and so richly deserve.[3] &#160;Many have struggled to keep their families together, after their spouses or partners left. &#160;Their &#8220;reward&#8221; has been a life of fear, when they should be enjoying their &#8220;golden years.&#8221;</p><p>They see the Lincoln Memorial in our nation&#8217;s capital being defaced when Abraham Lincoln and his generals, Ulysses S. Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman, defeated the South and freed the slaves and saved the nation.[4] &#160;They see the Democratic Party demagoguing these issues, even though it is the &#8220;father&#8221; of slavery, the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) and segregation. Indeed, former Democratic President Lyndon Johnson&#8217;s singular accomplishment in office&#8212;other than escalating John F. Kennedy&#8217;s Vietnam War[5]&#8212;was his &#8220;Great Society&#8221; welfare program. It broke up or crippled black families, and made them dependent on the Federal Government&#8217;s largesse, effectively enslaving them economically to this day.[6]</p><p>Other Americans are angry because they see a continuation of racial injustices. Many realize that America&#8217;s blacks have been and continue to be at the bottom of our economic totem pole. Even though they constitute less than 13 percent of America&#8217;s population[7], while Hispanic and Latino Americans number more than 18 percent[8], many non-black Americans empathize with their plight because of the color of their skin. &#8220;White Americans&#8221; constitute more than 75 percent of the U.S. population, including &#8220;White Hispanics.&#8221;[9]</p><p>However one slices and dices it, black Americans stand out&#8212;and are alone. &#160;Factor in the lack of education and job skills for the thugs, and there is a recipe for disaster, discrimination and pent-up anger, just waiting to be released and unleashed. &#160;Then throw in the effects of lockdowns and worries about the Coronavirus, and the personal dislike of President Trump by America&#8217;s Left, and we have the riots. &#160;&#8220;Social distancing&#8221; be damned, these people want to riot and they are determined to do so.</p><p>They must be put down like rabid animals, just like the South was put down viciously, never to rise again. &#160;Indeed, many educated blacks reject the rioters&#8217; tactics and actions. &#160;Among other reasons, often left unsaid, is that the thugs increase discrimination, which no amount of rioting or even rational thinking can avert. &#160;Human beings have discriminated since the beginning of time; and this type of discrimination never seems to go away, and perhaps it never will.&#160;</p><p>Lastly, it is important to share the following statement by Thomas D. Klingenstein and Ryan P. Williams&#8212;Chairman&#160;and President, respectively&#8212;of the Claremont Institute in California:</p><blockquote><p>The pretext for this entire nationwide riot is that America is a racist country. &#160;That is not true. &#160;America is not a racist country. &#160;America is a country that has strived, imperfectly but passionately, to live up to its founding promise that all men are created equal. &#160;There is not&#8212;and will never be&#8212;a greater barrier to racism, or to tyranny in any form, than this American idea. &#160;</p><p>The reckless charge that American law enforcement is &#8220;systemically racist&#8221; is also not true. &#160;As with any large organization of men wielding power, some will abuse that power. &#160;But police do not systematically target innocents&#8212;either by race or any other criteria. &#160;Any fair-minded review of the available data demonstrates that. &#160;&#160;</p><p>Why is it that so many of our citizens believe that America is racist to its core? &#160;Because this lie has been preached by our universities and media like the Gospel for a generation. &#160;From there it has traveled throughout society, particularly among the elite. &#160;Even most leaders on the Right are unwilling to refute this destructive untruth. &#160;In failing to do so, they promote the falsehood, the riots that it has engendered, and ultimately America&#8217;s destruction. &#160;This is to say, the riots are the handiwork of the elite. &#160;A country that has been taught it is ignoble will not defend itself against its enemies, domestic or foreign. &#160;</p><p>As we see written in flames in these riots and hear in all the commentary on them, the great divide in America is between those who believe that America is evil and needs to be destroyed, and those who believe that America is good and needs to be preserved. &#160;A version of that question is what the 2016 elections were about, and what the elections in 2020 will be about. &#160;The nation has a party devoted to transforming the American way of life; it needs a party devoted to preserving the American way of life.</p><p>America must have a full accounting of how the riots happened, who made them happen, and who let them happen. &#160;Those in power must be held to account. &#160;Most fundamentally, the lies that have been the core curriculum of American education must be replaced with the truth. &#160;The only way America can survive is as a united country dedicated to living out the true meaning of its creed. &#160;The elite want to rob us of that future. &#160;The rest of us should pledge our lives, fortunes, and sacred honor to stopping them.[10]</p></blockquote><p>Truer words were never spoken, or written. &#160;We are blessed with a great and gallant nation, unsurpassed anywhere in the world, which is why it is the target of so many. &#160;They must be put down and defeated. &#160;Otherwise, the heroic efforts of so many&#8212;not the least of them being Abraham Lincoln&#8212;will have been in vain.</p><p>&#169; 2020, Timothy D.

					<p> &#160; By<a title="Timothy D. Naegele" href="http://www.naegele.com/attorneys.html#tdn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&#160;Timothy D. Naegele</a><a href="#_edn1">[1]</a></p><p>Much is being made by America&#8217;s Left about how George Floyd died, and whether undue police brutality was involved. &#160;There are competing claims in terms of the official autopsy report, and another version commissioned by his family.[2] &#160;All of that is well and good; and the issues need to be put to rest, if that is possible.</p><p>The overriding issues, however, are the riots that followed. &#160;They were and are lawless, criminal acts; and they are consistent with earlier acts of mob violence that began in my lifetime with the Watts Riots in Los Angeles.[3] &#160;Put succinctly, the thugs and miscreants who have rioted need to be put down like a pack of rabid animals. &#160;They harken back to the barbarian Mongol hordes that swept across Asia, bringing death, destruction and anarchy with them.[4]</p><p>The American thugs have defaced the Lincoln Memorial and other monuments, which underscores the fact that they are ignorant and have no sense of history&#8212;and they do not care. &#160;Abraham Lincoln ended slavery and saved the Union. &#160;The ancestors of today&#8217;s Democrats and other Leftists brought slavery to America, and perpetuated it with the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) and segregation. &#160;Thus, how ignorant these thugs and yes, &#8220;animals&#8221; are today.</p><p>The question facing Americans now and in the future is whether they want to be ruled by rogue gangs of savages&#8212;or their Leftist, Democratic Party surrogates&#8212;much less in the midst of the deadly Coronavirus?[5] &#160;Will the thugs catch the virus? &#160;After all, it has been reported that 4,000 of them are in jails, which are incubators for the virus. &#160;Clearly they have not been &#8220;social distancing&#8221; during their anarchy; and presumably they will not be doing so in the jails and prisons of our land.</p><p>From a macro view, how China&#8217;s brutal Xi Jinping[6] and Russia&#8217;s equally brutal dictator-for-life Vladimir&#160;Putin[7] must be salivating. &#160;Having unleashed the Coronavirus as a bioweapon or inadvertently[8], Xi is moving against Hong Kong now; and Taiwan and other parts of Asia may be next. &#160;Yet, in all likelihood, the American thugs know nothing about these issues, or their global effects and impact on millions of lives, nor is it likely they would care one iota if they knew. &#160;Their rioting must be stopped, period.[9]</p><p>&#169; 2020, Timothy D.

					<p> &#160; By<a title="Timothy D. Naegele" href="http://www.naegele.com/attorneys.html#tdn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&#160;Timothy D. Naegele</a><a href="#_edn1">[1]</a></p><p>Why are some of us not surprised in the least by what has been happening in Minneapolis? &#160;Partly because we have been through such lawless rioting and senseless destruction before, many times; and history is repeating itself&#8212;albeit in a different city, and in a different time. &#160;</p><p>The nation and the world have been in &#8220;lockdowns,&#8221; owing to the fact that China unleashed the deadly Coronavirus globally.[2] &#160;And the deaths, suffering and economic costs have been horrendous; and tensions are on the razor&#8217;s edge. &#160;Among those hit the hardest have been Americans who could least afford it, such as minority group hourly workers. &#160;One spark and the lawless Antifa and similar groups of thugs have been more than ready and energized to repeat the violent past.&#160;</p><p>Shortly after I arrived at Berkeley for my first year in its law school, Boalt Hall&#8212;whose name has been dropped by its far-Left administrators, who engage in historical revisionism[3]&#8212;John F. Kennedy was shot and killed in Dallas as I was leaving to spend Thanksgiving in Los Angeles. &#160;Then, the Free Speech Movement hit the campus, followed by the anti-Vietnam War protests, which spread nationwide.</p><p>During my first summer break, I helped a Boalt Hall classmate interview minority group members who complained of police brutality, which is the underlying issue in Minneapolis, or ostensiby so. &#160;After my day job, he and I went into the Watts area of LA, and interviewed those who had been affected. &#160;The next summer, the Watts Riots erupted in LA, followed by other riots nationwide. &#160;I wrote a law review article that was published by Berkeley, addressing how to deal with grievances against the police so that both sides were treated fairly.[4]</p><p>From Boalt, I went to the Pentagon to work as a young Army officer assigned to the Defense Intelligence Agency. &#160;While I was there, Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated in Memphis on April 4, 1968, and Washington was set ablaze, not unlike Watts. &#160;I have a special interest in Minneapolis because my father&#8217;s family is from there. &#160;A husband and wife who had sixteen children left Rottweil, Germany in 1849, and settled in New Ulm, Minnesota, near Minneapolis. &#160;Both of my parents were born in Minneapolis, where they met in grade school before moving to California and marrying there.</p><p>When my father&#8217;s parents were alive, I spent parts of several summers in Minneapolis with them, their children and grandchildren; and I have been back there many times. &#160;It is a city that I came to love, so watching it burn is sad and upsetting. &#160;Simply put, nothing justifies such lawlessness, which is the lesson learned from previous riots. &#160;Needless to say, the same shrill incendiary voices have chimed in&#8212;such as Maxine Waters[5], Colin Kaepernick[6],&#160;Jesse Jackson[7] and Van Jones[8]&#8212;adding fuel to the raging fire of hatred.&#160;</p><p>To understand what has been happening, it is essential to review the facts. &#160;If police brutality has occurred, it must be dealt with severely.[9] &#160;A separate but equally important issue is dealing with the thugs who have set Minneapolis ablaze.[10] &#160;Justice must be meted out, on both sides of the equation.</p><p>&#169; 2020, Timothy D. Naegele</p><p><a href="#_ednref">[1]</a>&#160; Timothy D.

The world will never be the same. Like earlier pandemics in recorded history such as the Spanish flu&#8212;which killed as many as 100 million globally right after World War I&#8212;the effects of the Coronavirus may change humankind forever.</p><p>Countless numbers may die; the mass suffering may be indescribable; businesses will disappear; lawlessness may reign; and the social, economic and military order of the planet may be altered decisively and irretrievably. &#160;Banks and other financial institutions, and the very fabric of America, may be affected in ways not seen since the Great Depression.</p><p>Governmental controls are being imposed and will be implemented in the United States, not experienced since the dark days of World War II. &#160;China launched the Coronavirus, intentionally (as a bioweapon) or inadvertently; and many would argue that it must pay reparations or restitution to the world for having done so, which would likely run into trillions of dollars.</p><p>Also, a global boycott of anything and everything from China may ensue, as Americans and their counterparts abroad &#8220;vote&#8221; with their pocketbooks against the suffering that China unleashed.</p><p> &#169; 2020, Timothy D.

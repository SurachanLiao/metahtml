Tom Petty's family issues cease and desist after Trump plays "I Won't Back Down" at Tulsa rally

Tom Petty's family has issued a cease and desist notice against the Trump campaign after the late singer's 1989 hit "I Won't Back Down" was played at the president's Tulsa rally on Saturday. "Trump was in no way authorized to use this song to further a campaign that leaves too many Americans and common sense behind," the Petty family said in a statement posted to social media later that night.

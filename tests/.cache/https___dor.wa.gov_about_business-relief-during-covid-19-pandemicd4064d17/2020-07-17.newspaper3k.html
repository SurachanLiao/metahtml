		Updated July 15, 2020</p>
<p>
		Revenue is taking the following measures to provide relief to COVID-19 impacted businesses during the state of emergency (February 29, 2020, through the end of the state of emergency, yet to be determined).&#160;These actions address a broad range of taxes and programs: business and occupation tax, real estate excise tax assessments, leasehold excise tax, forest tax, and tax deferrals for biotechnology and medical device manufacturing.&#160;Check back for updates.</p>
<h4>
		What if I am unable to&#160;pay my monthly, quarterly or annual return?</h4>
<p>
		For businesses negatively impacted by the COVID-19 Pandemic, if an extension has not already been granted, a one-time extension may be available upon request.&#160; We request that all businesses still <strong>file</strong> their returns by their original due date, even if they are unable to pay.&#160;</p>
<p>
		Businesses may request&#160;a one-time extension for paying tax returns prior to the due date one of the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
			Apply in <a href="/manage-business/my-dor-help/business-taxes#Request">My DOR</a>.<br>
			<strong>Note</strong>: This option is only available for excise tax returns. This is not available for&#160;other tax types.&#160;</li>
<li>
			Send a secure email in your&#160;<a href="https://secure.dor.wa.gov/home/Login" target="_blank">My DOR account</a>.</li>
<li>
			Call&#160;Revenue&#8217;s customer service team at 360-705-6705, Monday through Friday 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.&#8203;&#160;</li>
</ul>
<p>
		If you miss the deadline for requesting an extension, request a penalty waiver when filing your return along with an explanation of how COVID-19 Pandemic caused the delay.</p>
<ul>
<li>
			<strong>Monthly filers:</strong>&#160;Monthly tax return payments are generally due the 25th of the following month.</li>
<li>
			<strong>Quarterly filers:</strong> The Quarter 1, 2020 return was extended to&#160;June 30, 2020. The Quarter 2. 2020 return is due July 31, 2020.&#160;</li>
<li>
			<strong>Annual filers:</strong> The Annual 2019 return was&#160;extended to&#160;June 15, 2020.</li>
</ul>
<p>
		Please note: Extensions only push out the due date; they don&#8217;t waive the tax owed.</p>
<p>
		If you already filed and scheduled your payment before the extended due date, you must cancel your payment in your online My DOR account BEFORE the scheduled payment date.&#160; <strong>Please reschedule your payment after the extension is reflected in your My DOR account.</strong></p>
<h4>
		I already received an extension on a tax return, but I still can&#8217;t pay my return in full by the new date. Can I get another extension?</h4>
<p>
		While the Department is not providing multiple extensions on the same tax return, we are providing flexible payment plans <strong>without penalties</strong>.&#160; To take advantage of this service, businesses should file their tax return by the extended due date, without payment.&#160; The business will receive a balance due notice from the Department and should contact the number on the notice to request a COVID-19 payment plan.&#160;</p>
<h4>
		What about interest?</h4>
<p>
		The Department will waive interest February 29, 2020 until the termination of the COVID-19 State of Emergency or August 1, 2020, whichever occurs first.&#160;After this date, interest will begin accruing on outstanding balances. &#160;</p>
<p>
		Tax returns filed and paid in full by the extended due date are consider timely, and will not incur interest.</p>
<h4>
		What if I need to, or have been, working with the Department on a collection related issue?</h4>
<p>
		In most circumstances, Revenue will delay the issuance of tax warrants, notices of withhold and deliver, and revocations until September 1.</p>
<h4>
		What if I have a payment plan with the Department?&#160;</h4>
<p>
		Upon request, Revenue will work with taxpayers that are impacted by COVID-19 to adjust payment plan amounts or extend payment dates. If your existing electronic payment plan has scheduled payments automatically debited from your account and you wish to adjust the payment amount or date, you <strong>must contact your Revenue Agent prior to the scheduled payment date</strong>.&#160;</p>
<h4>
		What if I am scheduled for an audit or under audit right now?</h4>
<ul>
<li>
			The Department will delay scheduling audits of the types of business that were <a href="https://medium.com/wagovernor/inslee-announces-statewide-shutdown-of-restaurants-bars-and-expanded-social-gathering-limits-bb19095b2251" target="_blank">specifically identified in the Governor&#8217;s proclamation</a>, to coincide with the <a href="https://coronavirus.wa.gov/sites/default/files/2020-05/PhasedReopeningChart.pdf" target="_blank">Governor&#8217;s phased approach</a> to reopening businesses.&#160;&#160;</li>
<li>
			For audits in progress, Revenue staff will work with you to either issue the audit or provide an extension&#160;based on your preference.</li>
<li>
			Revenue will resume audit efforts of business types not specifically identified in the Governor&#8217;s proclamation in June.&#160; Audit team members will remain flexible in scheduling audits and continue encouraging electronic records to support social distancing.</li>
</ul>
<h4>
		What should I do if I have a temporary business registration?</h4>
<p>
		Businesses with a temporary registration that have had their event cancelled should notify the Department by replying to the original email they received when obtaining their temporary registration certificate.&#160; If you no longer have the original email, you may send a message to <a href="mailto:communications@dor.wa.gov">communications@dor.wa.gov</a> to cancel your temporary registration.&#160;&#160;</p>
<h4>
		What happens if I am late renewing my business license during this time period?&#160;</h4>
<p>
		The Department will waive the BLS delinquency fee on late renewals of licenses expiring in February through June of 2020.</p>
<p>
		The Department does not have the authority to extend business license expiration dates. If your license endorsements expired and you have not renewed, check with the <a href="https://dor.wa.gov/manage-business/state-endorsements">state</a> or <a href="https://dor.wa.gov/manage-business/city-license-endorsements">local</a> regulatory agency for your endorsement to determine if continued operation is allowed.</p>
<h4>
		Is relief available for periods prior to the COVID-19 State of Emergency?</h4>
<p>
		No. Penalties and interest accrued prior to February 29, 2020, will not be waived. There will be no refunds for penalties and interest paid during the state of emergency.</p>
<h4>
		What if I'm late renewing my non-profit property tax exemption?</h4>
<p>
		The Department will waive penalties for nonprofit applications and renewals for exempt property&#160;for the months of February 2020 through July 2020.</p>
<h4>
		What if I have questions about paying my property taxes?</h4>
<p>
		Please contact your&#160;<a href="/taxes-rates/property-tax/county-assessor-and-treasurer-websites">local county treasurer</a>.</p>
<h4>
		What about estate tax returns?</h4>
<p>
		Estates filing a Washington Estate Tax Return <strong>and</strong> a federal Estate Tax Return can request an extension for the return and/or payment until July 15, 2020, based on Federal Notice 2020-23.</p>
<p>
		Estates filing a Washington Estate Tax Return <strong>only</strong>, and are negatively impacted by the COVID-19 crisis, can request an extension for the return and/or payment during&#160;the Governor&#8217;s state of emergency. Extension requests for payments will be reviewed on a case by case basis.</p>
<p>
		To request an extension or&#160;get more case specific information, please contact the Estate Tax Team at 360-534-1503, Option 2 or at <a href="mailto:estates@dor.wa.gov">estates@dor.wa.gov</a>.</p>

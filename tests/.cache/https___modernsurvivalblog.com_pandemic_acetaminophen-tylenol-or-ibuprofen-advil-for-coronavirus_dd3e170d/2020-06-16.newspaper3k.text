Acetaminophen ( Tylenol ) or Ibuprofen ( Advil ) for Coronavirus?

A report indicates that Acetaminophen (Tylenol) may be preferred over Ibuprofen (Advil) for coronavirus (fever).

The health minister of France, Olivier Veran, (a doctor and neurologist) said recently,

“The taking of anti-inflammatories [ibuprofen, cortisone … ] could be a factor in aggravating the infection. In case of fever, take paracetamol [acetaminophen, tylenol]. If you are already taking anti-inflammatory drugs, ask your doctor’s advice.”

Apparently, anti-inflammatory drugs are known to be a risk for those with infectious illnesses because they tend to diminish the response of the body’s immune system. Perhaps particularly important regarding Coronavirus.

Jean-Louis Montastruc, the head of pharmacology at Toulouse hospital, France, said:

Acetaminophen will reduce the fever without counterattacking the inflammation.

I first read about this from an article titled,

“French warn against anti-inflammatory drugs to treat coronavirus”

In the article, a pediatric infectious disease specialist and associate medical director for infection control at University Hospitals Rainbow Babies and Children’s Hospital said in response to the French ministers statement,

she is aware generally of what the French are saying and believes it’s probably based on a single study and therefore she is reluctant to accept any blanket statement. Also, the study would be looking at data from a lab setting and that the results in real life could be different. If more data comes out she might change her mind, she said.

Acetaminophen or Ibuprofen?

I just wanted to put this information out there.

If I personally happen to get the COVID-19 Coronavirus, I believe that my choice of fever reducer medication may be Acetaminophen. If and when more information comes out on this subject, I will update this post.

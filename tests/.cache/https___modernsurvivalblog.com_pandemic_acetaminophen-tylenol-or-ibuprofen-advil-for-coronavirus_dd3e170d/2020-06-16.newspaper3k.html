<p>A report indicates that <strong>Acetaminophen (Tylenol)</strong> may be preferred over Ibuprofen (Advil) for coronavirus (fever).</p>



<p>The health minister of France, Olivier Veran, (a doctor and neurologist) said recently, </p>



<p>&#8220;The taking of anti-inflammatories [ibuprofen, cortisone &#8230; ] could be a factor in aggravating the infection. In case of fever, take paracetamol [acetaminophen, tylenol]. If you are already taking anti-inflammatory drugs, ask your doctor&#8217;s advice.&#8221;</p>



<p class="wp-block-spacer"></p>



<p><strong>Apparently,  anti-inflammatory drugs are known to be a risk for those with infectious illnesses because they tend to diminish the response of the body&#8217;s immune system. Perhaps particularly important regarding Coronavirus.</strong></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p> Jean-Louis Montastruc, the head of pharmacology at Toulouse hospital, France, said:<br><br> &#8220;Anti-inflammatory drugs increase the risk of complications when there is a fever or infection.&#8221; </p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/anti-inflammatory-drugs-may-aggravate-coronavirus-infection" target="_blank">~ theguardian.com</a></blockquote>



<p>Acetaminophen will reduce the fever without counterattacking the inflammation.</p>



<p class="wp-block-spacer"></p>



<p>I first read about this from an article titled, </p>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/french-warn-against-anti-inflammatory-drugs-to-treat-coronavirus-cleveland-doctor-wants-more-data.html" target="_blank">&#8220;French warn against anti-inflammatory drugs to treat coronavirus&#8221;</a></p>



<p>In the article, a pediatric infectious disease specialist and associate medical director for infection control at University Hospitals Rainbow Babies and Children&#8217;s Hospital said in response to the French ministers statement,</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>she is aware generally of what the French are saying and believes it&#8217;s probably based on a single study and therefore she is reluctant to accept any blanket statement. Also, the study would be looking at data from a lab setting and that the results in real life could be different. If more data comes out she might change her mind, she said.  </p></blockquote>

<h2>Acetaminophen or Ibuprofen?</h2>



<p>I just wanted to put this information out there.</p>



<p>If I personally happen to get the COVID-19 Coronavirus, I believe that my choice of fever reducer medication may be Acetaminophen. If and when more information comes out on this subject, I will update this post. </p>

In case of fever, take paracetamol [acetaminophen, tylenol]. If you are already taking anti-inflammatory drugs, ask your doctor’s advice.”</p> <p>Apparently,  anti-inflammatory drugs are known to be a risk for those with infectious illnesses because they tend to diminish the response of the body’s immune system. Perhaps particularly important regarding Coronavirus.</p> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Jean-Louis Montastruc, the head of pharmacology at Toulouse hospital, France, said:  “Anti-inflammatory drugs increase the risk of complications when there is a fever or infection.” </p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/anti-inflammatory-drugs-may-aggravate-coronavirus-infection" target="_blank">~ theguardian.com</a></blockquote> <p>Acetaminophen will reduce the fever without counterattacking the inflammation.</p> <p>I first read about this from an article titled, </p> <p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/french-warn-against-anti-inflammatory-drugs-to-treat-coronavirus-cleveland-doctor-wants-more-data.html" target="_blank">“French warn against anti-inflammatory drugs to treat coronavirus”</a></p> <p>In the article, a pediatric infectious disease specialist and associate medical director for infection control at University Hospitals Rainbow Babies and Children’s Hospital said in response to the French ministers statement,</p> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>she is aware generally of what the French are saying and believes it’s probably based on a single study and therefore she is reluctant to accept any blanket statement. Also, the study would be looking at data from a lab setting and that the results in real life could be different. If more data comes out she might change her mind, she said.  </p></blockquote> <h2>Acetaminophen or Ibuprofen?</h2> <p>I just wanted to put this information out there.</p> <p>If I personally happen to get the COVID-19 Coronavirus, I believe that my choice of fever reducer medication may be Acetaminophen.

 You are correct… 
I know Advil effects the kidneys but when my kidneys act up and don’t filter out the uric acid properly, I get a bout of gout. That’s why I cringe when I get a bout because I use Advil for the swelling and pain associated with gout. I also drink cranberry juice and take cranberry supplements, both help kick my kidneys into working properly.</ins></p><ins> </ins><ins><span class="reply-container"><a rel="nofollow" class="comment-reply-link" href="#comment-1697322">Reply Link: #comment-1697322 </a></span> </ins></article><ul class="children"><li class="comment odd alt depth-5" id="li-comment-1697334"><article id="comment-1697334" class="comment-body clearfix"><p class="comment_postinfo"><ins><span class="fn">Just Sayin'</span> <span class="comment_date">on 03/17/2020 at 11:51 AM				</span> </ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Jabba, TRY Cherry Juice, or tart cherry capsules. both work for a DFM.</ins></p><ins> </ins></article></li><ins> </ins><li class="comment even depth-5" id="li-comment-1697352"><article id="comment-1697352" class="comment-body clearfix"><p class="comment_postinfo"><ins><span class="fn">Jabba</span> <span class="comment_date">on 03/17/2020 at 12:34 PM				</span> </ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>JS,

Be careful, you could put the person in shock by lowering the core temp too fast.</ins></p><ins> </ins><ins><span class="reply-container"><a rel="nofollow" class="comment-reply-link" href="#comment-1697323">Reply Link: #comment-1697323 </a></span> </ins></article></li><ins> </ins></ul><ins> </ins></li><ins> </ins><li class="comment even thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="li-comment-1697139"><article id="comment-1697139" class="comment-body clearfix"><p class="comment_postinfo"><ins><span class="fn">N.E.W. prepper</span> <span class="comment_date">on 03/16/2020 at 4:11 PM				</span> </ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>SARS-CoV2  appears to be the other name for this virus.

I looked this up also. My reference says it moderates cytokines in the body. I think the trick with elderberry is to be taking it before being exposed, as it kind of acts like a systemic antiviral, preventing any virus from replicating in your body. No virus replicating most likely means lower chance of cytokine storms, if I understand this right.</ins></p><ins> </ins><ins><span class="reply-container"><a rel="nofollow" class="comment-reply-link" href="#comment-1697257">Reply Link: #comment-1697257 </a></span> </ins></article><ul class="children"><li class="comment even depth-3" id="li-comment-1697874"><article id="comment-1697874" class="comment-body clearfix"><p class="comment_postinfo"><ins><span class="fn">Odd hawk</span> <span class="comment_date">on 03/18/2020 at 10:18 PM				</span> </ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>I have been taking elderberry for around four years and i have found it has to be in the system to be really effective.

  NO DOUBT!!. I’ve been hearing that even if you survive this you will have damage to the lungs. As in, you will have a decreased percentage of lung function.

   Ya, those underlying medical conditions are “any” lung conditions as some of the serious case turn into pneumonia… 
My scarred lung tissue is from when I was kid and had bronchitis and pneumonia at the same time. My asthma is from that and allergies. When I was a kid I was at 75% lung capacity… 
  Slap a mask on him now. A N95 at the least. Have him and everyone around him, get used to it now. I have been wearing a mask in my office for a while now. At first everyone asked why. I said allergies. Which at the time was true. I switched to a N95 because of Covid and no one noticed or said anything.

It is in xanthine family

Probably why coffee works

4,000mg really???? that’s like 20 of those little brown 200 mg pills a day. Ouch. Man, now I really feel bad for folks that have to take that much for pain. I used to gage how rough a day I had had by how many pills I took before bed. a “4 -Ibuprofen night” meant I had a really rough day. I won’t go near Tylenol all. I’d rather suffer through a fever than take that amount of drugs.</ins></p><ins> </ins><ins><span class="reply-container"><a rel="nofollow" class="comment-reply-link" href="#comment-1697503">Reply Link: #comment-1697503 </a></span> </ins></article><ul class="children"><li class="comment byuser comment-author-ken bypostauthor odd alt depth-4" id="li-comment-1697521"><article id="comment-1697521" class="comment-body clearfix"><p class="comment_postinfo"><ins><span class="fn"><a href="https://modernsurvivalblog.com/" rel="external nofollow ugc" class="url">Ken Jorgustin Link: https://modernsurvivalblog.com/ </a></span> <span class="comment_date">on 03/17/2020 at 8:23 PM				</span> </ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Yes, that’s what I’ve heard for absolute max.

Makes a pretty good case for letting fevers run their course (in adults), since the virus fighting agents in our system work best when warmer.  While he didn’t specify, I would imagine there’s some number you wouldn’t want your temperature to get over, but perhaps something up to about 101-102F might be more beneficial than not?  Perhaps get rid of the infection sooner?</ins></p><ins> </ins><ins><span class="reply-container"><a rel="nofollow" class="comment-reply-link" href="#comment-1697510">Reply Link: #comment-1697510 </a></span> </ins></article><ul class="children"><li class="comment even depth-2" id="li-comment-1697522"><article id="comment-1697522" class="comment-body clearfix"><p class="comment_postinfo"><ins><span class="fn">Minerjim</span> <span class="comment_date">on 03/17/2020 at 8:25 PM				</span> </ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Finally, 
I have been saying this for a while.  At least for myself, I’ll take the fever and skip the drugs and let my immune system try to fry the virus out. If I get too hot at some point I can always run through the vineyard naked at night, or jump in the irrigation canal.</ins></p><ins> </ins><ins><span class="reply-container"><a rel="nofollow" class="comment-reply-link" href="#comment-1697522">Reply Link: #comment-1697522 </a></span> </ins></article></li><ins> </ins><li class="comment odd alt depth-2" id="li-comment-1697547"><article id="comment-1697547" class="comment-body clearfix"><p class="comment_postinfo"><ins><span class="fn">Fireswamp</span> <span class="comment_date">on 03/17/2020 at 9:27 PM				</span> </ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Fever is a temperature higher than 100.4 F 
Once temperatures are higher than 103-104F then it’s considered a high fever and there’s increased risk of mental confusion or seizures 
A temperature 106F or higher is in DANGER zone and untreated could lead to brain damage or death (ie frying your brain) 
(hyperpyrexia an internal cause of high body temperature 
Hyperthermia is an external cause of high body temperature) 
Usually you don’t have to reflex treat a temperature if it’s low grade and not bothering you- there were studies in animals and cell cultures that showed some benefits of temperature helping your immune response 
Hope this helps clarify</ins></p><ins> </ins><ins><span class="reply-container"><a rel="nofollow" class="comment-reply-link" href="#comment-1697547">Reply Link: #comment-1697547 </a></span> </ins></article></li><ins> </ins></ul><ins> </ins></li><ins> </ins></ol><p id="respond" class="comment-respond"><ins></ins></p><h3 id="reply-title" class="comment-reply-title"><ins><span>Submit a Comment</span> <a rel="nofollow" id="cancel-comment-reply-link" href="/pandemic/acetaminophen-tylenol-or-ibuprofen-advil-for-coronavirus/#respond">Cancel reply Link: /pandemic/acetaminophen-tylenol-or-ibuprofen-advil-for-coronavirus/#respond </a></ins></h3><p class="comment-notes"><ins><span id="email-notes">Your email address will not be published.</span></ins></p></section> </article>

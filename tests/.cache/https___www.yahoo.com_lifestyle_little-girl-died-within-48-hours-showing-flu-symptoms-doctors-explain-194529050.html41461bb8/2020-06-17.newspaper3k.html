Here&#8217;s what might have happened. (Photo: GoFundMe).<p>Flu season is well underway in the U.S., and the virus has already claimed the lives of 13 children so far, according to recently released data from the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm#S3" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" class="link rapid-noclick-resp">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>. Among them is 6-year-old Allison Eaglespeaker, who died of the flu on Dec. 1</p><p>Eaglespeaker&#8217;s mother, Crystal White Shield, told <a href="https://www.wcvb.com/article/as-flu-is-on-the-rise-mom-says-i-didn-t-know-i-was-going-to-lose-my-baby-to-the-flu/25749201" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" class="link rapid-noclick-resp">WCVB5</a> that her daughter &#8212; who suffered from mild asthma &#8212; first showed signs of being sick just 48 hours before she died. &#8220;This illness hit her really hard and really fast,&#8221; Shield said. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know I was going to lose my baby.&#8221; Eaglespeaker&#8217;s aunt reportedly set up a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/funeral-expenses-for-allison" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" class="link rapid-noclick-resp">GoFundMe</a> for her niece&#8217;s family, calling her their &#8220;beautiful baby girl.&#8221;</p><p>It seems shocking that someone could die that quickly from the flu, but it happens, Gina Posner, MD, a pediatrician at MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, Calif., tells Yahoo Lifestyle. &#8220;The flu can move super quickly in children and adults,&#8221; she says. &#8220;The flu can come and just overwhelm the system. That&#8217;s why we always tell people to get their flu shot.&#8221;</p><p>Having an underlying condition like asthma, being immunocompromised, and not getting a flu shot increase the chances that someone will have a serious, rapidly progressing case of the flu, infectious disease expert&#160;Amesh&#160;A.&#160;Adalja, MD,&#160;senior scholar&#160;at the John&#8217;s Hopkins Center for Health Security, tells Yahoo Lifestyle. In general, &#8220;to die that fast from flu likely means that it caused a primary viral pneumonia, which can interfere with oxygen function,&#8221; he says. But overall, &#8220;there&#8217;s a lot of mystery in understanding who dies from flu and who doesn&#8217;t die from flu,&#8221; Adalja says. &#8220;There may be some genetic variation in the immune system of some people that allows the flu to progress rapidly.&#8221;</p><p>If your child becomes sick with an upper respiratory infection, it can be tough to know whether it&#8217;s due to something like a cold, general cough, or the flu, Posner says. &#8220;Typically the fever is higher and more persistent with the flu, but not always,&#8221; she says.</p><p class="caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse"></p><p>If your child has any kind of underlying medical issue, Adalja recommends taking them to the doctor ASAP to be tested for the flu and potentially put on an anti-viral drug like Tamiflu, which can shorten the duration of the flu and lower the odds that your child will experience serious complications from the illness. &#8220;Also, if they don&#8217;t have any medical problems but are short of breath, have uncontrollable fever, are lethargic, or have a change in behavior, that should prompt you to see a doctor,&#8221; Adalja says.</p><p>You&#8217;ll also want to provide lots of comfort care, including pushing fluids, having your child rest, and giving them ibuprofen or acetaminophen if they&#8217;re uncomfortable and feverish, Posner says. &#8220;Keep an eye on them and call your doctor if they seem to get worse,&#8221; she adds.</p><p>Overall, experts stress that prevention is crucial. &#8220;The most important thing that anyone can do is the flu shot,&#8221; Posner says. &#8220;Even if the shot does not prevent your child from getting the flu, at least it can help prevent your child from dying from the flu.&#8221;</p><p><strong>Read more from Yahoo Lifestyle:</strong></p><p><strong>Follow us on <a href="https://instagram.com/yahoolifestyle/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" class="link rapid-noclick-resp">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/yahoolifestyle" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" class="link rapid-noclick-resp">Facebook</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoolifestyle" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" class="link rapid-noclick-resp">Twitter</a> for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.</strong></p><br><p class="player"></p></div>

Attendees can't travel plan. Sponsors and marketers can't market with a degree of sensitivity.""I think the IOC insisting this will move ahead, with such conviction, is insensitive and irresponsible given the state of humanity."</p><p>She is not alone.Several athletes, including reigning Olympic pole vault champion Katerina Stefanidi, said the IOC decision was putting athletes' health at risk, urging them to train as normal when entire countries have shut down to contain the virus spread.</p><p>"There is no postponement, no cancellation. But it (the IOC) is putting us at risk," Stefanidi said in an exclusive interview to Reuters."We all want Tokyo to happen but what is the Plan B if it does not happen?"Knowing about a possible option has a major effect on my training because I may be taking risks now that I would not take if I knew there was also the possibility of a Plan B."&#160;</p> <a class="NewsLink fr" href="https://headtopics.com/uk/john-oliver-on-prisons-during-covid-19-that-s-not-justice-that-s-neglect-13839030" title="John Oliver on prisons during Covid-19: 'That's not justice, that's neglect'">John Oliver on prisons during Covid-19: 'That's not justice, that's neglect'</a> <a class="NewsLink fr" href="https://headtopics.com/uk/the-pandemic-is-not-over-we-need-to-push-now-for-a-zero-coronavirus-britain-devi-sridhar-13839264" title="The pandemic is not over &#8211; we need to push now for a zero-coronavirus Britain | Devi Sridhar">The pandemic is not over &#8211; we need to push now for a zero-coronavirus Britain | Devi Sridhar</a> <a class="NewsLink fr" href="https://headtopics.com/uk/syrian-doctor-arrested-in-germany-for-alleged-crimes-against-humanity-13839268" title="Syrian doctor arrested in Germany for alleged crimes against humanity">Syrian doctor arrested in Germany for alleged crimes against humanity</a> <a href="https://headtopics.com/uk/11928816" rel="nofollow" class="Read-More">Read more: The Independent &#187;</a> <p class="speech sb0">take a long hard look at the IOC and how it;s business model is designed. there is a level of corruption beyond anything seen before. they do not want to pay back the financial 'incentives' they recieved and the corporate sponsorship deals that run into billions All those wasted bribes sport latest: &#127954; GB ice hockey match cancelled &#9917; Six Espanyol players contract coronavirus &#128692;&#8205;&#9794;&#65039; Tour of Yorkshire cancelled</p><p class="News-Part"><strong>Katarina Johnson-Thompson criticises IOC for Olympics preparation advice</strong>Katarina Johnson-Thompson has questioned the <a href="https://headtopics.com/uk/ioc" title="Ioc, Ioc">IOC</a> &#8217;s advice that athletes should continue their preparations for Tokyo 2020 &#8216;as best they can&#8217;, saying it contradicts government information on isolation to curb the coronavirus pandemic there will be no Olympics this year The Olympics are all about money, not about sport.</p><p class="News-Part"><strong>IOC rules out staging Tokyo Olympic Games behind closed doors</strong>The Olympic Games in Tokyo will have spectators if it goes ahead as planned Empty stadiums are not the issue.

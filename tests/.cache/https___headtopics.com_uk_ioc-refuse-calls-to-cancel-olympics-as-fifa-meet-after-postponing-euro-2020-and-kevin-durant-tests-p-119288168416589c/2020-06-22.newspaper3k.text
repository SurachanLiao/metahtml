Dissent grows over Olympics resisting postponementThe International Olympic Committee is facing its strongest headwinds in decades as it prepares to brief national committees on Wednesday on the state of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics amid the coronavirus pandemic, with voices of dissent growing louder.

The IOC has remained committed to staging the Tokyo Games as planned from July 24-Aug. 9, saying on Tuesday after a meeting with international sports federations that measures against the virus were delivering results.The coronavirus has so far killed more than 7,500 people and infected about 200,000, with the epicentre now in Europe.

The IOC has refused to publicly consider cancellation or postponement as possible options, even as other major events including soccer's Euro 2020 and Copa America and the French Open tennis grand slam announced postponements on Tuesday.The virus has also wreaked havoc with Olympic qualification tournaments with athletes struggling to train, travel or compete and many pre-Games qualifiers cancelled or postponed.

IOC member Hayley Wickenheiser called the decision to proceed with the Games"insensitive and irresponsible" in the most vocal attack on the Olympic body since President Thomas Bach took over in 2013.Wickenheiser, who competed in five Winter Games in ice hockey and at the 2000 Summer Olympics in softball, said continuing with the Games as planned ignored the challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic.

"This crisis is bigger than even the Olympics," Wickenheiser said in a statement on Twitter."Athletes can't train. Attendees can't travel plan. Sponsors and marketers can't market with a degree of sensitivity.""I think the IOC insisting this will move ahead, with such conviction, is insensitive and irresponsible given the state of humanity."

She is not alone.Several athletes, including reigning Olympic pole vault champion Katerina Stefanidi, said the IOC decision was putting athletes' health at risk, urging them to train as normal when entire countries have shut down to contain the virus spread.

"There is no postponement, no cancellation. But it (the IOC) is putting us at risk," Stefanidi said in an exclusive interview to Reuters."We all want Tokyo to happen but what is the Plan B if it does not happen?"Knowing about a possible option has a major effect on my training because I may be taking risks now that I would not take if I knew there was also the possibility of a Plan B."

take a long hard look at the IOC and how it;s business model is designed. there is a level of corruption beyond anything seen before. they do not want to pay back the financial 'incentives' they recieved and the corporate sponsorship deals that run into billions All those wasted bribes sport latest: üèí GB ice hockey match cancelled ‚öΩ Six Espanyol players contract coronavirus üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Tour of Yorkshire cancelled

Katarina Johnson-Thompson criticises IOC for Olympics preparation adviceKatarina Johnson-Thompson has questioned the IOC ‚Äôs advice that athletes should continue their preparations for Tokyo 2020 ‚Äòas best they can‚Äô, saying it contradicts government information on isolation to curb the coronavirus pandemic there will be no Olympics this year The Olympics are all about money, not about sport.

IOC rules out staging Tokyo Olympic Games behind closed doorsThe Olympic Games in Tokyo will have spectators if it goes ahead as planned Empty stadiums are not the issue. The issue is, are you going to have your athletes live in the mass accommodations of Olympic Village? That's the issue. No one is going to attend to watch the games as infection rate is still high in Japan. There will be so much restrictions and long queue for health check before going inside any events/restaurants/airports etc, it will just take the fun out of watching.

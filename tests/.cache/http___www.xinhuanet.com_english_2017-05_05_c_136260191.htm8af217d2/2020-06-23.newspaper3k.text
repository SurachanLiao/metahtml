PYONGYANG, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) said Friday that it had foiled an attempt by U.S. and South Korean spy agencies to assassinate the country's top leader Kim Jong Un, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported.

According to the report, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) of the United States and South Korea's Intelligence Service (IS) attempted to murder DPRK's Kim last month with bio-chemical and radio-active substances.

The Ministry of State Security of the DPRK said in a statement that CIA recruited a DPRK citizen in Russia's Far East in 2014 and trained him to stage the assassination against Kim when he was making public appearances on April 15 during celebrations of the 105th birthday of DPRK founding leader Kim Il Sung.

The KCNA said the spy, surnamed Kim and a resident of Pyongyang, was given equipment, money and instruction to carry out the plot.

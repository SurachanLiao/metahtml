Stuxnet Knocks Natanz Out For a Week, Hits Iran's Air Defense (bug raiding all their military)

Despite Iranian claims in October that their nuclear systems were cleansed of the Stuxnet virus, Iranian sources confirm that the invasive malworm is still making trouble. It shut down uranium enrichment at Natanz for a week from Nov. 16 to 22 over breakdowns caused by mysterious power fluctuations in the operation of the centrifuge machines enriching uranium at Natanz. The shutdown was reported by the director of the International Atomic Energy Agency Yukiya Amano to the IAEA board in Vienna on Tuesday, Nov. 23.

Rapid changes in the spinning speed of the thousands of centrifuges enriching uranium to weapons-grade can cause them to blow apart suddenly without the monitors detecting any malfunction. The Iranian operators first tried replacing the P1 and P2 centrifuges used at Natanz with the more advanced IR1 type, but got the same effect. They finally decided to shut the plant down until computer security experts purged it of the malworm.

But then, when work was resumed Monday, about 5,000 of the 8,000 machines were found to be out of commission and the remaining 2,500-3,000 partially on the blink.

Tuesday, Ali Akbar Salehi, Director of Iran's Nuclear Energy Commission tried to put a good face on the disaster. "Fortunately the nuclear Stuxnet virus has faced a dead end," he said. However, the IAEA report and Western intelligence confirm that the virus has gathered itself for a fresh onslaught on Iran's vital facilities.

According to an exclusive report, Stuxnet is also in the process of raiding Iran's military systems, sowing damage and disorder in its wake.

On Nov. 17, in the middle of a massive air defense exercise, Iranian military sources reported six foreign aircraft had intruded the airspace over the practice sites and were put to flight by Iranian fighters. The next day, a different set of military sources claimed a misunderstanding; there had been no intrusions. Iranian fighters had simulated an enemy raid which too had been repulsed. debkafile's military sources disclose there was no "misunderstanding." The foreign intruders had shown up on the exercise's radar screens, but when the fighter jets scrambled to intercept them, they found empty sky, meaning the radar instruments had lied.

The military command accordingly decided to give up on using the exercise as a stage for unveiling new and highly sophisticated weaponry, including a homemade radar system, for fear that they too may have been infected by the ubiquitous Stuxnet worm.

This is too funny as a software enigneere it is nice to see something good done with computer viruses



To: dselig

Damn clever those Israelis.



To: ShadowAce

You’d think they could boot up in safe mode and do a system restore. :)



To: dselig

The enemy of my enemy is my friend. Keep up the good work, Stuxnet!

Let's hope it can differentiate friend from foe.

That is not a feature of the Jihad2000 operating system. Your only choices are “Detonate, Retry, or Fail.”



To: xkaydet65

Damn clever those Israelis. Agreed, but I'm wondering why it's taking Obamolester so long to publicly point the finger at them and then apologize profusely to Dinner-Jacket for the U.S. in being so evil for supporting Israel during the Booooooooooooooooooooooosh years.



To: Mr. K

We should try it on North Korea.



To: kromike

Bet you they will do a WikiLeak on it next...



To: dselig

Run into a dead end? Does that mean there are no more processors to infect?



To: kromike

He was waiting for the DEBKA report . Now he has evidnce,yes it’s DEBKA but so what, that Israel is behind the worm. I expect condemnation of Israel in 3,2,1...



To: xkaydet65

God bless and strengthen Israel! May all they put their hands to prosper, and their enemies become the trash-heaps of history!

“Damn clever those Israelis.” OK, so even Freepers know the worm is an attack on Iran's nuclear program. Question: isn't a cyber attack on this scale an act of war? What if the Iranians did that to our military computers? Wouldn't it justify an attack?



To: dselig

"Fortunately the nuclear Stuxnet virus has faced a dead end" LOL, but the Stuxnet virus that takes over the radar outside the base is still a goer. My money is on Stuxnet suppressing Iranian nuclear ambitions for decades.

In a world where bombarding an South Korean island isn’t an act of war, a fully deniable attack with a virus isn’t even on the radar.

Have BUG,

To: garjog

China’s already experimented with hacking our computers. As for Israel, I don’t want to say rules dont apply. BUt for a state the size of New Jersey that half the world iS bent on killing, there’s only one rule. DON’T LOSE!!!

Covid 19 also in the digestive tract, from the stomach to the intestine and especially the liver. The damage depends on yes from the strength of the virus, but also of the defenses each, so the effects are different in different patients. The supports Alessandro <ins>Pampanathe</ins> <del>Pampanathe</del> director of the operative unit of internal medicine of the Noa. The difficulty, however, for the liver, with the possibility of going to hepatitis.</p><p>Dr. Pampana, what are the damages gastroenterologici, at a distance, caused by the Coronavirus?</p><p>“The virus enters the body, most frequently through the respiratory tract and attacks the cells of many organs and systems, but its effects also depend on how well and how your body reacts. The immunological defences are different from individual to individual and the answer is different for everyone. Weaknesses of the digestive system are the cells that have on their surface structures that allow the entry of the virus, referred to as the Ace 2. You are on the esophagus, the stomach or the intestine where the virus can reproduce and stay longer than in other parts. The immune system is well represented in the digestive tract, where it interacts with the germs that are normally found in the intestine (the so-called microbiota). The Coronavirus is eliminated along with the feces, even after the disappearance of the respiratory symptoms and it was the problem of the transmission of infection via this route. Sometimes it remains in time an alteration that looks like “colon irritable””.</p><p>What are the disorders?</p><p>“Up to 30% of patients have a loss of appetite, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, emission of blood in the stool and diarrhea. These symptoms can accompany those on respirators, in some cases, precede them or be the only manifestations. The diarrhea can last for weeks after the apparent end of the infection and the prolonged elimination of viral particles in the faeces raised the question of a residual infectivity in individuals with this alteration. Symptoms such as “irritable bowel syndrome”, they remain sometimes for a long time. Patients have abdominal pain, feeling of bloating, alternating constipation and diarrhea; it is possible it is a result of the stress that the disease determines, or is tied, at least in part, to the action of the intestinal immune system, which, after the elimination of the virus, it remains enabled. Will be to assess, whether these symptoms represent the expression of a process that causes permanent damage”.</p><p>Men and women are affected in equal measure?</p><p>“The disorders affect men and women of all ages, with greater frequency and severity in elderly subjects and in those suffering from other diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, diabetic neuropathy or atherosclerosis of the arteries of the bowel”.</p><p>What is the hepatitis from Covid? Can cronicizzarsi?</p><p>“The receptor Ace 2 is found in liver, especially on the cells that line the canalicoli of bile, which is more than those that make up the majority of the liver the same and that perform most of the functions. The consequences are conditioned by the response of the immune system. So the severity of the injuries and damages will be different depending on the immune response of the individual. Affect any disease already present, a viral or non-viral, or the effects of the involvement of other organs (decreased oxygen in the blood due to lung disease). About 50% of the patients in the blood an increase in the value of serum transaminases and gamma GT (signs of inflammation of the liver), a decrease of albumin and a prothrombin time (decreased production of the liver). These alterations in the majority of cases, accompany the disorders of the respiratory system and resolve to improve the general framework; in others it has a negative evolution, with a real hepatitis (intense inflammation at the load of the liver) which can lead to liver failure. Several observations indicate the possibility of permanent consequences for the heart, kidney, brain, bone marrow, and it is not possible to exclude something similar to the liver”.</p><p>The treatments available are effective?</p><p>“For now, the treatments are designed to reduce noise (for example with drugs that modify bowel movements) and to control or compensate for the consequences of the disorders (for example, with the administration of fluids in case of diarrhea, and sodium or potassium in the case of proven losses with diarrhea)”. —</p></article>

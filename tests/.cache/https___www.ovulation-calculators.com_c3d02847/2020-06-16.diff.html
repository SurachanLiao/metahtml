Please note: this is not 14 days after your last period, but 14 days BEFORE your next period. This is a fairly common misconception, and the fact that most periodic cycles are of 28 days in length, makes many women assume that their ovulation is 14 days after the last period. Obviously, when your cycle length is 28 days, it is actually 14 days after your next period as well (as it's exactly 14 days before the next one), but what happens if your menstrual cycle is 30 days, for example? Well, in this case, you will ovulate 16 days after your last period (which is 14 days before your next one).<h4>OVULATION FACTS</h4><ul><li>Ovulation occurs 14 days before your next period</li><li>Most periodic cycles are 28 days in length</li><li>Once the egg is released during ovulation, it will live up to 12 <ins>hours,</ins> <del>hours,</del> waiting to be fertilised</li><li>Sperm can survive up to 5 days in the vaginal tract</li><li>Therefore, you are likely to conceive even if you have sex 5 days before your ovulation day</li></ul> <p></p><h2>Frequently Asked Questions on Ovulation</h2><section class="faq_card_section"><h2>What is ovulation?</h2><p>Ovulation is the time of the month when an egg is released from the woman's ovaries into the fallopian tube, where it can be fertilised by a sperm cell if intercourse happens.</p></section><section class="faq_card_section"><p></p><h2>When should I have intercourse to conceive a baby?</h2><p>Intercourse should happen a few days before the ovulation is estimated to happen, and on the ovulation day. Sperm cells can live in the vaginal tract for days, and this continuous intercourse ensures that the egg is more likely to be fertilised when it's released.</p></section><section class="faq_card_section"><p></p><h2>When exactly does my ovulation occur?</h2><p>Your ovulation occurs exactly 14 days BEFORE your next period. This is contrary to the belief that it occurs 14 days AFTER your last period, a most menstrual cycles are not 28 days in length.</p></section><section class="faq_card_section"><p></p><h2>How do I calculate my ovulation days?</h2><p>You'll need to add the length of your cycle (usually 28 days) to your last period date, then subtract 14 days from that, in order to evaluate when your next ovulation day occurs.

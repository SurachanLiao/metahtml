Frequently Asked Questions on Ovulation

What is ovulation? Ovulation is the time of the month when an egg is released from the woman's ovaries into the fallopian tube, where it can be fertilised by a sperm cell if intercourse happens.

When should I have intercourse to conceive a baby? Intercourse should happen a few days before the ovulation is estimated to happen, and on the ovulation day. Sperm cells can live in the vaginal tract for days, and this continuous intercourse ensures that the egg is more likely to be fertilised when it's released.

How ovulation happens - video explanation

This is a break-down of how your ovulation is calculated, and how we work out your most fertile days, based on your menstrual cycle.Your ovulation occurs 14 daysyour next period. Please note: this isyour last period, but 14 days BEFORE your next period. This is a fairly common misconception, and the fact that most periodic cycles are of 28 days in length, makes many women assume that their ovulation is 14 days after the last period. Obviously, when your cycle length is 28 days, it is actually 14 days after your next period as well (as it's exactly 14 days before the next one), but what happens if your menstrual cycle is 30 days, for example? Well, in this case, you will ovulate 16 days after your last period (which is 14 days before your next one).

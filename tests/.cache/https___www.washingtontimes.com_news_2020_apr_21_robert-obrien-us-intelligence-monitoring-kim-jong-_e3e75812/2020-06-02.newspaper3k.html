<div><p>The U.S. intelligence community is monitoring the condition of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un &#8220;very closely,&#8221; White House National Security Adviser Robert O&#8217;Brien said Tuesday.</p>

                      

                      

                      

                    
                      

                      

                      <p>Mr. Kim is reportedly in danger of dying after having a heart operation, according to a Monday CNN report that said the dictator is in &#8220;grave danger.&#8221;</p>

                      

                      

                      

                    
                      

                      

                      <p>&#8220;We&#8217;re monitoring these reports very closely,&#8221; Mr. O&#8217;Brien told Fox News, adding that &#8220;<a href="/topics/north-korea/">North Korea</a> is a very closed society.&#8221;</p>

                      

                         

                      

                      

                      

                    
                      

                      

                      <p>Mr. Kim was last seen publicly on April 11 and fell ill around the country&#8217;s biggest holiday celebrating the April 15 birthday of his grandfather, Kim Il-sung, the founder of <a href="/topics/north-korea/">North Korea</a>&#8217;s communist regime.</p>

                      

                      

                      

                    
                      

                      

                      <p>But neighbors China and South Korea have pushed back on the reports and have said they have not seen anything concerning.</p>

                      <p>&#8220;We have nothing to confirm, and there has been no unusual activity detected in <a href="/topics/north-korea/">North Korea</a>,&#8221; Kang Min-seok, a spokesman for the presidential Blue House, told reporters Tuesday.</p>

                      <p>An official with the Chinese Communist Party&#8217;s International Liaison Department told Reuters they do not believe Mr. Kim is &#8220;critically ill.&#8221;</p>

2. These n*ggas actually demonized FORKS! The eating utensil. Like they were propagandized that they were like "hoes for picking up cow sh*t." They made fun of Americans for using forks apparently lol<br>
<br>
3. You could get shot and k*lled for eating beef over there. Like the government will give a starving family a cow and some beans and they better not eat that cow until the cow is too old to work. Then they k*ll it by feeding it fertilizer. After that they harvest the poisoned meat and send 30% to the local government. She said it is the toughest meat you could possibly imagine, already turned into leather and sh*t <img border="0" alt="" title="Dead" class="inlineimg lazyload"><br>

4. They talked about how often they got to eat meat, and they said they basically got rationed a handful of pork or dog meat, so most of the meat they raised for slaughter was going to the government<p>1. There is a QUOTA for dog and rabbit furs for each family in North Korea. They raise rabbits and dogs for food and each year they turn in the pelts to the government so they can use them to make coats for soldiers in the North where it's very cold. And if they don't meet quota they have to pay a tax instead. So they are used to raising dogs for food annually or close to it. There are breeds that will be pretty much fully grown after a year2.

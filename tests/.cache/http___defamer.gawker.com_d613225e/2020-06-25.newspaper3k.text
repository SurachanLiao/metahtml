Hello, Dolls! Itâs great to see you all again. I hope youâve had a restful few weeks between Keeping Up With the Kardashians seasons, and youâve properly mourned the loss of KUWTKâs old, tired, and clunky graphics. Thatâs right, ainât no old graphics, bih, we got new graphics and opening sequences, bihhhhh! Things are rapidly changing in the Kardashian/Jenner household, so weâre thankful that we have a safe space in which we can keep up. Speaking of keeping up, letâs dive right in to this lightly packed premiere and uncover when and why we were lied to by Calabasasâ first family. Come here, hold my hand, and letâs go dolls.

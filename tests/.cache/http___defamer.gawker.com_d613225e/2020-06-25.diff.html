Preceding this album has been a string of derpily titled singlesââWhere Are Ã Now,â âWhat Do You Mean,â âSorryââthat work on their own as proper songs and donât require built-in fandom for appreciation. Theyâve all gone Top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 (âWhat Do You Meanâ debuted at No. 1, in fact), which has helped shape a narrative that this album marks a comeback for Bieber. But where did he go? What do you mean, music press? And, most importantly, why should we care? Below we attempt to unravel these great mysteries.</ins></p></article> <div><p><del>Hello, Dolls!

Things are rapidly changing in the Kardashian/Jenner household, so weâre thankful that we have a safe space in which we can keep up. Speaking of keeping up, letâs dive right in to this lightly packed premiere and uncover when and why we were lied to by Calabasasâ first family. Come here, hold my hand, and letâs go dolls. </del></p><del> </del></div>

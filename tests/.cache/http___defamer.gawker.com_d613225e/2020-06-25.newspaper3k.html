<div><p>Hello, Dolls! It&#226;&#128;&#153;s great to see you all again. I hope you&#226;&#128;&#153;ve had a restful few weeks between Keeping Up With the Kardashians seasons, and you&#226;&#128;&#153;ve properly mourned the loss of KUWTK&#226;&#128;&#153;s old, tired, and clunky graphics. That&#226;&#128;&#153;s right, ain&#226;&#128;&#153;t no old graphics, <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=bih"></a>bih, we got new graphics and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNZhjyL8tx8"></a>opening sequences, bihhhhh! Things are rapidly changing in the Kardashian/Jenner household, so we&#226;&#128;&#153;re thankful that we have a safe space in which we can keep up. Speaking of keeping up, let&#226;&#128;&#153;s dive right in to this lightly packed premiere and uncover when and why we were lied to by Calabasas&#226;&#128;&#153; first family. Come here, hold my hand, and let&#226;&#128;&#153;s go dolls. </p>

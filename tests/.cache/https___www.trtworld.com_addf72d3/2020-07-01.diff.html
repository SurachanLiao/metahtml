Israel's foreign minister has said in an announcement that the proposed annexation of occupied West Bank land was unlikely on Wednesday. 
 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu set July 1 as the date from which it can begin implementing US President Trump's controversial Mideast proposal dubbed “Deal of the Century”. 
 
Palestinians have rejected the Trump plan calling it the “slap of the century”. But they say they are willing to discuss alternatives with the Israelis. 
 
*)Hong Kong makes first arrest under new national security law  
 
Hong Kong police have made their first arrest under the new security legislation and warned of punishment for anti-Beijing material. 
 
Riot police used pepper spray to arrest at least two people, while one metro  station was closed as hundreds of protesters gathered for an annual rally. 
 
Police earlier banned the rally, citing the law for the first time. 
 
*)Russians set to back reforms allowing Putin to extend rule 
 
Russians are casting their ballots this week in a vote on constitutional reforms that could prolong President Putin's hold on power. 
 
Putin proposed the changes in January and they were quickly approved by Russia's two houses of parliament and regional lawmakers. 
 
A nationwide vote to approve the reforms planned for April was postponed as Russia registered a surge in coronavirus infections. 
 
*)Slaying of Ethiopian singer sparks protests, leaving at least 10 dead 
 
At least 10 people were killed and more than 80 wounded after the killing of a popular singer triggered blasts and protests in Ethiopia's capital and the surrounding Oromiya region. 
 
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed called the killing of musician Haacaaluu Hundeessaa "an evil act" in a televised address.  
 
Police said several suspects have been arrested, without giving more details, except that Hundeessaa was targeted.  
 
And finally… 
 
*)Facebook boots far-right network and boosts original news 
 
Facebook has disrupted a "violent US-based anti-government network" and vowed to give original news priority. 
 
The decision comes as Facebook faces an advertiser boycott that has morphed into a global digital activist campaign aimed at curbing hateful and toxic content. 
 
The disrupted network was loosely affiliated with the "Boogaloo" movement, whose followers have appeared at recent protests while heavily armed, the company said.</p> <ins><span class="dnbListDate hidden">Wednesday, July 01, 2020</span> <span class="dnbListDateTime hidden">Wed, 01 Jul 2020 09:03:51 +0000</span></ins> </li> <li><a href="#">Tuesday, June 30, 2020</a> <p>*)China passes controversial Hong Kong security law 
 
We start in China, where the parliament has passed a controversial national security legislation for Hong Kong. State media is expected to publish details of the law soon. 
 
The law comes in response to last year's often violent anti-China protests in Hong Kong. 
 
The legislation is aimed at curbing subversive, secessionist and terrorist activities as well as foreign intervention in the city’s affairs. 
 
*)Hong Kong activists quit democracy group Demosisto 
 
Hong Kong activists Joshua Wong, Nathan Law, Jeffrey Ngo and Agnes Chow ended their involvement with Demosisto party, founded by leaders of the protests in 2014. 
 
The move comes hours after China passed a sweeping national security law for the city. 
 
Wong said he would be a “prime target” of Beijing’s new law. All four activists said they would continue to campaign in a personal capacity. 
 
*)White House aware of intelligence on Russian bounties on US troops  
 
President Donald Trump received a written briefing about alleged Russian bounties offered to Taliban militants to kill US troops as early as February. 
 
Notes on bounties were included in a written version of the president's daily briefing in late February, The New York Times reported, citing two officials. 
 
Trump has denied being informed of the assessment, while the White House said the claim had been kept from him. 
 
*)Maduro gives EU ambassador 72 hours to leave Venezuela 
 
Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has given the head of the European Union mission in Caracas 72 hours to leave the country.  
 
The move follows the bloc’s announcement of financial sanctions against 11 Venezuelan officials. 
 
The EU said the Venezuelan officials are "responsible for acting against the National Assembly's democratic functioning." 
 
And finally… 
 
*)TikTok denies sharing Indian user data with China 
 
TikTok denied sharing Indian user data with the Chinese government after New Delhi banned the popular app. 
 
The company said user privacy is very important to them and would never share any such information even if asked in the future. 
 
TikTok is owned by China's ByteDance and was one of 59 Chinese mobile apps banned by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government.</p> <ins><span class="dnbListDate hidden">Tuesday, June 30, 2020</span> <span class="dnbListDateTime hidden">Tue, 30 Jun 2020 09:21:15 +0000</span></ins> </li> <li><a href="#">Monday, June 29, 2020</a> <p>*)Mississippi removes Confederate symbol from its flag  
 
Mississippi's legislature voted on Sunday to remove the controversial Confederate symbol from the state flag.  
 
Protesters across the US have torn down dozens of Confederate statues and symbols of racism in recent weeks.

*)Gunmen attack Pakistani stock exchange 
 
Gunmen have attacked the Pakistani stock exchange building situated in the heart of Karachi’s financial district. 
 
Karachi police say at least four attackers have been killed in Monday’s attack. Local media reported at least two civilian casualties with multiple injuries. 
 
The assailants attacked the building with grenades and guns, local media reported.  
 
*)Poland's Duda, rival Trzaskowski face tight run-off 
 
Voting has ended in Poland's presidential election. 
 
Exit polls show President Andrzej Duda has won the majority of votes but has fallen short of a first-round victory.  
 
The elections could reshape Poland’s tense relationship with the European Union.  
 
Duda has pledged to maintain the status quo of more conservative Catholic values, while his main challenger Rafal Trzaskowski presented himself as progressive. 
 
*)Vietnam grounds Pakistani pilots over licence concerns 
 
Vietnam's aviation authority said it had grounded all Pakistani pilots working for local airlines. 
 
This comes after concerns from global regulators that some pilots may have been using "dubious" licences. 
 
The suspension will be in effect until further notice from the authority, which is coordinating with Pakistani authorities to review pilot profiles. 
 
*)Starbucks joins companies in pausing social media ads 
 
Starbucks will pause advertising on all social media platforms as it explores the best ways to help stop the spread of hate speech, the company said in a statement. 
 
Starbucks said it will "have discussions internally and with media partners and civil rights organisations to stop the spread of hate speech."  
 
The statement said though Starbucks is pausing advertising, it is not joining the "Stop Hate For Profit" boycott campaign kicked off earlier this month.</p> <ins><span class="dnbListDate hidden">Monday, June 29, 2020</span> <span class="dnbListDateTime hidden">Mon, 29 Jun 2020 09:58:47 +0000</span></ins> </li> <li><a href="#">Friday, June 26, 2020</a> <p>*)US health officials estimate 20M Americans have been infection  
 
US officials estimate that 20 million Americans have been infected with the coronavirus since it first arrived in the United States

*)Big explosion near Iran's capital Tehran 
 
An explosion has taken place at an Iranian gas storage facility in an area which houses a sensitive military site near the capital Tehran. 
 
A defence ministry spokesman said the explosion took place in the "public area" of Parchin as opposed to the military site. 
 
The fire was brought under control and there were no casualties. 
 
*)Police reform bill clears US House, heads for Senate showdown 
 
The US House of Representatives has approved a controversial Democratic police reform bill, sending the measure to the Senate.  
 
The bill opposed by President Donald Trump, would mandate concrete changes in law and policy to rein in police misconduct.  
 
The bill follows George Floyd's death in Minneapolis police custody which sparked worldwide protests against racism and police brutality. 
 
*)Mexico tops 25,000 coronavirus deaths and 200,000 cases

*)Liverpool clinches Premier League title after 30 years 
 
Liverpool fans gathered at Anfield football stadium at night to celebrate the club's first Premier League title in 30 years.

UN, European and Arab powers have all warned Israel that its imminent plan to annex Palestinian land would deal a major blow to peace. 
 
The US, at a UN meeting, declined to criticise the move which comes off the back of President Donald Trump’s Middle East plan. 
 
Arab League secretary general Ahmed Aboul Gheit warned the annexation could ignite “a religious war in and beyond” in the Middle East. 
 
*)Trump says US moving troops to Poland  
 
US President Donald Trump and his Polish counterpart, Andrzej Duda, have met at the White House, saying they look forward to signing a defence cooperation agreement.

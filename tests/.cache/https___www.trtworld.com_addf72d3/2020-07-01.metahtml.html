                <p>*)Israel says annexation of occupied West Bank unlikely on Wednesday 
 
Israel's foreign minister has said in an announcement that the proposed annexation of occupied West Bank land was unlikely on Wednesday. 
 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu set July 1 as the date from which it can begin implementing US President Trump's controversial Mideast proposal dubbed &#8220;Deal of the Century&#8221;.

Police earlier banned the rally, citing the law for the first time. 
 
*)Russians set to back reforms allowing Putin to extend rule 
 
Russians are casting their ballots this week in a vote on constitutional reforms that could prolong President Putin's hold on power.

*)Facebook boots far-right network and boosts original news 
 
Facebook has disrupted a "violent US-based anti-government network" and vowed to give original news priority.

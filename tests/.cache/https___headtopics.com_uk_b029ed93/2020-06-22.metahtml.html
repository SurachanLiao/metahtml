Personal ego, pride and prejudice is doing us all in. The only truth in last 4 yrs - not much good has come out of it all. We waited 8 Obama years, then wasted another 4 Trump years. Sigh! Even though John Bolton is a war-monger, but he has said nothing but the truth here. Dont think most people have any INTEREST in what John Bolton says, period. Flogging his book what a backstabbing turncoat. Not sure why anyone would listen to him except the usual leftist suspects. He&#8217;s only confirming the obvious.</p> <a href="https://headtopics.com/uk/john-bolton-exclusive-interview-trump-does-not-represent-the-republican-cause-that-i-want-to-back-13821178" title="John Bolton exclusive interview: Trump does not represent the Republican cause that I want to back">Read more...</a> </main></section><section class="Accordion-section"><main class="Accordion-content"><p>More than 400 staff have now been tested following the outbreak at the chicken factory on Thursday.</p><p>158 workers have coronavirus at Anglesey chicken factory</p><p>R=3 Are you sure it isn't clorineovirus.. &#129300;&#128580;&#129303;&#129303; Read up on meat and pandemics.

It proves that the end game is to erase the female experience. IstandwithJKRowling IstandwithJKR Yes!! Finally, a company with some spine... Great response from the agency- 'To reiterate, we believe in freedom of speech for all; these clients have decided to leave because we did not meet their demands to be re-educated to their point of view.' &#128077; This is getting ridiculous. Saying that sex is real isn't transphobic, it's a scientific fact that should empower women and transwomen alike.

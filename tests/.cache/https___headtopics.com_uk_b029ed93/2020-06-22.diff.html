Personal ego, pride and prejudice is doing us all in. The only truth in last 4 yrs - not much good has come out of it all. We waited 8 Obama years, then wasted another 4 Trump years. Sigh! Even though John Bolton is a war-monger, but he has said nothing but the truth here. Dont think most people have any INTEREST in what John Bolton says, period. Flogging his book what a backstabbing turncoat. Not sure why anyone would listen to him except the usual leftist suspects. He’s only confirming the obvious.</p> <a href="https://headtopics.com/uk/john-bolton-exclusive-interview-trump-does-not-represent-the-republican-cause-that-i-want-to-back-13821178" title="John Bolton exclusive interview: Trump does not represent the Republican cause that I want to back">Read more...</a> </main></section> <section class="Accordion-section"><main class="Accordion-content"><p><ins>More than 400 staff have now been tested following the outbreak at the chicken factory on Thursday.</ins></p><p><ins>158 workers have coronavirus at Anglesey chicken factory</ins></p><p><ins>R=3 Are you sure it isn't clorineovirus.. 🤔🙄🤗🤗 Read up on meat and pandemics.

She is speaking for the concern of other women. How ridiculous. She is the most amazing author and how anybody could read what she wrote and still be offended is beyond me. It proves that the end game is to erase the female experience. IstandwithJKRowling IstandwithJKR Yes!! Finally, a company with some spine... Great response from the agency- 'To reiterate, we believe in freedom of speech for all; these clients have decided to leave because we did not meet their demands to be re-educated to their point of view.' 👍 This is getting ridiculous. Saying that sex is real isn't transphobic, it's a scientific fact that should empower women and transwomen alike. The activists are missing the ball here, no offence.</ins></p><ins> </ins><ins><a href="https://headtopics.com/uk/authors-quit-jk-rowling-agency-over-transgender-rights-13837761" title="Authors quit JK Rowling agency over transgender rights">Read more...

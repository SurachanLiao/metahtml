ðŸš¨ EXCLUSIVE: John Bolton says Trump 'does not know the difference between the national interest of the U.S., and the interests of Donald Trump'

Dear ED., Whether Bolton is right/Trump is right, there's just too much hate in the world. Personal ego, pride and prejudice is doing us all in. The only truth in last 4 yrs - not much good has come out of it all. We waited 8 Obama years, then wasted another 4 Trump years. Sigh!



Even though John Bolton is a war-monger, but he has said nothing but the truth here.



Dont think most people have any INTEREST in what John Bolton says, period.



Flogging his book what a backstabbing turncoat. Not sure why anyone would listen to him except the usual leftist suspects.



Heâ€™s only confirming the obvious.

<p class="content-tweet">With the news that the Washington football team is changing its name, I thought that this would be an opportune time to weigh in with some suggestions. Suggestions that stand apart. <span class="nop nop-end"> 1/9</span></p>
<p class="content-tweet">You&#8217;ll have your standards (Tigers, Bulldogs, Wildcats) and your regional go-to&#8217;s (Senators, Presidents, Lobbyists and Swamp Things), but I&#8217;d like to recommend something more original. Syrup Makers? Battling Bathers? Nimrods? Banana Slugs? Alas, all taken at some point. <span class="nop nop-end"> 2/9</span></p>
<p class="content-tweet">In order to find the perfect name, one that strikes fear in the hearts of the enemy while simultaneously ensuring you don&#8217;t infringe on the copyright of a Midwest community college, I have dug deep into the archives of mythological history to unearth the following five gems. <span class="nop nop-end"> 3/9</span></p>

<p class="content-tweet">So in light of a recent documentary I just watched, I think it is time to share the moment I got red pilled (this is a really long post, sorry!!).

While applying for university in my year off, I was made aware of a very special opportunity...</p>
<p class="content-tweet">that I could apply for. This opportunity was/is called The Arts and Science Honours Academy. Upon reading the description for this prestigious 4-year program that would be put on my transcript, I couldn't wait to apply. I have always loved learning about the world around me...</p>

Ricardo*, who'd been detained with his son for 121 days at Karnes Family Detention Center were both finally released on Friday. Let this clip be a testament that ICE has the discretion to <a class="entity-hashtag" href="/hashtag/FreeThemAll">#FreeThemAll</a> <a class="entity-hashtag" href="/hashtag/SafeAndTogether">#SafeAndTogether</a> </p>
<p class="content-tweet">A little backstory: Ricardo* was living with his wife &amp; 2 year old son in San Antonio, Texas prior to being arrested.</p><p>
He'd been going to his ICE check-ins and missed a court date he didn't know about so at his next check-in, he was arrested &amp; taken to Karnes with his older son.</p>
<p class="content-tweet">A few months ago we submitted a request for parole on behalf of the family which was subsequently denied.</p><p>
In the reason for denial, ICE stated that they could not determine that neither Jose nor his son were flight risks despite their strong community ties.</p>

<p class="content-tweet">Let&#8217;s talk about herd immunity. I&#8217;ve listened to some people argue that the rapid spread of cases is a good thing, and we need to reach herd immunity in Mississippi and elsewhere to survive. I&#8217;m not a health care expert by any means, but I am a math guy. And I have thoughts:</p>
<p class="content-tweet">The experts say we need 70-80% of the population to get COVID-19 to achieve herd immunity. Let&#8217;s assume they&#8217;re wrong (it&#8217;s certainly possible, they have been before.) Let&#8217;s assume they&#8217;re being way overly cautious and we actually only need 40% infection for herd immunity.</p>
<p class="content-tweet">In Mississippi, our population is 3 million. We&#8217;ve had 36,680 cases so far. </p><p>
We&#8217;d need 1.2 MILLION infections to achieve that hypothetical 40% threshold. (Remember, experts say it&#8217;s double that.)</p>

<p class="content-tweet">On January 22, 2021, the republicans will begin to cry political persecution as the prosecutorial heat gets turned up on Trump. They will continue to try to gaslight America into believing that one side is as bad as the other, it was all just politics as usual,...</p>
<p class="content-tweet">...the democrats are mean, vindictive, hateful, and spiteful, The Democrats are anti-conservative and anti-Christian, and that a democratic president would have been just as bad and in the future will be prosecuted the same way.</p>
<p class="content-tweet">So let's be crystal clear: there is nothing political about prosecuting Trump and the rest of his Oval Office Syndicate. They are strictly criminals of the highest order.</p>

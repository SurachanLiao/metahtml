Although other types of fiberglass damages occur, the basic method in this story can apply to most fiberglass fixes. That is, unless the damage is too great, and a new panel is required. &#8230; <a href="https://www.autobreakingnews.com/1999/12/stock-car-fiberglass-repair-making-it-as-good-as-new/" class="more-link">[Read more...] <span class="screen-reader-text">about Stock Car Fiberglass Repair &#8211; Making It As Good As New</span></a></p></article><article class="post-46230480 post type-post status-publish format-standard entry"><p>CT: You seemed to be on track toward the top when you drove for car owner Larry Hedrick, with whom you earned top rookie honors in 1995 and in 1996 logged two Third Places, five top 10s, sat on two poles, and ranked 20th in points. Why did you leave Hedrick for Hendrick Motorsports&#8217; #25 team after the &#8217;96 season?Craven: I viewed that as the opportunity to play for the &#8220;Chicago Bulls of NASCAR.&#8221; I challenged myself to do that and realize the same type of success that Jeff Gordon and Jeff Burton are having now. It was a risk I took, and it didn&#8217;t work out. It was a decision I made. &#8230; <a href="https://www.autobreakingnews.com/1999/12/ricky-craven-winston-cup-driver-interview-the-interview/" class="more-link">[Read more...] <span class="screen-reader-text">about Ricky Craven Winston Cup Driver Interview &#8211; The Interview</span></a></p></article><article class="post-46230492 post type-post status-publish format-standard entry"><p>Do your research. If you&#8217;re shopping for a race school, that&#8217;s the best advice we can give. Ultimately, finding the correct school requires shopping around. Since more racing schools exist now than ever before in the history of mankind, we put this handy guide together to help make shopping around a little easier. Driving schools typically come in three flavors: serious race driver training, fan experience, and then there are ones that cater to both audiences. For the fan who wants a taste of driving a real race car and has no serious intentions of competing, there are many schools from which to choose. The weekend racer who seeks serious training has fewer options. In fact, most schools across the country cater more to the fan audience. But this is America, and somewhere and somehow, somebody is probably selling something you want. (If somebody&#8217;s not selling it, figure out how to sell it, and then you can drive a Cadillac Escalade for the rest of your life.) &#8230; <a href="https://www.autobreakingnews.com/1999/12/race-car-driving-schools-schools-around-the-country/" class="more-link">[Read more...] <span class="screen-reader-text">about Race Car Driving Schools- Schools Around The Country</span></a></p></article><article class="post-46253274 post type-post status-publish format-standard entry"><p>While the front disc swap on a Dakota will only take an hour or two, we spent some extra time and detailed the rotors and brake pads with POR-15, because we hate rust. You also need to know that on Dakotas, the calipers are held in place with a No. 45 Torx head bolt, so you&#8217;ll need to purchase a Torx socket to fit-don&#8217;t try using an Allen wrench, because you&#8217;ll strip out the head. The Stillen components go right in place of the factory pieces, so there are no surprises-simply remove and replace. &#8230; <a href="https://www.autobreakingnews.com/1999/12/stillen-cross-drilled-front-rotors-drilled-for-success/" class="more-link">[Read more...] <span class="screen-reader-text">about Stillen Cross-Drilled Front Rotors &#8211; Drilled For Success</span></a></p></article><article class="post-46219122 post type-post status-publish format-standard entry"><p>With the ominous task of disassembly and cataloguing of parts complete, the next step was to deliver the unitbody to DeWayne Krumenauer and Randy Goettl&#8217;s Progressive Stripping in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin. It was determined with the level of disassembly that this car has seen, that media blasting would be the most appropriate method to get the B-Body ready for additional metalwork. &#8230; <a href="https://www.autobreakingnews.com/1999/12/plymouth-roadrunner-stripping-mopar-project-car/" class="more-link">[Read more...] <span class="screen-reader-text">about Plymouth Roadrunner Stripping &#8211; Mopar Project Car</span></a></p></article></main>

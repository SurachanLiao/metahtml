According to a&#160;<a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/the-big-story/asia-report/china/story/jangs-execution-bodes-ill-china-20131224">detailed report</a>, Kim Jong Un fed his Uncle Jang Song Thaek to a pack of hungry dogs, a deviation from the traditional method of execution by firing squad.</span></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>
<span class="Apple-style-span">"Jang was stripped naked and thrown into a cage, along with his five closest aides. Then 120 hounds, starved for three days, were allowed to prey on them until they were completely eaten up. This is called "quan jue", or execution by dogs."</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<span class="Apple-style-span">The report, appearing in a Chinese controlled newspaper, stated that the "execution" lasted for one hour and was supervised by Kim Jong Un and "300 senior officials." &#160;</span></p>
<p>
<span class="Apple-style-span">Six months ago, the North Korean dictator&#160;<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/kim-jong-uns-ex-girlfriend-reportedly-executed-2013-8#ixzz2pKdm8M3P%20">executed</a>&#160;his ex-girlfriend by firing squad.&#160;</span></p>

They have also ruled out bird flu, influenza and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, among other potential causes. Officials say there is no evidence yet that it has spread from human to human.</p><p class="video-fallback-line-1">We apologize, but this video has failed to load.</p> <p><ins>Try refreshing your browser, or</ins></p> <p><a href="https://ottawacitizen.com/tag/video-centre" target="_blank" title="Link to Video Centre">tap here to see other videos from our team</a>.</p> <p><del>Try refreshing your browser, or</del></p><h5 class="control-heading"><del></del></h5><p class="control-heading--max"><del>Canadian officials closely monitoring mysterious virus based in China</del></p><del> </del><p class="control-heading--min"><del>Back to video</del></p> <p>But the world is watching closely.

Those changes include new and improved systems in Canadian provinces and territories to “identify, prevent and control the spread of serious infectious diseases into and within Canada.”</ins></p></section><section class="ad"><h2 class="visually-hidden"><ins>Advertisement</ins></h2><p class="ad__label__center"><ins>Story continues below</ins></p><p class="placeholder-inner"><ins>This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.</ins></p></section><section class="article-content"><h2 class="visually-hidden"><ins>Article content continued</ins></h2><p><ins>Post-SARS protections also include a global public health intelligence monitoring system, which scans the world’s open source media, in addition to international collaboration and information sharing across Canada, said Morrissette.</ins></p><p><ins>“The Canadian public health laboratory system is well-equipped to detect serious infectious diseases,” he added.</ins></p><p><ins>Other post-SARS changes include screening patients coming into emergency rooms for infectious diseases and having rooms designed to contain infectious patients.</ins></p><p><ins>Those kinds of initiatives are positive, said Drummond, but do not overcome the lack of space in hospitals.</ins></p></section><section class="ad"><h2 class="visually-hidden"><ins>Advertisement</ins></h2><p class="ad__label__center"><ins>Story continues below</ins></p><p class="placeholder-inner"><ins>This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.</ins></p></section><section class="article-content"><h2 class="visually-hidden"><ins>Article content continued</ins></h2><p><ins>“I would worry greatly that the best laid plans of mice and men are going to be scuppered because we do not have bed capacity.”</ins></p><p><ins>Hospitals are so overcrowded that Drummond said he could foresee military tents having to be set up in some hospital parking lots to deal with surge capacity if Ontario was hit by a serious pandemic.</ins></p><p><ins>In order to have safe occupancy rates and allow for busier periods, Drummond said hospitals should be operating around 85 per cent capacity most of the time. But in Ontario, most hospitals are closer to 100 per cent capacity or higher. In Ottawa, that has had a cascading impact on ambulances, which have been forced to repeatedly declare Code Zero, meaning no ambulances are available, because paramedics are waiting for patients to be admitted.</ins></p></section><section class="ad"><h2 class="visually-hidden"><ins>Advertisement</ins></h2><p class="ad__label__center"><ins>Story continues below</ins></p><p class="placeholder-inner"><ins>This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.</ins></p></section><section class="article-content"><h2 class="visually-hidden"><ins>Article content continued</ins></h2><p><ins>“The Code Zeroes for ambulances are bad now.

<p><p>We read that &#8220;the Palestinians want to establish a state in East Jerusalem.&#8221; Well I want to play quarterback for the Green Bay Packers.</p></p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<p><br></p></p>
<p>
<p>I have as much right to this as they have to that, but they keep on&#160;wanting. There never was a Palestinian state in East Jerusalem or West Jerusalem.</p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<p>There never was a Palestinian state&#160;anywhere.&#160; Period.</p></p>
<p>
<p>End of&#160;<p class="IL_AD" id="IL_AD1">story</p>. If only that were so.</p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<p><br></p></p>
<p>
<p>Who were their kings? Who were their prophets throughout the Holy Land for some 3,800 years?&#160;</p></p>
<p>
<p><br></p></p>
<p>
<p>We can name thousands. It&#8217;s in the books. Can they name one?</p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<p><br></p></p>
<p>
<p>But they keep on wanting. They want and they want and they want and the news media keeps wanting it for them.</p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Like crybabies who want the other child&#8217;s shiny toy, they want what is not theirs, a thing that never belonged to them. So they go crying to Mommy, in the form of the European Union, or they throw a tantrum for help from their uncles at the United Nations.</p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<p><br></p></p>
<p>
<p>Always, though, they can count on the news media to share their unfounded grievances, entitlements and justifications.</p></p>
<span><a></a><p>This then becomes a grand scheme that I have termed the Media Jihad at length <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bathsheba-Deadline-Original-Novel-ebook/dp/B00NC0612G/ref=tmm_kin_title_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;sr=1-3&amp;qid=1419880884" target="_blank">here</a> on these pages.</p></span><p>
<p><br></p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<p>At the moment we are dealing specifically with a Media Jihad taking place at the&#160;Jewish Daily Forward, a leftist newspaper that has been post-Zionist from even before there were Zionists.&#160;</p></p>
<p>
<p><br></p></p>
<p>
<p>The website&#160;Israelly cool&#160;alerts us to what the coverage was like at&#160;The Forward&#160;attending to a particularly awful terrorist attack in Israel.</p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<p><br></p></p>
<p>
<p>A gorgeous 11-year-old became the latest victim of Islamist savagery. Her name is Ayala Shapira. She was set on fire in the most cowardly act imaginable.</p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Ayala was&#160;<p class="IL_AD" id="IL_AD5">riding</p>&#160;in the&#160;<p class="IL_AD" id="IL_AD3">car</p>&#160;with her father when the Arabs pounced on her with firebombs.&#160;</p></p>
<p>
<p><br></p></p>
<p>
<p>Yes (as in Scriptures) they choose the defenseless.</p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<p>As we prayed and continue to pray for Ayala&#8217;s speedy and complete recovery,&#160;The Forward&#160;ran with&#160;Reuters, so forget tears and compassion and an understanding heart. Forget a moment to pause and reflect. Instead they used the incident to rush their politics, always to the most extreme detriment of the Jewish State.</p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<p><br></p></p>
<p>
<p>The&#160;Israellycool&#160;website provides a more rounded&#160;<p class="IL_AD" id="IL_AD2">account</p>&#160;of how&#160;The Forward&#160;ran the&#160;story&#160;courtesy of&#160;Reuters.&#160;</p></p>
<p>
<p><br></p></p>
<p>
<p>But I choose to focus on two passages, this first:</p></p>
<p>
<p>&#160;&#8220;The [Israeli] military did not say whether the victims of the attack were settlers, who are bitterly resented by many Palestinians.&#8221;</p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<p><br></p></p>
<p>
<p>Really?&#160;</p></p>
<p>
<p><br></p></p>
<p>
<p>So if the victims were settlers, implies&#160;The Forward, it&#8217;s okay. It&#8217;s open season. Jews are fair&#160;<p class="IL_AD" id="IL_AD6">game</p>.&#160;</p></p>
<p>
<p><br></p></p>
<p>
<p>Moreover, this sort of gutter journalism does not trouble itself from separating fact from opinion, as in &#8220;bitterly resented by many Palestinians.&#8221;</p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Who asked for the editorial -- and can it be that the &#8220;bitter resentment&#8221; more accurately expresses the view of&#160;Reuters&#160;and&#160;The Forward?</p></p>
<p>
<p><br></p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Sounds like it when we read what comes next:</p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<p>&#8220;Palestinians want to establish a state in East Jerusalem, the occupied West&#160;<p class="IL_AD" id="IL_AD4">Bank</p>&#160;and Gaza, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war.&#8221;</p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<p><br></p></p>
<p>
<p>Notice each word dipped in poison &#8211; &#8220;occupied&#8221; and &#8220;captured&#8221; and the most reliable phrasing of all, &#8220;Palestinians WANT.&#8221;</p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<p><br></p></p>
<p>
<p>Yes they want and if Israel is reluctant to give them what they want the news media is always ready to be of service.</p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<p><br></p></p>
<p>
<p>I should have seen this coming. But I have not been following&#160;The Forward. I had to Google it up and then found something and someone I did know.</p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<p><br></p></p>
<p>
<p>Jane Eisner is&#160;The Forward&#8217;s&#160;editor-in-chief. It all came back as I remembered her years at the&#160;Philadelphia Inquirer. Along with cartoonist Tony Auth, she managed to infuriate and turn away thousands of fair-minded readers with her toxic anti-Israel rants.</p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<p><br></p></p>
<p>
<p>It is one thing to be left-wing. It is yet another thing to be anti-Zionist. But it is something else to be entirely ridiculous, point made by Eisner&#8217;s&#160;Forward.</p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Thanks.&#160;</p></p>
<p>
<p><br></p></p>
<p>
<p>Now, once again, we know where to go if we want news that is twisted, slanted, biased and laughable.</p></p>

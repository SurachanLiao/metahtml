Washington, Oct 29 (ANI): A lawmaker has said that North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un who went missing from public view for about six weeks, underwent a surgery to get a cyst removed from his left ankle.

Lawmaker Lee Cheol-woo said that South Korea's National Intelligence Service told lawmakers that a cyst was removed from the leader's ankle between May and June earlier and that cyst may have caused muscle nerve damage and impelled him to undergo ankle surgery between September and October.

According to CNN, Kim is believed to be recovering but the cyst could recur due to the leader's heavy schedule and obesity.

It was Kim's longest absence when he went missing from September 3 after he reportedly attended a concert with his wife.

Kim had also missed the 65th anniversary of the Workers' Party of North Korea when he went missing in September. (ANI)

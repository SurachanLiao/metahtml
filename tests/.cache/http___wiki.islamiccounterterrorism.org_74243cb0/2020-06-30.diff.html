This rogue clerical regime has managed to dominate a highly distinguished nation, Iran, and is using its vast resources and superb resourcefulness to inject fear and terror into our lives. One day the Velayat-e Faqih Regime tests long range ballistic missiles that could reach any of its neighbors and the next day threatens to close the Strait of Hormuz, stop the flow oil from the Arabian/Persian Gulf, and kill the global economy! One day Velayat labels the Arab Governments illegitimate and calls for their downfall and incites civil strife and the next day it ships more weapons to the ever-oppressive Hezbollah! One day Velayat calls for the liberation of Jerusalem and the next day it threatens to unleash tens of thousands of terror operatives on the nations of the world… And so on…

Velayat wants you to live "behind the cloak" of the so-called "Vice-Mahdi" (Farsi: "نائب امام عصر") and "Vali -e Faqih" Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, for Velayat considers all other leaders and ways of life to be false and illegitimate! To impose its oppressive rule over your personal life, the founder of the Velayat-e Faqih Regime, the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, has called for the establishment of the "Twenty-Million-Man Army" and the conquest of the world! His successor, Khamenei, is working literally day and night to make this goal a reality. Indeed, our world is facing a clear and present danger!

</p> <ol><li>Educating yourself about the severe problem and deadly threats. Velayat and its Hezbollah are a constant threat to the security of our world.</li> <li>Sharing with others what you have learned: Write, blog, tweet!</li> <li>Requiring your representative in Congress or Parliament to enact more special laws designed specifically to limit both the domestic and international threats of Velayat and Hezbollah.  Indeed, new anti-terrorism laws focused on the source of the threat are the most effective way to combat Velayat and Hezbollah: We believe that it is a must that we provide law enforcement agencies throughout the world with a greater edge in the global war against state-sponsored terrorism.</li> <li>Watch out for infiltration and identify Velayat and Hezbollah "sympathizers" and discretely notify law enforcement about their presence and location. These "sympathizers" might just be members of Sleeper Terror Cells: Give law enforcement the chance to assess the true level of danger, if any. Remember, these terror operatives are highly deceitful and trained in indoctrination and psychological manipulation. They are known to have converted citizens from every country and every religion to their strain of self-invented distorted Islamism.</li></ol> <p align="center" dir="rtl">لي كابلن يناقش مسألة علي مير (إشراق عابدي)

AMAN is a unique pioneering project and an unprecedented independent Islamic effort for combating terrorism in new and innovative ways. The AMAN websites are focused on building awareness about the threat to world Peace, especially the Middle East, by the oppressive Velayat-e Faqih Regime of Iran and the terrorist organization Hezbollah. We utilize the power of the Internet and technology to reach audiences throughout the Arabic-speaking MENA countries (i.e., the Middle East and North Africa). Our cultural language is one that can be clearly understood by the visitors of our online network. Our analysis is effective and our message is delivered by example.
</p> <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="WARNINGS">WARNINGS</span></h2> <p>WARNING: Sympathy for Hezbollah terrorism is not born in a vacuum. At the heart of every group of Hezbollah "sympathizers" there are undercover Hezbollah or Velayat-e Faqih Regime terror operatives indoctrinating and brainwashing them! By reporting the "sympathizers" to law enforcement, the investigators can quietly identify and track the alien terror operatives and their domestic and international handlers. When it comes to national security, have no doubt or hesitation — just say no to terrorism and make your country safer.
</p> <p>WARNING: The Islamic Counterterrorism Institute recognizes that the great peoples of Iran are ultimately the first oppressed victims of the clerical Velayat-e Faqih regime. Even the misguided Iranian youths who have been bewitched by the ideologues of Velayat are victims of mental intoxication and systemic brainwashing. As such we boldly warn against the usage of a shotgun approach while dealing with the great Iranian peoples — this only serves the schemes of Velayat, as it leads to the solidification of the support of its popular base. It is critical to recognize the distinction between the rogue mullah regime and both its willing and unwilling victims.

Here's Why.</h3><p class="SummaryCard_summary__3z5iX">Your Coronavirus Risk Is Even Higher in These States. Here's Why. COVID-19 has spread across the globe and has made its way into every state in the United States. However, some state numbers are astronomically higher than others—like Florida, which experts say could become the next epicenter. And one natural phenomenon may make your coronavirus risk even higher in certain states: wildfires. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the pandemic is "overlapping with the occurrence of wildfires" in the country. And the exposure to air pollutants that are within wildfire smoke can irritate your lungs, cause inflammation, alter your immune function, and increase your susceptibility to respiratory infections—including coronavirus.</p> <ins> Link: /news/0PODvFVn/your-coronavirus-risk-is-even-higher-in-these-states-heres-why </ins><p class="SummaryCard_actionItem__3y-0C SummaryCard_actionItemMobile__3C3IL"><ins>320</ins></p><a class="SummaryCard_actionItem__3y-0C" href="/news/0PODvFVn/your-coronavirus-risk-is-even-higher-in-these-states-heres-why"><p><ins>167</ins></p><ins> Link: /news/0PODvFVn/your-coronavirus-risk-is-even-higher-in-these-states-heres-why </ins></a><p tabindex="0" class="SocialMediaShareButton SocialMediaShareButton--facebook"><ins>Share</ins></p><p class="jsx-4103317667 n-paper SummaryCard_root__O-RVX"><ins></ins></p><p class="SummaryCard_header__2MRbt SummaryCard_defaultHeader__1wrpe"><ins><span>FiercePharma</span><span>|</span><span>7d</span></ins></p><a class="SummaryCard_wrapper__3GtTZ" href="/news/0PLRUgyg/fda-yanks-chloroquines-emergency-ok-after-data-show-it-doesnt-work-against-covid-19"><p class="SummaryCard_content__1IvEg"><ins></ins></p><h3 class="SummaryCard_title__3CZHF"><ins>FDA yanks chloroquine's emergency OK after data show it doesn't work against COVID-19</ins></h3><p class="SummaryCard_summary__3z5iX"><ins>It's been more than 2 months since President Donald Trump touted malaria drugs as a possible "game-changer" for coronavirus treatment, and the FDA quickly signed off on their emergency use during the pandemic.

The style&#160;connected to Anderson&#8217;s live-action work, with its quirky color tones and character designs.&#160;The animation in Isle of&#160;Dogs has clearly been even more refined to match his style. &#8230; <a href="https://www.moviebreakingnews.com/2018/03/isle-of-dogs-could-be-wes-andersons-masterpiece/" class="more-link">[Read more...] <span class="screen-reader-text">about &#8216;Isle of Dogs&#8217; Could Be Wes Anderson&#8217;s Masterpiece</span></a></p></article><article class="post-39638217 post type-post status-publish format-standard entry"><p>Jimmy Kimmel delivered a brutal set mocking Rep.

                              <strong>17. New Era Pinstripe Bowl</strong> <br><b>Teams:</b> Boston College (7-5) vs. Penn State (6-6) 
<br><br><b>When:</b> Saturday, Dec. 27, 4:30 p.m. (ESPN)
<br><br><b>Where:</b> New York, N.Y.
<br><br><b>Why to watch:</b> While they finished just 7-5, BC showed a propensity to rise to the occasion for big games, beating then ninth-ranked USC and nearly toppling both Clemson and Florida State. Meanwhile, the Nittany Lions took Ohio State to two overtimes before a heartbreaking loss. Both teams sport top-20 defenses, which should lead to an old-fashioned, low scoring game. Bonus: This has the best venue of any game this year -- Yankee Stadium.

                              <strong>19. Autozone Liberty Bowl</strong> <br><b>Teams:</b> Texas A&amp;M (7-5) vs. West Virginia (7-5)
<br><br><b>When:</b> Monday, Dec. 29, 2 p.m. (ESPN)
<br><br><b>Where:</b> Memphis, Tenn.
<br><br><b>Why to watch:</b> Both schools notched upsets over top-five programs, with A&amp;M toppling Auburn and WVU handing Baylor its lone defeat of the year. But missed opportunities in their other big games left each team with only seven wins. Both are capable of putting up big numbers, especially with Clint Trickett guiding the Mountaineers' ninth-ranked passing offense.

                              <strong>20. Russell Athletic Bowl</strong> <br><b>Teams:</b> Oklahoma (8-4) vs. #17 Clemson (9-3)
<br><br><b>When:</b> Monday, Dec. 29, 5:30 p.m. (ESPN)
<br><br><b>Where:</b> Orlando, Fla.
<br><br><b>Why to watch:</b> Once a top-five ranked team, the Sooners took TCU to the wire in Fort Worth and battled Kansas State to a one-point game, but were blown out in Norman by Baylor, then lost the Bedlam game in a stunning finish. They have the talent to compete with a Clemson squad that didn't beat a ranked opponent all year. But with a promising season derailed, will Trevor Knight and company show up?

                              <strong>21. Advocare V100 Texas Bowl</strong> <br><b>Teams:</b> Arkansas (6-6) vs. Texas (6-6)
<br><br><b>When:</b> Monday, Dec. 29, 9 p.m. (ESPN)
<br><br><b>Where:</b> Houston, Texas
<br><br><b>Why to watch:</b> While both teams are just 6-6, each is playing some of their best football of the year. With a Razorbacks defense that blanked two top-20 opponents in the final three weeks of the season and a UT offense that was held to 10 points or less four times, this game has the highest likelihood of producing a shutout in this year's bowl slate.

                              <strong>22. Franklin American Mortgage Music City Bowl</strong> <br><b>Teams:</b> Notre Dame (7-5) vs. #23 LSU (8-4)
<br><br><b>When:</b> Tuesday, Dec. 30, 3 p.m. (ESPN)
<br><br><b>Where:</b> Nashville, Tenn.
<br><br><b>Why to watch:</b> Notre Dame looked to be knocking on the door of the playoff picture before entering a death spiral that saw them drop five of their final six games. Their reward? A feisty LSU team with the nation's third-best scoring defense. Of course, the Tigers were nails at Death Valley (averaging less than 12 points per game allowed), but were a different team away from home (more than 25 PPG).

                              <strong>23. Belk Bowl</strong> <br><b>Teams:</b> #13 Georgia (9-3) vs. #21 Louisville (9-3)
<br><br><b>When:</b> Tuesday, Dec. 30, 6:30 p.m. (ESPN)
<br><br><b>Where:</b> Charlotte, N.C.
<br><br><b>Why to watch:</b> The first matchup of ranked teams come in&#8230;the Belk Bowl. It may be an underwhelming title -- and we may still not know exactly what Belk is, or what it does -- but the Dawgs crushed Auburn and the Cardinals won in South Bend, so both teams have bona fide resumes heading into what should be an entertaining matchup.                             
                            <p class="gallery_photo_credit">

                              <strong>24. Foster Farms Bowl</strong> <br><b>Teams:</b> Maryland (7-5) vs. Stanford (7-5)
<br><br><b>When:</b> Tuesday, Dec. 30, 10 p.m. (ESPN)
<br><br><b>Where:</b> Santa Clara, Calif.
<br><br><b>Why to watch:</b> Let's see, a 10 p.m. ET start against a power conference program playing less than 15 miles from campus? That's not an ideal setup for the Terps, who at +14 are the biggest underdog of the bowl season. Then again, Randy Edsall's crew was 5-1 away from College Park this year, with wins in Happy Valley and The Big House. Don't count them out yet.

                              <strong>25. Chick-Fil-A Peach Bowl</strong> <br><b>Teams:</b> #9 Ole Miss (9-3) vs. #6 TCU (11-1)
<br><br><b>When:</b> Wednesday, Dec. 31, 12:30 p.m. (ESPN)
<br><br><b>Where:</b> Atlanta, Ga.
<br><br><b>Why to watch:</b> Now we're talking. This clash of top-10 programs who each occupied a playoff spot at some point this year is a perfect start to the second-best day of games this year. TCU's second-ranked offense (46.8 points per game) runs into the Rebels' top scoring defense (13.8 PPG). The Horned Frogs (-3) will look to show the committee that they deserved a spot in the final four.

                              <strong>26. Vizio Fiesta Bowl</strong> <br><b>Teams:</b> #20 Boise State (11-2) vs. #10 Arizona (10-3)
<br><br><b>When:</b> Wednesday, Dec. 31, 4 p.m. (ESPN)
<br><br><b>Where:</b> Glendale, Ariz.
<br><br><b>Why to watch:</b> Have you ever seen Boise State in a big bowl game? The Broncos have only produced two of the most exciting college football games of all time. The hook and ladder. The Statue of Liberty play. On-field marriage proposals. Miss this game at your own peril.

                              <strong>27. Capital One Orange Bowl</strong> <br><b>Teams:</b> #7 Mississippi State (10-2) vs. #12 Georgia Tech (10-3)
<br><br><b>When:</b> Wednesday, Dec. 31, 8 p.m. (ESPN)
<br><br><b>Where:</b> Miami, Fla.
<br><br><b>Why to watch:</b> Georgia Tech was the biggest surprise in college football this year outside of TCU, riding the nation's third-best rushing attack to a road upset of in-state SEC rival Georgia and a near-takedown of Florida State in the ACC title game. Mississippi State, meanwhile, saw its big wins (Texas A&amp;M, Auburn) diminished as the season progressed, then lost to both Alabama and Ole Miss late to fall out of the playoff picture. Can the Yellow Jackets expose the SEC again?

                              <strong>28. Outback Bowl</strong> <br><b>Teams:</b> #19 Auburn (8-4) vs. #18 Wisconsin (10-3)
<br><br><b>When:</b> Thursday, Jan. 1, 12 p.m. (ESPN2)
<br><br><b>Where:</b> Tampa, Fla.
<br><br><b>Why to watch:</b> While this matchup probably looked better at the beginning of the year than it does now, both teams have registered a pair of top-20 wins. Wisconsin rode Heisman finalist Melvin Gordon through their Big 10 slate, but will the feature back be able to carry the Badgers against the Tigers, or did Ohio State expose Wisconsin's weaknesses in that unsightly conference title game?

                              <strong>29. Goodyear Cotton Bowl Classic</strong> <br><b>Teams:</b> #8 Michigan State (10-2) vs. #5 Baylor (11-1)
<br><br><b>When:</b> Thursday, Jan. 1, 12:30 p.m. (ESPN)
<br><br><b>Where:</b> Arlington, Texas
<br><br><b>Why to watch:</b> Baylor gets its chance to make the committee look bad for excluding them, drawing a top-10 Michigan State squad in a virtual home game. The Spartans rank 7th in points scored and 12th in points against, but struggled the most this year in a 19-point loss in Eugene, against an Oregon squad that operates very similarly to the Bears. Baylor has the top scoring offense in the nation and has not scored less than 27 points in any game. Can Sparty keep up?

<br><br><b>When:</b> Thursday, Jan. 1, 1 p.m. (ABC)
<br><br><b>Where:</b> Orlando, Fla.
<br><br><b>Why to watch:</b> The networks probably wish they could swap coverage for this game. Easily the weakest of the New Year's Day bowls, this matchup features Mizzou and Minnesota squads that combined for a grand total of zero wins against teams that finished in the Top 25. But hey, you need something to watch during the commercial breaks of Baylor-Michigan State, which figure to be plentiful.

<br><br><b>When:</b> Thursday, Jan. 1, 5 p.m. (ESPN)
<br><br><b>Where:</b> Pasadena, Calif.
<br><br><b>Why to watch:</b> The Grandaddy of Them All may be just a semifinal game this year, but it's still a dandy. The last two Heisman Trophy winners will square off as Oregon looks to finally break through and vanquish America's villain, the Florida State Seminoles. Vegas has the Ducks as nine-point favorites, but if the Ducks' defense can force Jameis Winston into mistakes, Marcus Mariota and company -- who haven't won a game by fewer than 25 points since Oct. 11 -- may deliver an even bigger knockout blow.

<br><br><b>When:</b> Thursday, Jan. 1, 8:30 p.m. 
<br><br><b>Where:</b> New Orleans, La.
<br><br><b>Why to watch:</b> Saban vs. Meyer. One legacy program against another. As if you needed any additional reason to watch a national semifinal game, the prospect of seeing one of the most reviled programs in the nation knocked out should make nearly every college football fan happy. Did Ohio State deserve to make the playoff? Prove it. (Courtesy: Allstate Sugar Bowl

<br><br><b>When:</b> Friday, Jan. 2, 12 p.m. (ESPN)
<br><br><b>Where:</b> Fort Worth, Texas
<br><br><b>Why to watch:</b> While it's odd to take a step back in terms of important bowl games after New Year's Day, games like this function like the NIT between the first two weekends of March Madness. There's still football on TV. That's all you can really ask for, right?

<br><br><b>When:</b> Friday, Jan. 2, 3:20 p.m. (ESPN)
<br><br><b>Where:</b> Jacksonville, Fla.
<br><br><b>Why to watch:</b> The best sponsor name of any bowl this year comes buried in the post-New Year's purgatory of two middling major-conference programs. Iowa lost at home to Iowa State and the Hawkeyes' most impressive win this year was&#8230;at Pitt? Maybe? Tennessee won in overtime at South Carolina. The Vols also lost at home to Florida, 10-9.

<br><br><b>When:</b> Friday, Jan. 2, 6:45 p.m. (ESPN)
<br><br><b>Where:</b> San Antonio, Texas
<br><br><b>Why to watch:</b> Bill Snyder is the man. He is, perhaps, the only reason K-State isn't the laughingstock of the Big 12, building up the program from nothing, retiring, then coming back to do it all over again. His overachieving Wildcats take on the underachieving Bruins and Brett Hundley, who probably should have lost at Virginia, at home against Texas and at Cal. UCLA is clearly more talented, but can Snyder coach his way to a win?

<br><br><b>When:</b> Friday, Jan. 2, 10:15 p.m. (ESPN)
<br><br><b>Where:</b> Tempe, Ariz.
<br><br><b>Why to watch:</b> You may have gone a little too hard on Wednesday night. It's OK; we understand. No need to try to go out again on Friday. There's football on. No, it's not good football. Yes, Oklahoma is the only ranked team (and not ranked anymore) that either team beat this year. Just let it wash over you; let it put you to sleep.

<br><br><b>When:</b> Saturday, Jan. 3, 12 p.m. (ESPN)
<br><br><b>Where:</b> Birmingham, Ala. (where else?)
<br><br><b>Why to watch:</b> More football! Hey, East Carolina gave us one of the more fun blowouts of the season when they hung 70 on UNC. The Pirates sport the second-best passing offense in the game, so at least we can expect some fireworks. With Will Muschamp already out the door at Florida, who knows what to expect out of the Gators?

<br><br><b>When:</b> Sunday, Jan. 4, 9 p.m. (ESPN)
<br><br><b>Where:</b> Mobile, Ala.
<br><br><b>Why to watch:</b> Bet you didn't know this game existed. Heck, you might not even have known that Arkansas State was an FBS school. This matchup has all the allure you would expect from a game scheduled for 9 p.m. on a Sunday. But it's your last vestige of college football before the eight-day break that leads into the title game.

<br><br><b>Why to watch:</b> This is what we all wanted, right? The culmination of a full season of games, picking the top four teams and letting them battle each other to the finish. No matter which two teams advance, it promises to be a well-watched, exciting matchup. Enjoy.

<br><br><b>When:</b> Saturday, Dec. 20, 2:20 p.m. (ESPN)
<br><br><b>Where:</b> Albuquerque, N.M.
<br><br><b>Why to watch:</b> The Miners very nearly beat Texas Tech (30-26) early in the season, and the Aggies knocked off BYU to hand the Cougars their first loss of the year, a 15-point win on the road.

<br><br><b>When:</b> Saturday, Dec. 20, 3:30 p.m. (ABC)
<br><br><b>Where:</b> Las Vegas, Nev.
<br><br><b>Why to watch:</b> The best matchup of the opening day of bowl season features a Utah squad that beat UCLA and USC against a Rams team that reeled off nine straight wins before a heartbreaking loss as time expired at Air Force in their final regular-season game.

<br><br><b>When:</b> Saturday, Dec. 20, 5:45 p.m. (ESPN)
<br><br><b>Where:</b> Boise, Idaho
<br><br><b>Why to watch:</b> It's always fun to watch teams compete on the frozen blue turf in Boise. Will Air Force -- which handed Boise State its lone conference loss -- try to exploit the advantage the Broncos often do and wear matching blue uniforms?

<br><br><b>When:</b> Saturday, Dec. 20, 9:15 p.m. (ESPN)
<br><br><b>Where:</b> Montgomery, Ala.
<br><br><b>Why to watch:</b> Game-wise, there isn't much here (South Alabama gave Navy a scare&#8230;that's about as good as it gets), but it'll be worth it to see if whoever gets stuck broadcasting this one can get through the title "Raycom Media Camellia Bowl" without stuttering.

<br><br><b>When:</b> Monday, Dec. 22, 2 p.m. (ESPN)
<br><br><b>Where:</b> Miami, Fla.
<br><br><b>Why to watch:</b> While BYU no doubt was hoping for a more prestigious bowl after a 4-0 start that included a trouncing of Texas in Austin, they're probably happy to be in South Beach in late December. The Cougars draw a stout Memphis defense that hasn't allowed more than 20 points since mid-October, raking fifth in the nation in points against.

<br><br><b>When:</b> Tuesday, Dec. 23, 6 p.m. (ESPN)
<br><br><b>Where:</b> Boca Raton, Fla.
<br><br><b>Why to watch:</b> This should be a terrific game between two top-flight mid-major programs. Marshall was one devastating 67-66 overtime loss from an undefeated season, while Northern Illinois survived the MACtion and trashed Bowling Green in the conference title game to set up this high-powered matchup.

<br><br><b>When:</b> Tuesday, Dec. 23, 9:30 p.m. (ESPN)
<br><br><b>Where:</b> San Diego, Calif.
<br><br><b>Why to watch:</b> Aside from the local Navy angle, this game is a really well thought-out matchup of two teams that enjoy great support in sunny Southern California. The strong naval presence in San Diego makes this a home matchup for both teams and should sport the most goodwill of any contest this bowl season.

<br><br><b>When:</b> Wednesday, Dec. 24, 12 p.m. (ESPN)
<br><br><b>Where:</b> Nassau, Bahamas
<br><br><b>Why to watch:</b> Do you want to live vicariously through two Midwestern teams enjoying the warm, island breeze? If that doesn't do it for you, enjoy what promises to be a high-scoring affair, as Western Kentucky features the number-three passing offense and number six-scoring offense in the country.

<br><br><b>When:</b> Wednesday, Dec. 24, 8 p.m. (ESPN)
<br><br><b>Where:</b> Honolulu, Hawaii
<br><br><b>Why to watch:</b> Give Fresno State and Rice credit -- each played a tough non-conference slate. But neither team beat anybody. That makes the chance for a bowl-bound team to finish with eight losses perhaps the most compelling storyline in this one.

<br><br><b>When:</b> Friday, Dec. 26, 1 p.m. (ESPN)
<br><br><b>Where:</b> Dallas, Texas
<br><br><b>Why to watch:</b> After a day off for Christmas, the Big 10 gets its first test of the bowl season. Tech gave Marshall a scare and trounced bowl-goers UTEP and Western Kentucky. There's a reason the Bulldogs are six-point favorites over the Fighting Illini.

<br><br><b>When:</b> Friday, Dec. 26, 4:30 p.m. (ESPN)
<br><br><b>Where:</b> Detroit, Mich.
<br><br><b>Why to watch:</b> The Tar Heels have been one of the most enigmatic teams in college football this season. They beat decent San Diego State, Georgia Tech and Duke teams and took Notre Dame to the wire. They were also blown out by East Carolina, Miami and N.C. State. Tune in to see which Carolina team shows up against The State University of New Jersey.

<br><br><b>Where:</b> St. Petersburg, Fla.
<br><br><b>Why to watch:</b> Yes, Bitcoin is sponsoring a bowl game. Unfortunately, neither team involved won any games of note this year, although N.C. State was the first in a line of many to give Florida State a scare. No word yet on whether the winner will receive an actual trophy or merely online credit.

<br><br><b>When:</b> Saturday, Dec. 27, 1 p.m. (ESPN)
<br><br><b>Where:</b> Annapolis, Md.
<br><br><b>Why to watch:</b> These teams had a pair of shared opponents this year: Ohio State and East Carolina. Virginia Tech beat the Buckeyes in Columbus, only to lose at home to the Pirates the next week. Meanwhile, the Bearcats were handled by Ohio State, but won a high-scoring thriller over East Carolina in Cincinnati. The transitive property of football tells us nothing, other than that the closest bowl to D.C. should be a close game.

                              <strong>15. Hyundai Sun Bowl</strong> <br><b>Teams:</b> #15 Arizona State (9-3) vs. Duke (9-3)
<br><br><b>When:</b> Saturday, Dec. 27, 2 p.m. (CBS)
<br><br><b>Where:</b> El Paso, Texas
<br><br><b>Why to watch:</b> The Sun Devils had as many quality wins as any team not in the Playoff, beating USC, Stanford, Utah and Notre Dame, but missed a shot at the PAC-12 title after a tough loss to rival Arizona. They should be a tough matchup for Duke, which will need its 20th-ranked scoring defense to be at its best to keep this one close.

                              <strong>16. Duck Commander Independence Bowl</strong> <br><b>Teams:</b> Miami (6-6) vs. South Carolina (6-6) 
<br><br><b>When:</b> Saturday, Dec. 27, 3:30 p.m. (ABC)
<br><br><b>Where:</b> Shreveport, La.
<br><br><b>Why to watch:</b> In the first of two bowl matchups without a winning team, the free-falling Hurricanes look to end their season strong against an underachieving South Carolina squad that some saw as a dark horse playoff contender prior to the season. Despite their SEC roots, the Gamecocks' opening line of -1.5 has flipped to +3 as the bettors seem to like Miami. Did we mention this game is sponsored by Duck Commander? Well, it is.

                              <strong>18. National University Holiday Bowl</strong> <br><b>Teams:</b> Nebraska (9-3) vs. #24 USC (8-4)
<br><br><b>When:</b> Saturday, Dec. 27, 8 p.m. (ESPN)
<br><br><b>Where:</b> San Diego, Calif.
<br><br><b>Why to watch:</b> Nebraska and USC had very similar seasons, largely beating the teams they were expected to beat and losing to higher-ranked opponents. But Trojans quarterback Cody Kessler dismantled Notre Dame in USC's final game and is someone to keep an eye on as an emerging pro prospect.

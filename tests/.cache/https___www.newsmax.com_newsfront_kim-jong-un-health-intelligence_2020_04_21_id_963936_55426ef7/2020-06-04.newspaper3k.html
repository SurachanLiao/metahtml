<div><p>If reports that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's health is in grave condition&#160;are true, the U.S. government has a plan for when he dies, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/us-has-extensive-contingency-plans-kim-jong-un-death-sources" target="_blank">Fox News</a> reports.</p>

<p>Conflicting reports about the leader&#8217;s health have emerged and sent leaders to discuss "extensive contingency plans" the government has in place, an intelligence source told the news network on Tuesday.&#160;</p>

<p>The official said there will likely be a humanitarian crisis that could include millions of people facing starvation and a mass exodus of North Korean refugees into China.&#160;</p>

<p>The source said the government's&#160;plan involves heavy reliance on China to step in and manage the situation.&#160;</p>

<p>National Security Adviser Robert O&#8217;Brien told reporters at the White House on Tuesday&#160;that the administration is &#8220;watching reports closely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are monitoring these reports very closely and as you know North Korea is a very closed society, there is not a free press there, they are parsimonious with the information they provide on many things, including the health of Kim Jong Un,&#8221; O&#8217;Brien said.&#160;&#8220;People should know we have a great intelligence community, the president, vice president, Secretary Pompeo, Secretary Esper, General Milley, we&#8217;ve got a lot of watchtowers during this coronavirus crisis making sure America is safe, whether it&#8217;s from a virus or adversary abroad, so we are keeping a close eye on North Korea as we are in other parts of the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>Reports about Kim&#8217;s health have been circulating since he was absent from North Korea&#8217;s most important holiday, the birthday of his grandfather Kim Il&#160;Sung on April 15.</p>

The report said Kim has been in bad health because he smokes and is overweight.</p>

<h2>Could Historic Summit End With Supreme Leader&#8217;s Assassination?</h2>
<p>About a year ago, North Korea <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/05/north-korea-accuses-cia-biochemical-plot-kill-kim-jong-un" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accused the American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)</a> of attempting to assassinate its supreme leader <a href="https://mustsharenews.com/dear-donald/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kim Jong-un</a>.</p>
<p>The hermit state issued a statement that claimed that Americans had bribed a <a href="https://mustsharenews.com/vivian-balakrishnan-pyongyang/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">North Korean</a> citizen to kill Mr Kim, 34.</p>
<p>Possible locations for the assassination?</p>
<p>The mausoleum where Mr Kim Jong-un&#8217;s father and grandfather lie, or at one of Pyongyang&#8217;s many military parades.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to see why the North Koreans came to that conclusion about the CIA.</p>
<p>The agency has been associated with a long list of covert assassinations of political leaders &#8211; its name was floated at the death of former <a href="https://www.outlookindia.com/magazine/story/finally-all-fingers-point-to-anbsp-foreign-hand/205868" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi</a>&#160;as well as a string of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/may/05/cia-long-history-kill-leaders-around-the-world-north-korea" target="_blank" rel="noopener">left-leaning leaders in the 1970s and 1980s</a>.</p>
<p>And US-North Korea tensions were at an all-time high last year.</p>
<p>First there was the murder of Mr Kim Jong-nam at Kuala Lumpur International Airport.</p> 
<p>Then there was Mr Trump&#8217;s infamous &#8220;fire and fury&#8221; speech to the United Nations?</p>
<p>Given the history between the two states, it&#160;would be foolish for Mr Kim&#8217;s administration to take next week&#8217;s meeting with the Americans lightly.</p>
<h3>Will Singapore save the day?</h3>
<p>Making the 7-hour flight to Singapore in itself is a risk, since this would be the furthest Mr Kim has travelled since appointed Supreme Leader in 2011.</p>
<p>Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-06/trump-wants-kim-to-commit-to-disarmament-timetable-in-singapore" target="_blank" rel="noopener">writes</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>US officials believe Kim is extremely worried about security at the summit and is fearful of assassination attempts, according to two people familiar with the matter.</p></blockquote>
<p>For its part, Singapore is doing its best to keep both Mr Kim and Mr Trump safe.</p>
<p>From snipers atop buildings to public security orders, we&#8217;re pulling out all the stops to ensure next week&#8217;s summit goes off without a hitch.</p>
<p>As AsiaOne <a href="http://www.asiaone.com/singapore/khukris-and-assault-rifles-singapores-gurkhas-guard-trump-kim-summit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">put it</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>Elite Singaporean police, including its Gurkha Contingent, will be securing the summit venue, roads and hotels, according to diplomats familiar with VIP security in the island state.</p></blockquote>
<h3>American power all around</h3>
<p>But that appears to be not enough for Mr Kim for one simple reason.</p>
<p>Business Insider <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-06/trump-wants-kim-to-commit-to-disarmament-timetable-in-singapore" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> that Mr Kim is especially afraid of being assassinated&#160;on his way to Singapore.</p>
<p>Very afraid.</p>
<p>And he has reason to be.</p> 
<p>Just take a look at the map of the region:</p>
<p>a<a href="https://news.antiwar.com/2012/06/23/us-reconstructs-former-military-bases-across-asia-pacific/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></p>
<p>These figures were reported by the BBC in 2012 but they gave a good indicator of the strength of the American military muscle in the Asia-Pacific region.</p>
<p>If American intelligence did want to take Mr Kim down, there&#8217;s no shortage of bases for them to operate out of.</p>
<h3>The China syndrome</h3>
<p>Mr Kim&#8217;s flight is likely to go overland over China as it approaches Singapore.</p>
<p>But the world&#8217;s most-populated nation appears to be salty about not being invited to the historic summit.</p>
<p>In an editorial this week, state mouthpiece&#160;Global Times&#160;<a href="https://news.sina.com.cn/c/nd/2018-06-04/doc-ihcmurvh8091174.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>Without China, a peace declaration will never replace the Korean Armistice Agreement on the technical level.</p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/10165796" target="_blank" rel="noopener">armistice ended hostilities</a> between North and South Korea after the 3-year Korean War.</p>
<p>China was a signatory then, along with North Korea and the United States.</p>
<p>Could Chinese anger at not being invited prompt an assassination?</p>
<h3>Will Kim Jong-nam&#8217;s killer return?</h3>
<p>The identity of Mr Kim Jong-nam&#8217;s killer is still unknown.</p>
<p>Could he/she return to notoriety by pulling off an assassination of Mr Kim Jong-un?</p>
<p>Chemical weapons proved to be an effective killer the last time &#8211; something we&#8217;re not sure even the best security forces can protect the North Korean leader from.</p>
<h3>An unlikely finale</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s unlikely that months of talks between North Korea and the United States will end with Mr Kim&#8217;s assassination.</p>
<p>Still, if there&#8217;s one thing we can learn from history is to always expect the unexpected.</p>
<p>And if there&#8217;s one thing we can learn from Hollywood: if it happened <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kP8O-MOqmcw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a movie</a>, it could happen in real life.</p>

Note: Consider this a little impeachment reprieve for those who are exhausted from talking about it.



I have written a number of posts concerning the seeming-rise of charlatans and grifters in Evangelical church pulpits since the ascendancy of Trump. The Church has always had wolves in its midst, this is nothing new. The pulpit provides a uniquely tempting opportunity for the corrupt to wield power and influence over vulnerable, lost souls. The corrupt shepherds dressed in sheep‚Äôs clothing, who deign to instruct others on how they should live, are practiced in the art of deception and can smoothly recite longed-for words of persuasion as they successfully manipulate the naive and the willing. It‚Äôs a dangerous game, this wolf playing good shepherd. Eventually their con will come to an end, and they will have to answer for their perversion of God and Scripture, and for preying on the saints. Until that time though, the ‚Äúmission‚Äù remains: If the money is good, let the good times keep roll. All in the name of Christ, of course.

With that, this is Paula White, President Trump‚Äôs spiritual advisor and Special Adviser to the White House Faith and Opportunity Initiative . She is also known as the God Whisperer. I‚Äôll just say that if she is actually advising Trump on spiritual matters, it could explain a whole lot.

We interrupt that which has been deployed to hurt the church in this season, that which has been deployed to hurt this nation. In the name of Jesus, forgive us for our sins. Come on, I need you guys to pray. We cancel every surprise from the witchcraft [sic] and the marine kingdom ‚Äî any hex, any spell, any witchcraft, any spirit of control, any Jezebel, anything that the enemy desires through spells, through witchcraft, through any way that is manipulation, demonic manipulation. We curse that. We break it, according to the word of God. In the name of Jesus, we come against the marine kingdom, we come against the animal kingdom, the woman who rides upon the waters. We break the power, in the name of Jesus, and we declare that any strange winds, any strange winds that have been sent to hurt the church, sent against this nation, sent against our president, sent against myself, sent against others ‚Äî we break it by the superior blood of Jesus right now. In the name of Jesus, we arrest every infirmity, affliction, fatigue, weariness, weakness, fear, sickness, any self-righteousness, any self-serving action, God. Let pride fall, let pride fall, let pride fall, let pride fall, in the name of Jesus. We command all satanic pregnancies to miscarry right now. We declare that anything that‚Äôs been conceived in satanic wombs, that it will miscarry, it will not be able to carry forth any plan of destruction, any plan of harm ‚Ä¶

White, who leads a congregation of 10,000 worshipers at the New Destiny Christian Center megachurch, attempted to clarify what she meant when she prayed for women to miscarry babies in their um, [double-checks notes]‚Ä¶‚Äùsatanic wombs‚Äù:

That is- any plans to hurt people. Let's be clear what is really going on‚Ä¶ this is a disingenuous attempt to use words out of context for political gain. I will just keep praying! ‚Äî Paula White-Cain (@Paula_White) January 26, 2020

So calling out White‚Äôs crazy ‚Äúsatanic womb‚Äù mumbo-jumbo is nothing but a disingenuous attempt to use words out of context for political gain‚Ä¶

For reference, here is Ephesians 6:12 NASB:

For our struggle is not against [a]flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places.

Yet more evidence of disturbed Trump-supporting pastors who have deified the President as if he were a co-equal with the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, is Evangelical pastor Rodney Howard-Browne. Howard-Browne was so upset over John Bolton‚Äôs claims about Trump and the Ukraine in his yet-to-be-released memoir, ‚ÄúThe Room Where it Happens,‚Äù that he launched an attack on the former national security advisor:

I have no respect for someone who is disloyal to the President and loyal to deep state !!! No respect! No respect at all ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ what a globalist sellout! üôÑ ‚Äî Rodney Howard-Browne (@rhowardbrowne) January 28, 2020

When we are fighting for the republic, endeavoring to save it from a deep state coup, this ‚Äúclown‚Äù walrus ‚Äì Warhawk Bolton just needs to just return to the deep state ocean he swam out of! ‚Äî Rodney Howard-Browne (@rhowardbrowne) January 28, 2020

‚ÄúYou are a slime ball of the highest order ‚Ä¶. I should have knocked your sorry butt through the door of the Oval Office into the rose garden when I saw you. I would have gladly been arrested ‚Ä¶. what a Benedict Arnold ‚Ä¶.. I am glad you were fired !!!!!‚Äù Howard-Browne tweeted Monday. ‚ÄúI have no respect for someone who is disloyal to the President and loyal to deep state !!! No respect! No respect at all ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ what a globalist sellout!‚Äù he added.

As if that weren‚Äôt enough, Howard-Browne also tweeted:

‚ÄúWWJD: he would have made a whip and beat the crap out of him!!!!‚Äù

Apparently this was a tweet too far for Howard-Browne, as it seems that he has since deleted the tweet.

I am reminded of this gem from David French, as he discussed the Evangelical response to *any* political leader:

The proper Evangelical position toward any president is not hard to articulate, though it is exceedingly difficult to hold to, especially in polarized times when one party seems set on limiting religious liberty and zealously defending abortion: We should pray for presidents, critique them when they‚Äôre wrong, praise them when they‚Äôre right, and never, ever impose partisan double standards. We can‚Äôt ever forget the importance of character, the necessity of our own integrity, and the power of the prophetic witness. In other words, Evangelicals can never take a purely transactional approach to politics. We are never divorced from our transcendent purpose, which always trumps political expediency. In scripture, prophets confronted leaders about their sin. They understood a core truth, one clearly articulated in the Southern Baptist Convention‚Äôs 1998 Resolution on Moral Character of Public Officials: ‚ÄúTolerance of serious wrong by leaders sears the conscience of the culture, spawns unrestrained immorality and lawlessness in the society, and surely results in God‚Äôs judgment.‚Äù All too many of our nation‚Äôs Evangelical leaders haven‚Äôt just ‚Äútolerated‚Äù serious wrongdoing by Trump, they‚Äôve rationalized and minimized it.

WWJD, you ask?? He‚Äôd tell White, Howard-Browne, and other false prophets, grifters, and liars misrepresenting him in the Evangelical church to knock this shit off right now. (See 2 Peter.) He would also remind believers that He has already made it very clear that they are to watch out for those who cause divisions and create obstacles contrary to the doctrine that you have been taught; avoid them. For such persons do not serve our Lord Christ, but their own appetites, and by smooth talk and flattery they deceive the hearts of the naive. Time for those sitting in the pews to

wise up.

Fox-hunting photos decorate the walls in a room full of books. A fire is burning. And downstairs, a group of liberal white women have gathered around a long wooden table to admit how racist they are.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>“Recently, I have been driving around, seeing a black person, and having an assumption that they are up to no good,” says Alison Gubser. “Immediately after I am like, that’s no good! This is a human, just doing their thing. Why do I think that?”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>This is Race to Dinner. A white woman volunteers to host a dinner in her home for seven other white women – often strangers, perhaps acquaintances. (Each dinner costs $2,500, which can be covered by a generous host or divided among guests.) A frank discussion is led by co-founders Regina Jackson, who is black, and Saira Rao, who identifies as Indian American. They started Race to Dinner to challenge liberal white women to accept their racism, however subconscious. “If you did this in a conference room, they’d leave,” Rao says. “But wealthy white women have been taught never to leave the dinner table.”</ins></p></blockquote><ins> </ins><p><ins>These moneyed, white liberal women belong to a select group of malleable, non-independent thinking individuals. A group which notably excludes men and Trump-supporting women:</ins></p><ins> </ins><blockquote><p><ins>Rao and Jackson believe white, liberal women are the most receptive audience because they are open to changing their behavior. They don’t bother with the 53% of white women who voted for Trump. White men, they feel, are similarly a lost cause. “White men are never going to change anything. If they were, they would have done it by now,” Jackson says.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>White women, on the other hand, are uniquely placed to challenge racism because of their proximity to power and wealth, Jackson says. “If they don’t hold these positions themselves, the white men in power are often their family, friends and partners.”</ins></p></blockquote><ins> </ins><p><ins>I simply lack the energy to do any analysis of this report.  Yet given how painfully self-serving the leaders of Race to Dinner are, and the deep insecurity and neediness of its  attendees, there’s really not much to say.  Because honestly, the real issue with Race to Dinner is as plain as  the problematic white nose on your face…</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>–Dana</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="feedback"><ins><a href="http://patterico.com/jury/2020/02/03/privileged-white-liberal-women-shell-out-big-bucks-to-admit-they-are-racist/#respond">Comments (0) Link: http://patterico.com/jury/2020/02/03/privileged-white-liberal-women-shell-out-big-bucks-to-admit-they-are-racist/#respond </a> </ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="post" id="post-7767"><ins></ins></p><h3 class="storytitle"><ins><a href="http://patterico.com/jury/2020/02/03/gop-senator-warns-joe-biden-if-youre-elected-republicans-might-immediately-push-to-impeach-you/" rel="bookmark">GOP Senator Warns Joe Biden: If You’re Elected, We Might Immediately Push To Impeach You Link: http://patterico.com/jury/2020/02/03/gop-senator-warns-joe-biden-if-youre-elected-republicans-might-immediately-push-to-impeach-you/ </a></ins></h3><ins> </ins><p class="meta"><ins>Filed under:              <a href="http://patterico.com/jury/category/uncategorized/" rel="category tag">Uncategorized Link: http://patterico.com/jury/category/uncategorized/ </a> —

There is something hypocritical about a party that has cried foul from the Trump impeachment get-go and blamed it on  everything from a witch hunt, to partisan politics, and as nothing more than an attempt to undue an election, and yet these same people are now warning a contender from the other side of the aisle that there could be a push for impeachment if he is elected.  Let’s call it weaponizing impeachment.  Whatever happened to letting the voters decide?  Whatever happened to doing the will of the people?  What about accusations that the impeachment effort was nothing more than an effort to overturn an election? Does all of that go out the window when the president is a Democrat?  Shouldn’t consistency and an equal-application of laws and processes be the goal rather than straight partisanship? Because if Biden becomes our next persident, then clearly the people will have spoken and made their will known.     </ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>–Dana</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="feedback"><ins><a href="http://patterico.com/jury/2020/02/03/gop-senator-warns-joe-biden-if-youre-elected-republicans-might-immediately-push-to-impeach-you/#respond">Comments (0) Link: http://patterico.com/jury/2020/02/03/gop-senator-warns-joe-biden-if-youre-elected-republicans-might-immediately-push-to-impeach-you/#respond </a> </ins></p><ins> </ins><h2><ins>2/2/2020</ins></h2><ins> </ins><p class="post" id="post-7763"><ins></ins></p><h3 class="storytitle"><ins><a href="http://patterico.com/jury/2020/02/02/sunday-music-francks-les-beatitudes/" rel="bookmark">Sunday Music: Franck’s “Les Béatitudes” Link: http://patterico.com/jury/2020/02/02/sunday-music-francks-les-beatitudes/ </a></ins></h3><ins> </ins><p class="meta"><ins>Filed under:              <a href="http://patterico.com/jury/category/uncategorized/" rel="category tag">Uncategorized Link: http://patterico.com/jury/category/uncategorized/ </a> —

Drives to the grave.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Christ:

</ins></p><blockquote><ins>Lyric Gillett, founder of Faces of Choice, accused Fox, which is broadcasting the game, of stringing her along after she began negotiating in July to air a powerful black-and-white ad featuring adults and children of different genders and ethnicities with one thing in common: they survived abortions.
</ins><p><ins>“In an era where we’re trying to give survivors a voice, whether that is through the #MeToo movement or on any number of issues, for some reason we deem survivors of abortion worthy of being ignored into oblivion,” Ms. Gillett said. “That, to me, is both ironic but also just appalling.”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>[…]</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>A Fox spokesperson said in an email that the network sold out its ad space early on for this year’s championship game in Miami between the Kansas City Chiefs and the San Francisco 49ers.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>“Super Bowl LIV sold out at a record pace this year, and unfortunately we were unable to accommodate Faces of Choice and other advertisers,” the spokesperson said.</ins></p></blockquote><ins> </ins><p><ins>Gillet pushed back against it being a simple matter of ad space being sold out:  </ins></p><ins> </ins><blockquote><p><ins>Ms. Gillett said there is more to the story. After providing storyboards and fielding questions about her organization, she said, she was told by the sales division that she would have a response from the legal department by a date in late November.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>“Some individuals had apparently expressed that the sales division was not happy with the way the legal division was going in terms of not providing answers,” Ms. Gillett said. “So an executive flew up from New York and we were told Friday to expect an answer by Monday. Monday came along, we got no answer, and then found out that night that they were sold out.”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>After that, she said, she asked Fox again to clear the ad in case other slots opened from cancellations for financial or content reasons. She said she was told in mid-December to expect an answer “very, very soon,” but the response never came.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>“It feels like the reason for that is they don’t want to, I guess in their minds, give a story that we were rejected,” Ms. Gillett said. “I guess that’s the reason behind it. Nothing else makes sense. But again, that’s unprofessional, and I don’t think that’s how they operate with other clients.”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>[…]</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Her biggest frustration lies in what she described as Fox’s lack of responsiveness. She said she also reached out to the Academy Awards about running an ad, and an ABC executive got back to her the same day to tell her that the show has a policy against advocacy spots.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>[…]</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>“Every time we would meet a stipulation or request, it would morph into something different. I would send an email saying, ‘What else do you need to get some type of answer?’ Even if it’s a ‘no,’ we don’t want a ‘no,’ but at least we can have an answer. We never got that answer,” Ms. Gillett said.</ins></p></blockquote><ins> </ins><p><ins>Note that there will be both <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/healthcare/strung-along-fox-declines-super-bowl-ad-on-botched-abortions">advocacy and political ads Link: https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/healthcare/strung-along-fox-declines-super-bowl-ad-on-botched-abortions </a> aired  during the Super Bowl, including  an ad focusing on police shootings of black people, an Audi ad <a href="https://adage.com/section/Super-Bowl-Commercial-Updates/792">focusing on environmentalism Link: https://adage.com/section/Super-Bowl-Commercial-Updates/792 </a>, an <a href="https://www.lifenews.com/2020/01/29/fox-allows-super-bowl-ad-with-drag-queens-wont-approve-pro-life-commercial/">ad Link: https://www.lifenews.com/2020/01/29/fox-allows-super-bowl-ad-with-drag-queens-wont-approve-pro-life-commercial/ </a> featuring drag queens Kim Chi and Miz Cracker from “RuPaul’s Drag Race,” about which LGBTQ marketing strategist Bob Witeck said:  </ins></p><ins> </ins><blockquote><p><ins>“For queer audiences, it is an art form and an ‘outsiders’ language,” Witek said of drag. “Reaching the Super Bowl means taking our language into every home in the nation and millions around the world.” </ins></p></blockquote><ins> </ins><p><ins>There will also be ads airing from Michael Bloomberg about gun violence, and President Trump  promoting the achievements of his first term in office.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins><a href="https://adage.com/article/special-report-super-bowl/fox-sells-out-its-super-bowl-liv-commercial-inventory/2218411?CSAuthResp=1%3A%3A5261840%3A0%3A24%3Asuccess%3A2701E41FACA2FE7A79AECB3E83A211B4">Ad Age Link: https://adage.com/article/special-report-super-bowl/fox-sells-out-its-super-bowl-liv-commercial-inventory/2218411?CSAuthResp=1%3A%3A5261840%3A0%3A24%3Asuccess%3A2701E41FACA2FE7A79AECB3E83A211B4 </a> confirmed that Fox Super Bowl ad units were sold out in November:  </ins></p><ins> </ins><blockquote><p><ins>After network honcho Seth Winter spent the better part of the last few weeks warning would-be clients that the last of the Big Game inventory was about to run out, the executive VP of sales for Fox Sports sold the last available spot on Friday. </ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Not a single commercial unit is being held back for the stragglers who may have been iffy on their creative or were simply hoping to hold out for a better price.

              6:32 pm                          </ins></p> <p>[guest post by Dana]</p> <p>Note: Consider this a little impeachment reprieve for those who are exhausted from talking about it. 
 
I have written a number of posts concerning the seeming-rise of charlatans and grifters in Evangelical church pulpits since the ascendancy of Trump.   The Church has always had  wolves in its midst, this is nothing new.  The pulpit provides a uniquely tempting opportunity for the corrupt to wield power and influence over vulnerable, lost souls.  The corrupt shepherds dressed in sheep’s clothing, who deign to instruct others on how they should live, are practiced in the art of deception and can smoothly recite   longed-for words of persuasion as they successfully manipulate the naive and the willing.   It’s a dangerous game, this wolf playing good shepherd.  Eventually their con will come to an end, and they will have to answer for their perversion of God and Scripture, and for preying on the saints.  Until that time though, the “mission” remains:  If the money is good, let the good times keep roll.  All in the name of Christ, of course.</p> <p>With that, this is Paula White, President Trump’s spiritual advisor and Special Adviser to the White House Faith and Opportunity Initiative .  She is also known as the  <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/donald-trump-pastor-paula-white-225315">God Whisperer</a>.  I’ll just say that if she is actually advising Trump on spiritual matters, it could explain a whole lot.</p> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Presidential spiritual adviser Paula White takes authority over the marine kingdom, the animal kingdom, and all "satanic pregnancies" that seek to harm Trump or the church. <a href="https://t.co/pmrJEIxCHk">pic.twitter.com/pmrJEIxCHk</a></p> <p>— Right Wing Watch (@RightWingWatch) <a href="https://twitter.com/RightWingWatch/status/1220740601781608448?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 24, 2020</a></p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>We interrupt that which has been deployed to hurt the church in this season, that which has been deployed to hurt this nation. In the name of Jesus, forgive us for our sins. Come on, I need you guys to pray. We cancel every surprise from the witchcraft [sic] and the marine kingdom — any hex, any spell, any witchcraft, any spirit of control, any Jezebel, anything that the enemy desires through spells, through witchcraft, through any way that is manipulation, demonic manipulation. We curse that. We break it, according to the word of God.</p> <p>In the name of Jesus, we come against the marine kingdom, we come against the animal kingdom, the woman who rides upon the waters. We break the power, in the name of Jesus, and we declare that any strange winds, any strange winds that have been sent to hurt the church, sent against this nation, sent against our president, sent against myself, sent against others — we break it by the superior blood of Jesus right now.

Howard-Browne was so upset over John Bolton’s claims about Trump and the Ukraine in his yet-to-be-released memoir, “The Room Where it Happens,” that he launched an attack on the former national security advisor:  </p> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I have no respect for someone who is disloyal to the President and loyal to deep state !!! </p> <p>No respect!

No respect at all …… what a globalist sellout!” he added.  </p></blockquote> <p>As if that weren’t enough, Howard-Browne also tweeted:  </p> <blockquote><p>“WWJD: he would have made a whip and beat the crap out of him!!!!”</p></blockquote> <p>Apparently this was  a tweet too far for Howard-Browne, as it seems that he has since <a href="https://twitter.com/rhowardbrowne/status/1222014918280519680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">deleted</a> the tweet.</p> <p>I am reminded of <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/franklin-graham-and-the-high-cost-of-the-lost-evangelical-witness/">this gem</a> from David French, as he discussed the Evangelical response to *any* political leader:  </p> <blockquote><p>The proper Evangelical position toward any president is not hard to articulate, though it is exceedingly difficult to hold to, especially in polarized times when one party seems set on limiting religious liberty and zealously defending abortion: We should pray for presidents, critique them when they’re wrong, praise them when they’re right, and never, ever impose partisan double standards. We can’t ever forget the importance of character, the necessity of our own integrity, and the power of the prophetic witness.</p> <p>In other words, Evangelicals can never take a purely transactional approach to politics. We are never divorced from our transcendent purpose, which always trumps political expediency. In scripture, prophets confronted leaders about their sin. They understood a core truth, one clearly articulated in the Southern Baptist Convention’s 1998 Resolution on Moral Character of Public Officials: “Tolerance of serious wrong by leaders sears the conscience of the culture, spawns unrestrained immorality and lawlessness in the society, and surely results in God’s judgment.”</p> <p>All too many of our nation’s Evangelical leaders haven’t just “tolerated” serious wrongdoing by Trump, they’ve rationalized and minimized it. </p></blockquote> <p>WWJD, you ask??  He’d tell  White, Howard-Browne, and other false prophets, grifters, and liars misrepresenting him in the Evangelical church to  knock this shit off right now. (See 2 Peter.) He would also remind believers that He has already made it very clear that they are  to  watch out for those who cause divisions and create obstacles contrary to the doctrine that you have been taught; avoid them. For such persons do not serve our Lord Christ, but their own appetites, and by smooth talk and flattery they deceive the hearts of the naive.   Time for those sitting in the pews to

But last year, he made a large contribution to the GOP for the first time: $37,500 in hopes of four more years of President Trump.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>“That’s a big investment for anybody,” said Costa, whose only other contribution to a presidential candidate was $1,000 to Mitt Romney in 2012. “It’s like insurance that is going to help save the country. . . . It’s for me and my grandkids and the next generations.”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>[…]</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Their ranks include investors in a South Florida hot yoga studio, a Ni­ger­ian American real estate developer in Dallas and the head of a trucking business in Los Angeles. They have been joined by veteran GOP donors who have returned to the fold after sitting out Trump’s 2016 campaign.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>[…]</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Trump is now also supported by a more traditional source of party money: longtime GOP donors who shunned him during his 2016 campaign. By and large, those wealthy establishment donors have fallen in line behind Trump’s reelection, said Lisa Spies, a longtime Republican fundraiser.</ins></p></blockquote><ins> </ins><p><ins>The report goes on to note that the new wave of contributors are giving anything but chump change:  </ins></p><ins> </ins><blockquote><p><ins>Trump’s vaunted political money machine is helping drive record sums to the Republican National Committee, and not just from the same donors who supported him in 2016. Enticed by exclusive gatherings and ecstatic about the president’s tax cuts, an eclectic new crop of donors is going all in, giving five and six figures to support his reelection.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The Washington Post identified at least 220 big donors to Trump’s reelection who are either new to major political giving or sat out the last presidential general election. Together, they have deluged pro-Trump fundraising committees with more than $21 million — a cash infusion that suggests a newfound enthusiasm for the president among supporters capable of writing large checks.</ins></p></blockquote><ins> </ins><p><ins>Motivating donors is the healthy economy, Trump’s tax cuts and efforts at deregulation.  </ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Note:  Since Trump’s election, more than 1.6 million new donors have contributed to the Republican Party, in both large and small amounts, party officials said.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Though doubtful that it was intentional, the report reveals the diversity of Trump’s big donors, including  Nigerian-Americans, Hispanics,  and Chinese-Americans.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>While there are those <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/479078-trumps-reelection-looks-more-like-a-long-shot-than-a-slam-dunk#.Ximpc_ZNGQw.twitter">opining Link: https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/479078-trumps-reelection-looks-more-like-a-long-shot-than-a-slam-dunk#.Ximpc_ZNGQw.twitter </a> that Trump’s reelection looks like a long-shot, one has to wonder if a Trump loss really will be a slam-dunk, given his considerable <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-campaignraised-46-million-infourth-quarter-11577970640">war chest Link: https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-campaignraised-46-million-infourth-quarter-11577970640 </a> of more than $100 million headed into the 2020 election year:  </ins></p><ins> </ins><blockquote><p><ins>And if you think this election will favor Trump, ask yourself this question: When was the last time his approval rating was above 45 percent and his disapproval was below 45 percent? Answer: not since his inauguration. Simply put, this fact does not bode well for this incumbent — no matter how strong the economy or his campaign’s success in turning out his voters. Trump is not a majority president. It’s unlikely he can be a majority candidate.      </ins></p></blockquote><ins> </ins><p><ins>Interestngly, the <a href="https://www.nrsc.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/State-of-Play.pdf">NRSC reported Link: https://www.nrsc.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/State-of-Play.pdf </a> today that the impeachment hearing has “fired up Trump’s base” and become and is a “net negative for Democrats in key states”:   </ins></p><ins> </ins><blockquote><p><ins>NRSC surveys conducted in January in battleground states, including Arizona, Colorado, Maine, and North Carolina, show that 62% of voters agree that Congress should be focusing on top issues like health care costs, trade deals, and keeping the economy on track instead of trying to remove Donald Trump from office. This includes 63% of independents and 61% of women.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Furthermore, 58% agree that Democrats should let voters decide for themselves in next November’s elections instead of trying to impeach Trump and remove him from office, including 59% of independents and 55% of women.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>In Maine, which has given the collective media a nosebleed as they attempt to put Susan Collins in a box, 59% of voters agree Congress should focus on top issues instead of impeachment and 55% agree that we should let voters decide in November.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Perhaps most telling, a whopping 62% of independents in Maine say that we should focus on other issues instead of impeachment, and 58% of independents think we should let the voters decide at the ballot box in November.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>And these numbers aren’t unique to Maine. We’ve seen similar numbers in Colorado, North Carolina, Arizona, and other battleground states. Across the board, voters recognize this for what it is: a partisan sideshow. 68% say that impeachment “is all about politics” and that “Democrats should be more concerned about addressing issues of the day like the cost of health care, fair trade deals and keeping the economy on track.”</ins></p></blockquote><ins> </ins><p><ins>However, here’s what recent <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/891779/fox-news-poll-finds-independents-want-senate-convict-remove-trump-by-19point-margin">Fox News polling Link: https://theweek.com/speedreads/891779/fox-news-poll-finds-independents-want-senate-convict-remove-trump-by-19point-margin </a> found:  </ins></p><ins> </ins><blockquote><p><ins>A Fox News poll released Sunday found that voters think the Senate already has enough evidence to render its verdict — 48 percent to 44 percent who say senators should subpoena witnesses. But by a margin of 6 percentage points, they think the evidence points to guilt and removal from office…Two polls last week found that 51 percent of Americans want the Senate to convict and oust Trump, whose approval rating in the Fox News poll is 45 percent, 54 percent disapproval…the party with a Senate majority is taking his side — 84 percent of Republicans told the Fox News pollsters that Trump shouldn’t be convicted and removed, versus 81 percent of Democrats who said he should be; independents wanted Trump removed by a 19-point margin, 53 percent to 34 percent. </ins></p></blockquote><ins> </ins><p><ins>Meanwhile, Trump seems to be feeling pretty confident today:</ins></p><ins> </ins><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><ins>GAME OVER! <a href="https://t.co/yvMa6bPqfy">pic.twitter.com/yvMa6bPqfy Link: https://t.co/yvMa6bPqfy </a></ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>— Donald J.

Now, how do the Republicans expect to use the Hunter Biden argument to show Trump’s demands to Zelensky were legit? Well, as a technical matter Hunter Biden can’t show that, because the relevant question is what Trump thought, not what Hunter Biden says now. And we all know that Trump thought whatever he was told on Fox News. But those are technical arguments. What would we really learn from Hunter Biden? I think the GOP dream is like the plan of the South Park Underpants Gnomes:</ins></p><ins> </ins><blockquote><p><ins>Phase 1: Collect underpants 
Phase 2: ? 
Phase 3: Profit!</ins></p></blockquote><ins> </ins><p><ins>But the GOP version is:</ins></p><ins> </ins><blockquote><p><ins>Phase 1: Call Hunter Biden 
Phase 2: ? 
Phase 3: Not guilty!</ins></p></blockquote><ins> </ins><p><ins>So what does the question mark represent? In the GOP fantasy, it’s hours of these questions on repeat:</ins></p><ins> </ins><blockquote><p><ins>Q. DIDN’T YOU COLLECT THOUSANDS, PERHAPS MILLIONS, PERHAPS TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM BURISMA?</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>A: YES.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Q. IS IT NOT TRUE THAT THIS IS RANK CORRUPTION OF THE HIGHEST ORDER AND THAT DONALD TRUMP WAS TOTALLY RIGHT TO WANT TO INVESTIGATE IT?</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>A. NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT, YOU’RE RIGHT, OF COURSE.</ins></p></blockquote><ins> </ins><p><ins>But the reality is that, after the 12th invocation of the thousands, or millions, or quintillions of dollars Biden took, there will be further analysis of just what the hell this has to do with anything. And the more the facts are explored, the more the public will begin to realize certain facts:</ins></p><ins> </ins><ul><li><ins>Shokin, the Ukranian prosecutor whom Biden sought to have ousted, was actually dirty</ins></li><ins> </ins></ul><ins> </ins><ul><li><ins>Some Republican Senators supported Biden’s actions in ousting Shokin</ins></li><ins> </ins></ul><ins> </ins><ul><li><ins>Any Burisma investigation related to events that happened years before Hunter Biden joined the board</ins></li><ins> </ins></ul><ins> </ins><ul><li><ins>Biden’s actions were official U.S. policy and supported by most of the world</ins></li><ins> </ins></ul><ins> </ins><ul><li><ins>Biden’s actions likely would have made Burisma more likely to be investigated</ins></li><ins> </ins></ul><ins> </ins><ul><li><ins>The GOP argument is bullshit</ins></li><ins> </ins></ul><ins> </ins><p><ins>The GOP Underpants Gnomes plan can still work, but the question mark in Phase 2 does not stand for “damning testimony emerges of the rightness of Donald Trump’s actions” but rather for “Republican Senators vote not guilty no matter what the evidence is.” Which means Trump will be fine — for now. But how will this end up looking come November?</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Anyway, that’s what I say to expect. As usual, hound me in a few days when I turn out to have been wrong about everything.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="feedback"><ins><a href="http://patterico.com/jury/2020/01/29/impeachment-what-comes-next/#respond">Comments (0) Link: http://patterico.com/jury/2020/01/29/impeachment-what-comes-next/#respond </a> </ins></p><ins> </ins><ins><a href="http://patterico.com/jury/page/2/">Next Page » Link: http://patterico.com/jury/page/2/ </a> Recent Comments

той новой статье, полезной для саморазвития?

Я планировала завести свой собственный блог в ближайшем 
будущем, но пока трудно сделать выбор между 
BlogEngine/WordPress/b2evolution и Drupal. Почему я спрашиваю - потому что этот дизайн,
кажется, отличается от большей части блогов, а я 
ищу нечто совершенно оригинальное.
П.С. Приношу извинения за 
вопросы не по теме, но я должен был спросить!

Unfortunately I have become quite discouraged about our government and in a broader sense society as a whole due to the blatant hypocrisy and people's inability to have even a small sense of decency. It might even border on apathy these days.

I found it sad that good and positive events and the achievement of individuals could not be honored and celebrated simply because of the person recognizing them.  

And I find it disturbing that our president can't seem to speak of anything without using hyperbole.

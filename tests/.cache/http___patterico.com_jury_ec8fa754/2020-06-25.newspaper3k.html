<p>Note: Consider this a little impeachment reprieve for those who are exhausted from talking about it.<br>
<br>
I have written a number of posts concerning the seeming-rise of charlatans and grifters in Evangelical church pulpits since the ascendancy of Trump.   The Church has always had  wolves in its midst, this is nothing new.  The pulpit provides a uniquely tempting opportunity for the corrupt to wield power and influence over vulnerable, lost souls.  The corrupt shepherds dressed in sheep&#8217;s clothing, who deign to instruct others on how they should live, are practiced in the art of deception and can smoothly recite   longed-for words of persuasion as they successfully manipulate the naive and the willing.   It&#8217;s a dangerous game, this wolf playing good shepherd.  Eventually their con will come to an end, and they will have to answer for their perversion of God and Scripture, and for preying on the saints.  Until that time though, the &#8220;mission&#8221; remains:  If the money is good, let the good times keep roll.  All in the name of Christ, of course.</p>
<p>With that, this is Paula White, President Trump&#8217;s spiritual advisor and Special Adviser to the White House Faith and Opportunity Initiative .  She is also known as the  <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/donald-trump-pastor-paula-white-225315">God Whisperer</a>.  I&#8217;ll just say that if she is actually advising Trump on spiritual matters, it could explain a whole lot.</p>

<blockquote><p>We interrupt that which has been deployed to hurt the church in this season, that which has been deployed to hurt this nation. In the name of Jesus, forgive us for our sins.

<p>White, who leads a congregation of 10,000 worshipers at the New Destiny Christian Center megachurch, attempted to <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/480039-trumps-spiritual-adviser-responds-to-backlash-after-sermon">clarify</a> what she meant when she  prayed for women to miscarry babies in their um, [double-checks notes]&#8230;&#8221;satanic wombs&#8221;:  </p>

<p>So calling out White&#8217;s crazy &#8220;satanic womb&#8221; mumbo-jumbo is nothing but  a disingenuous attempt to use words out of context for political gain&#8230;   </p>
<p>For reference, here is Ephesians 6:12 NASB:  </p>
<blockquote><p>For our struggle is not against [a]flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yet more evidence of  disturbed Trump-supporting pastors who have <a href="https://twitter.com/nowthisnews/status/1191721327415066624">deified the President </a>as if he were a co-equal with the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, is Evangelical pastor Rodney Howard-Browne.  Howard-Browne was so upset over John Bolton&#8217;s claims about Trump and the Ukraine in his yet-to-be-released memoir, &#8220;The Room Where it Happens,&#8221; that he launched an attack on the former national security advisor:  </p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;You are a slime ball of the highest order &#8230;. I should have knocked your sorry butt through the door of the Oval Office into the rose garden when I saw you. I would have gladly been arrested &#8230;. what a Benedict Arnold &#8230;.. I am glad you were fired !!!!!&#8221; Howard-Browne tweeted Monday. </p>
<p>&#8220;I have no respect for someone who is disloyal to the President and loyal to deep state !!! No respect! No respect at all &#8230;&#8230; what a globalist sellout!&#8221; he added.  </p></blockquote>
<p>As if that weren&#8217;t enough, Howard-Browne also tweeted:  </p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;WWJD: he would have made a whip and beat the crap out of him!!!!&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Apparently this was  a tweet too far for Howard-Browne, as it seems that he has since <a href="https://twitter.com/rhowardbrowne/status/1222014918280519680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">deleted</a> the tweet.</p>
<p>I am reminded of <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/franklin-graham-and-the-high-cost-of-the-lost-evangelical-witness/">this gem</a> from David French, as he discussed the Evangelical response to *any* political leader:  </p>
<blockquote><p>The proper Evangelical position toward any president is not hard to articulate, though it is exceedingly difficult to hold to, especially in polarized times when one party seems set on limiting religious liberty and zealously defending abortion: We should pray for presidents, critique them when they&#8217;re wrong, praise them when they&#8217;re right, and never, ever impose partisan double standards. We can&#8217;t ever forget the importance of character, the necessity of our own integrity, and the power of the prophetic witness.</p>
<p>In other words, Evangelicals can never take a purely transactional approach to politics. We are never divorced from our transcendent purpose, which always trumps political expediency. In scripture, prophets confronted leaders about their sin. They understood a core truth, one clearly articulated in the Southern Baptist Convention&#8217;s 1998 Resolution on Moral Character of Public Officials: &#8220;Tolerance of serious wrong by leaders sears the conscience of the culture, spawns unrestrained immorality and lawlessness in the society, and surely results in God&#8217;s judgment.&#8221;</p>
<p>All too many of our nation&#8217;s Evangelical leaders haven&#8217;t just &#8220;tolerated&#8221; serious wrongdoing by Trump, they&#8217;ve rationalized and minimized it. </p></blockquote>
<p>WWJD, you ask??  He&#8217;d tell  White, Howard-Browne, and other false prophets, grifters, and liars misrepresenting him in the Evangelical church to  knock this shit off right now. (See 2 Peter.) He would also remind believers that He has already made it very clear that they are  to  watch out for those who cause divisions and create obstacles contrary to the doctrine that you have been taught; avoid them. For such persons do not serve our Lord Christ, but their own appetites, and by smooth talk and flattery they deceive the hearts of the naive.   Time for those sitting in the pews to<br>
 wise up.</p>

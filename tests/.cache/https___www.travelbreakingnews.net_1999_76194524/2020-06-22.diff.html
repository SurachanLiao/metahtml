On an 8-by-6 foot platform constructed in the branches of the towering tree, Hill cooked vegetarian meals, listened to a hand-cranked radio, and wrote poetry. Food, water and other necessities, were hoisted up to her by supporters. … <a href="https://www.travelbreakingnews.net/1999/12/julia-butterfly-hill-leaves-redwood-home/" class="more-link">[Read more...] <span class="screen-reader-text">about Julia ‘Butterfly’ Hill Leaves Redwood Home</span> Link: https://www.travelbreakingnews.net/1999/12/julia-butterfly-hill-leaves-redwood-home/ </a></ins></p></article><article class="post-39787860 post type-post status-publish format-standard entry"><p><ins>Once you've chinked all the cracks that let body heat escape, you'll still need to keep the furnace stoked. Here's where it pays to be fit, but not necessarily thin. "Muscle is where metabolic heat is produced," Donner says. "The more muscle you've got, the more heat you can make." Spend too much time sitting around not using those muscles, and the body compensates with chattering teeth and shivering. "The metabolic heat energy produced by shivering is huge, almost like jogging, but it's an inefficient use of energy. Most people can't shiver for more than 2 hours because their muscles run out of fuel." … <a href="https://www.travelbreakingnews.net/1999/11/winter-harm-cold-dangers/" class="more-link">[Read more...] <span class="screen-reader-text">about Winter Harm: Cold Dangers</span> Link: https://www.travelbreakingnews.net/1999/11/winter-harm-cold-dangers/ </a></ins></p></article> <article class="post-39787851 post type-post status-publish format-standard entry"><p>The easiest option is to buy baked or smoked tofu. These come sealed in plastic, so you can throw the package in your backpack and go. Look for two brands I like, Soy Boy or White Wave, in the refrigerated section at a local natural foods store. The tofu will last unrefrigerated for a day or two, so it's best suited for short trips. Like most ready-made foods, both smoked and baked tofu cost more (about $2.75 per 6 ounces) than raw tofu, but they cut prep time to as fast as you can slice. Hint: Slice and eat the tofu with a bagel for lunch, throw it into soup, or add it to pasta during the last few minutes of boiling. … <a href="https://www.travelbreakingnews.net/1999/11/tofu-anyone/" class="more-link">[Read more...] <span class="screen-reader-text">about Tofu, Anyone?</span></a></p></article> <article class="post-39787863 post type-post status-publish format-standard entry"><p><ins>TRAILS: Leaving Rainbow Falls trailhead, Fish Creek Trail connects with the PCT to form a 31-mile loop through Fish and Cascade Valleys.

The National Park Service spends more than $2 million a year on the problem and estimates that this is only 10 percent of the money needed to control invasive plants. Even President Clinton has gotten involved: In April he signed the Invasive Species Executive Order, which directs all the land agencies to monitor, research, and act on alien plant issues. Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt put it this way: "The invasion of noxious weeds has created a level of destruction to America's environment and economy that is matched only by the damage caused by floods, earthquakes, wildfire, hurricanes, and mud slides." … <a href="https://www.travelbreakingnews.net/1999/11/americas-least-wanted-flowers/" class="more-link">[Read more...] <span class="screen-reader-text">about America’s Least Wanted Flowers</span> Link: https://www.travelbreakingnews.net/1999/11/americas-least-wanted-flowers/ </a></ins></p></article> </main>

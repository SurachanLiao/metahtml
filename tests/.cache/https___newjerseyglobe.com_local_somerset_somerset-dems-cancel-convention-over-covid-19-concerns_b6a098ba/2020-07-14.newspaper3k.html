<p>Somerset County Democratic Committee leadership cancelled Wednesday night&#8217;s county convention over concerns about COVID-19, according to an email obtained by the Ne Jersey Globe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Out of an abundance of caution and with your and the public&#8217;s health in mind, the SCDC Executive Committee has decided to cancel tonight&#8217;s county convention out of concern over COVID-19,&#8221; SCDC Chairwoman Peg Schaffer said. &#8220;We regret the lost opportunity to meet our candidates and gather together, but&#160;the widespread medical advice of experts made it clear that it was a necessary choice to reduce the risk to our members, candidates, and the public at large.&#8221;</p>
<p>The committee will send out an online survey asking their delegates to select their favored candidates.</p>
<p>The county&#8217;s Democratic screening committee has endorsed candidates in the race, and no others have sought nominations at the party&#8217;s convention, though delegates will be able to vote for write-in candidates.</p>
<p>The county is holding an open primary for president.</p>

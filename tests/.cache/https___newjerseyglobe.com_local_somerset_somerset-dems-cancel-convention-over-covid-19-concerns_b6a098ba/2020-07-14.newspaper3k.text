Somerset County Democratic Committee leadership cancelled Wednesday night’s county convention over concerns about COVID-19, according to an email obtained by the Ne Jersey Globe.

“Out of an abundance of caution and with your and the public’s health in mind, the SCDC Executive Committee has decided to cancel tonight’s county convention out of concern over COVID-19,” SCDC Chairwoman Peg Schaffer said. “We regret the lost opportunity to meet our candidates and gather together, but the widespread medical advice of experts made it clear that it was a necessary choice to reduce the risk to our members, candidates, and the public at large.”

The committee will send out an online survey asking their delegates to select their favored candidates.

The county’s Democratic screening committee has endorsed candidates in the race, and no others have sought nominations at the party’s convention, though delegates will be able to vote for write-in candidates.

The county is holding an open primary for president.

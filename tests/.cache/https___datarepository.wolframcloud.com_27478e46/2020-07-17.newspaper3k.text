The Wolfram Data Repository is a public resource that hosts an expanding collection of computable datasets, curated and structured to be suitable for immediate use in computation, visualization, analysis and more.

Building on the Wolfram Data Framework and the Wolfram Language, the Wolfram Data Repository provides a uniform system for storing data and making it immediately computable and useful. With datasets of many types and from many sources, the Wolfram Data Repository is built to be a global resource for public data and data-backed publication. Stephen Wolfram’s Announcement »

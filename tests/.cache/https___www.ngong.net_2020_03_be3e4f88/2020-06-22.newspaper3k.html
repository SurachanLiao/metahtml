<div><p>Day three: Extreme fatigue. I had a fitful night's sleep and was dog-tired; I couldn't even get up to go to the bathroom. I spent the day in bed, munching on nothing but ice cubes and drinking the odd glass of water. The baby woke up with a temperature, 38C, but no other symptoms; she spent the whole day clinging onto her Dad, being cuddled and whimpering. She only wanted to drink milk, eat a plain biscuit and sleep. She whimpered on and off throughout the day with her temperature going between 36.9C (normal) to 39C - we let her nursery know that she wouldn't be in for 7 days, with suspected coronavirus symptoms. I stayed in bed all day, sleeping on and off; she went to bed like normal but woke up at 2am screaming. It took two hours to settle her, her temperature normal but extremely upset. &#8230; <a href="https://www.ngong.net/2020/03/mum-reveals-what-it-s-like-for-her-11-month-old-baby-to-have-coronavirus/" class="more-link">[Read more...] about Mum reveals what it&#8217;s like for her 11-month-old baby to have coronavirus</a></p></div>

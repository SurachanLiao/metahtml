			<p>&#8220;Coronavirus&#8221; isn&#8217;t a specific term, because the common cold can be a coronavirus. But you won&#8217;t often hear the media refer to it as &#8220;Wuhan virus&#8221; or &#8220;Chinese virus,&#8221; let alone &#8220;Chinese Red Death&#8221; or &#8220;Kung Flu&#8221; &#8212; even though these terms would be more apt.</p>
<p>Via <a target="_blank" href="https://noqreport.com/2020/03/17/why-is-american-media-echoing-communist-chinas-propaganda-about-racism/" rel="noopener noreferrer">NOQ Report</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>First, the Wuhan Coronavirus originated in Wuhan, China. Second, the Chinese Communist Party not only ignored but completely covered up the disease for as long as they could, allowing it to not only spread among its own people but to countries around the world. Third, diseases are regularly named after the area (like Ebola), city (like Lyme Disease), or region/nation (like Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) of their origin.</p></blockquote>
<p>Deranged by political correctness and obsessive hatred of Trump (who has called it <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1239685852093169664" rel="noopener noreferrer">&#8220;the Chinese Virus&#8221;</a>), the liberals who run the media reject these terms in favor of the vague &#8220;coronavirus&#8221; or awkward &#8220;COVID-19.&#8221; More descriptive terms are denounced as racist and xenophobic. However,</p>
<blockquote><p>No American who has ever heard of West Nile Virus, German Measles, Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever, St. Louis Encephalitis, or Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever believes the phrase &#8220;Chinese Virus&#8221; is racist or xenophobic. The World Health Organization even acknowledged the reason they came up with the clunky, manufactured name &#8220;COVID-19&#8221; was to prevent the stigma from touching China.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here a Chinese propaganda service exploits political correctness to bully people into pretending not to notice that the virus came from China:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Racism is not the right tool to cover your own incompetence <a href="https://t.co/LmGDyPsULt">pic.twitter.com/LmGDyPsULt</a></p>
<p>&#8212; China Xinhua News (@XHNews) <a href="https://twitter.com/XHNews/status/1239753294265765888?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 17, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
 
<p>In effect, every time the media says &#8220;COVID-19&#8221; instead of &#8220;Wuhan virus,&#8221; it is complying with China&#8217;s tyrannical communist party, which helped the virus spread by trying to cover it up.</p>

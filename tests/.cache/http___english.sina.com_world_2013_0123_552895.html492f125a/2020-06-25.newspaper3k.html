<p>Speculation that Kim's resemblance to the country's founding leader, Kim Il Sung, is not 100 percent natural has been around for some time, though with little or no supporting evidence.</p>

<p>The rumors have been partly fed by the undeniable fact that Kim Jong Un has sought to evoke memories of his grandfather in numerous ways, through his dress, haircut, gestures and public appearances.</p>

<p>And there is a clear physical resemblance. But Pyongyang's patience with reports of plastic surgery appears to have run out.</p>

<p>"The false report... released by enemies is a hideous criminal act which the party, state, army and people can never tolerate," the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said in a commentary Wednesday.</p>

<p>Insisting that the very idea of Kim, who is in his late 20s, undergoing plastic surgery was "unimaginable," KCNA flatly rejected what it described as "sordid hackwork by rubbish media."</p>

<p>While the focus of the commentary's fury was the South Korean media, it seems Pyongyang's anger was triggered by a Chinese report last week that was widely picked up by newspapers in the South.</p>

<p>China's Shenzhen TV cited a diplomatic source who, on a private visit to Pyongyang, had spoken to a DPRK official who confirmed the plastic surgery rumors.</p>

<p>KCNA referenced the Chinese report, but saved its real vitriol for the South Korean newspapers.  "Those hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership of the nation should not expect any mercy or leniency.</p>

<p>"Time will clearly show what dear price the human scum and media in the service of traitors of South Korea, slaves of capital, will have to pay," it said.</p>

<p>Kim Il Sung died in 1994. He is officially referred to as "The Great Leader" and is designated in the constitution as the country's "Eternal President". His birthday is a public holiday.</p>

<p>Possibly concerned that the Shenzhen TV report may have caused offence, China's official Xinhua news agency issued a report Tuesday, citing two of its correspondents in Pyongyang who rejected the plastic surgery rumors.</p>

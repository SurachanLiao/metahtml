Link: http://mysingaporenews.blogspot.com/2020/07/elections-in-western-democracies-and.html </a> </ins></h3><ins> </ins><p class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-1947272225310777125"><ins>Do elections in western countries really demonstrate that they are democratic. No, never, elections in western democracies and pseudo democracies have exposed their cancerous corruptions.</ins></p><p><ins>When elections are around all the rogues, shits, scums and rag tags will take the opportunity to stand for election. When elected they will plunder the country for personal gains and self-interests. All promises to the people during elections are hogwash and soon forgotten. Their behaviour at election time is like wild dogs, hyenas and wolves in heat always barking and howling at each other.</ins></p><p><ins>The robber barons in western democracies, the crooks, scoundrels and rogues in parliament, Senate, Congress and House of Representatives have always been robbing the people and the country freely with impunity. Unfortunately this western political disease has spread far and wide to pseudo democracies all over Africa, Asia and Latin America.</ins></p><p><ins>Western democracies mean legalise robbery by crooks and scoundrels in Congress, Senate, parliament or House of Representatives and other high places of power and authority like the US judiciary, CIA, Pentagon and The Federal Reserve Bank. The citizens are numbed and intimidated and cannot do anything . Corruption is rife and very extensive in all or most western democracies and pseudo democracies, yet it is never easy to pin down a rogue politician on corruption.</ins></p><p><ins>The American politicians have  developed a systematic " Political Lobby" a very powerful corrupted system whereby politicians who are supported by rich millionaires or billionaires in big corporations and companies will represent them to lobby the government to do things at their bidding for their own selfish interests, aggrandizement and enrichment. In the meantime the interests of the  over 95 percent  ordinary American citizens are ignored.</ins></p><p><ins>Thus western democracy is clearly used by the rich and powerful as a tool and instrument to defraud and control the populace and the country. Indeed the Americans use 'Democracy' as a tool and medium to rob and control the whole world especially the poor third world countries through defrauding them by subterfuge.</ins></p><p><ins>Southernglory1</ins></p><p><ins>Friday, 3rd July, 2020

Think the posters were put up by our foreign talents who were unfamiliar with the PAP logo nor were they able to read and could not tell the diffence between an upside down poster.

There are anger and frustration for and against the ruling party and the opposition camp as well.</ins></p><p class="separator"><ins>Now everyone is calling for calm. Not to worry, it would not become like, 'Black Lives Matter' even if the campaign cry is turning to 'Singaporean Lives Matter'. Suddenly everyone seems to be very concern about the well being of Singaporeans, about finding jobs for Singaporeans, and to be serious, they are now talking about good jobs, not drivers, security guards and cleaners.  Is this just part of the political gerrymandering, good enough for one week of campagning and everything back to normal after the GE? Then the official calls will be again for more foreign talents and more population growth? And be happy if you have a job, any job, done be choosy. Be grateful? Cannot use any numbers, very sensitive now.  The official position expounded by Vivian is that the govt has no official target for population growth, not even thinking of 6.9m and definitely not 10m. </ins></p><p class="separator"><ins>Should Singaporeans fearing more job losses to foreigners, higher cost of living and more squeeze and having to make sex in small places be feeling better now, more assured that things would not go down that slippery road of no return?</ins></p><p class="separator"><ins>These are pre election days. Everyone is saying nice things that the people want to hear.

The native Australians have 0 trust in the white Australian govt for the centuries of abuses, ill treatment and racial discrimination after invading and seizing their land. The non white population of Australians have little trust in being treated fairly by the white Australian govt and at best as second or third class citizens.</ins></p><p><ins>Regionally the trust by the nations in the region of white Australia and their white policies has never been lower. In most instances the trust is less than 30 percent. None of the countries in the region believe that the white Australian govt is a part of the region, none see the white Australian govt as part of the region. Most of the countries see white Australian govt as a continued legacy of European colonialism and should have no place in the history and affairs of the region. The white Australians are foreigners to the region.</ins></p><p><ins>Very few countries in the region have trust that the white Australian govt would act responsibly for the interest of the people of the region. Some regard the white Australians as behaving like white colonialists walking around carrying a big stick as if they are the warlords of the region.</ins></p><p><ins>The poll also found that most white Australians viewed favourably their relationship with the USA than with China or countries in the region.</ins></p><p><ins>PS. RISS is the Redbean Institute of Strategic Studies, an authoritative regional think tank.

It simply 
means, watch your back because something unexpected – invariably 
negative, dangerous, violent, unexpected – is going to happen TO YOU.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>In this case of Surya Kumar, given the context of what has happened 
with Ivan Lim and RSM Bryant’s role in it, Surya Kumar’s threat is 
particularly troubling.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The authorities really should look into the threat.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Andrew Loh</ins></p><p><ins>Above is Andrew Loh's post on the latest threat by ex Colonel Surya Kumar against RSM Bryant Wong for exposing PAP candidate Ivan Lim's past. Telling someone to watch your back, implicating that something unpleasant is going to happen is surely not a nice thing to say. What can happen to Bryant Wong and who would be responsible for it?  Now a police report has been made against this big shot ex colonel of the the SAF.</ins></p><p><ins>This reminds me of the threat against me sometime ago by an IB called Raymond in my blog. I too made a police report against him. This Raymond could also be a big shot from some organisation and thus dared to behave so arrogantly, like a gangster.</ins></p><p><ins>I told that Raymond that he better prayed that nothing would happen to me, if it does, then he would be held responsible for it. And this could be anything that could hurt me, be it an accident or in the case of RSM Bryant Wong, losing his job or maybe kena robbed or beaten on the way home.</ins></p><p><ins>Making such uncalled for threat is unacceptable in our so called rule of law state. Are these people gangsters or what? Or are they above the law and could make such threats against another citizen and acted as if nothing would happen to them, they are untouchable?</ins></p><p><ins>Now this colonel better pray that nothing untoward happened to Bryant Wong in the next few days or months. If it does, the fingers would be pointing to him for making this threat.</ins></p><p><ins>Never mind if the police would call him up or not. Pray that Bryant Wong is safe and sound. Bryant can put the blame on him for anything bad that happened to him. Don't pray pray.</ins></p><p><ins>In the past the fear of Singaporeans used to be Sue. Now there is another fear, threats or the legal people would call it criminal intimidation by powerful people or well connected people. A new fear in the scene.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="post-footer-line post-footer-line-1"><ins><span class="post-author vcard">Posted by

Every Chinese worth his salt should be proud of it. Link: http://mysingaporenews.blogspot.com/2020/07/china-led-by-chinese-communist-party-is.html </a> </ins></h3><ins> </ins><p><ins>PART      FIVE</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Last And Concluding episode</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The ultimate triumph of the Chinese Communist Party after a long and lethal life and death struggle against the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek 's KMT , Japan and the Western imperial powers headed by UK, US and France.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The Chinese Communist Party Revolution was disrupted by Chiang. Mao and Chu Teh and the CCP had to escape to the hills in Ching Kang-shan in Hunan where they found the Fourth Red Army  to continue their revolution to bring in a strong and successful socialist China.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The debacle of the CCP in the struggle with Chiang Kai Shek and the KMT was due to the wrong, confusing  and conflicting instructions of Stalin via his officials Borodin and Galen. Thereafter the CCP under the leadership of Mao Tse-tung disavowed Russian communist advice and followed only their own policies and strategy and Mao Tse-tung's instructions. </ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The period from 1922 to the mid 1930s  was a time of great danger to China. Chiang's KMT was beset with great internal feuds, strive and power struggle. The CCP  under the leadership of Mao Tse-tung though  cohesive and united was very much weakened with constant attacks by Chiang's KMT armies.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>In the meantime Japanese aggression against China became more strident and fiercer. After the annexation of Korea in 1910, Japan was coveting the conquest of the Chinese provinces of Manchuria and Outer Mongolia. Japan already occupied the Liaotung Peninsula which it took over from the Russian leasehold after the defeat of Russia in the Russo-Japanese war of 1905. It also took over Russia's control of the railways in Manchuria.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Japan started to invade Manchuria after staging the Mukden Incident  on 18 th September, 1931 whereby a bomb explosion in a railway track was blamed on the Chinese to provide a basis for Japanese aggression. Inspite of China's protest and appeal to the League of Nations none of the Western powers and Russia condemn Japan or came to China's help. Thus China was left to face Japan alone.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Chiang Kai-shek also did not want to confront the Japanese at this time because his priority was to destroy Mao Tse-tung and the CCP as he claimed that the Japanese problem was the disease of the skin while the CCP was the disease of the heart. With this type of warp thinking how could China be saved from foreign aggression and in this case Japanese aggression. So it beholds that only the CCP could save China.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>While the CCP pleaded to the KMT for unity and solidarity among the Chinese to fight and oppose Japanese aggression, Chiang thought otherwise and continued to attack and harass the CCP troops. Mao was concentrating to attack the Japanese with guerilla warfare but ironically he and his CCP troops were constantly attacked and harassed by the KMT armies.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Stalin also contributed to the weakening of the CCP when he supported a different faction which toed the Comintern's instructions to stage uprisings from the cities which always failed with disastrous consequences whereas Mao organized peasant uprisings and resistance. Eventually it was Mao's tactics that reaped the greatest success in galvanizing the Chinese spirit to successfully defeat the reactionary forces of Chiang Kai-shek's KMT and the Japanese armies.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>At Ching Kang-shan Mao regrouped his forces to form the Fourth Army under the command of Chu Teh and Ch'en Yi. Thereafter they moved their headquarters to Juichin, Kiangsi province. The CCP created another base in Shensi province under the charge of Liu Chih-tan and Kao-kang. As pointed out earlier the CCP would have suffered irrecoverable damage if it were to continue receiving wrong instructions from Stalin and the Comintern. Thus Mao and his colleagues, Chu Teh, Chen Yi, Chou En-lai, P'eng Te-huai  and other leaders refused to take instructions from Stalin or the Comintern. Under the strong leadership of Mao Tse-tung they decided on their own policies and strategies in the struggle and fight against the KMT and the Japanese invaders. Moa's growing power and independence from Stalin's or Comintern's control was the essential factor that contributed  to CCP's final victory over the KMT and the Japanese and China's regain of sovereignty when all western powers were driven out of China.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The CCP's base in Juichin became untenable as Chiang Kai-shek's KMT armies kept on attacking and harassing them relentlessly non-stop and with aerial bombing too. If the CCP did not move out of Juichin the communist forces would have been completely wiped out by Chiang Kai-shek. So on October 15 ,1934 Mao and his army started on the Long March with 100,000 soldiers on a 6000 miles journey to Yenan , Shensi province in the north west far away from KMT forces. On November 10, 1934, Juichin fell to the Nationalist - KMT forces. At the end of the epic Long March Mao's forces could count with only about 10, 000 survivors.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>In Yenan other communist forces led by other leaders joined Mao Tse-tung to continue their fight against the KMT and the Japanese invaders. From 1936 the Japanese had stepped up their attack on China and invaded large parts of north east China and the coastal regions. The Chinese communists adopted guerilla warfare against the Japanese and constantly attacked their rear with hit and run tactics. Still the despicable Chiang refused to unite with Mao to fight the Japanese. On December 12, at Sian, Chiang Kai-shek was made a captive by Chang Hsueh-Liang a commander of the KMT army to force him to unite with the CCP to fight the Japanese.  His release was brokered by the good will of Chou En-lai. But the cooperation between the KMT and the CCP did not last long. For soon after the Japanese surrender in 1945, the Chinese civil war between the KMT and the CCP resumed due to the untrustworthy nature of Chiang Kai-shek and the KMT.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The civil war ended with the triumphant victory for Mao Tse-tung and his communist government as they had the whole support of the Chinese people both the rural peasants and the working class proletariats in all the towns and cities. China under the CCP had stood up with pride and dignity on 1st October, 1949 as proclaimed by Chairman Mao Tse-tung.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Thus with the Chinese Communist Party leadership and guidance today's China is able to grow from strength to strength in her all round development in her economy, science and technology, trade and finance, political and military power . The CCP has brought back honour, self-respect, pride and dignity to China and the Chinese people.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>China's success is due to the great leaders both past and present and the millions of patriots who are selfless, self-sacrificing and utterly devoted to serve the country for the glory of the nation. Therefore every Chinese must honour and cherish the CCP and its leaders.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Southernglory1</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Wednesday, 1st July , 2020</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="post-footer-line post-footer-line-1"><ins><span class="post-author vcard">Posted by

Unfortunately he was not in the list of nomination for the GE.</ins></p><p><ins>Though Cheng Bock has made his present felt, there is just so much Cheng Bock can do as an individual, a solitary figure taking on the PAP political machinery. He needed a few heavy weights, I mean really heavy weights, to take on the PAP. Not many are in this category to really move the people and make big changes to the political system and force the PAP to tread more carefully unlike before. A Hsien Yang would have made the difference. Alas, it is not to be.</ins></p><p><ins>So what can the people that are unhappy with the PAP, with its policies that many viewed as anti Singaporeans and pro foreigners, do in this GE? Nothing much really. Nothing really very much. There would be the possibility of one more GRC, ie West Coast led by Cheng Bock, to join WP's Hougang Aljunied GRC in Parliament if the Hougang Aljunid voters have not been swayed to change sides. PAP's weak team there also gives hope that PAP too think Hougang Aljunid is a gone case and not putting much hope in it. Any more GRCs would be mere accidents. So not much to hope for.</ins></p><p><ins>Would there be accidents happening in Holland Bukit Timah with Jee Say rejoining the SDP team to fight Vivian one more time? Would Lim Tean be able to attract enough votes on his own strength, his commanding oratory skills to make his day? He could not ask for more with Josephine Teo struggling under the pressure of unemployment, fake and funny foreign talents and Covid infections in the dormitories and tasked to lead the Jalan Besar team. Would the absence of Halimah in Marsiling Yew Tee opens up a gap for Benjamin Pwee's team under SDP to make a breakthrough? Would Gan Kim Yong be weakened and made to pay a heavy price for the surge in Covid19 cases and all the problems in the hospitals and allow PSP's newcomers led by Francis Yuen, an SAF scholar, to crash through? Nicole Seah is not going to make much of an impact in a fairly weak team and in the wrong place, against the PM to be Heng Swee Kiat's team. Bad strategy is all I can say, wasting a trump card in a losing corner.  She could have added strength to a team with a higher chance of winning, but not against Heng Swee Kiat, I think. The happiest guy and team must be Chan Chun Sing and the Tanjong Pagar team for not having to meet Hsien Yang wearing PSP logo. If there is going to be an earth shaking moment in the GE2020 election, it must be Hsien Yang bungling Chan Chun Sing and the PAP Tanjong Pagar team out of Parliament. Well, it is game over in Tanjong Pagar.</ins></p><p><ins>In the single wards contest there looks like some possibility of a few opposition candidates making it through the gate. Highly watched would be Paul Tambyah. Chee Soon Juan may be given another chance given the bad publicity and performance of Murali in Bukit Batok. The voters there have seen how he performed and may abandon him for the never say die Chee. There are some far fetch chances for Ang Yong Guan and a few others. The smartest move this time is Goh Meng Seng for taking on Ting Pei Ling, a pretty shaky MP, still looking very young and fresh.</ins></p><p><ins></ins></p><p><ins>At the end of the GE PAP is going to be the next govt again for sure and at most with a few of its MPs and ministers missing the boat. The West Coast team is going to sweat a bit more and feeling very uneasy for now. Everything will remain fairly unchanged.  More foreign talents, more changes to CPF rules, more taxes, more fare and fee hikes, more of everything that Singaporeans know best after every GE. Cry also no tears.</ins></p><p><ins>This GE is likely to be another non event. The only little hope is for a big ground shift given all the bad policies that the people are very unhappy about, the influx of foreigners to steal the Singaporeans lunch, Singaporeans unable to get good jobs, CPF like no longer Singaporeans money but money owed to the govt and the govt is collecting it relentlessly at all cost no matter how old a person is, no time limit, no age limit, etc etc.  If there is such a big shift and the voters would vote for anything as long as it is not PAP, then all hell will break lose. This, unfortunately is yet to be the case, at least not proven till after the GE.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="post-footer-line post-footer-line-1"><ins><span class="post-author vcard">Posted by

In this manner the Chinese Communist Party was founded in 1921.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The CCP was founded simultaneously in 1921 in Peking by Chen Tu-Hsiu , Li Ta-Chao  and Mao Tse-tung where Chen Tu Hsiu was Professor of Peking National University ( PEITA ) and  Li Ta-chao  and Mao Tse-tung were Librarian  and  assistant librarian of Peking University respectively and in Paris, France by a group of Chinese students Chu Teh, Chou En-lai and a few others .</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The Chinese Communist Party was founded independently of the  Russian communist party. However, due to a meeting by Dr. Sun Yat Sen with a Russian communist representative Dr. Sun agreed to take in Chinese communists as members of the KMT.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Meanwhile the endless cycle of warlord civil wars continued in the north. The warlord Feng Yu-hsiang was more agreeable to a peaceful reunion of China. Unfortunately before he could finish his task for the unification of China, Dr Sun died in March , 1925. Before long Feng was ousted by the reactionary Chang Tso-lin the warlord of Manchuria. The reactionary Chang Tso-lin also captured and executed Li Ta-chao on April 28, 1927.  So the reunion of China was temporarily shattered.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Before he died Dr, Sun was preparing the KMT government in Canton for an expedition to conquer the north to destroy the warlords. Dr. Sun had established the Whampoa military training college in Canton. Dr. Sun had put Chiang Kai-shek as commander of the Whampoa military college. From this college some of the best generals of the KMT and the CCP were produced. Many of the KMT generals were disillisioned with the self-serving corrupt Chiang Kai-shek and thus in the on-going civil war in later years they were thus being influenced to cross over to join the ranks of Mao Tse-tung and enabled the Chinese Communist Party to win the civil war from 1946 to 1949.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The indiscriminate shooting of Chinese in foreign concessions due to trade disputes.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>On 30th May, 1925 , a huge student crowd demonstrated against the foreign-controlled police of the International settlement in Shanghai on the occasion of the arrest of strikers from a Japanese mill were fired upon with many fatal casualties by the police in the Nanking Road. This resulted in nationwide boycotts of British and Japanese firms from Canton and Hong Kong to Peking. Demonstrations continued unabated for weeks and months in in all Chinese towns and cities which provoked more foreign violence and atrocities.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The Chinese press was very indignant at the violence of the foreign police and fiercely condemned the foreigners in no uncertain terms. There was universal indignation, violent hatred and ferocious threats of vengeance against all western imperialist powers and Japan and these demands were the sole response to outrageous foreign action in China. Hundreds of foreign Christian missionaries felt untenable and had to leave China. These missionaries had been brainwashing the Chinese population especially in the interior and converting them to Christianity while at the same time deculturalise the Chinese folks from their traditional beliefs and traditional values.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The Chinese were very outraged because too often the Chinese were badly treated and killed. Shanghai is a Chinese city and the foreign police just shoot and kill as they like with no responsibility or remorse. And those shot and killed were students, scholars and members of the educated elite who were protesting against acts of imperialist oppression.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The Chinese now insist that all foreign concessions and extra-territorial rights should be abolished. For the first time since the Revolution the whole Chinese nation and people were stirred and roused. The infringement of Chinese sovereignty was too much for the Chinese to accept. They realised that foreign aggressions were the cause of all the sorrows and sufferings of China. Thus there was a strong demand and urge to drive the westerners out , to strip them of their ill-gotten wealth, to seize the concessions and abolish their privileges so that the Chinese revolution could go forward in the assurance of victory of modernization and of peace.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>PART      FOUR</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>KMT And CCP Cooperate to liberate China.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>May 30th, 1925, provided a good date for the KMT and the CCP to work together to liberate China from the warlords. The militarist government in Peking and the provincial warlords who accommodated the foreign powers were described by the Chinese as "Running Dogs of the Imperialists because they refused to unite with the KMT and the CCP to drive out the foreign imperialists to liberate China. This serious issue of liberation stired the minds of the soldiers of the warlords and the militarist government in Peking. They were later to cross over to join the forces of the KMT and CCP in their march northward to overthrow the warlords.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The warlords were cooperating with the western powers and Japan to sell China and divide China into separate colonies of the foreign powers. This was too much for the Chinese people and thus when the revolutionary armies from Canton marched north they were in full support and assured the success of the liberation. By 1926 the Revolutionary armies had taken Wu Han and the whole of the YangTze Valley as well as Nanking and Shanghai.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The west especially the British were seriously alarmed by the success of the KMT-CCP unity. The British sent troops to garrison the international settlement and naval ships to the Yang Tze to protect the foreign concessions.In the past it served to frighten the Chinese but not this time.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The Nationalist revolutionary armies undeterred by the presence of foreign warships approached, attacked and captured Nanking. At Hankow the Chinese overran the British concessions, seized the British ships and drove off the British gunboats with severe casualties by artillery fire.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>In Shanghai, in February, 1927, communist forces under the command of Chou En-lai wrested control of the city from the warlords. Foreign powers and the British could no longer maintain their concessions or extra-territorial powers in China. The British realized it was futile to start a war with a strong and very determined revolutionary China.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the CCP</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The KMT and the CCP were supposed to work together in coalition for the good of China's national development. But after achieving success and victory over the warlords Chiang unceremoniously turned against Mao Tse-tung and the communist. On 26th March, 1927 Chiang struck and slew all the communist leaders he could catch in Shanghai and other cities. Fortunately many of the top communist leaders including Chou En-lai managed to escape.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Chiang was so treacherous that with one fell swoop he got rid of the CCP from KMT coalition government and denied it a role in the Chinese revolution against the warlords. Then in 1928 the nationalist armies marched north to Peking and destroyed the warlord Chang Tso-lin. Chiang then shifted the capital from Peking to Nanking.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Though the warlords and the militarists in the north were defeated the task of freeing China from her subjection to the foreigners was not yet completed. The foreigners still retain most of the concessions and most of the extra-territorial privileges.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Chiang had destroyed all oppositions and failed to satisfy the demands of nationalism . Workers in the big cities were suppressed and the communists were driven from power. However on 1st August , 1927, the Fourth Army of the Nationalist at Nan-chang revolted and went over to the communist to form the Red Army of the CCP. Also the peasants who were suppressed and oppressed by Chiang rallied to the CCP.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>End of   PART   FOUR</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>What eventually happened to the Chinese Communist Party  ( CCP ) after Chiang Kai-shek's treasonable acts will appear in the concluding  PART   FIVE  which will be published tomorrow, Wednesday, 1st July, 2020.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Southernglory 1</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Tuesday, 30th June, 2020</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="post-footer-line post-footer-line-1"><ins><span class="post-author vcard">Posted by

Singapore does not have to provide jobs for the unemployed of other countries.  The responsibility of the Singapore govt is first towards Singaporeans, providing every Singaporean with good jobs and a decent standard of living. Any govt that thinks it is their responsibility to provide jobs for foreigners is not pro Singaporeans and does not deserve to be voted to form the govt. Our govt does not have to solve the unemployment problems of other countries at the expense of Singaporeans.</ins></p><p><ins>How many jobs are there that really need to be filled by foreigners that Singaporeans cannot fill them?  As I said many times, many jobs in Singapore are nothing like selling chicken rice to Singaporeans. The market is domestic, the consumers are Singaporeans. You do not need international experience or exposure or foreign talents for these jobs. At a glance, many jobs in the administrative area, like HR, admin, PR, sales, bank managers, research analysts, transport operators, postal services, do not need foreigners to do a better job. They are local in nature and there is no difference for one Singaporean to be competing with another Singaporean. What is the point of having a foreigner to compete against a Singapore in a local business with local consumers?</ins></p><p><ins>There are some jobs, highly technical and highly specialised that an organisation may not be able to find the expertise locally. They are some jobs that are international in nature, competing in the international market for business when international experience and exposure are not only useful but necessary. Such jobs could be better served with some foreign talents but not all. If all such jobs must need foreigners, then what is the point of having a Singapore work force, having citizens?</ins></p><p><ins>Having said that, all those jobs that can be done by Singaporeans must be reserved for Singaporeans first. The govt owes it to the people, the citizens. Offering such jobs that can be done by Singaporeans to foreigners is selling out the interests of Singaporeans and is traitorous. Charity begins at home.  </ins></p><p><ins>There are a few hundred thousand such jobs that are now given to foreigners. This is unacceptable.  Who is responsible for such irresponsible policy of giving jobs to foreigners and leaving Singaporeans unemployed or under employed? It is a very depressing and painful experience for Singaporeans not able to find jobs in Singapore when there are a few hundred thousand foreigners working here happily in jobs that Singaporeans can do. It is terribly demoralising and humiliating to hear of foreigners, fresh graduates, half past six qualifications, fake degrees, funny degrees, to walk in and land a job here within days while our own citizens can be banging their heads for months and years and cannot land a decent job.  What the hell is going? Doesn't anyone know that this is wrong and unacceptable?</ins></p><p><ins>If the govt is really pro Singaporean, make it a point that HR jobs must go to Singaporeans. Employment agencies must be run by Singaporeans. There is a need for a little protectionism, a bit of Singaporean first. Even the USA is doing so. Singapore is the silly copycat that everything the USA does, Singapore will follow. Let's follow this American First policy by having a Singaporean First policy for Singaporeans. Your American masters cannot fault you for doing that. They have started it.</ins></p><p><ins>The GE must all be about Singaporean First. The govt has for the last two decades been moving towards foreigners first resulting in millions of foreigners here and taking away many good jobs from Singaporeans. Any joker still screaming about hiring foreigners and not taking care of Singaporeans should be voted out. And taking care of Singaporeans is not training the highly qualified to lower paying jobs while opening the door widely to foreigners.</ins></p><p><ins>This must be the message for all political parties to be talking about, top in their agenda. Singapore is for Singaporeans.  Do not sell out the interests of Singaporeans to foreigners. That is treason!</ins></p><p><ins>The main agenda for GE2020 must be Singaporean First. Do not let this be distracted. Do not let rogue leaders to set a different agenda against the interests of Singaporeans. The need to hire foreigners as needed talents must be clearly defined with clear criteria and conditions, not a blank cheque. We have too many wildlife and foreign shits here being called foreign talents when they were either cheats, fakes or unemployable in their countries. And many came from bullshit universities that are no better than degree mills.  And we called them talents.  And don't listen to idiots that said can work ok oredy, no need degrees. What a load of rubbish.  This is a crime against our own citizens.</ins></p><p><ins>Would Singaporeans want to vote for a party that hires foreigners to replace them, make their children unemployable, at the mercy of foreign HR staff who preferred to bring in foreigners from their villages?  Do you think the MOM should be sacked for allowing this to go on and on for years? Vote for the party that puts Singaporeans interests first instead of foreigners. If a govt does not think it is its responsibility to uplift the life of its citizens, it must be voted out.</ins></p><p><ins>PS. Most if not all the jobs in the ministries, stats boards and GLCs do not need foreigners and should be reserved for Singaporeans.  In Malaysia, they are reserved for bumiputras. Why is the Singapore govt giving such jobs to foreigners and not to Singaporeans and leaving many Singaporeans crying for jobs?</ins></p><p><ins>I am very sad and disappointed to have to write about this. It pains me to see our PMETs and our young graduates suffering and struggling to find a decent job in our own country, and at the mercy of foreigners and our very own people favouring foreigners. Is this still a nation of people or a hotel without owners? If we don't stop this trend, we are doomed as a people and a nation.  We have misplaced priority!  We have lost our way.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="post-footer-line post-footer-line-1"><ins><span class="post-author vcard">Posted by

He renounced the extra-territorial rights and privileges which the Tsarist government had extorted from the Chinese of the weak Qin Dynasty. He promised to return to China all Chinese lands and territories that the Tsarist Empire had illegally taken from China through manipulated unequal treaties. This was to give the Chinese a good impression of the Russian communist and set a standard of friendly cooperation.  ( Footnote:  However, Stalin the Russian leader after Lenin reneged on Lenin's promise and stole even more of Chinese lands. )</ins></p><p><ins>China was able to compare the behaviour of communist Russia and the capitalist western imperialist. The capitalist western imperialists were seen as selfish and self-serving.</ins></p><p><ins>England and the United States rejected Dr Sun Yat Sen's appeal for recognition of his would-be democratic regime at Canton and for assistance to overthrow the ruinous rule of the warlords.</ins></p><p><ins>US and UK prefered to support the warlords and Yuan Shi Kai the new emperor pretender whom they could manipulate to support their own sinister agenda of controlling China behind the curtain. This caused the collapse of the early Republic.</ins></p><p><ins>After the death of Yuan Shi Kai in June 1916, China was thrown into complete choas for the next ten years when competing warlords strived for power and control. It was total anarchy for China.</ins></p><p><ins>SunYat Sen again appealed to the West for aid to end China's misery. Again he was rebuffed by Britain and the United States. They feared that Sun Yat Sen might achieve the formation of a strong and nationalist China in which they could no longer exploit. The western powers feared a strong united China under Sun Yat Sen might demand the return of all Chinese lands and territories which they had grabbed earlier from a weak China under Qin's rule.</ins></p><p><ins>Also they feared a strong China would abolish western imposed concessions, fortified extra-territorial rights and tariffs imposed on China to prevent Chinese competition and China's rights to impose duties on western products.</ins></p><p><ins>The warlords were traitors who liked the western Concessions which gave them sanctuary at every adverse turn of the political wheel. At the Concessions they could invest their spoils or loot in safety under the protection of the foreign powers' law. From the concessions they could continue their nefarious activities to plot for their return to power safe from the arrest or interference of the Central Republic Government of Dr. Sun Yat Sen.</ins></p><p><ins>Most of the KMT republican politicians were corrupt and their mouthing of slogans for revolution against the Qin's rule were just a travesty of the revolution as they aimed for their personal enrichment, aggrandizement and despotic power.</ins></p><p><ins>Western democracy was perceived as a sham and Chinese revolutionaries cast it aside. In 1921, Sun Yat Sen met a Russian representative in Shanghai and agreed with some principles of communism. Dr. Sun renamed his republican party as Kuomintang ( KMT ) or Nationalist Party. There was still no alliance between KMT and the Chinese communist party.</ins></p><p><ins>Dr. Sun Yat Sen was a non-partisan between the Kuomintang and the Chinese Communist Party. All he wanted was to unite all Chinese as a united front to build up China as a strong respected and dignified country which will never be bullied and humiliated by foreign powers again. Therefore he welcomed Chinese communists to join the KMT as individual members.</ins></p><p><ins>He reorganized the KMT along the lines of the Russian communist party with political commissars and strict discipline. The KMT therefore turned away from western democracy.</ins></p><p><ins>It was unfortunate that Dr. Sun died early in 1925 before he could see to fruition  his dream of forming a strong united China. After the death of Dr. Sun Yat Sen, the KMT leadership was usurped by Chiang Kai Shek.</ins></p><p><ins>Under Dr. Sun the KMT had recognized that all the evils and troubles which China suffered were due to the unequal treaties and western imperialism.</ins></p><p><ins>Chiang Kai Shek betrayed the ideals of Dr. Sun Yat Sen.</ins></p><p><ins>The KMT was not a communist party but Dr. Sun had welcomed capable communist leaders into the party to help to run the country. Chiang Kai Shek who was of mediocre intellect subsequently came under strong American influence. He soon betrayed Dr Sun ideal for a united front and under Strong American influence he turned against the Chinese communists. Chiang Kai Shek had asserted full authoritarian and dictatorial power in the KMT. In his quest for dictatorial power he had trampled on Dr. Sun's three principles for China's national development via ( 1) recovery of sovereign rights - abolish foreign concessions and extra-territorial rights ( 2 ) Socialism - reform the land system and introduction of the rule of law and ( 3 ) People's livelihood - Every Chinese is assured of employment and a just salary for livelihood. All these were not fulfilled. It led to great national discontent and the rise of the more competent and patriotic Chinese communists.</ins></p><p><ins>End of  PART     TWO</ins></p><p><ins>What happened afterwards, can be found in  PART    THREE , which will be published  tomorrow, 30-06-2020</ins></p><p><ins>Southernglory1</ins></p><p><ins>Monday, 29th June, 2020</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="post-footer-line post-footer-line-1"><ins><span class="post-author vcard">Posted by

Singapore cannot continue going down with these issues as the new normal and untouchable. Below are the issues that must be put to an end immediately and must be the core issues for GE 2020 as posted by SSO. </ins></p><p><ins>Singaporeans cannot be forced to accept these as the inevitable by the ruling party. It is their agenda, their way and what they think are good for Singaporeans which is not necessary true. These things have hurt the Singaporeans very badly and gravely but totally ignored by the ruling party or at best a few consoling words that they understood and empathised with the victims of their policies but the policies must continue like the dreadful CECA, population increase and influx of foreign talents as the drug to keep Singapore afloat.</ins></p><ins> 1. There must be a limit to the population this island can hold, not 6.9m or 10m, at least not in the near future. Maybe in another 20 years or more if the environment and technology permit this to grow.</ins><p><ins>2. No more CECA. Kill this agreement immediately.</ins></p><p><ins>3. No more foreign talents. Only real talents. There must be a definition of what is considered talent. Not any shit with fake and funny degrees that are unverifiable is a talent.</ins></p><p><ins>4. There is a limit to contribution to CPF. No one should be forced to contribute to the CPF after age 65 under whatever excuses. Not even to return housing loans and interests past 65. There must be no more liability to the CPF. All money in the CPF must be returned to the rightful owners. Any contribution or savings in the CPF after 65 must be voluntary.</ins></p><p><ins>5. Stop the cost of living from rising cost of everything, fees, fares, fines, cost of housing, rentals etc etc</ins></p><p><ins>6. No more increases in ministerial salary. This should be capped at $1m. No more higher. The $1m must be absolute, no more additional allowances, bonuses etc etc.</ins></p><p><ins>7. No more additional MPs in Parliament. Small country no need so many MPs and mayors and what not.</ins></p><p><ins>8. No more additional political offices, senior ministers, deputy ministers, senior this or that.</ins></p><p><ins>9. Political offices must not be structures as a career like employment, with promotions, bonuses, career path, increments etc etc.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Have Singapore have had enough of the above and want to continue to be deceived and cheated of their rightful place in Singapore, to lose their good jobs to foreigners, their CPF money kena tangkap for life and taxes going up and up and up and they have to pay and pay and pay?</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="post-footer-line post-footer-line-1"><ins><span class="post-author vcard">Posted by

Every Chinese worth his salt must be proud of it. Link: http://mysingaporenews.blogspot.com/2020/06/china-led-by-ccp-is-glorious-rich-and.html </a> </ins></h3><ins> </ins><p dir="ltr"><ins>China led by Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is glorious, modern, rich and powerful. Every Chinese worth his salt should be proud of it.</ins></p><p><ins>PART      ONE</ins></p><p><ins>Prologue  --   Background Story</ins></p><p><ins>What led to the founding of the Chinese Communist Party?</ins></p><p><ins>The European countries like England, France, Germany, Russia, Spain, Portugal, Holland and America and Japan that invaded China from the 1830s to 1940s had brought long streaks of pain, suffering, agony and disasters to China and the Chinese people with the resulting lost of pride, honour, self-respect and dignity had influenced great Chinese patriots to found the Chinese Communist Party to save China and the Chinese people from foreign aggression and to regain back its sovereignty and dignity.</ins></p><p><ins>The road to the founding of the Chinese Communist Party was long, tedious, dangerous and involved great personal selfless sacrifice to the founding leaders and their followers.</ins></p><p><ins>The barbaric West headed by the Evil Empire USA, should stop talking nonsense about the legitimacy of modern China led by the CCP. China is now rich and powerful and this is because it is led by the CCP. The Chinese Communist Party is the precious blood, the saviour and saving star of China and all Chinese people. In the beginning of Chinese history, China is The Yellow Emperor, in Qin Shi Huangdi's time, China is Qin Shi Huangdi, in emperor Han Wu Ti's time China is the Han Dynasty, in the Ming Dynasty time China is the Ming Dynasty  and in this modern time China is CCP and CCP is China. So the West headed by the United States should not befudge the world with their nonsense about the CCP and China. CCP and China is one and the same entity and no one can confuse the fact. The CCP is China and China is the CCP. It is because of the CCP that China and the Chinese people are able after about two hundred years of Western humiliation, to stand up again with pride, self-respect and dignity as declared by Chairman Mao Tse-tung in Beijing on 1st October, 1949. That rapturous joy of happiness of 1st October, 1949  in Beijing is still resounding in all Chinese hearts and minds and the Chinese people are now even more determined to confront and defeat all USA aggressions and hegemony  and ensure that China and the Chinese people will never be bullied and humbled again.</ins></p><p><ins>It is said among the Chinese that whenever China faces mortal danger many Chinese patriotic leaders will mysteriously appear from all corners of China to lead, fight and  save the Chinese nation. The Taiping rebellion in the 1850s to 1860s  would have overthrown the Qin Dynasty had it not been for the treachery of Britain and other Western powers including the United States which helped the Qin Dynasty to cling on to power for the next sixty years until 1911 when it was finally overthrown by Dr. Sun Yat Sen who founded the Republic of China.</ins></p><p><ins>From the 1830s to 1860s England imposed the Opium Wars on China so as to force China to accept payments in opium for goods they bought from China and reversely to force China to pay to England and the western powers in pure Chinese silver dollars for the opium they unloaded on China. France, Germany, America, Russia and Japan joined England to attack and invade China. When China lost the wars each of the invading countries imposed heavy war indemnities on China to the tune of a few hundred million Chinese silver or gold dollars. This indemnities greatly impoverished China and China was still paying the indemnities until October,1949 when Mao's Communist China stopped the illegal payments.</ins></p><p><ins>The Western countries and Japan kept on  supporting the dying Qin Dynasty because it was weak and could be easily manipulated to suit their own agenda of reaping benefits in extra-territorial rights and territorial concessions.</ins></p><p><ins>Dr. Sun Yat Sen Republic power center was in Canton, Southern China. Meanwhile with the downfall of the Qin Dynasty many of the former Qin army generals became little despots and warlords who fought for control of the many provinces in Central and Northern China. The most notorious warlords were Wu Pei-fu, Chang Tso-lin,  Feng Yu Hsiang , Sun Chuan-fang and Yen Hsi-shan. In November,1923 Dr. Sun had created a military college in Canton to train army generals. He had earlier in August, sent a junior general, Chiang Kai Shek to Moscow for training. When Chiang Kai Shek returned from Moscow he was made the commander of the Whampoa military college. Dr. Sun Yat Sen had  for the good of China included the Chinese communists in his government and in the Whampoa military academy. He tried to persuade the nationalist Kuomintang ( KMT ) and the Chinese communist to work together to form a national front to liberate central and northern China from the warlords and to eventually drive out the occupying western powers and Japan from China in pursuit of Chinese sovereignty.</ins></p><p><ins>Yuan Shi Kai the last commander in chief of the Qin Dynasty was persuaded to join the cause of the Republic. He promised to throw in his lot with  the Republic only if he was made   the president of the Chinese Republic. For the sake of unity and the Republic Dr. Sun Yat Sen gave up his presidency in favour of Yuan Shi Kai.</ins></p><p><ins>Dr. Sun's Republican cause was not supported by Western countries, Russia or Japan. He  had appealed to UK, US and other western countries for help to develop China. But he was rebuffed by the western powers who prefered to deal with the warlords who can be pliant and easily manipulated by the western powers for their own agenda and benefits. They feared a strong resurgent republican China would threaten their established privileges and colonial possessions of the Western powers in the Far East.</ins></p><p><ins>For Japan the rise of a strong republican China would banish forever the Japanese dream of establishing a continental empire in Asia. Russia too would not welcome a strong united republic China which is bound to settle accounts with Russia's illegal occupation of large swathes of Chinese territories from Lake Baikal to the Maritime Province in the Pacific coast. The Russian city of Vladivostok in the Pacific coast was formerly a Chinese city by the original name of Haishenwei. Russia grabbed the Chinese maritime province together with Haishenwei from the Chinese in 1885.</ins></p><p><ins>The dying Qin empire was surrounded with many western foes inclusive of Japan and the United States, all anxious to profit from its demise. Thus the new found Chinese Republic of Dr. Sun  Yat Sen was encircled with enemies determined to strangle it at birth.</ins></p><p><ins>The Republic under Yuan Shi Kai's presidency was infested with extreme corruption. The topsy-turvy in the republic gave Yuan Shi Kai a chance to found his new dynasty. He tried to garner the support of the western powers and Japan who were alarmed at the decline of order  and the evident incapacity of the republicans.</ins></p><p><ins>Yuan Shi Kai betrayed the Republicans.</ins></p><p><ins>Yuan secured a large loan from the European powers without the consent of parliament. He either exiled or assassinated the few capable republicans so as to make way for him to proclaim himself  as the emperor-elect of a new dynasty.</ins></p><p><ins>During the First World War  1914 - 1918, Japan was an ally of UK,France and US against Germany. Japan treacherously presented Twenty-One Demands on May 4th, 1915 to the Chinese Republic. If these demands were accepted China would deem to be placed under a virtual Japanese protectorate and extinguished her independence. Yuan Shi Kai accepted some of the demands. The Chinese people were shocked and were roused to real alarm and indignation.</ins></p><p><ins>The Chinese masses were awakened.</ins></p><p><ins>Yuan Shi Kai's plan to found his new dynasty was routed  when on Christmas Day, 1915, the commander of the republic forces in the province of Yunnan rose in revolt and denounced Yuan Shi Kai the new emperor pretender. Soon all other commanders joined the revolt. Yuan Shi Kai had lost all support from the army and so he dropped all his plans for his emperor inauguration in March, 1916. He died in June 1916 forlorn and disgraced.</ins></p><p><ins>Under Yuan Shi Kai the young republic was filled with extreme corruption. Members of parliament were nothing but selfish, self-seeking careerists who sought for self-aggrandizement and personal fortune. The Chinese people saw through the corruption of Western Democracy. In the name of parliament they had seen gross and shameless corruption. In the name of democracy they had seen nothing but weak and bad government, military usurpation, violation of law, every kind of oppression  and national decline. Chen Tu-hsiu a professor at Peita University and one of the founding members of the Chinese Communist Party had by mid 1920, completely lost faith with Western democracy as he observed that  "Western democracy was no more than a tool used by the bourgeoisie  to swindle mankind in order to maintain political power."</ins></p><p><ins>By the end of the second decade 1920-1930 of the 20th century the Chinese people were completely disillusioned with Western Democracy. The Chinese felt Western Democracy was not the solution to Chinese society. It was tacitly abandoned by the revolutionary element of the Chinese Communist Party.</ins></p><p><ins>During the First World War the Chinese observed the visceral behaviour of the west with disgust and western prestige was greatly shaken and despised. The western powers had bullied the corrupt and powerless Peking government into declaring war on Germany so that the allied powers might seize the German assets in China and the German ships in Chinese ports. This affair made a very bad impression on the Chinese.</ins></p><p><ins>Treachery of the West and Japan  on China.</ins></p><p><ins>After the war the allied powers handed over the Shantung province to Japan. China an ally was to be robbed off for the benefit of Japan. This indecent treatment aroused in China a tremendous fiery storm of nationalist feeling in 4th May,1919. It forced the Chinese delegation led by Wellington Khoo at Versailles, France not to sign the treaty. The republican government had acted in dignified self-assertion due entirely to the unofficial forces of the outraged patriotism of the students and the demands of the entire country.</ins></p><p><ins>What happened afterwards will appear in  PART  TWO   which will be published  tomorrow, , 29-06-2020</ins></p><p><ins>Southernglory1</ins></p><p><ins>Sunday, 28th June, 2020</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="post-footer-line post-footer-line-1"><ins><span class="post-author vcard">Posted by

To the readers, the impression of the two candidates, just by looking at these pics would create very different perceptions and impressions of them, positive and negative, likeable, acceptable, unpleasant etc etc.</ins></p><p class="separator"><ins>Actually I did not want to post Mun Wai's pic here as it does not do justice to him as like many pics of him posted in the social media too did not make him look good. I have to post this here just to show the impact of what a good and decent pic or vice versa can do to the candidate. Look at Ivan Lim's pic, so handsome, so likeable. Auntie killer look, or boy next door look.</ins></p><p class="separator"><ins>Incidentally both pics were taken from www.theindependent.sg. I would suggest to PSP to have a word with theindependent.sg and offer them pics of their candidates that they would like to use if theindependent.sg did not have any decent looking pics to post. Do not underestimate the power of the media, images and the press. Organisations paid millions to PR agencies just to make sure the pics of their people and organisations came out right and not offensive or unattractive.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="post-footer-line post-footer-line-1"><ins><span class="post-author vcard">Posted by

The inconceiveable has happened to the opposition parties in Singapore. The days of being intractable, stubborn, selfish, inflexible, not negotiable are over. The days when every opposition party was thinking only of itself, refuse to cooperate, negotiate, refuse to butt when contesting in the GE and stubbornly engaging in now win 3 corner or 4 corner fights are looking like history if what were happening in the last few days are going to be the new ethos of the day.</ins></p><p><ins>Kenneth Jeyeratnam of Reform Party has graciously concede the West Coast GRC to Tan Cheng Bock's Progress Singapore Party, a GRC Reform Party had fought for several GEs. This was unthinkable a few days ago but it happened. And People's Power Party has given way to Reform Party in the single seat Radin Mas constituency to avoid a 3 corner fight.  Can anyone believe this is happening in the opposition camp?</ins></p><p><ins>If this is the trend going forward, there could be more amiable settlement and lesser 3 corner fights in this GE and puts the opposition camp in better light. In past GE, the inflexible and recalcitrant stand of the opposition camp were a joke, making them looking so silly fighting a no win GE with 3 and 4 corner fights when a straight 1 to 1 fight was already a lost cause. It made the voters wondered what the hell was going on, why contest when it was sure lose with weak opposition candidates engaging in 3 corner fights against the incumbent PAP.</ins></p><p><ins></ins></p><p><ins>Let's hope this new trend will be the order of  the day. Let's hope no silly loser party would still insist on 3 corner fights to guarantee losing the contest and even their deposit money. There is hope and optimism with these two announcements. There is an awakening, the scale in front of the eyes have been removed and the opposition parties are now able to see more clearly and to put themselves in a better position, a more credible position, to contest this GE.</ins></p><p><ins>Another positive news is that Jee Say has dissolved his Singapore First Party so as not to dilute the opposition camp. With Ang Yong Guan in the camp of PSP, maybe more of Singapore First members would follow suit to strengthen the PSP.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>But be prepared, be sure that there would still be some clowns surfacing to spoil the broth, for obvious reasons...clowns are clowns.</ins></p><p><ins>No more heroes or prima donnas in the opposition camp. Every party must be flexible and be willing to do some horse trading to give themselves a better chance to challenge the incumbent party and to replace them. The voters too would have more confidence when they see the opposition parties are serious and are acting seriously and rightly and strategically to want to represent them and to win the election.</ins></p><p><ins>May the force of goodness be with the opposition camp. When the opposition camp can get their acts together, it will shake the earth and send fear to the ruling party. No more easy walkovers because of stupid infighting among the opposition camps.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="post-footer-line post-footer-line-1"><ins><span class="post-author vcard">Posted by

calls to step in to halt the extradition trial of Chinese Huawei 
executive Meng Wanzhou, saying it would risk more arrests of Canadians 
overseas to pressure Ottawa.</ins></p><p><ins>His comments were in response to a 
letter penned by 19 Canadian former lawmakers and diplomats, backed by 
the family of ex-diplomat Michael Kovrig, urging Ottawa to free Meng....</ins></p><p><ins>But their proposal is shortsighted, he said.</ins></p><p><ins>It would, he 
explained, "demonstrate to China that all they or another country has to
 do is randomly arrest a handful of Canadians to put political pressure 
on a government to do what (they) want," he said.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>And that "would endanger the millions of Canadians who live and travel overseas every single year."</ins></p><p><ins>"We
 cannot allow political pressures or random arrests of Canadian citizens
 (by foreign governments) to influence the functioning of our justice 
system."</ins></p><p><ins>The above AFP report only reveals how stupid this boy is. His stupid reason for rejecting the proposal to exchange two Canadians charged with crimes that would lead to death penalties against a fake commercial crime of Huawei executive is ludicrous.  He is prepared to risk losing the lives of two Canadians for his involvement in an American political conspiracy which has nothing to do with Canada and nothing to gain for Canada except to be called 'good boy' by Trump.</ins></p><p><ins>And he is alleging that there would be more arbitrary arrests of Canadians by China if he did the exchange.  Now who did the silly arbitrary arrest of a Chinese citizen on transit in a Canadian airport in the first place? And how did the two Canadians got arrested for espionage if this silly boy has not agreed to arrest a Chinese citizen on the calling of the Americans? He cannot see his own stupidity in getting himself and Canada involved in a political conspiracy to start this sad story and stubbornly wanting to continue down this dreadful road that would not only lead to the life imprisonment or execution of two Canadians, but also the economy and trade between China and Canada.  To this boy PM, the lives of two Canadians are worth losing to play the dirty game of the Americans.</ins></p><p><ins>All for what? For being in the good book of clown Trump and his gangsters in the White House? The Canadians should slap this idiotic boy to wake him up from his folly and save the lives of the two Canadians and the Canadian economy and not looking like another silly ass in the world stage.</ins></p><p><ins>Children should not get involved in the dirty games that adults are playing without knowing what is happening. They will end up the losers.  Unfortunately this idiotic boy cannot see it.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="post-footer-line post-footer-line-1"><ins><span class="post-author vcard">Posted by

and foreign policy interests by encouraging US industry to fully engage 
and advocate for US technologies to become international standards."</ins></p><p><ins>The
 Commerce Department publicly announced the move later on Monday. It 
noted that US participation in standards-setting "influences the future 
of 5G, autonomous vehicles, artificial intelligence and other 
cutting-edge technologies."...</ins></p><p><ins>"Confusion stemming from the May 2019 entity list update had 
inadvertently sidelined US companies from some technical standards 
conversations, putting them at a strategic disadvantage," said Naomi 
Wilson, senior director of policy for Asia at the Information Technology
 Industry Council, which represents companies including Amazon.com Inc, 
Qualcomm Inc and Intel Corp.</ins></p><p><ins>"This much-needed clarification will 
allow companies to once again compete and lead in these foundational 
activities that help enable the rollout of advanced technologies, such 
as 5G and AI, across markets," she said. "We look forward to reviewing 
the rule once posted and working with the administration on 
implementation."</ins></p><p><ins>Reuters exclusively reported last month that the amendment had been drafted and was awaiting approval.</ins></p><p><ins>Can you believe it, the Americans are trying to claim leadership in 5G technology when they have none, and wanting to set the standards and specifications for this technology? After banning Huawei from the American market they suddenly realised their stupidity by excluding themselves from being a player in 5G technology, no speaking rights, and quickly rushed in to want to be the leader and to set the agenda! This is like a blind man crashing into a meeting to tell the group that he is there to show them the way, on what can be done, what cannot and how it should be done.</ins></p><p><ins>5G is a revelation on how backward the Americans have fallen behind the Chinese and desperately grabbing at straws trying to thwart the progress made by Huawei, China, and even wanting to lead the conversation.</ins></p><p><ins>When you are behind, backward, you are behind and backward. Stop pretending otherwise. Huawei China is the pipe piper in this race and setting the standards. There is no need for someone who did not know what is 5G to gatecrash into a meeting to call the shot.</ins></p><p><ins>And stop spreading the lie that China is stealing American technology when there is nothing to steal in the first place. It is the Americans that will be stealing Chinese technology on 5G.</ins></p><p><ins>PS. And Singapore awarded 5G infrastructure building to Nokia and Ericsson.  Do these companies have 5G technology? If not, would Huawei, out of contention for whatever reasons, become the subcontractor to these companies to finish the jobs for them if they can't? Why not give job to Huawei who is world leader in 5G technology? Would this become an expensive mistake for awarding the contract to companies that are far behind Huawei in 5G technology? Singapore not going for the best and cheapest? Funny, funny, funny.</ins></p><p><ins></ins></p><p><ins>It is like letting the Americans to dictate the regulations on 5G technology when they did not know what 5G is all about.</ins></p><ins> This brings back to the time when contracts were given to foreign companies who then subcontracted to Singapore companies to do the job and got paid the giant share of the contract while Sinkies did all the work and got peanuts.

No bicycle is allowed inside the stadium. They do not want to know how big is the bicycle, adult bicycle or children bicycle. They did not want to know big or small, normal or foldable. Bicycle should be parked outside the stadium bicycle park. So neat and clean. It is their rules.</ins></p><p><ins>How big is a stadium compared to a train? SMRT allowed foldable bikes to be brought into the train cabin. A stadium has no place for a foldable bike.</ins></p><p><ins>When there are major events in the stadium it is understandable that you would not want bicycles to be inside the stadium. But when there is no event, when people are using the stadium for training and leisure, and families brought their children to play, with their little bikes, not allowed. It is the stadium rule.</ins></p><p><ins>Long long ago there was no foldable bike when the rules were made, just like when the stadiums were built, just like when the trains were built. Then they invented foldable bikes. So how? It is very easy to say a bicycle is a bicycle, no need to think further, no need to bother about new inventions and changes over time.</ins></p><p><ins>Is a foldable bike a bicycle when folded?</ins></p><p><ins>Anyway when the authorities think and act like they are the rulers of the people, rules are made by them to suit their interest and agenda and convenience and to be followed.

The report also raised the question whether Hsien Yang would stand in the GE and his reply was that it would be made known at the appropriate time.</ins><p><ins>I called this pic frightening because wherever Hsien Yang is going to stand, his chances of winning is very high. And if he stands in Tanjong Pagar, his father's stronghold, he cannot be defeated. Now where would PAP put Chan Chun Sing if this is the case? He has to be bundled out to some safe constituency if there is one, or his second in line premiership dream is going to crash prematurely. I don't think he would dare to face Hsien Yang head on.  And this would apply to any other top ministers or lesser ministers as well.  Facing Hsien Yang is like facing doomsday.</ins></p><p><ins>Like it or not Hsien Yang is a heavy weight of the opposition camp and is good enough to take on any minister and win. As to the question of whether he is standing, just ask this question. As a man, if his wife and son are under seiged, can he stand idly by and do nothing? The situation demands him to stand up to defend his family, his loved ones. There is no other way out for him. Doing nothing is not acceptable. Just throwing some money to support the opposition camp is barely enough.</ins></p><p><ins>Someone is going to wet his pants.  Oops, a few not one, as Hsien Yang is going to helm a GRC team. This is really unbelieveable. In the past it was a PAP minister helming a GRC to give weight and win. Now the opposition camp has a heavy weight to helm a GRC and win against the PAP.</ins></p><p><ins>Can you believe that? I am wondering who would dare to throw shit at Hsien Yang and think he could get away with it. Hsien Yang is the game changer in opposition politics.</ins></p><p><ins>And there is Cheng Bock in the West Coast GRC, his home base where he built his political career. His supporters are there waiting for him.  PSP is good for two GRCs helmed by Cheng Bock and Hsien Yang. The time has come for the opposition camp to make a dent in the PAP armour and to walk into Parliament in force.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="post-footer-line post-footer-line-1"><ins><span class="post-author vcard">Posted by

 has called General Election 2020 to "clear the decks" for a fresh 
mandate for the Government.... he has advised President Halimah Yacob to dissolve 
Parliament and issue the Writ of Election.</ins></p><p><ins>An election now will give the new Government a fresh five-year 
mandate to focus on the national agenda and the difficult decisions it 
will have to make, the Prime Minister said. ...</ins></p><p><ins>Nomination Day will be on Jun 30. Polling Day will be on Jul
 10, a Friday, the Elections Department said, adding that Polling Day 
in any General Election is a public holiday.</ins></p><p><ins>Singapore made a big mistake in the last GE. Would Singaporeans make amends and clear the deck this time, clear the dead woods, and bring in a new team, a new govt to look into some very frightening and existential issues like keeping the island for Singaporeans, not foreigners now called new citizens and coming in in big numbers, like creating more good jobs for Singaporeans instead of good jobs for foreigners, security guards and taxi driver jobs for Singaporeans, like giving our fresh graduates a chance to land a job instead of giving jobs to fresh foreign graduates with funny degrees or fake degrees from God knows where and no need to verify, like giving jobs to people who can do the jobs, never mind got degree or no degree, like blindly going to bring in more foreign talons without conditions, without qualifications on what is foreign talents and what is not and what jobs that Singaporeans can do and no need to give to foreign talons.</ins></p><p><ins>This GE must be a redefining moment for the daft Singaporeans, the zombies that did not know that their little precious island has been taken over by foreigners, with more than a couple of millions of them here, almost making Singaporeans a minority and many driven to joblessness, premature retirement, under employment and serving, ferrying or working for foreigners with half past six degrees, funny degrees and fake degrees that should not be employed at all. Nobody cares to verify the numbers of cheats and fakes working here and stealing the jobs and lunches of Singaporeans who paid a fortune to earn their degrees from world best universities but found unemployable.</ins></p><p><ins>What the hell is going on? Would Singaporeans make this GE count and turn their fortune and misery around? Yes, clear the deck, clear the swamp, clear the dead woods, clear those that do not think it is important to attend parliament sitting, or sleeping in Parliament. Being a people's representative is not a part time job with a big part time allowance that most full time jobs cannot match.</ins></p><p><ins>Time to take back our country before we lose it.

TONY EASTLEY: Bird flu has largely slipped from the public's consciousness but now the UN is warning authorities to be again on high alert.<br><br>It says the virus appears to be returning and a mutant strain is spreading across parts of Asia.<br><br>It says there could be a spill-over to humans but there's no need, at this stage, for any alarm.<br><br>Lexi Metherell reports.<br><br>LEXI METHERELL: Bird flu is back.<br><br>Outbreaks of the virus peaked in 2006 before it was eradicated from most countries. <br><br>But now the United Nations is warning the virus could rear its head again on a major scale with unpredictable risks for human health. <br><br>JAN SLINGENBERGH: We've seen a comeback of the virus in different countries in Asia. And we believe that this virus is doing very well in poultry, chicken to chicken transmission, but it also does show quite good affinity with several wild bird species.<br><br>LEXI METHERELL: And that's the concern for the UN.<br><br>Wild birds can carry the virus further than domestic birds.<br><br>The virus has remained entrenched in Bangladesh, China, Egypt, India, Indonesia and Vietnam, and the UN is concerned about a mutant strain of the virus spreading across Asia.<br><br>It says a variant of the virus has appeared in China and Vietnam which appears able to side step Vaccines.<br><br>The UN is concerned the new form of the virus could spread to Cambodia, Thailand and Malaysia, as well as the Korean Peninsula and Japan.<br><br>Jan Slingenbergh is the senior animal health officer with the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization. <br><br>JAN SLINGENBERGH: We are moving into fall in the northern hemisphere and because of that we do expect an increased flair up. Mainly because of migratory bird affected viruses in the areas stretching from eastern Asia all the way to Siberia and the Arabian Peninsula and perhaps the Black Sea Basin.<br><br>LEXI METHERELL: Jan Slingenbergh says it's time for authorities to ramp up surveillance and preparations for an outbreak. <br><br>JAN SLINGENBERGH: We are worried about veterinary services to become ready and to make sure that they early detect and response to any flair up of viruses.<br><br>LEXI METHERELL: But at this stage the UN and other experts say public health authorities don't need to worry about the virus spilling over into humans. <br><br>University of Sydney Professor, Robert Booy has studied bird flu extensively.<br><br>ROBERT BOOY: Bird flu has been around more than 10 years now and largely restricted to Asia and South-East Asia. In humans we've seen less than 600 cases in that time, but over half of them died. No cases whatsoever in Australia and for the moment I see no prospect of Australia being affected.<br><br>LEXI METHERELL: We've seen this variant of the virus now, the UN is warning that it's mutated, is there a risk that could spill over into humans?<br><br>ROBERT BOOY: The concern with the new mutation in Vietnam is that it will spread through poultry and wild birds in Asia; so neighbouring countries to begin with - Thailand and China.<br><br>The mutation has resulted in the virus becoming resistant to the vaccine they were using in birds, in poultry and therefore the vaccine isn't working as well as it was. It doesn't mean that the virus is more transmissible, that's a different set of mutations that need to occur before that problem will happen.<br><br>So we've seen this virus, as I've said, more than 10 years. It still hasn't learnt how to transmit well between humans. It could do, but for the moment it's not showing a sign of doing that.<br><br>TONY EASTLEY: Professor Robert Booy of the University of Sydney ending that report by Lexi Metherell.

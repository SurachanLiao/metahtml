</p><p>Libyan leader General Muammar Qaddafi has some advice for U.S. foreign policy: forget a two state solution in Israel, re-trace the mis-steps of the Bush Administration in Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo, and <a href="/%E2%80%9CIf%20there%20is%20a%20state%20in%20the%20West%20Bank,%20Israel%20will%20feel%20threatened%20and%20the%20conflict%20will%20continue.%20%20The%20old%20approach%20is%20wrong%E2%80%94it%20will%20only%20bring%20destruction%20to%20the%20Palestinians,%20destruction%20to%20the%20Jews,%20destruction%20to%20the%20whole%20world,%E2%80%9D%20he%20continued.%20%20%E2%80%9COne%20democratic%20state,%20this%20is%20the%20solution%20I%20insist%20on%20because%20I%20think%20the%20new%20generation%20will%20accept%20it%E2%80%A6We%20want%20the%20Jews%20to%20be%20save%20and%20live%20in%20security%20with%20the%20Palestinians.%20%20The%20Jewish%20and%20Palestinian%20youth%20want%20to%20live%20together,%20to%20intermarry,%20to%20no%20longer%20be%20enemies.%E2%80%9D" title="Associated Press" target="_blank">talk to Osama Bin Laden</a>. &#8220;I think Osama bin Laden is a person who can be given a chance&#8230;Maybe he wants peace.&#8221; </p><p>The Leader, as he is affectionately (and mandatorily) referred to in Libya, spoke at Georgetown University via satellite last night. And the view from Qaddafi-cam looks a characteristic mix of suprisingly rational rhetoric with a healthy dose of crazy. </p><p>Qaddafi&#8217;s proposal for a one-state solution in Israel was also laid out in a New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/22/opinion/22qaddafi.html?_r=1&amp;ref=opinion">op-ed</a> today.(&#8220;<a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idINIndia-37584820090121" title="Reuters" target="_blank">We can call [the single state] Isratine</a>&#8220;, he suggested at Georgetown.) He likewise offered a <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2009/01/21/america/NA-US-Libya.php" title="Associated Press" target="_blank">candid admission</a> that petro-state Libya is suffering from the low oil prices. </p><p>In the war on terror, Qaddafi described a window of opportunity for Obama to reach out to a select few. Without explanation, he concluded that, though Ayman al-Zawahiri is a thug, Bin Laden might be more rational &#8220;Maybe we can have a dialogue with [bin Laden] and find out the reason that led him in this direction,&#8221; Qaddafi <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idINIndia-37584820090121" title="Reuters" target="_blank">suggested</a>. </p><p>Yeah, I&#8217;m sure Obama will take that under advisement.  </p><p>As our photo essay so eloquently put it, The Leader has <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.php?story_id=4464" title="FP" target="_blank">got his groove back</a>. The only question is &#8212; does Obama want to dance?</p></article>

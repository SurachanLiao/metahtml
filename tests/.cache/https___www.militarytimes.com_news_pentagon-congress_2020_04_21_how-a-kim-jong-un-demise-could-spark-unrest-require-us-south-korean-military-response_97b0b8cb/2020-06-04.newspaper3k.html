However, the Yonhap News Agency, a South Korean-government funded organization, later tweeted out that there were &#8220;no unusual signs&#8221; of Kim&#8217;s health.</p> <p class="o-articleBody__text a-body1 element element-paragraph"> But even if he isn&#8217;t on his death bed, Kim does have health issues and his exit from the stage would create turmoil, experts say.</p> <p class="o-articleBody__text a-body1 element element-paragraph"> Without a designated heir there will be &#8220;chaos, human suffering, instability,&#8221; retired South Korean Lt. Gen. Chun In-Bum, the former head of his nation&#8217;s special operations forces, told Military Times. &#8220;It&#8217;s bad news for everyone.&#8221;</p> <p id="300x250-1-in-story" class="o-articleBody__ad --ad-300X250 pb-ad-container 300x250-1-in-story pb-ad pb-ad-prod ad-300X250"></p>  <p class="o-articleBody__text a-body1 element element-paragraph"> David Maxwell, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies think tank who has two decades of military service in Asia said a U.S. and South Korean military reaction to that upheaval could require an effort that &#8220;will make Afghanistan and Iraq pale in comparison."</p> <p class="o-articleBody__text a-body1 element element-paragraph"> Like Chun, Maxwell, a retired Special Forces colonel who served with him, said a lack of clear succession would set chaos into motion.</p> <p class="o-articleBody__text a-body1 element element-paragraph"> Kim Il Sung designated his son successor in 1973 and the Kim Il-sung designated his son success in 2009 or 2010.</p> <p class="o-articleBody__signupForm a-fullBleed--at-small a-fullBleed--at-xs a-fullBleed--at-medium a-inset --size-s a-greyBox --grey-50 container signup newsletter">         </p>     <h1> Fear of missing out?</h1> <p class="newsletter-description">Sign up for the Early Bird Brief - a daily roundup of military and defense news stories from around the globe.</p> <p class="signup-form col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 nopad">      </p> <p class="confirm hide col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 nopad"> <h1 class="nl-signup-heading"> Thanks for signing up. </h1> </p> <p class="nl-signup-disclaimer">By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief.</p> <img alt="Military Times Logo" class="logo" src="//www.militarytimes.com/pb/resources/assets/svg/military-logo.svg" width="150px">   <p class="o-articleBody__text a-body1 element element-paragraph"> &#8220;It is unknown whether Kim Jong-un has designated a successor,&#8221; said Maxwell.

It will be further complicated by the coronavirus.</p> <p id="300x250-3-in-story" class="o-articleBody__ad --ad-300X250 pb-ad-container 300x250-3-in-story pb-ad pb-ad-prod ad-300X250"></p>  <p class="o-articleBody__text a-body1 element element-paragraph"> &#8220;South Korea, China, and Japan (via boat) are going to have to deal with potential large scale refugee flows,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Units of the North Korean People&#8217;s Army are going to compete for resources and survival. This will lead to internal conflict among units and could escalate to widespread civil war.&#8221;</p> <p class="o-articleBody__text a-body1 element element-paragraph"> But even such internal strife won&#8217;t hinder the North&#8217;s animus toward the outside or its willingness to fight if they feel it is warranted.</p> <p class="o-articleBody__text a-body1 element element-paragraph"> &#8220;Since North Korea is a Guerrilla Dynasty built on the myth of anti-Japanese partisan warfare we can expect large numbers of the military (1.2 million active duty and 6 million reserves) to resist any and all outside foreign intervention to include from South Korea,&#8221; said Maxwell.</p> <p class="o-articleBody__text a-body1 element element-paragraph"> And then there are the North Korea weapons of mass destruction.</p> <p id="300x250-4-in-story" class="o-articleBody__ad --ad-300X250 pb-ad-container 300x250-4-in-story pb-ad pb-ad-prod ad-300X250"></p>  <p class="o-articleBody__text a-body1 element element-paragraph"> &#8220;Lastly the ROK/US alliance is going to have to be prepared to secure and render safe the entire WMD program, nuclear, chemical, biological weapons and stockpiles, manufacturing facilities, and human infrastructure (scientists and technicians),&#8221; said Maxwell. &#8220;This is a contingency operation that will make Afghanistan and Iraq pale in comparison.&#8221;</p> <p class="o-articleBody__text a-body1 element element-paragraph"> The U.S./South Korean alliance &#8220;has contingency plans for this,&#8221; Maxwell said. &#8220;It will be a combined effort because neither South Korea nor the U.S. can execute this alone.&#8221;</p> <p class="o-articleBody__text a-body1 element element-paragraph"> Those plans, however, have been &#8220;too long-neglected,&#8221; said Maxwell, adding that the cancellation of many high-level training exercises hasn&#8217;t helped.</p> <p class="o-articleBody__text a-body1 element element-paragraph"> In addition, the &#8220;friction of burden sharing as well as the move of U.S. forces out of Seoul to Camp Humphreys&#8221; means &#8220;the alliance is just not as well trained, ready, and solid as it has been in the past.&#8221;</p> <p id="300x250-5-in-story" class="o-articleBody__ad --ad-300X250 pb-ad-container 300x250-5-in-story pb-ad pb-ad-prod ad-300X250"></p>  <p class="o-articleBody__text a-body1 element element-paragraph"> Chun, the retired South Korean general, largely agreed with Maxwell about the refugees and potential civil war in the north, but does not see a U.S./South Korean military incursion past the 38th Parallel.</p> <p class="o-articleBody__text a-body1 element element-paragraph"> &#8220;What are we going to do? March in there?? Let the Chinese do it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The DPRK is a sovereign country. Anyone going in there, including the Chinese, would be crazy. The ROK/US has a bad plan with bad assumptions. It will get us into a nuclear war.&#8221;</p> <p class="related-stories"> </p> <p class="addthis_inline_share_toolbox"></p> </div>

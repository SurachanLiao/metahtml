<div><p><strong>COVID-19:</strong> This page is constantly updated to reflect the latest changes to the calendar of summits, ministerial meetings and video conferences.<br>The list of meetings of the Council preparatory bodies is included in the following document:</p>
<p>The Council is supported by the Committee of Permanent Representatives of the Governments of the Member States to the European Union (<strong>Coreper</strong>) and more than <strong>150 highly specialised working parties and committees</strong>, known as the 'Council preparatory bodies'.</p>
<p>The preparatory bodies can be divided into two main categories:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Committees set up by the treaties, intergovernmental decisions or by Council act</strong> - they are mostly permanent and often have an appointed or elected chairperson</li>
<li><strong>Committees and working parties set up by Coreper</strong> - these deal with very specific subjects and are chaired by the delegate of the country holding the rotating 6-month presidency of the Council.</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition, <strong>ad hoc</strong> committees can be created for a specific purpose and cease to exist when their task is fulfilled.</p>

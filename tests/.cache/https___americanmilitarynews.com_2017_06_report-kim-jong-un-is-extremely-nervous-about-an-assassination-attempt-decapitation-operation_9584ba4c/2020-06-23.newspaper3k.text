Kim Jong Un might fire off missiles on a whim, but the North Korean leader lives in fear – of his own assassination.

South Korean’s intelligence agency told lawmakers last week that the communist leader feels “extremely nervous” about possible plots to eliminate him, according to a report in the Korea Herald.

South Korean National Intelligence Services told a private session of parliament that Un now prefers to use “subordinates’ cars, such as a Lexus car,” and not his personal Mercedes-Benz 600, said Rep. Lee Cheol-woo of the main opposition Liberty Party of Korea, who attended the meeting.

It has been reported that some nations want to establish a team to take out Pyongyang’s leadership, and the unit would be in charge of eliminating Kim Jong Un, according to the Korea Herald.

“Kim is so engrossed with collecting information about the ‘decapitation operation’ through his intelligence agency,” Lee said, according to the Korea Herald, referring to the operation that could be targeting him.

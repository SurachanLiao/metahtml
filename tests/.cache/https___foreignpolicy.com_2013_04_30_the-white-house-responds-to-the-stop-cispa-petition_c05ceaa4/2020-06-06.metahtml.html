</p><p>Just in case there was any question, the White House says that the now dead-in-the-water Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act, CISPA, does not do enough to protect privacy rights.</p><p> "Even though a bill [CISPA] went on to pass the House of Representatives and includes some important improvements over previous versions, this legislation still doesn&#8217;t adequately address our fundamental concerns," Todd Park, the U.S. chief technology officer, and Michael Daniel, the White House&#8217;s cybersecurity coordinator, said today in the Obama administration&#8217;s official reaction to a petition on whitehouse.gov titled, Stop CISPA. </p><p> The White House threatened to veto CISPA earlier this month. However, that action is likely unnecessary after Senate staffers indicated that their chamber will not take up CISPA following the House&#8217;s passage of the bill last week. (The Senate is in the early stages of crafting its own cyber-information-sharing bill, Senate intelligence committee chair, Dianne Feinstein told Killer Apps recently.)</p><p> Still, the White House, Senate, and House all want legislation that, at a minimum, allows businesses to quickly share information on cyberthreats with each other and the government, as Killer Apps reported last week. &#160;</p><p> To meet the approval of the White House and the Democrat-controlled Senate, any such bill would probably have to protect civil liberties by mandating that personally identifiable information be scrubbed from any data shared by companies, requiring that data be shared with a civilian government agency like the Department of Homeland Security instead of going straight to a military organization, and providing limited protections from lawsuits for companies that violate antitrust laws when sharing cyberthreat information. </p></article>

But now, in the wake of North Korea&#8217;s most threatening nuclear test earlier this month, the South has stepped up their state of alert.</p><p>That nuclear test may very well warrant such a heightened state of readiness. The September 9th test marked not only North Korea&#8217;s largest device ever detonated but also the first time they were able to mount a nuclear device on a ballistic missile, which exponentially increases the ways in which they could actually use such a device in a nuclear strike.</p><p>Many world leaders swiftly condemned the test, with President Obama <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/08/asia/north-korea-seismic-activity/" target="_blank">stating</a>, &#8220;To be clear, the United States does not, and never will, accept North Korea as a nuclear state,&#8221; adding that North Korea will face &#8220;consequences to its unlawful and dangerous actions.&#8221; </p><p>Of course, as dangerous as North Korea&#8217;s test may be to the country&#8217;s enemies abroad, like the United States, it&#8217;s that much more dangerous to the country&#8217;s neighboring enemies, like South Korea and Japan. Just after the test, Obama stated that he spoke with the leaders of both countries by phone and that they would &#8220;take additional significant steps, including new sanctions.&#8221;</p><p>However, given this week&#8217;s statements from defense minister Han Min-koo, we can be sure that South Korea has some even more severe countermeasures in mind.</p><p>Next, read up on <a href="https://allthatsinteresting.com/north-korea-bans-sarcasm" target="_blank">North Korea&#8217;s recent efforts to ban sarcasm</a>.

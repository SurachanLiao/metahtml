With&#160;two connections, experts argue, North Korean Internet users could expect&#160;a higher international bandwidth capacity as well as a greater&#160;ability to withstand attacks.</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">&#8220;In practical terms, [having multiple connections] will allow additional resiliency if one of those connections were to be rendered inactive for any number of reasons,&#8221;&#160;said&#160;Doug Madory, director of Internet analysis at Oracle Dyn.</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">The new connection &#8220;will improve the resiliency of their network and increase their ability to conduct command and control over those activities,&#8221; Bryce Boland, cybersecurity firm FireEye&#8217;s chief technology office for the Asia-Pacific region, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nkorea-internet/russian-firm-provides-new-internet-connection-to-north-korea-idUSKCN1C70D2">told Reuters</a>.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">On Saturday, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-signed-presidential-directive-ordering-actions-to-pressure-north-korea/2017/09/30/97c6722a-a620-11e7-b14f-f41773cd5a14_story.html?utm_term=.09dfd8ce99f0&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_9">The Washington Post reported</a> that a U.S. Cyber Command operation had targeted hackers at North Korea&#8217;s military spy agency, the Reconnaissance General Bureau. The U.S. operation used what is known as a denial-of-service attack, choking off access to the Internet for North Korean users. It ended Saturday, shortly before North Korea's new Internet connection went online.</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Martyn Williams, an expert on North Korean technology&#160;who first reported on the new connection at the <a href="https://www.38north.org/2017/10/mwilliams100117/">website 38 North</a>, wrote that &#8220;relying on one Internet provider has always left North Korea in a precarious situation.&#8221; In 2014, after a cyberattack on Sony Pictures that was widely attributed to North Korea, the country suddenly lost its connection to the Internet in what&#160;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/23/world/asia/attack-is-suspected-as-north-korean-internet-collapses.html?mcubz=3">many suspected</a>&#160;was U.S. retaliation.</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">TransTeleCom is part of Russian Railways, a huge state-owned infrastructure and transport company formerly headed by&#160;Vladimir Yakunin, a U.S.-censured former KGB agent considered a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Although&#160;Yakunin was reportedly ousted in 2015,&#160;the organization still has deep ties to the&#160;president, experts say.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">&#8220;This means that the opening of the connection has Russian government backing behind it,&#8221; said Andrei Soldatov, co-author of the book &#8220;<a href="https://read.amazon.com/kp/embed?asin=B012271TXA&amp;preview=newtab&amp;linkCode=kpe&amp;ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_R.fPzbFQSTPXD&amp;tag=thewaspos09-20">The Red Web: The Struggle Between Russia's Digital Dictators and the New Online Revolutionaries</a>.&#8221;</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">TransTeleCom did not respond to a request for comment, but a spokesman for the company told <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d1d48dd0-5366-3fd8-b0bc-bcab64101a17">the Financial Times</a> that it has a long relationship with Pyongyang and has &#8220;historically had a backbone network interface with North Korea under an agreement with Korea Posts and Telecommunications Corp. struck in 2009.&#8221;</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Madory said it was not clear to him exactly how&#160;TransTeleCom built the infrastructure needed for the new network. If it needed to lay&#160;fiber optic lines, it would likely have taken &#8220;days or weeks,&#8221; Madory said, though that installation time may have been shorter if there was existing infrastructure that could have been reused.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">U.S. officials say that as China has increased economic pressure on North Korea in line with U.N. sanctions, Russian entrepreneurs have stepped into the gap, quietly <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/how-russia-quietly-undercuts-sanctions-intended-to-stop-north-koreas-nuclear-program/2017/09/11/f963867e-93e4-11e7-8754-d478688d23b4_story.html?utm_term=.e8226fe16c3b&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_20">undermining sanctions</a> with illicit trade and smuggling.&#160;In an email, Kent Boydston of the&#160;Peterson Institute for International Economics said it was unclear if the new network broke any sanctions.</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">&#8220;Telecommunications haven&#8217;t been specifically targeted by U.N. Security Council resolutions, although it&#8217;s hard to see how this wouldn&#8217;t violate UNSCR 2375&#8217;s proscription of joint ventures with the North Korean government,&#8221; Boydston wrote, referring to the strict sanctions imposed&#160;<a href="http://unscr.com/en/resolutions/2375">in September by the United Nations</a>.</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">The new network was an &#8220;example of Russia stepping in once North Korea feels pressure,&#8221; said Anthony Ruggiero,&#160;a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and a former U.S. Treasury Department official.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">More on WorldViews</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md "><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/09/11/why-havent-sanctions-on-north-korea-worked-two-very-different-theories/?utm_term=.f42aff109854&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_26">Why haven&#8217;t sanctions on North Korea worked?

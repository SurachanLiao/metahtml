A police officer searches a San Leandro, Calif., car dealership shortly after multiple vehicles were stolen on Monday, many of them super-pricey and some driven through showroom glass. Police say many smash-and-grab thefts have been carried out not by isolated, individual looters, but rather by caravans of well-coordinated criminals blending in with George Floyd protesters.

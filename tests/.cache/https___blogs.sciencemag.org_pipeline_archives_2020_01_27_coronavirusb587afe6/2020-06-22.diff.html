The problem is, right now there are several important things that we don’t know about the situation. The mortality rate, the ease of human-human transmission, the rate of mutation of the virus (and how many strains we might be dealing with – all of these need more clarity. Unfortunately, we’ve already gone past the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East_respiratory_syndrome-related_coronavirus">MERS outbreak</a> in severity (which until now was the most recent new coronavirus to make the jump into humans). If we’re fortunate, though, we’ll still have something that will be worrisome, but not as bad as (say) the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html">usual flu numbers</a> (many people don’t realize that influenza kills tens of thousands of people in the US each year). The worst case, though, is something like <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/1918-pandemic-h1n1.html">1918</a>, and we really, really don’t need that.</p><p>Coronaviruses, which are rather large single-stranded RNA viruses, are nothing new in human disease. They are, in fact, the most usual one cause of the common cold, so all of us have been infected with who-knows-how-many different coronavirus strains over the years. Generally that’s what you can expect from them: a mild, irritating respiratory infection, and in fact I’ve been fighting off just such a thing for several days now myself. Such things are generally in the upper respiratory tract, but some of these viral infections can move on to bronchitis or pneumonia, either primary (viral infection in these areas) or secondary (opportunistic bacterial infection that develops as a sequel). I had secondary bacterial pneumonia in both lungs a few winters ago, and I give the experience 0 out of 5 stars. I was extremely glad that antibiotic therapy knocked it back down so quickly (the improvement was dramatic), and I have no trouble at all picturing how pneumonia in general has managed to kill off so many people over the centuries.</p><p>All sorts of creatures have their own suite of coronaviruses infecting them, and every so often one jumps into a new species. Humans seem to be more vulnerable to viral infection from other mammals (naturally) and from birds. No one is sure what species 2019-nCoV came from, although all the evidence is that it started in a particular market in Wuhan, likely from direct blood transmission in some sort of butcher shop. The virus <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30183-5/fulltext">appears to cause</a> a rapidly developing viral pneumonia in some patients, and the problem with that is that there is very little to be done. Supportive care is all there is to offer – as medical professionals continually remind the general public, antibiotics are useless against viruses. And although we have more actual antiviral agents than we used to, the selection in hand is not very useful against the coronaviruses. So what does biopharma research have to offer?</p><p>There is no way that a new antiviral small molecule can be discovered and developed in time to help anyone in the near future. That sounds rather pessimistic of me, but it’s true. Extremely fortunate and rapid development of such an agent would cut the lead time down to just a few years; that’s the time scale we’re looking at, and there’s no guarantee that any such drug can be found at all. No, the chances for a more rapid response come down to the biologics: a vaccine, or treatment with (say) monoclonal antibodies. (Update: <a href="https://www.biocentury.com/biocentury/product-development/2020-01-24/coronavirus-outbreak-creating-testbed-new-vaccine-and-">here’s an overview</a> at Biocentury on what’s going on). Extremely fortunate and rapid development of either of those would still be on the scale of many months, and if this viral outbreak is seasonal (as they tend to be) that would mean that there is nothing that’s going to arrive in time to help this season’s victims. But it also buys some time for the next round, if you want to look on the bright side.</p><p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6315345/">Here’s a look</a> at antibody therapy against MERS, to give you the idea. Manufacturing such things on scale is not trivial, but could be done. The biggest obstacle to using Mabs as therapy in this situation is their selectivity (which is also, of course, a great strength of antibodies under the right circumstances). Mutational escape is always a possibility, so ideally you’d want several antibodies at once, each targeting a different epitope and thus lowering the chance of the virus mutating its way out of the spotlight. But that makes development correspondingly more difficult.</p><p>And as <a href="//www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/01/scientists-are-moving-record-speed-create-new-coronavirus-vaccines-they-may-come-too">this article</a> at Science shows, vaccine development is already underway. Moderna, Inovio, and the University of Queensland are mentioned as working with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), and there are other companies who are cranking up their own efforts. It would seems quite likely that a vaccine can be developed, and the earlier work on the SARS and MERS coronaviruses will help these efforts out. But vaccines need to be tested, in animals and then in humans, and you are of course looking (as you always do with a new therapy) for safety and efficacy. You don’t want to set off nasty immune responses – the immune system is terrifying when aroused inappropriately. And you also don’t want a vaccine that the virus can evade easily by mutating some protein on its surface. A vaccine is just a way of doing endogenous antibody therapy (rather than giving a monoclonal one from outside), and the same considerations apply – raising response to several epitopes and/or known variants at the same time is the best strategy when you can manage it. Manufacturing such a vaccine on scale would be the next challenge, one that everyone involved is well aware of, and the effectiveness of a coronavirus vaccine would be partly determined by how many millions of people we would need to vaccinate.</p><p>That takes us back to the open questions about the spread of the virus. For news on this and other issues, <a href="http://statnews.com">Stat</a> has been doing a good job rounding up the reliable information, and they’re doing it in front of their paywall. Here’s <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/01/26/containing-new-coronavirus-may-not-be-feasible-experts-say/">one of their latest</a>, on the shift from trying to contain the virus to dealing with the fact that it may be too late for that strategy to work.</p><p>The signal/noise on this whole story has been suboptimal, as well it would be, so it’s important to have good sources.  Vast amounts of junk information have already been circulating. For one thing, no, this particular virus was not patented in 2015, and it is not some engineered bioweapon. There are no “natural” cures or preventatives that you can buy from friendly merchants trying to sell you some. I have been forwarded clips of what are purportedly Chinese workers spraying some sort of white stuff around to supposedly block the spread of the virus, but this is also spurious – there are no virus “disinfectants” to spray around, and we’re not even sure how this virus is most likely to be spread. The best preventatives that we know of are dull stuff like avoiding getting sneezed on, not going around shaking hands with everyone, avoiding large confined crowds of people, and other basic public hygiene points. I rather doubt that face masks help much (although they certainly don’t do any harm), since we don’t know how this virus spreads and what sort of particles it might spread on. (And besides, a lot of the air that you breath while wearing one of those standard white face masks is coming from around the sides of the mask, anyway).</p><p>So that’s about as far as we can go with the information we have. A developing story, indeed, which calls for avoiding panic on one end and complacency on the other. The advent of new infectious diseases is a test of our civilization’s technological ability – let’s pass it.</p> <p id="comments" class="comments-area"><ins></ins></p><h2 class="comments-title"><ins>123 comments on “Coronavirus”    </ins></h2><ins> </ins><ol class="comment-list"><li class="comment even thread-even depth-1 parent" id="comment-311845"><p class="comment-author vcard"><ins>Hap <span class="says">says:</span> </ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="comment-meta commentmetadata"><ins><a href="//blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/01/27/coronavirus#comment-311845">27 January, 2020 at 10:21 am Link: //blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/01/27/coronavirus#comment-311845 </a> </ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Would masks decrease droplet transmission or do droplets stay aloft (and meander around) too long for them to work?</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="reply"><ins><a rel="nofollow" class="comment-reply-link" href="//blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/01/27/coronavirus?replytocom=311845#respond">Reply Link: //blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/01/27/coronavirus?replytocom=311845#respond </a></ins></p><ins> </ins><ol class="children"><li class="comment odd alt depth-2 parent" id="comment-311870"><p class="comment-author vcard"><ins>SirWired <span class="says">says:</span> </ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="comment-meta commentmetadata"><ins><a href="//blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/01/27/coronavirus#comment-311870">27 January, 2020 at 2:01 pm Link: //blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/01/27/coronavirus#comment-311870 </a> </ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Given that few mask-wearers are likely to have it fitted properly, and changed at the correct (rather short) intervals, masks mostly serve to reduce your infection of others; they are limited-to-no effectiveness in protecting you from contagious illness.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>(When fitted properly and changed at the prescribed intervals, they are quite effective in keeping you from getting sick, but that would be rare indeed among the general public.)</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="reply"><ins><a rel="nofollow" class="comment-reply-link" href="//blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/01/27/coronavirus?replytocom=311870#respond">Reply Link: //blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/01/27/coronavirus?replytocom=311870#respond </a></ins></p><ins> </ins><ol class="children"><li class="comment even depth-3 parent" id="comment-311875"><p class="comment-author vcard"><ins>Hap <span class="says">says:</span> </ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="comment-meta commentmetadata"><ins><a href="//blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/01/27/coronavirus#comment-311875">27 January, 2020 at 4:17 pm Link: //blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/01/27/coronavirus#comment-311875 </a> </ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Well, lowering the spread would help, even if it doesn’t help me directly.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="reply"><ins><a rel="nofollow" class="comment-reply-link" href="//blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/01/27/coronavirus?replytocom=311875#respond">Reply Link: //blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/01/27/coronavirus?replytocom=311875#respond </a></ins></p><ins> </ins><ol class="children"><li class="comment odd alt depth-4" id="comment-313534"><p class="comment-author vcard"><ins>Sergio <span class="says">says:</span> </ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="comment-meta commentmetadata"><ins><a href="//blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/01/27/coronavirus#comment-313534">15 March, 2020 at 10:20 pm Link: //blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/01/27/coronavirus#comment-313534 </a> </ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Nine years ago, movie about the coronavirus epidemic came out.

The sartans inhibit the ACE1 (AT1) receptor (which is a 7TM and not an enzyme) and are usually also many thousand fold selective over the ACE2 (AT2) receptor which is also a 7TM and not an enzyme.  Since the corona viruse’s spike proteins use ACE2 enzyme as a receptor, I’m guessing that one would not observe a direct antiviral effect with that class of drugs.  Further, from what I understand the ACE1 carboxypeptidase inhibitors like captopril and enalopril don’t inhibit the ACE2 enzyme either.  In fact, as far as I know, there aren’t any ACE2 enzyme inhibitors on the market and even if there were I would guess that the virus would have to bind at the active site of the enzyme for an enzyme inhibitor to inhibit viral replication.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="reply"><ins><a rel="nofollow" class="comment-reply-link" href="//blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/01/27/coronavirus?replytocom=312294#respond">Reply Link: //blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/01/27/coronavirus?replytocom=312294#respond </a></ins></p><ins> </ins><ol class="children"><li class="comment odd alt depth-4 parent" id="comment-312359"><p class="comment-author vcard"><ins>Magnus Dominans <span class="says">says:</span> </ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="comment-meta commentmetadata"><ins><a href="//blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/01/27/coronavirus#comment-312359">8 February, 2020 at 9:21 pm Link: //blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/01/27/coronavirus#comment-312359 </a> </ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Cynical,

Usually, children, with less developed immune systems than adults, come down with one illness after another. A particularly severe example is RSV viral pneumonia, which results in an estimated 118,200 child deaths annually. (Adults are not seriously affected.)</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Yet few children have yet been reported with coronavirus symptoms. That does not mean that no children have been infected. A similar pattern of benign disease in children, with increasing severity and mortality with age, was seen in SARS and MERS. SARS had a mortality rate averaging 10 percent. Yet no children, and just 1 percent of youths under 24, died, while those older than 50 had a 65 percent risk of dying. Is being an adult a risk factor per se? If so, what is it about childhood that confers protection? It may be the nonspecific effects of live vaccines such as for measles and rubella, which already have been found to provide protection from diseases beyond their immediate target. That may also explain why more men than women have been infected by the coronavirus, because women routinely are given a rubella vaccine booster in their teens to guard against the dangers of having rubella while pregnant. While we wait for an accelerated coronavirus vaccine to be ready, could innate immunity in adults be boosted by giving measles vaccines?”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="reply"><ins><a rel="nofollow" class="comment-reply-link" href="//blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/01/27/coronavirus?replytocom=311928#respond">Reply Link: //blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/01/27/coronavirus?replytocom=311928#respond </a></ins></p><ins> </ins><ol class="children"><li class="comment even depth-2 parent" id="comment-313927"><p class="comment-author vcard"><ins>Paulo Barrera <span class="says">says:</span> </ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="comment-meta commentmetadata"><ins><a href="//blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/01/27/coronavirus#comment-313927">21 March, 2020 at 4:34 am Link: //blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/01/27/coronavirus#comment-313927 </a> </ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Definitely a possibility !!

Dimethyl fumarate is a cheap chemical ~60$ for 100gr 97% purity. This price is much, much lower than going for the extremely expensive Tecfidera for MS containing this simple chemical (drug prices…uhhh). Probably, dimethyl fumarate is not the  safest and best coronovirus cys-protease inhibitor available, but on the one hand not many if any drugs have been registered with this activity and on the other hand a selective cys protease inhibitor and scaling it to production takes a couple of years. Allicin and or diallyl-disulfide from Garlic: these nasty substances should inhibit coronavirus cys proteases…….also not a convenient cure available in a few months. Interestingly, the reactive metabolite of the analgesic acetaminophen (paracetamol): NAPQI is also a non-specific cys protease inhibitor. So a couple of well established drugs with reasonable safety is available which may inhibit the 3C-like viral cys protease irreversibly….and the garlic molecules of course. Would be interested to see what the IC50 of all these substances is and if it is within a realistic range. 
Making an ACE2 blocker on large scale is not easy either and Losartan is not an enzyme ACE blocker but a AT-II gpcr receptor antagonist……</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="reply"><ins><a rel="nofollow" class="comment-reply-link" href="//blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/01/27/coronavirus?replytocom=312340#respond">Reply Link: //blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/01/27/coronavirus?replytocom=312340#respond </a></ins></p><ins> </ins><ol class="children"><li class="comment odd alt depth-4" id="comment-312361"><p class="comment-author vcard"><ins>M.D. Tropico <span class="says">says:</span> </ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="comment-meta commentmetadata"><ins><a href="//blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/01/27/coronavirus#comment-312361">8 February, 2020 at 9:47 pm Link: //blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/01/27/coronavirus#comment-312361 </a> </ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>1.

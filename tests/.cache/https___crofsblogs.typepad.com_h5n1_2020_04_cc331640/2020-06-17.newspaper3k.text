In The New York Times, Seth Berkley writes: At Least 89 Coronavirus Vaccines Are Being Developed. It May Not Matter. Excerpt:

For now, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations is trying to expedite the development of vaccines against emerging infectious diseases. The coalition has kick-started the development of at least nine coronavirus vaccines but needs to raise $2 billion to help up to three of these candidates make it through the regulatory and quality requirements and to complete efficacy trials. The world would then need to ensure funds to guarantee manufacturing capacity for global production to make billions of doses available within the next 18 to 24 months.

In addition to this, the coalition is working to create a mechanism to ensure equal access to these vaccines. It is unclear precisely how this would be achieved and whether, for dozens of other vaccines under development through other efforts, others making vaccines will follow suit once a mechanism is developed. It is also unclear how poorer countries will pay for them. But in global health crises where emergency vaccines are a global public good that keeps us all safe, the answer has to be largely through public funding.

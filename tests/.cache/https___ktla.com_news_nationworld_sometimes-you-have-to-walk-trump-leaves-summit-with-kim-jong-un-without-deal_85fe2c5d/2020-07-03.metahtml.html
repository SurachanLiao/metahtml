That was a bridge too far for the US President, who said Kim offered to take some steps toward dismantling his nuclear arsenal but not enough to warrant ending the debilitating sanctions regime on the country.

&#8220;Sometimes you have to walk,&#8221; Trump said during a news conference following the conclusion of the summit, which broke up earlier than planned. &#8220;This was just one of those times.&#8221;

But it was evident from early in the summit that Trump was seeking to tamp down expectations, repeating he&#8217;s in no rush to strike a deal even as North Korea continues to advance its nuclear weapons program.

&#8220;I&#8217;ve been saying very much from the beginning that speed is not that important to me,&#8221; Trump said earlier Thursday at the summit&#8217;s outset. &#8220;Speed is not important to me. What is important is that we do the right deal.&#8221;

Trump cast the lack of deal as only a short-term disappointment, even though he&#8217;d hoped coming into the talks to be able to point to a new, concrete pathway toward denuclearization. A major agreement struck in Hanoi may also have pushed aside embarrassing headlines about&#160;<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2019/02/28/politics/donald-trump-michael-cohen-world/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trump&#8217;s former lawyer Michael Cohen testifying</a>&#160;the President is a racist conman.

The President, who said scheduling Cohen&#8217;s testimony during his summit was a &#8220;terrible thing,&#8221; instead suggested the inconclusive talks with Kim were another step in a lengthy process toward convincing the young leader to abandon his nuclear program.

<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2019/02/26/politics/donald-trump-kim-jong-un-friendship-chemistry/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The personal chemistry that Trump has cultivated</a>&#160;&#8212; and loudly trumpeted &#8212; with the young despotic leader remains intact, the President insisted.

And the summit ended amicably, without either man storming away.

&#8220;It was a very friendly walk,&#8221; Trump said.
<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2019/02/26/politics/donald-trump-kim-jong-un-north-korea-hanoi/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pursuing two objectives as he sat down once again with the North Korean dictator</a>&#160;on Thursday: draw North Korea closer to the prospect of abandoning its nuclear weapons and regain control of the media narrative.

As he arrived at the swanky Metropole Hotel on Wednesday to advance his historic direct diplomacy with Kim, Trump was quickly upstaged by the&#160;<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2019/02/27/politics/michael-cohen-testimony-house-committee/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">damning congressional testimony</a>&#160;of his longtime former attorney and adviser Michael Cohen.

By the time&#160;<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2019/02/26/politics/donald-trump-kim-jong-un-north-korea-hanoi/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trump finished dinner with Kim</a>, the airwaves were blanketed with coverage of Cohen&#8217;s testimony. A grand agreement on denuclearization might have helped in that effort to change the narrative. But on Thursday Trump repeatedly downplayed the prospects of a deal emerging from the Hanoi talks and suggested something more vague might result from his second summit with Kim.

&#8220;I can&#8217;t speak for today but over a little bit longer term &#8230; we&#8217;re going to have a fantastic success,&#8221; Trump said.

He described his dinner an evening earlier as positive, but did not describe in detail any of the negotiations underway.

&#8220;A lot of great ideas being thrown about,&#8221; Trump said.
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/11/world/asia/north-korea-human-rights.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">glosses over the rampant human rights abuses in North Korea</a>, which include Kim&#8217;s brutal assassinations of those who cross him and the imprisonment of thousands in labor camps. Trump largely avoided any mention of human rights during his talks with Kim, instead focusing on the prospects for financial investment if Kim agrees to abandon his nuclear weapons.

When a reporter asked Kim whether the topic was discussed, Trump answered for him.

&#8220;We&#8217;re discussing everything,&#8221; Trump said.

Later, when asked about the treatment of Otto Warmbier, an American student who spent 17 months in North Korean detention before being returned to the US in a vegetative state and subsequently dying, Trump denied Kim had been aware of the incident.

&#8220;He felt badly about it. He felt very badly,&#8221; Trump said. &#8220;He tells me that he didn&#8217;t know about it and I will take him at his word.&#8221;

&#8220;I don&#8217;t think that the top leadership knew about it,&#8221; Trump added. &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe that he (Kim) would have allowed that to happen.&#8221;

While Trump continues to insist that there is no rush to make progress, North Korea has continued to develop its nuclear weapons program and expanded its nuclear arsenal. In just the past year, North Korea is estimated to have produced enough fissile material for an additional five to seven nuclear weapons,&#160;<a href="https://cisac.fsi.stanford.edu/news/north-korea-2018-qa-siegfried-hecker" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to Stanford University&#8217;s Center for International Security and Cooperation</a>.

That nuclear production is expected to continue so long as Trump does not secure a verifiable freeze in North Korea&#8217;s nuclear production &#8212; a US objective that so far has remained elusive.

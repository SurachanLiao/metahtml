              12:01 am                          </ins></p> <p>It is the fourth Sunday in Lent. It is also the 334th anniversary of the date of Bach’s birth. Alles Gute zum Geburtstag, Herr Bach! Today’s Bach cantata is “Wo soll ich fliehen hin” (Where shall I flee).</p> <p>Today’s Gospel reading is <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+15%3A1-3%2CLuke+15%3A11-32&amp;version=NIV" target="_blank">Luke 15:1-3, 11b-32</a>:</p> <blockquote><p>The Parable of the Lost Sheep</p> <p>Now the tax collectors and sinners were all gathering around to hear Jesus. But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law muttered, “This man welcomes sinners and eats with them.”</p> <p>Then Jesus told them this parable:</p> <p>The Parable of the Lost Son</p> <p>Jesus continued: “There was a man who had two sons. The younger one said to his father, ‘Father, give me my share of the estate.’ So he divided his property between them.</p> <p>“Not long after that, the younger son got together all he had, set off for a distant country and there squandered his wealth in wild living. After he had spent everything, there was a severe famine in that whole country, and he began to be in need. So he went and hired himself out to a citizen of that country, who sent him to his fields to feed pigs. He longed to fill his stomach with the pods that the pigs were eating, but no one gave him anything.</p> <p>“When he came to his senses, he said, ‘How many of my father’s hired servants have food to spare, and here I am starving to death! I will set out and go back to my father and say to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired servants.’ So he got up and went to his father.</p> <p>“But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him; he ran to his son, threw his arms around him and kissed him.</p> <p>“The son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.’</p> <p>“But the father said to his servants, ‘Quick! Bring the best robe and put it on him. Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet. Bring the fattened calf and kill it. Let’s have a feast and celebrate. For this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.’ So they began to celebrate.</p> <p>“Meanwhile, the older son was in the field. When he came near the house, he heard music and dancing. So he called one of the servants and asked him what was going on. ‘Your brother has come,’ he replied, ‘and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has him back safe and sound.’</p> <p>“The older brother became angry and refused to go in. So his father went out and pleaded with him. But he answered his father, ‘Look! All these years I’ve been slaving for you and never disobeyed your orders. Yet you never gave me even a young goat so I could celebrate with my friends. But when this son of yours who has squandered your property with prostitutes comes home, you kill the fattened calf for him!’</p> <p>“‘My son,’ the father said, ‘you are always with me, and everything I have is yours. But we had to celebrate and be glad, because this brother of yours was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.’”</p></blockquote> <p><ins>The text of today’s piece is available <a href="http://www.emmanuelmusic.org/notes_translations/translations_cantata/t_bwv005.htm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here Link: http://www.emmanuelmusic.org/notes_translations/translations_cantata/t_bwv005.htm </a>. It contains these words, which emphasize the importance of forgiveness of sins in the Gospel:</ins></p><ins> </ins><blockquote><p><ins>Where shall I flee, 
since I am burdened 
with many great sins? 
Where shall I find rescue?</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>. . . .</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>My loving Savior comforts me, 
buried in His grave 
are the sins I committed; 
however great my transgression is, 
He makes me free and clear.</ins></p></blockquote><ins> </ins><p><ins>Happy listening!

For years <a href="http://patterico.com/2015/02/17/the-inappropriateness-of-joe-biden/">I’ve railed about Joe Biden’s creepy handsiness Link: http://patterico.com/2015/02/17/the-inappropriateness-of-joe-biden/ </a> when it comes to women other than his wife.  While I’m not the least bit surprised that <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2019/03/an-awkward-kiss-changed-how-i-saw-joe-biden.html">a former politician has accused Biden of kissing her  Link: https://www.thecut.com/2019/03/an-awkward-kiss-changed-how-i-saw-joe-biden.html </a> on the campaign trail in 2014, I am surprised that she is publicly speaking out about it and not giving him cover for his bad behavior like powerful Democrats have done for years.  And if everyday Americans have noticed the former vice-president’s incessant handsiness with women, then you know that everyone from President Obama to Nancy Pelosi to Hillary Clinton to Loretta Lynch and everyone else who has worked with Biden, also knew.  But to my knowledge, no one has come forward to make a direct and public complaint.  Until now.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>From<a href="https://www.thecut.com/2019/03/an-awkward-kiss-changed-how-i-saw-joe-biden.html">Lucy Flores writing in The Cut Link: https://www.thecut.com/2019/03/an-awkward-kiss-changed-how-i-saw-joe-biden.html </a>:</ins></p><ins> </ins><blockquote><p><ins>…when my campaign heard from Vice-President Joe Biden’s office that he was looking to help me and other Democrats in the state, I was grateful and flattered. His team offered to bring him to a campaign rally in an effort to help boost voter turnout. We set the date for November 1, just three days before election day.I found my way to the holding room for the speakers, where everyone was chatting, taking photos, and getting ready to speak to the hundreds of voters in the audience. Just before the speeches, we were ushered to the side of the stage where we were lined up by order of introduction. As I was taking deep breaths and preparing myself to make my case to the crowd, I felt two hands on my shoulders. I froze. “Why is the vice-president of the United States touching me?”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>I felt him get closer to me from behind. He leaned further in and inhaled my hair. I was mortified. I thought to myself, “I didn’t wash my hair today and the vice-president of the United States is smelling it. [Ed. Seriously?  Your concern was that you hadn’t washed your hair and it didn’t smell pretty for the veep?  Oh. Come. On.] And also, what in the actual fuck? Why is the vice-president of the United States smelling my hair?” He proceeded to plant a big slow kiss on the back of my head. My brain couldn’t process what was happening. I was embarrassed. I was shocked. I was confused. There is a Spanish saying, “tragame tierra,” it means, “earth, swallow me whole.” I couldn’t move and I couldn’t say anything. I wanted nothing more than to get Biden away from me. My name was called and I was never happier to get on stage in front of an audience.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>By then, as a young Latina in politics, I had gotten used to feeling like an outsider in rooms dominated by white men. But I had never experienced anything so blatantly inappropriate and unnerving before. Biden was the second-most powerful man in the country and, arguably, one of the most powerful men in the world. He was there to promote me as the right person for the lieutenant governor job. Instead, he made me feel uneasy, gross, and confused. The vice-president of the United States of America had just touched me in an intimate way reserved for close friends, family, or romantic partners — and I felt powerless to do anything about it.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Our strange interaction happened during a pivotal moment in my political career. I’d spent months raising money, talking to voters, and securing endorsements. Biden came to Nevada to speak to my leadership and my potential to be second-in-command — an important role he knew firsthand. But he stopped treating me like a peer the moment he touched me. Even if his behavior wasn’t violent or sexual, it was demeaning and disrespectful. I wasn’t attending the rally as his mentee or even his friend; I was there as the most qualified person for the job.</ins></p></blockquote><ins> </ins><p><ins>Flores offers these parting thoughts:  </ins></p><ins> </ins><blockquote><p><ins>I’m not suggesting that Biden broke any laws, but the transgressions that society deems minor (or doesn’t even see as transgressions) often feel considerable to the person on the receiving end. That imbalance of power and attention is the whole point — and the whole problem.</ins></p></blockquote><ins> </ins><p><ins>The timing of Flores’s revealing story is interesting given that its publication comes in the midst of Biden teasing-out and test-running a possible announcement for his candidacy in 2020.  Not only is he being coy about running, but he also appears to be gauging every possible reaction to an announcement and making preemptive strikes accordingly (possibly asking Stacy Abrams a place on his ticket and promising to only serve for one term).  </ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Flores explains why she is coming forward with her accusations now:  </ins></p><ins> </ins><blockquote><p><ins>For years I feared my experience would be dismissed. Biden will be Biden. Boys will be boys. I worried about the doubts, the threats, the insults, and the minimization. “It’s not that big of a deal. He touched her, so what?” The immediate passing of judgement and the questioning of motives. “Why now? Why so long after? She just wants attention.” Or: “It’s politically motivated.” I would be lying if I said I didn’t carefully consider all of this before deciding to speak. But hearing Biden’s potential candidacy for president discussed without much talk about his troubling past as it relates to women became too much to keep bottled up any longer.</ins></p></blockquote><ins> </ins><p><ins>It would be completely logical to assume that any forthcoming public accusation would indeed be dismissed, given that this has been the standard response by Democrats for years when it came to Biden and his inappropriate behavior with women.  Ironically, Flores’s own party! </ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Bill Russo, a spokesman for Biden, <a href="https://twitter.com/billr?lang=en">responded Link: https://twitter.com/billr?lang=en </a> to the accusation made by Flores:  </ins></p><ins> </ins><blockquote><p><ins>“Vice President Biden was pleased to support Lucy Flores’s candidacy for lieutenant governor of Nevada in 2014 and to speak on her behalf at a well-attended public event. </ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Neither then, nor in the years since, did he or the staff with him at the time have an inkling that Ms. Flores had been at any time uncomfortable, nor do they recall what she describes,</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>But Vice President Biden believes that Ms. Flores has every right to share her own recollection and reflections, and that it is a change for better in our society that she has the opportunity to do so. He respects Ms. Flores as a strong and independent voice in our politics and wishes her only the best.</ins></p></blockquote><ins> </ins><p><ins>As of yesterday, before this story broke, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/28/politics/quinnipiac-poll-march-28/index.html">Biden  held a comfortable lead over the other leading Dem candidates Link: https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/28/politics/quinnipiac-poll-march-28/index.html </a>.  Mind you, this is without even making an official announcement:</ins></p><ins> </ins><blockquote><p><ins>Former Vice President Joe Biden is out front in a poll by Quinnipiac University out Thursday, with 29% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters saying they’ll vote for him in the 2020 primary if he runs.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>He is followed by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders (19%), former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke (12%), and Sen. Kamala Harris (8%), according to the Quinnipiac poll.</ins></p></blockquote><ins> </ins><p><ins>Oh, and I wanted to post this photo (via The Cut) of Biden standing between Lucy Flores and actress Eva Longoria at the event where the alleged kiss took place because it’s a perfect example of a question answering itself:  Why would Biden have his hand up at the top of Longoria’s waist where he might accidentally feel the side of her breast?</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>–Dana</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="feedback"><ins><a href="http://patterico.com/jury/2019/03/29/former-lawmaker-accuses-joe-biden-of-kissing-her-without-consent/#comments">Comments (12) Link: http://patterico.com/jury/2019/03/29/former-lawmaker-accuses-joe-biden-of-kissing-her-without-consent/#comments </a> </ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="post" id="post-6323"><ins></ins></p><h3 class="storytitle"><ins><a href="http://patterico.com/jury/2019/03/29/video-trumpers-cheering-for-qanon-conspiracy/" rel="bookmark">Video: Trumpers Cheering for QAnon Conspiracy Link: http://patterico.com/jury/2019/03/29/video-trumpers-cheering-for-qanon-conspiracy/ </a></ins></h3><ins> </ins><p class="meta"><ins>Filed under:              <a href="http://patterico.com/jury/category/uncategorized/" rel="category tag">Uncategorized Link: http://patterico.com/jury/category/uncategorized/ </a> —

Today’s Bach cantata is “Meinen Jesum laß ich nicht” (I will not let go of my Jesus).</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Today’s Gospel reading is <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+13%3A1-9&amp;version=NIV" target="_blank">Luke 13:1-9 Link: https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+13%3A1-9&amp;version=NIV </a>:</ins></p><ins> </ins><blockquote><p><ins>Repent or Perish</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Now there were some present at that time who told Jesus about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices. Jesus answered, “Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans because they suffered this way? I tell you, no! But unless you repent, you too will all perish. Or those eighteen who died when the tower in Siloam fell on them—do you think they were more guilty than all the others living in Jerusalem? I tell you, no! But unless you repent, you too will all perish.”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Then he told this parable: “A man had a fig tree growing in his vineyard, and he went to look for fruit on it but did not find any. So he said to the man who took care of the vineyard, ‘For three years now I’ve been coming to look for fruit on this fig tree and haven’t found any. Cut it down! Why should it use up the soil?’</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>“‘Sir,’ the man replied, ‘leave it alone for one more year, and I’ll dig around it and fertilize it. If it bears fruit next year, fine! If not, then cut it down.’”</ins></p></blockquote><ins> </ins><p><ins>The text of today’s piece is available <a href="http://www.emmanuelmusic.org/notes_translations/translations_cantata/t_bwv124.htm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here Link: http://www.emmanuelmusic.org/notes_translations/translations_cantata/t_bwv124.htm </a>.

Levy (@jtlevy) <a href="https://twitter.com/jtlevy/status/1109591957464965120?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 23, 2019 Link: https://twitter.com/jtlevy/status/1109591957464965120?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw </a></ins></p></blockquote><ins> </ins><p><ins>We don’t know what’s in the Mueller report. Here are a few things we do know.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>We know that Joseph Mifsud, a professor with connections to high-ranking Russian officials, told George Papadopolous about “dirt” Russia had on Hillary Clinton in the form of emails when Papadopoulos was an adviser to the Trump campaign. Papadopoulos later lied about the timing to federal investigators to make it sound as if he learned this information before becoming an adviser to the campaign. In fact, Papadopoulos was told this only because he was a Trump campaign adviser. Papadopoulos repeatedly tried to set up a meeting between Russian officials and the Trump campaign.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>We know that Roger Stone communicated with Wikileaks, which operated as a cutout for the Kremlin. Stone was contacted by Trump campaign officials about future releases from Wikileaks, which falsely denied its communications with Stone. Stone said to someone involved with the Trump campaign: “Spoke to my friend in London last night. The payload is still coming.” After the Podesta emails were first released, an associate of the Trump campaign official sent Stone a text message saying “Well done.”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>We know that Paul Manafort was a lobbyist for Putin-connected former President of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovych. We know Manafort was later convicted of filing false tax returns, bank fraud, failing to disclose a foreign bank account, conspiracy to defraud the United States, and witness tampering. He was also the chairman of Trump’s campaign, and in that capacity, with Trump’s son and son-in-law, met with a woman with connections to high-ranking Kremlin officials hoping to get dirt on Hillary Clinton.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>We know that Michael Cohen wrote letters to senior Kremlin officials pursuing Trump Tower Moscow well into the presidential campaign, and lied about this to Congress to foster a false narrative that the Trump organization was not involved in any attempts to conduct business in Moscow.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>We know that Michael Flynn asked a member of Trump’s presidential transition team about what to tell the Soviet ambassador regarding an issue of recent sanctions imposed on Russia by the Obama administration. The transition official discussed the fact that the transition team did not want the situation to escalate, which Flynn told the Russian ambassador. Putin decided not to retaliate. Flynn then lied about all of this to the FBI.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Smells like vindication to you? OK. It probably is vindication on direct collusion in the sense of conspiring to hack emails — something nobody but insane Resistance types ever believed. To many of us, it’s something short of vindication on the issue of queasy connections between a presidential campaign and one of our enemies.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Maybe tamp down the triumphalism a bit there, sport.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>UPDATE: Trump organization, not campaign. Fixed.

Too bad, so sad. And if you’re a child who physically survives  that something too terrible for words, yet your mind and heart and soul are deeply damaged, shake it off, it didn’t kill you:</ins></p><ins> </ins><blockquote><p><ins>Speaking to <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/barbra-streisand-at-76-dog-cloning-art-collecting-and-being-a-grandma-rvcgqd5cb">the Times Link: https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/barbra-streisand-at-76-dog-cloning-art-collecting-and-being-a-grandma-rvcgqd5cb </a> in advance of performances in Britain this summer, Streisand said she “absolutely” believed Wade Robson and James Safechuck.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>But she said: “You can say ‘molested’, but those children, as you heard say, they were thrilled to be [at Jackson’s Neverland ranch]. They both married and they both have children, so it didn’t kill them.”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>In the documentary, the two men allege Jackson began grooming them when they were as young as seven and subjected them to sexual abuse. Both men say that as adults they have suffered from depression, self-loathing and anxiety and have struggled with familial relations.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Streisand, 76, said she had “a combination of feelings. I feel bad for the children. I feel bad for him. I blame, I guess, the parents, who would allow their children to sleep with him.”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>It is widely believed Jackson was verbally and physically abused as a child.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>“His sexual needs were his sexual needs,” said Streisand, “coming from whatever childhood he has or whatever DNA he has.”  When she met him, she said, she found him “very sweet, very childlike”.  [Ed. I suspect that victims of child sexual abuse might strenuously object to Streisand’s trivialization of the crime  committed against them.]  </ins></p></blockquote><ins> </ins><p><ins>Responding to her outrageous comment was the director of Leaving Neverland, Dan Reed:</ins></p><ins> </ins><blockquote><p><ins>“Did you really say that?” On Saturday morning, he added: “‘His sexual needs were his sexual needs’ – is pedophilia tolerated in parts of the entertainment industry?”</ins></p></blockquote><ins> </ins><p><ins>Well, it’s pretty much <a href="https://www.kqed.org/pop/97287/its-not-hard-to-connect-the-dots-in-hollywoods-culture-of-abuse">an open secret Link: https://www.kqed.org/pop/97287/its-not-hard-to-connect-the-dots-in-hollywoods-culture-of-abuse </a>, so the answer is, disgustingly, <a href="https://variety.com/2016/film/news/elijah-wood-pedophilia-hollywood-problem-1201781021/">yes Link: https://variety.com/2016/film/news/elijah-wood-pedophilia-hollywood-problem-1201781021/ </a>.

Not limited to an incredibly detailed discussion about Chernobyl, the book also discusses previous Russian nuclear accidents (turns out their reputation for safety was a Soviet myth; go figure.) It’s similar in size, scope, and detail to <a href="https://amzn.to/2Oh7aPd" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Command and Control: Nuclear Weapons, the Damascus Accident, and the Illusion of Safety Link: https://amzn.to/2Oh7aPd </a> by Eric Schlosser — a book I’m pretty sure I have mentioned before. The latter book, although ostensibly about a single nuclear weapons accident in Arkansas in the 1980s, contained an encyclopedic categorization of America’s history of nuclear accidents. Among the more salient existential risks to the planet and to our species is the existence of nuclear weapons and the potential damage from accidents involving them. The safety of nuclear reactors, touted by many as bulleproof, is only as reliable as the flawed humans that operate them. Chernobyl easily could have rendered large portions of Europe uninhabitable for a thousand years, if things had gone just a litle differently.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Oh, and then there’s this:</ins></p><ins> </ins><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><ins>George Conway, often referred to as Mr. Kellyanne Conway by those who know him, is VERY jealous of his wife’s success &amp; angry that I, with her help, didn’t give him the job he so desperately wanted.

In making his case, Mr. Nunes, a loyal ally of President Trump and the former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, repeated several common Republican complaints that Twitter has repeatedly denied: that it censors Republicans, “shadow bans” their accounts and actively helps their opponents.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Though absorbing criticism comes with the territory for politicians, the complaint described the objectionable tweets from the three users as something “that no human being should ever have to bear and suffer in their whole life.”</ins></p></blockquote><ins> </ins><p><ins>One of the defendants is Liz Mair, who stands accused of runnning certain troll accounts including one named “Devin Nunes Mom.”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Devin Nunes has always been a national joke.

Meanwhile the national debt stands at over $22 trillion, we live in a world where nothing is being done about the spread of weapons that could end the human race, and we have apparently lost all popular understanding of the importance of free markets that have lifted millions upon millions out of poverty.

той новой статье, полезной для саморазвития?

Я планировала завести свой собственный блог в ближайшем 
будущем, но пока трудно сделать выбор между 
BlogEngine/WordPress/b2evolution и Drupal. Почему я спрашиваю - потому что этот дизайн,
кажется, отличается от большей части блогов, а я 
ищу нечто совершенно оригинальное.

Unfortunately I have become quite discouraged about our government and in a broader sense society as a whole due to the blatant hypocrisy and people's inability to have even a small sense of decency. It might even border on apathy these days.

I found it sad that good and positive events and the achievement of individuals could not be honored and celebrated simply because of the person recognizing them.  

And I find it disturbing that our president can't seem to speak of anything without using hyperbole.

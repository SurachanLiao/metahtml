<p>"Mossad director Yitzhak Hofi announced at the beginning of the meeting that wasn't prone to support the request on moral grounds but asked to hear the opinions of those who were present," said Alpher. "I told the heads of the Mossad that I had difficulty supporting the request because we didn't know enough about who and what Khomeini was. I really regret not supporting that request."</p> </span></p> <p><ins><span class="art_footer_date">פרסום ראשון: 05.15.15, 12:09 </span></ins></p> </article>

<p>1. Kim Jong-Un is the 3rd generation of the dictator of North Korea or the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea. Democracy and dictatorship don&#8217;t go hand in hand but that&#8217;s how it has been in North Korea for 3 generations.</p>
<p>2. Kim Jong-Un became the Supreme Leader of North Korea after his dad Kim Jong-Il (Dear Leader) passed away unexpectedly in 2011. His father Kim Jong-Il and his grandfather Kim Il-Sung (Eternal President) were both dictators.</p>
<p>3. The Supreme Leader Kim Jong-Un is the only top-ranked military official in this whole world who has absolutely no previous military experience or even training. </p>
<p>He still controls the world&#8217;s 4th largest armed forces, which is known to have 1.1 million active military personnel. He became Daejang in the army in the year 2010. Daejang in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea is the same as General in the United States.</p>
<p>4. The only thing that is &#8216;military&#8217; about the Supreme Leader is that he goes nuts over nuclear weapons. He absolutely loves them. Despite his lack of military experience, Kim Jong-Un managed to become the head of the state using his intelligence and talent.</p>
<p>5. He always wanted to look like Eternal President, i.e. his grandfather, and hence, in an attempt to do so, he underwent plastic surgery, according to <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1317958/Has-Kim-Jong-Un-plastic-surgery-look-like-grandfather-Kim-Il-Sung.html" target="_blank">Daily Mail</a>.</p>

<p>6. The Supreme Leader ensured that the entire nation mourned the death of his father whole-heartedly. How do you expect people to do so? Put them under the threat of being killed by mortar! </p>
<p>That&#8217;s precisely what he did to Kim Chol &#8211; deputy defense minister of North Korea. Kim Chol&#8217;s crime was that he got drunk during the mourning period and did not sufficiently grieve. He was shot by mortars.</p>
<p>7. China declared Kim Jong-Un as the sexiest man alive in 2012. You don&#8217;t believe it? Well, the Chinese media actually picked up an <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.theonion.com/article/kim-jong-un-named-the-onions-sexiest-man-alive-for-30379" target="_blank">article by newspaper named The Onion</a> where the Supreme Leader was named as the sexiest man alive!</p>
<p>8. Of all world leaders, Kim Jong-Un is the youngest. However, no one knows what his actual age is. Some say it is 31, some say 32 and some say 33. Well, you can decide which year you will pick as his birth years &#8211; 1982, 1983, or 1984.</p>
<p>9. In 2012 he was not only named as the sexist man alive on this planet, but he has also enjoyed something else! A hillside was carved with a 1,800-foot carving which read, &#8220;Long Live General, The Shining Sun&#8221;!</p>
<p>10. Kim Jong-Un suddenly became empathetic and decided to allow women to wear platform shoes, pants, and earrings.

The idea for such radical changes was to create Children&#8217;s Heaven Nation and Feminists&#8217; Paradise. Doesn&#8217;t that sound creepy?</p>

<p>13. The Supreme Leader attended Liebefeld-Steinholz &#8211; a school in Switzerland using the alias Pak Un. He was admitted to the school as the son of an employee of the North Korean embassy in Switzerland.</p>

<p>15. While in Switzerland however, Kim Jong-Un fell in love with Emmental. Can you guess what it is? Well, it is a type of Swiss Cheese. Every year the North Korean government spends literally thousands and thousands of pounds just for importing Emmental so that the Supreme Leader can fulfill his cravings. Sadly, most of the North Korean population is suffering from malnutrition.</p>

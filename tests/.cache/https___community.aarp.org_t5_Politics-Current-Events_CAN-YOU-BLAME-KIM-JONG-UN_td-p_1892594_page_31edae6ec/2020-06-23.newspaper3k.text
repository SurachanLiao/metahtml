China does not want "control" politically of the Korean Peninsula. They want America out of Korea, free trading with Korea, and isolation of Japan from Asia. The Koreans and the Chinese despise the Japanese.



Russia just wants chaos and destabilization... with no goal other than making money.



Only China can prevent a shooting war.



Ask yourself .... if North Korea launches a short range nuke against South Korea, or Japan.... does that loss of life make it "acceptable" to THEN shoot back? or is it in everyone's best interest to make sure that never happens and save lives?



How long can the world tolerate the clear and present danger from the North Koreans?









Only the USA can prevent a Shooting War.......................................Trump is like Bush - He Wants a War on his Resume...........................any war - because thats what Bullies do......................they instigate & bully and then expect others to do the Heavy Lifting

There are hundreds of Thousands of Americans in harms way - not even talking Nuclear - just a conventional weapons war or even a accidental escalation will cause the deaths of many Americans For No Good Reason

The Jig is Up - it's already too late - North Korea is a Nuclear State...........................the only solution is complete annihilation of North Korea and the cost for that is too high............................

The Best Scenario now is working to prevent North Korea from Proliferating their Nuclear Capability to other State and/or Non-State Entities....................like they already did once with Syria and ISIS still has plenty of Money

China does not want a War - they are already winning the Worlds Economic Wars & the Worlds Environmental Wars - Millions of New Jobs in China in the Renewable Energy Industry - 40,000 New Jobs in America under Trump in the Coal Mining - Any Conventional or Nuclear War is Counter-intuitive to China but they are more worried about a Loose Cannon Insecure Paranoid Bully like Trump then they are Kim jong un - Kim wants to stay in power - attacking the USA in any form is going to end that forever and he knows that.......................

Trump can send Americans to Die from the Safety of Mar ERH Lago or Bedminster or the Whitehouse - and he will without blinking a eye because he has No Conscience and has No Vested Interest in this Country or it's people - evidenced multiple times when he says things like - let Obamacare Die a Slow Painful Death.....................American Citizens will be dying that Slow Painful Death and he's either to Stupid or too ambivalent to understand the distinction

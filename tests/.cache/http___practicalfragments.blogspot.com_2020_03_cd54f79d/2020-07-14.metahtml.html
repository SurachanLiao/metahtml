</h3>

 


<p class="MsoNormal">
In less than a <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2020/03/fragments-in-clinic-2020-edition.html">week</a> the number
of cases of COVID-19 worldwide has more than doubled, beyond 720,000, as have
the number of deaths, to more than 34,000. For those of us in drug discovery but
not on the front lines of clinical care, it is frustrating to watch these numbers climb
relentlessly while doing nothing to help other than physical distancing. The
temporary closure of so many labs accentuates this feeling.</p>
 
<p class="MsoNormal">
In early March we <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2020/03/fragments-vs-sars-cov-2-protease-open.html">highlighted</a> an
effort by Dave Stuart, Martin Walsh, Frank von Delft, and others at the Diamond Light Source
to screen fragments against crystals of the main protease (MPro) of
SARS-CoV-2. The enzyme is a cysteine protease, ideal for <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2019/06/characterizing-and-screening.html">covalent fragment screening</a>, and indeed Nir London and coworkers at the Weizmann Institute used
intact protein mass-spectrometry to pre-screen 993 fragments. In total, these
combined efforts yielded crystal structures of 44 hits bound covalently to the
active-site cysteine, 22 non-covalent hits in the active site, and 2
non-covalent hits at the protein dimer interface. Full details and structures
can be found <a href="https://www.diamond.ac.uk/covid-19/for-scientists/Main-protease-structure-and-XChem.html">here</a>.</p>
 
<p class="MsoNormal">
In our previous <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2020/03/fragments-vs-sars-cov-2-protease-open.html">post</a> we showed an
overlay of the seven fragments that had been released at the time showing
multiple high-quality interactions with the protein. You can look at them all interactively <a href="https://www.diamond.ac.uk/covid-19/for-scientists/Main-protease-structure-and-XChem/Interactive-views.html">here</a>,
and some of the chemical structures are shown below.</p>
 
<p>
This is where crowdsourcing comes
in. A group called <a href="https://covid.postera.ai/covid">PostEra</a> (corrected: part of a consortium called COVID MoonShot), consisting of academic and industrial researchers
around the world, is trying to use these data and more to develop drugs against
SARS-CoV-2. Everyone is invited to contribute, from first year graduate
students through industry veterans and emeritus professors.</p>
 
<p class="MsoNormal">
Do you have ideas how you might
grow or merge some of the fragments? If so, you can propose structures, and
those that pass a series of filters including synthetic accessibility and
toxicity predictions will be synthesized at Enamine and tested at various laboratories
(including yours, if you&#8217;re interested). We&#8217;ve previously <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2019/02/what-will-you-do-with-hundreds-of.html">highlighted</a> Enamine&#8217;s
&#8220;make on demand&#8221; model, which has turnaround times of just a few weeks. At
least a couple computational companies, including BioSolveIT and Nanome, are
offering <a href="https://discuss.postera.ai/t/about-the-get-help-deals-category/104">free access</a> to their platforms to help you design molecules. Already
more than 350 molecule ideas have been submitted.</p>
 
<p class="MsoNormal">
A cynic could say that these
efforts are misguided given the slow pace of drug discovery. <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2011/08/first-fragment-based-drug-approved.html">Vemurafenib</a>, the
first fragment-based drug <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2020/03/fragments-in-clinic-2020-edition.html">approved</a>, took six years from the start of the
program to approval, and this is lightening speed. However, as Derek Lowe <a href="https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/03/06/covid-19-small-molecule-therapies-reviewed">observed</a>, all of the drugs currently being clinically tested against
COVID-19 were originally developed for other indications. Stephen Burley <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00888-7">suggested</a>
recently in Nature that we probably would already have drugs against
COVID-19 had we spent more effort fighting SARS.</p>
 
<p class="MsoNormal">
Hopefully we will have a vaccine
long before any drugs coming out of this effort enter the clinic. But there will
be a SARS-CoV-3, and a SARS-CoV-4. Having more drugs in our pipeline may
prevent those from killing so many people.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
As I write this, more than 350,000 people worldwide have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. More than 15,000 of them have died.</p><p>
It is important to stay aware of what's going on and take appropriate measures to stop the spread of COVID-19. But to paraphrase Nietzsche, one can spend too much time staring into the abyss. In the spirit of hope, Practical Fragments offers an updated list of FBLD-derived drugs.</p><p>
The current list contains 47 molecules, 7 more than the last <a href="https://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2018/10/fragments-in-clinic-2018-edition.html">compilation</a>,
 with 4 approved. As always, this table includes compounds whether or 
not 
they are still in development (indeed, some of the companies no longer 
even exist). Because of this, the Phase 1 list contains a higher 
proportion of compounds that are no longer progressing. Drugs reported 
as still active in&#160;<a href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/">clinicaltrials.gov</a>,&#160;company websites, or other sources are in&#160;bold, and those that have been discussed on&#160;Practical Fragments&#160;are&#160;<span><span><span>hyperlinked</span></span></span>&#160;to the most relevant post. The list is almost certainly
incomplete, particularly for Phase 1 compounds. If you know of any others (and can 
mention them) please leave a comment.</p>

<a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2020/03/fragments-vs-pseudomonas-aeruginosa.html">Fragments vs a Pseudomonas aeruginosa virulence factor</a>
</h3>

 


<p class="MsoNormal">
The world is understandably
focused on SARS-CoV-2; see for example last week&#8217;s <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2020/03/fragments-vs-sars-cov-2-protease-open.html">post</a>. But there are many
other threats out there, including infectious Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which
is particularly problematic for immunocompromised people. A recent (open
access!) ChemMedChem <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cmdc.201900621">paper</a> by Martin Empting and collaborators at the
Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research and elsewhere describes a clever
approach to tackle this pathogen.</p>
 
<p class="MsoNormal">
An age-old problem for
antibiotics is that they provoke resistance: nothing like death to kick
evolution into high gear. One way to <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2015/02/fragments-vs-dsba-targeting-bacterial.html">sidestep</a> this is to develop drugs that
target virulence rather than essential microbial pathways. The protein PqsR is
part of the Pseudomonas Quinolone Signal Quorum Sensing system, and is
important for pathogenicity. </p>
 
<p class="MsoNormal">
A previously <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jm400830r">published</a> screen of
720 fragments by <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2010/02/surface-plasmon-resonance-spr.html">SPR</a> yielded about 40 hits, including compound 3. Not only does
this compound have impressive <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2017/04/ligand-efficiency-invalidated.html">ligand efficiency</a>, it also has high <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2011/05/perverse-trade-offs-maximal-enthalpy-of.html">enthalpic efficiency</a>; the binding is largely enthalpy-driven. Although the utility of
thermodynamics for lead optimization is <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2019/06/is-thermodynamic-data-useful-for-drug.html">questionable</a>, the researchers were
cognizant of the hydrophobic nature of the ligand binding site for PqsR, and
sought molecules that would make polar interactions from the start rather than
having to engineer them; a similar strategy proved <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2018/09/fragments-in-clinic-astx660.html">successful</a> for Astex.</p>
 
 
 
<p class="MsoNormal">
Crystallography with compound 3 was
unsuccessful, but SAR by catalog led to compound 7, which has higher affinity
for PqsR as assessed by isothermal titration calorimetry (<a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2010/02/isothermal-titration-calorimetry-itc.html">ITC</a>) and also shows activity
in a reporter gene assay. Fragment growing led to compound 11, which the
researchers were able to characterize crystallographically. The two aromatic
rings are at a sharp angle to one another, and attempts at rigidifying the
linker proved unsuccessful. But further growing led to compound 20, with
submicromolar activity in the reporter assay. This molecule also reduced
release of a toxic virulence factor from a clinical isolate of P. aeruginosa.

</p>
 
<p class="MsoNormal">
Interestingly, despite the
increased activity of compound 20 over compound 11 in the reporter assay, it
seems to have lower affinity for PqsR by ITC. The researchers suggest that the
full protein in cells likely behaves differently than the truncated version
studied in the biophysical assays. </p>
 
<p class="MsoNormal">
The researchers also emphasize
that flexible linkers were more successful than rigid linkers in improving
potency &#8211; a phenomenon we&#8217;ve previously highlighted <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2012/01/fragment-linking-flexible-rules.html">here</a> and <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2014/03/flexible-fragment-linking-vs.html">here</a>. Intuitively a more
flexible linker is likely to be more forgiving, as a fraction of an &#229;ngstr&#246;m
can make the difference between binding or not. </p>
 
<p class="MsoNormal">
There is still much to do: in
particular, activity will need to be improved further, and no pharmacokinetic or
other animal data are provided. Moreover, a clinical trial with an anti-virulence
strategy would be difficult to design. Still, this is an interesting approach,
and I hope the authors or others will follow up on it.</p>

<a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2020/03/fragments-vs-sars-cov-2-protease-open.html">Fragments vs SARS-CoV-2 Protease: open science in action</a>
</h3>

 


<p class="MsoNormal">
Last year we <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2019/04/help-develop-new-antibiotics-from.html">highlighted</a> work
done by a consortium called Open Source Antibiotics to find fragment hits
against antibacterial targets. A similar effort has now launched to discover leads
for COVID-19. And those involved have done so with breathtaking speed and openness.</p>
 
<p class="MsoNormal">
A group of researchers including Dave
Stuart, Martin Walsh, and Frank von Delft (Diamond Light Source) has performed
a fragment screen against crystals of the main protease (MPro) of
SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Even before fully analyzing all of the
data, let alone publishing it on bioRxiv, they are making it available <a href="https://www.diamond.ac.uk/covid-19/for-scientists/Main-protease-structure-and-XChem.html">here</a>,
with promises of frequent updates.</p>
 
<p class="MsoNormal">
MPro is a cysteine
protease essential for viral viability. The first crystal structure of the
protein was solved in January and <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.964882v1">posted</a> on bioRxiv late last month. The Diamond
researchers synthesized the gene and used it to produce protein that crystallized
and diffracted to high (1.39 &#197;) resolution. Importantly, they found a crystal
form in which the active site was empty and thus well-suited to fragment soaking.
In just three days the <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2019/05/crystallographic-vs-computational.html">XChem</a> researchers grew, soaked and analyzed 600 crystals.
Since then they have screened over 1000 fragments and found 7 that bind in the
active site. These will be released in the <a href="https://www.rcsb.org/">protein data bank</a> on March 11, though
the coordinates and electron density maps can already be <a href="https://www.diamond.ac.uk/covid-19/for-scientists/Main-protease-structure-and-XChem.html">downloaded</a> from XChem and viewed interactively <a href="https://fragalysis.diamond.ac.uk/viewer/react/snapshot/4c6c8fb1-f072-4b17-b948-5b6eeec0ebf1">here</a>. An
overlay shows a large and attractive pocket with multiple opportunities for protein-ligand
interactions.</p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal">
Frank sent an email on March 6 describing
this achievement to a number of researchers, and within minutes Brian Shoichet
(UCSF) said that he would be using the fragments as controls in a large library
<a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2019/02/what-will-you-do-with-hundreds-of.html">docking screen</a> he is doing. Just a few hours later Andrew Hopkins (Exscientia) said
that he has SPR and enzymatic assays up and running and is willing to screen
compounds sent to him. Then John Chodera (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center)
volunteered to do free-energy calculations. </p>
 
<p class="MsoNormal">
As anyone who has worked in drug
discovery, fragment-based or not, will recognize, there is still a long road ahead to turn these fragments into effective drugs. But this global team
has sprinted off the starting line. Please join them in the race if you can.</p>

<a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2020/03/fbld-meets-del.html">FBLD meets DEL</a>
</h3>

 


<p class="MsoNormal">
FBLD, of course, starts with
small libraries of small fragments. DNA-encoded chemical libraries (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA-encoded_chemical_library">DEL</a>) usually
start from the opposite extreme. Massive numbers of molecules are combinatorially
synthesized attached to DNA, screened against a target using affinity selection,
and hits identified by sequencing the DNA. A recent <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.9b01670">paper</a> in J. Med. Chem.
by Christopher Wellaway and colleagues at GlaxoSmithKline uses information from
both approaches to generate a high-quality candidate.</p>
 
<p class="MsoNormal">
The researchers were interested in
bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) family proteins &#8211; the same targets we <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2020/02/fragments-in-clinic-abbv-744.html">discussed</a>
last week. GlaxoSmithKline had already put molecules into the clinic, but they
were looking for structurally different backup candidates, so they performed a
DEL screen on the BD1 domain of BRD4. A library of 117 million compounds yielded
potent compound 10, and crystallography revealed that the 2,6-dimethylphenol
moiety bound in the acetyl-lysine-binding pocket.</p>
 
 
<p class="MsoNormal">
Phenols are often metabolic
liabilities, and indeed compound 10 was rapidly cleared in mice. However, GlaxoSmithKline
has a long and successful history of fragment screening against bromodomains;
Teddy first <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2012/02/whos-regulating-regulators.html">described</a> some of their seminal work back in 2012, when the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_phenomenon">world didn&#8217;t end</a>. Compound 16 had been found in a previous screen as a hit against
BRD4, and crystallography revealed that the pyridone binds in a similar fashion
to the phenol moiety. (Similar pyridones had been reported by others, for example <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2016/07/fragments-deliver-chemical-probe-for.html">this</a> one.) Merging the molecules led &#8211; after a bit of tweaking &#8211; to compound
20a. In addition to BRD4, this molecule binds another bromodomain, BAZ2A, which
the researchers wanted to avoid. Structure-based design led them to the more selective
compound 20i.</p>
 
<p class="MsoNormal">
Although compound 20i is potent
in cells, it still has moderate clearance in rats. Unsubstituted benzimidazole rings
have been reported to be unstable, so the researchers systematically explored a
series of substitutions, ultimately arriving at compound 24 (I-BET469). Not only is this compound
potent and soluble, it is remarkably stable, with &#8220;no detectable turnover in
rat, dog, and human microsomal and hepatocyte preparations.&#8221; Oral bioavailabilities
approach 100%, and the compound proved to be effective in acute and chronic
mouse inflammation models. Although selectivity against non-BET family bromodomains
members is good, compound 24 does strongly bind to both BD1 and BD2 domains of
all four BET family members, and as we saw <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2020/02/fragments-in-clinic-abbv-744.html">last week</a> this may lead to toxicity.</p>
 
<p class="MsoNormal">
Nonetheless, this is a lovely example
of using a fragment to replace a problematic moiety in a larger molecule, as we&#8217;ve
seen previously for <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2013/07/fragments-vs-chymase-swapping-out-grease.html">chymase</a>, <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2015/05/fragments-vs-factor-viia.html">Factor VIIa</a>, and <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2015/03/fragments-vs-factor-xia.html">Factor XIa</a>. Throughout the
optimization the researchers paid close attention to molecular properties such
as lipohilicity and molecular weight, and this resulted in a molecule with
excellent pharmacokinetics despite the presence of potentially unstable
moieties such as the morpholine. If nothing else, this will be a useful in vivo <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2015/07/introducing-chemical-probes-portal.html">chemical probe</a>. </p>

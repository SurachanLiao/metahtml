However, the market clawed back much of its intraday losses in the last 15 minutes of trading.&#160;</p>                                            <p>Bond prices soared as investors sought safety, pushing yields to record lows. The stock swoon is being driven by fear that the coronavirus outbreak will derail the global economy.&#160;</p>                                            <p class="ad__inner ad__inner_border_true ad__inner_background_true">

    <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 357 points, or 1.4%, to 25,409. The S&amp;P 500 lost 24 points, or 0.8%, to 2,954. The benchmark index has lost 13% since hitting a record high 10 days ago.

While that big a drop is scary, corrections are fairly regular occurrences. Some traders even see them as healthy, helping to eliminate froth that may have built up after a long run higher. But fear is high this correction may worsen into a bear market -- a drop of 20%.</p>                                            <p class="article__section article__section_type_embed">

                    <p>Asian markets continued their freefall Friday.

    <p>The Fed said Friday that it will &#8220;act as appropriate to support the economy." The statement came after a week of sharp market drops that drove stocks down roughly 13% in value.&#160;</p>                                            <p>Powell said the fundamentals of the U.S. economy &#8220;remain strong," but added that "the coronavirus poses evolving risks to economic activity.&#8221; </p>                                            <p>The deepening global rout is fueled by fears the spreading virus, COVID-19, that emerged in China in December will derail global trade and other industries. Investors had appeared confident governments were bringing the outbreak under control, but forecasters warned such optimism likely was premature.</p>                                            <p>The outbreak has sapped financial markets, emptied shops and businesses and put major sites and events off limits. The list of countries hit by the illness edged toward 60 on Friday as Mexico, Belarus, Lithuania, New Zealand, Nigeria, Azerbaijan, Iceland and the Netherlands reported their first cases.&#160;</p>                                            <p>The threats to livelihoods were increasingly as worrisome as the threats to lives. If the disease becomes a global pandemic, economists say the U.S. and other global economies could fall into recession.&#160;</p>                                            <p>A growing list of major companies are issuing profit warnings and say factory shutdowns in China are disrupting supply chains. They say travel bans and other anti-disease measures also are hurting Chinese consumer spending.</p>                                            <img class="lazy-image__placeholder lazy-image__placeholder_blur_true" alt="" width="1140" height="641" src="https://media.wusa9.com/assets/WTSP/images/df0ee7c4-d732-47ec-bcbc-62e3c34d8316/df0ee7c4-d732-47ec-bcbc-62e3c34d8316_16x9.jpg"><img class="lazy-image__image lazy-image__image_blur_true" alt="" width="1140" height="641" src="/assets/shared-images/backgrounds/blank.png"><img class="lazy-image__nojs-image" alt="" width="1140" height="641" src="https://media.wusa9.com/assets/WTSP/images/df0ee7c4-d732-47ec-bcbc-62e3c34d8316/df0ee7c4-d732-47ec-bcbc-62e3c34d8316_1140x641.jpg"><p>&#160;</p>                                            </div>

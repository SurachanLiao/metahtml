<article class="post-66544527 post type-post status-publish format-standard entry"><p>Ryanair, British Airways and Jet2 have today cancelled hundreds of flights to and from Italy until April at the earliest and easyJet has also grounded most of its services leaving thousands of customers stranded in the coronavirus-hit country. BA has axed its 60 flights a day to cities including Milan, Venice and Rome while Jet2 has gone even further and cancelled all its Italian trips for almost seven weeks until April 26 with Easter holiday plans for thousands likely to be in ruins. But there were farcical scenes at UK airports as people on the final flights from Italy today walked through arrivals unchecked with many completely unaware they should now self-isolate for the next 14 days.&#160; Ryanair announced it had cancelled all flights from March 14 until April 9, but has told thousands of Brits trapped in Italy they can switch their return flight to come home before Saturday&#160;as Britain lost its sixth victim to coronavirus today and Italy&#8217;s death toll increased by 97 in 24 hours to 463. Other airlines appear likely to put on &#8216;repatriation&#8217; flights this week while the Government may also step in and send rescue planes like the ones dispatched to bring home Britons&#8230; <a href="/go?url=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFpbHltYWlsLmNvLnVrL25ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZS04MDk1MjM1L0JyaXRpc2gtQWlyd2F5cy1jYW5jZWxzLWZsaWdodHMtSXRhbHktQXByaWwtNC1hbWlkLWNvcm9uYXZpcnVzLWNyaXNpcy5odG1s" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Read full this story</a></p><blockquote class="wps-mine-source-information"> Thousands of furious Brits stranded as Ryanair, BA and Jet2 cancel ALL flights to and from Italy until April amid coronavirus crisis &#8211; so how ARE UK passengers going to get home? have 301 words, post on <a href="/go?url=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFpbHltYWlsLmNvLnVrL25ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZS04MDk1MjM1L0JyaXRpc2gtQWlyd2F5cy1jYW5jZWxzLWZsaWdodHMtSXRhbHktQXByaWwtNC1hbWlkLWNvcm9uYXZpcnVzLWNyaXNpcy5odG1s" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">www.dailymail.co.uk</a> at March 10, 2020.

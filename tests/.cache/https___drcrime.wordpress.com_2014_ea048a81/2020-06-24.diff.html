coup after the mysterious disappearance of despot Kim Jong-un have been put to bed after it was revealed the North Korean leader is merely recovering from surgery – after cheese-fuelled weight gain caused him to fracture his ankles.</ins></p><p><ins>Unbridled daily binges on Emmental imported from Switzerland are believed to be responsible for the dictator’s rapid weight gain, with some defectors speculating he was trying to match the considerable bulk of his grandfather, Kim Il-sung.</ins></p><p><ins>And South Korea’s largest newspaper claims that the tubby tyrant is in fact recovering from two fractured ankles after the strain of his expanding waistline put pressure on a pre-existing injury – and caused the bones to crack.</ins></p><p><ins>‘I heard that Kim Jong-un injured his right ankle in June after pushing ahead with on-site visits and ended up fracturing both ankles because he left the injury unattended,’ an unnamed source told Chosun Ilbo. The source added that the 31-year-old had undergone an operation at the Bonghwa Clinic, an exclusive hospital for high-ranking party members.</ins></p><p><ins>Kim, who has not been seen in public in almost a month, missed a session of the Supreme People’s Assembly in Pyongyang for the first time since ascending to power in 2011, sending the gossip mill into overdrive.</ins></p><p><ins>Chinese social media Weibo went crazy with reports that a former North Korean vice marshal had overthrown Kim in a coup, while outside commentators speculated he had developed gout, which runs in his family.</ins></p><ul><li><ins>Text <a href="http://metro.co.uk/2014/10/01/kim-jong-un-is-so-fat-from-eating-cheese-that-he-has-broken-his-ankles-4888448/" target="_blank">source Link:

for three ice creams and a bottle of water at a bar in central Rome, asking the police to intervene, but the manager told The Local it was “their fault” for not reading the menu.</p><p>James and Mariann Luciani had just finished dinner when they and a relative stopped for an ice cream at Bar il Caffè, just a stone’s throw from the Trevi Fountain. Having paid around €3 or €4 for an ice cream so far on their Italian holiday, they were shocked when the bill came to €42 ($50).</p><p>The Lucianis contested the charge, only to be shown a menu — having not checked before ordering—in which the price for an ice cream was set at €13 apiece. The waiter told them that they had, in fact, been given a discount as they were relieved of the €2.50 per person cover charge.</p><p>“We’d just paid €59 for our entire dinner, including a litre of wine, and then were charged €42 for gelato!” James told The Local. “We’ve been careful in watching out for pickpockets in Rome, but I never thought I would get scammed here,” he said. The couple paid the bill but, unsure whether such a high charge was legal, they returned to the bar on Thursday morning with the police.</p><p>Mediating between the waiter and the Lucianis, a police officer checked the menu and found that the price was written down. As the menu was available, the bar was not breaking Italian law. “I should have checked the menu,” James told The Local, adding that he and his wife had previously been guests of Italian relatives and so had not encountered such problems.</p><p>When approached by The Local, the waiter said that he only worked at the bar and did not decide the menu prices. When the manager arrived at Bar il Caffè later on Thursday, he told The Local that he was an “honest” person and the problem was the customers’ fault. “It’s their fault…I advise foreigners to read the menu,” he said, declining to give his name and pointing to menus on a number of outdoor tables.</p><p>“Italy isn’t like other countries. Here there’s always a different price at the bar and sat at a table,” the manager added, pointing to a sign above the ice cream stand which in English states the cheaper “take-away” prices. “An ice cream in this cup is big,” the manager said, holding up a glass bowl which carries the €13 price tag. “You could have it for lunch!”</p><p>But the Lucianis are not the first visitors to complain that the place is a tourist trap. The bar’s TripAdvisor page gets a resounding “terrible” rating from 25 of its 28 reviews. A British tourist who visited earlier this month described the bar as a “complete rip off” to “avoid at all costs” after she was charged €29 for two drinks.</p><ul><li>Image <a

hotel Saturday morning.</ins></p><p><ins>The trailer was parked at the Hampton Inn along Bass Pro Drive in Manteca, Manteca Police say. At some point between 12:30 and 6:30 a.m., police say, thieves took off with the whole caravan of vehicles – which not only includes a pickup truck and a trailer, but three classic Volkswagen Mini Buses.</ins></p><p><ins>The VW Mini Buses were in the trailer, which was attached to a Ford F-350, when the theft happened, police say. Police say that the VW Mini Buses alone are worth about $100,000 each. The buses are used as a part of Tillamook’s promotional tour, each one highlighting the company’s different cheese, yogurt and ice cream products.</ins></p><p><ins>It shouldn’t be too hard to spot the vehicles, as all of them are custom-painted orange with the “Tillamook” logo emblazoned on the sides. Anyone who knows where the vehicles might be is asked to call the Manteca Police Department at (209) 456-8101. The following is the vehicle’s description, along with their license plate numbers:</ins></p><p><ins>♦ 2008 Ford F350, Oregon License plate number Y116821 
♦ Wells Cargo Trailer, Oregon License plate number TF1144 
♦ 1964 VW Mini Bus, Oregon License plate number YUM4

court judge banned Master Softee from operating its rogue fleet of ice cream trucks that blatantly rip off the Mister Softee brand — but so far, the Master’s rapscallion cast of dessert vendors refuses to budge.</ins></p><p><ins>The June 5 ruling was a score for Mister Softee. The summertime treat powerhouse had sued its former franchisee, Dimitrios Tsirkos, who runs his buggies in Queens, Manhattan and the Bronx out of a depot in Long Island City.</ins></p><p><ins>The 53-year-old Woodside businessman painted his vehicles in a familiar-looking red, white and blue color scheme and included a grinning, cone-headed mascot — making the truck difficult to differentiate from a Mister Softee four-wheeler.</ins></p><p><ins>“It is obvious that (Tsirkos) adopted his truck designs with the object of achieving an appearance similar to plaintiff’s Mister Softee trucks,” Judge Laura Taylor Swain wrote in court papers. “The trucks are designed to appeal to children, who are relatively unsophisticated consumers.”</ins></p><p><ins>Swain barred Tsirkos from using the name Master Softee or any other confusing names or marks, and prohibited Tsirkos from involvement in any facet of theretail ice cream industry within 5 miles of his former Mister Softee franchise territories until February 2016.</ins></p><p><ins>Still, the Daily News spotted Master Softee trucks over the weekend on Sixth Ave., in Greenwich Village, and along Broadway in Astoria. Mister Softee co-owner Jim Conway said that a private eye retained by his company counted 10 of the trucks on Saturday and Sunday in Manhattan.</ins></p><p><ins>“These guys are bad guys on all levels,” said Conway, whose family founded the New Jersey-based chain in 1956. “We don’t have an alternative but to work through the court system. Conway and his lawyer, Jeff Zucker, have spent more than a decade suing knockoff Mister Softee ice cream trucks. They say they have never lost a case.</ins></p><p><ins>Tsirkos’ attorney, Nicholas Damadeo, wouldn’t explain why the illegal sugar-loving crew appeared to be ignoring the court’s order. “The case is still proceeding,” Damadeo said, adding the ban is not permanent and Tsirkos can file an appeal. “That’s one of the avenues that is available.”</ins></p><p><ins>Meanwhile, Mister Softee investigators plan to submit photographs of Master Softee trucks in action, hoping that Swain will come down on Tsirkos. “They are violating the judge’s orders,” Conway said.</ins></p><ul><li><ins>Image <a

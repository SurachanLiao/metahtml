            <p>The Golden State Warriors played a normal home game at Chase Center on Saturday night despite a <a href="https://www.sfdph.org/dph/alerts/coronavirus-faq.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Friday warning from the San Francisco public health department</a> urging that "non-essential large gatherings should be canceled or postponed" due to the spread of the coronavirus. But it sounds like things may not be normal for much longer.</p>

     
            <p>On Monday, <a href="https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1237073983587090433" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported</a> that the NBA has scheduled a conference call with owners Wednesday to discuss next steps for the league as the number of COVID-19 cases in the country continues to rise.</p>

        </p>
     <p>"Concerns are escalating among owners and executives that more drastic steps could be coming for the league, including games played with only essential personnel in arenas; the precise scenario that the NBA has required teams be prepared to execute," he <a href="https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1237073983587090433" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted.</a></p>

     <p><a href="https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1237131647667011584" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wojnarowski also reported</a> that the league is "planning to limit locker room access to only players and essential team personnel" going forward. In addition, teams have reportedly been instructed to "create a 6-to-8 foot distance between players and media in availability sessions outside locker rooms."</p>

<p>LeBron James <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/warriors/article/Warriors-76ers-coronavirus-Chase-Center-measures-15113307.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previously stated</a> that he would not play in games if fans were not present, and Houston Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta said he would prefer to see play suspended instead.</p>

    <p>The Warriors have a home game against the Los Angeles Clippers on Tuesday night, which will occur a day before the league's conference call. Golden State is scheduled to host the Brooklyn Nets on Thursday night, and there's a possibility that could be the start of the NBA's new normal as the virus spreads.</p>

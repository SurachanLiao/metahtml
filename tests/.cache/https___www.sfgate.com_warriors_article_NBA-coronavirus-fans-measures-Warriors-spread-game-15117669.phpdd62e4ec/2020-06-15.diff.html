                    </p><p>The Golden State Warriors played a normal home game at Chase Center on Saturday night despite a <a href="https://www.sfdph.org/dph/alerts/coronavirus-faq.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Friday warning from the San Francisco public health department</a> urging that "non-essential large gatherings should be canceled or postponed" due to the spread of the coronavirus. But it sounds like things may not be normal for much longer.</p><p>On Monday, <a href="https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1237073983587090433" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported</a> that the NBA has scheduled a conference call with owners Wednesday to discuss next steps for the league as the number of COVID-19 cases in the country continues to rise.</p><p>"Concerns are escalating among owners and executives that more drastic steps could be coming for the league, including games played with only essential personnel in arenas; the precise scenario that the NBA has required teams be prepared to execute," he <a href="https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1237073983587090433" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted.</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1237131647667011584" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wojnarowski also reported</a> that the league is "planning to limit locker room access to only players and essential team personnel" going forward. In addition, teams have reportedly been instructed to "create a 6-to-8 foot distance between players and media in availability sessions outside locker rooms."</p><p class="video_automatch_header"></p><h3>Recommended Video:</h3> <p>LeBron James <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/warriors/article/Warriors-76ers-coronavirus-Chase-Center-measures-15113307.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previously stated</a> that he would not play in games if fans were not present, and Houston Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta said he would prefer to see play suspended instead.</p><p>The Warriors have a home game against the Los Angeles Clippers on Tuesday night, which will occur a day before the league's conference call. Golden State is scheduled to host the Brooklyn Nets on Thursday night, and there's a possibility that could be the start of the NBA's new normal as the virus spreads.</p><p>MORE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:</p> <ul><li><ins><a href="%E2%80%9Chttps:/www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/coronavirus-websites-online-resources-best-trusted-15094737.php%E2%80%9D">A full list of online coronavirus resources: Where to get your questions answered Link: %E2%80%9Chttps:/www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/coronavirus-websites-online-resources-best-trusted-15094737.php%E2%80%9D </a></ins></li><ins> </ins><li><ins><a href="%E2%80%9Chttps:/www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/most-common-symptoms-coronavirus-fever-cough-15111345.php%E2%80%9D">The two most common symptoms in coronavirus patients, says report Link: %E2%80%9Chttps:/www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/most-common-symptoms-coronavirus-fever-cough-15111345.php%E2%80%9D </a></ins></li><ins> </ins><li><ins><a href="%E2%80%9Chttps:/www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/How-coronavirus-compares-to-epidemics-of-the-past-15099913.php#photo-18853876%E2%80%9D">How coronavirus compares to epidemics of the past Link: %E2%80%9Chttps:/www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/How-coronavirus-compares-to-epidemics-of-the-past-15099913.php#photo-18853876%E2%80%9D </a></ins></li><ins> </ins><li><ins><a href="%E2%80%9Chttps:/www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/how-can-you-tell-if-you-have-coronavirus-flu-cold-15093687.php%E2%80%9D">How to tell if you have a cold, the flu, or coronavirus  Link: %E2%80%9Chttps:/www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/how-can-you-tell-if-you-have-coronavirus-flu-cold-15093687.php%E2%80%9D </a></ins></li><ins> </ins><li><ins><a href="%E2%80%9Chttps:/www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/coronavirus-Bay-Area-companies-work-from-home-news-15111144.php%E2%80%9D" target="“_blank”" rel="“noopener”">These companies are asking Bay Area employees to work from home due to coronavirus Link: %E2%80%9Chttps:/www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/coronavirus-Bay-Area-companies-work-from-home-news-15111144.php%E2%80%9D </a></ins></li><ins> </ins><li><ins><a href="%E2%80%9Chttps:/www.sfgate.com/news/article/Bay-Area-school-closures-coronavirus-sf-san-jose-15117093.php%E2%80%9D" target="“_blank”" rel="“noopener”">List of Bay Area school closures due to COVID-19 Link: %E2%80%9Chttps:/www.sfgate.com/news/article/Bay-Area-school-closures-coronavirus-sf-san-jose-15117093.php%E2%80%9D </a></ins></li><ins> </ins><li><ins><a href="%E2%80%9Chttps:/www.sfgate.com/travel/article/coronavirus-covid-19-travel-tips-15096847.php%E2%80%9D">6 things travelers should know in the age of coronavirus Link: %E2%80%9Chttps:/www.sfgate.com/travel/article/coronavirus-covid-19-travel-tips-15096847.php%E2%80%9D </a></ins></li><ins> </ins><li><ins><a href="%E2%80%9Chttps:/www.sfgate.com/science/article/Worst-myths-and-misinformation-coronavirus-covid19-15090614.php%E2%80%9D">The worst myths and misinformation about coronavirus Link: %E2%80%9Chttps:/www.sfgate.com/science/article/Worst-myths-and-misinformation-coronavirus-covid19-15090614.php%E2%80%9D </a></ins></li><ins> </ins><li><ins><a href="%E2%80%9Chttps:/www.sfgate.com/science/article/hand-sanitizer-how-to-make-your-own-recipe-15102238.php%E2%80%9D" target="“_blank”" rel="“noopener”">Out of hand sanitizer?

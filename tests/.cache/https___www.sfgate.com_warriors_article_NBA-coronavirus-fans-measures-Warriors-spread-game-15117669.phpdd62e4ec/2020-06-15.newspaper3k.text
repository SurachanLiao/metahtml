The Golden State Warriors played a normal home game at Chase Center on Saturday night despite a Friday warning from the San Francisco public health department urging that "non-essential large gatherings should be canceled or postponed" due to the spread of the coronavirus. But it sounds like things may not be normal for much longer.

On Monday, ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported that the NBA has scheduled a conference call with owners Wednesday to discuss next steps for the league as the number of COVID-19 cases in the country continues to rise.

"Concerns are escalating among owners and executives that more drastic steps could be coming for the league, including games played with only essential personnel in arenas; the precise scenario that the NBA has required teams be prepared to execute," he tweeted.

Wojnarowski also reported that the league is "planning to limit locker room access to only players and essential team personnel" going forward. In addition, teams have reportedly been instructed to "create a 6-to-8 foot distance between players and media in availability sessions outside locker rooms."

LeBron James previously stated that he would not play in games if fans were not present, and Houston Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta said he would prefer to see play suspended instead.

The Warriors have a home game against the Los Angeles Clippers on Tuesday night, which will occur a day before the league's conference call. Golden State is scheduled to host the Brooklyn Nets on Thursday night, and there's a possibility that could be the start of the NBA's new normal as the virus spreads.

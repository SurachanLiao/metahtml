<div><p>&#8220;Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that their deeds will be exposed. But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what they have done has been done in the sight of God.&#8221;- Jesus</p>
<p>Of all the of the wisdom shared with the world by Jesus or whoever it was that wrote the Book of John 100 years after JC&#8217;s death, the quote above is one of my favorites. I understand it because I have lived in what it describes. There was a short period in my life that I hid from the light worried that my sins, my evil would be exposed. I lived behind curtains drawn, and shades pulled because I was ashamed, embarrassed for what I had done. Thankfully, this was a very short time in my life, but it happened, and I know that I am not alone. I am sure it has happened to many of you.</p>
<p>I remember vividly that moment I decided to step out of the darkness and face the light, face my past, face my actions, and more importantly face my new future. I remember feeling cleansed, liberated, still burden by my mistake but no longer hiding, no longer fearing the light.</p>
<p>What strikes me about these two sentences is that I know every Evangelical Christian in America knows them by heart, knows there context, and knows who Jesus was speaking too. They have also used these simple words parceled together to justify their own righteousness, their own purity of heart and their relentless condemnation of others. Which is why, brothers and sisters, I continue to be amazed that the high perched &#8220;Christians&#8221; like Franklin Graham tumbling all the way down to the Frankie Graham&#8217;s in Bumfuck, Alabama continue to accept and support Donald J. Trump as their lord and savior.</p>
<p>You see, Donald J. Trump is terrified of the light because the light shines on everyone the same. Sinners and saints. Rich and poor. White, black, and orange. It doesn&#8217;t care how much money you have, your last name, or how bad your spray tan is. The light exposes all evil, sins, lies the same and the only way to avoid it is to hide from it or in the case of Trump, sue.</p>
<p>Remember Trump&#8217;s tax returns? The ones he would release once the audit was complete. Well that didn&#8217;t happen and it isn&#8217;t going to happen. As matter of fact Trump is asking the Supreme Court, the highest authority in the land (sorry folks it isn&#8217;t God) to make sure his taxes never see the light of day. I wonder why? Could he be hiding something? Something evil? Maybe even illegal? Trump&#8217;s taxes live in the darkness.</p>
<p>And how about Trump&#8217;s health? Have you seen the video of him walking down the ramp or having to use his two little hands to drink a glass of water? One to hold the cup, the other to push it up to his mouth. Obviously, something is wrong with him. We all know mentally he is bat shit crazy but something else is happening. Many in the healthcare field have speculated Trump is suffering from dementia. But what do we hear from his doctors? Trump is the picture of health. The healthiest President the world has ever known. He is 100 pounds lighter than he looks and hell he even grew an inch while in the White House. Trump&#8217;s health lives in the darkness.</p>
<p>And now Trump is suing John Bolton and his niece Mary Trump for books that apparently cast that dreaded light he works so hard to avoid. Trump claims Bolton writes about classified information in his book and Mary Trump signed a Non-Disclosure Agreement. What kind of man gets his own family member to sign an NDA? What the hell did he do so bad to her or her family that required her to never speak of it? Wouldn&#8217;t you love to see the list of people over the last 50 years that have signed one of Trump&#8217;s NDA&#8217;s? I promise, given all the people he has screwed figuratively and literally it is a very long list.</p>
<p>But The Donald has a problem, a big problem that will haunt him in what should be his golden years&#8230;.light and lawsuits. You see, Bolton and Mary&#8217;s books are just two of the hundreds that will begin trickling out. Most folks will wait until the election is over, maybe even until his fat ass is parked permanently in Florida. The book agents are having a field day and the authors they are representing will be anyone and everyone, from political heavyweights, even foreign leaders to the guy that made midnight runs to KFC and Burger King for him, and the lady that weaved his hair every morning. And do not forget about Robert Mueller and the sealed indictments he spread around different states like landmines waiting to detonate.</p>
<p>Those indictments will see the light of day beginning January 21, 2021, Trump&#8217;s first full day as the Ex-President. Those indictments will keep him busy, and here is the best part, they will be very expensive to defend. What we can expect to see from Trump in his golden years are telethons, telethons to support his MAGA defense fund on the 700 Club and QVC, and lots of rallies but this time at fair grounds, and high school gyms. And rather than being free he will have to charge ten dollars a head and sale t-shirts, hats, funnel cakes and hot dogs. Trump&#8217;s going to hate the light even more than he does now.</p>

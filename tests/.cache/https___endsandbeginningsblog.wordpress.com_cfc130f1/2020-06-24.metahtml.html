But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what they have done has been done in the sight of God.&#8221;- Jesus</p><p>Of all the of the wisdom shared with the world by Jesus or whoever it was that wrote the Book of John 100 years after JC&#8217;s death, the quote above is one of my favorites. I understand it because I have lived in what it describes. There was a short period in my life that I hid from the light worried that my sins, my evil would be exposed. I lived behind curtains drawn, and shades pulled because I was ashamed, embarrassed for what I had done. Thankfully, this was a very short time in my life, but it happened, and I know that I am not alone. I am sure it has happened to many of you.</p><p>I remember vividly that moment I decided to step out of the darkness and face the light, face my past, face my actions, and more importantly face my new future. I remember feeling cleansed, liberated, still burden by my mistake but no longer hiding, no longer fearing the light.</p><p>What strikes me about these two sentences is that I know every Evangelical Christian in America knows them by heart, knows there context, and knows who Jesus was speaking too. They have also used these simple words parceled together to justify their own righteousness, their own purity of heart and their relentless condemnation of others. Which is why, brothers and sisters, I continue to be amazed that the high perched &#8220;Christians&#8221; like Franklin Graham tumbling all the way down to the Frankie Graham&#8217;s in Bumfuck, Alabama continue to accept and support Donald J. Trump as their lord and savior.</p><p>You see, Donald J. Trump is terrified of the light because the light shines on everyone the same. Sinners and saints. Rich and poor. White, black, and orange. It doesn&#8217;t care how much money you have, your last name, or how bad your spray tan is. The light exposes all evil, sins, lies the same and the only way to avoid it is to hide from it or in the case of Trump, sue.</p><p>Remember Trump&#8217;s tax returns? The ones he would release once the audit was complete. Well that didn&#8217;t happen and it isn&#8217;t going to happen. As matter of fact Trump is asking the Supreme Court, the highest authority in the land (sorry folks it isn&#8217;t God) to make sure his taxes never see the light of day. I wonder why? Could he be hiding something? Something evil? Maybe even illegal? Trump&#8217;s taxes live in the darkness.</p><p>And how about Trump&#8217;s health? Have you seen the video of him walking down the ramp or having to use his two little hands to drink a glass of water? One to hold the cup, the other to push it up to his mouth. Obviously, something is wrong with him. We all know mentally he is bat shit crazy but something else is happening. Many in the healthcare field have speculated Trump is suffering from dementia. But what do we hear from his doctors? Trump is the picture of health. The healthiest President the world has ever known. He is 100 pounds lighter than he looks and hell he even grew an inch while in the White House. Trump&#8217;s health lives in the darkness.</p><p>And now Trump is suing John Bolton and his niece Mary Trump for books that apparently cast that dreaded light he works so hard to avoid. Trump claims Bolton writes about classified information in his book and Mary Trump signed a Non-Disclosure Agreement. What kind of man gets his own family member to sign an NDA? What the hell did he do so bad to her or her family that required her to never speak of it? Wouldn&#8217;t you love to see the list of people over the last 50 years that have signed one of Trump&#8217;s NDA&#8217;s? I promise, given all the people he has screwed figuratively and literally it is a very long list.</p><p>But The Donald has a problem, a big problem that will haunt him in what should be his golden years&#8230;.light and lawsuits. You see, Bolton and Mary&#8217;s books are just two of the hundreds that will begin trickling out. Most folks will wait until the election is over, maybe even until his fat ass is parked permanently in Florida. The book agents are having a field day and the authors they are representing will be anyone and everyone, from political heavyweights, even foreign leaders to the guy that made midnight runs to KFC and Burger King for him, and the lady that weaved his hair every morning. And do not forget about Robert Mueller and the sealed indictments he spread around different states like landmines waiting to detonate.</p><p>Those indictments will see the light of day beginning January 21, 2021, Trump&#8217;s first full day as the Ex-President. Those indictments will keep him busy, and here is the best part, they will be very expensive to defend. What we can expect to see from Trump in his golden years are telethons, telethons to support his MAGA defense fund on the 700 Club and QVC, and lots of rallies but this time at fair grounds, and high school gyms. And rather than being free he will have to charge ten dollars a head and sale t-shirts, hats, funnel cakes and hot dogs. Trump&#8217;s going to hate the light even more than he does now.</p><p class="entry-utility">

<p>Down I-85, south of the city I call home there is billboard with a picture of the face of &#8220;Jesus&#8221; or at least how the Southern Baptist think &#8220;Jesus&#8221; looks. I like to call the Southern Baptist &#8220;Jesus&#8221; suntanned Jesus, not white with blues eyes but certainly not dark or middle eastern looking either. Suntanned Jesus looks like the guy you buy t-shirts from at the gift shop in Myrtle Beach. He used to be a lifeguard but he aged out of that gig and just can&#8217;t find another job that allows him to live the hang-loose, its casual life he loves and is so accustomed too.</p>
<p>I pass suntanned Jesus once a month or so, looking down on the world or at least the traffic on I-85 from high atop His billboard perch. Next to suntanned Jesus&#8217; image are these hypocritical words JESUS IS ALIVE. I am here to tell that is a lie, Jesus isn&#8217;t alive. For the Southern Baptists, Evangelicals, and the Franklin Graham&#8217;s of the world, Jesus is dead and he dies a new death every, single day.</p>
<p>The idea that Jesus is alive derives from the dogma that He lives in the hearts and souls of His followers. But here is the problem, like the image of Jesus that they have bastardize for their own benefit they have also bastardize what he said, believed and stood for. Need proof? Look at the image above, the image of the man Evangelicals claim as their savior. The man they believe was delivered by God to take them to the promise land while oppressing the rest of us. Does that man act like Jesus lives in his heart? The greater question would be does he even have a heart?</p>
<p>Trump didn&#8217;t kill Jesus. He was long dead in the hearts and souls of Evangelicals. What Trump has done is allow the rest of to recognize the mark of the beast on these &#8220;Christians&#8221; foreheads. Trump gave them the voice, the platform, the means and the motivation to crawl out from under their rocks and prove once and for all that it wasn&#8217;t the Jews that killed Christ it was His own fraudulent believers, people who manipulate his words, actions and image in a way that benefits them and hurts the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Trump&#8217;s photo-op in front of St. John&#8217;s Church holding a book he has never opened only came to be after peaceful protesters were beat and gassed in Lafayette Square. This is the law and order of the suntanned Jesus and the orange Donald. This is the America we live in today. The America that has killed Jesus.</p>

I used a three-ring binder with indexed page separators, very powerful. Many important people have read it. I had the best people write it. Look at it. It is huge, bigger than Obama&#8217;s. Many people have said it was tremendous, very powerful. You know who I am talking about.&#8221;</p><p>Press: &#8220;Can we read it Mr. President?&#8221;</p><p>Trump: &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p><p>Press: &#8220;When Mr. President?&#8221;</p><p>Trump: &#8220;We will get you a copy. It is better than Obama&#8217;s fake plan that was just stapled. Ours is in a three-ring binder. Look at this powerful cover.&#8221;</p><p>Press: &#8220;Can we see some of the pages Mr. President?&#8221;</p><p>Trump: &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p><p>Press: &#8220;When Mr. President?&#8221;</p><p>Trump: &#8220;We will get you a copy.&#8221;</p><p>This exchange really did happen.</p><p>Press: &#8220;You appeared to accuse Obama of a crime yesterday. What did he do?&#8221;</p><p>Trump: &#8220;Obamagate.&#8221;</p><p>Press: &#8220;What is the crime?&#8221;</p><p>Trump: &#8220;You know what the crime is. The crime is very obvious to everybody.&#8221;</p><p>I know it seems like 100 years ago but during the time Robert Mueller was putting together his report Trump stood before the press with a stack of papers claiming what was in front of him was the beginnings of Rudy Giuliani&#8217;s own investigation. According to Trump, Rudy&#8217;s report was going to be bigger, badder, and more damning than anything the Democrats or the Fake News was going to put out about him and the Russian Hoax.</p><p>Fast forward 100 years to today and surprise, surprise, Rudy never put his report out. Honestly except during that two-week news cycle we have never heard another word about it. I know that shocks you, Trump telling us something was going to happen but it never did. Trump telling us he had proof but never sharing it. But here is the thing, the Rudy report and now the Trump pandemic playbook that has apparently been around for &#8220;years&#8221; is simply part of Trump&#8217;s con.</p><p>What Trump knows, and the press play right into, is that the average IQ of one of his faithful followers and defenders is about 12, 15 if they still have all of their teeth. In order to distract them, Trump throws shiny objects in the air to hold their attention while the real shit is hitting the fan.</p><p>Case in point, to date we are at 88,000 Coronavirus deaths and 1.5 million confirmed cases. What is Fox News covering? What are Rush, Tucker and Hannity talking about right now? Not the Coronavirus but Obamagate.</p><p>Do you even know what Obamagate is? Funny thing is Trump isn&#8217;t sure what it is other than a frightening sounding word. Remember Trump&#8217;s motto, when all else fails blame the black guy.</p><p>When asked what Obamagate actually was Trump responded that it was &#8220;obvious to everybody.&#8221; Later he called it the &#8220;the biggest political crime in American history, by far!&#8221;</p><p>This is what it is. Obamagate is a word, nothing but a made up, unoriginal word. It is not a theory and it is certainly not based on any fact or proof. It is a word concocted in the mind of an isolated, 72-year-old man high on Adderall. A man who sits alone in his bedroom for 90% of the day, fuming that the world sees him as a joke, watching television and tweeting.</p><p>It is just another shiny object Trump tossed in the air for the 12 and 15 IQ&#8217;s to sink their teeth into. Something for them to blame, and hate while Trump&#8217;s Coronavirus response kills their grandmother. Something for them to blame, and hate as they try to stretch that $1,200 check for one more month. Something for them to blame, and hate because they are to fucking proud and stupid to admit that they were wrong about Trump.</p><p>I hope each of you are doing well. Staying healthy, six feet apart and conserving toilet paper. We will get through this and live to tell our grand-kids that we survived that thing called Trumpgate one day. Peace.</p><p class="entry-utility">

<p>My late Grandmother was born at the tail end of the 1918 flu pandemic (referred to as the Spanish flu). I only remember hearing her talk about it once, sometime in 1970&#8217;s, during a particularly bad flu season which stirred her memory.</p>
<p>My grandmother lived in an isolated, rural area of North Carolina. The thought was, given the remote and clannish nature of the region that there was little to fear about being infected. But then men, farm boys began coming home from World War I and with them came the flu. As she recounted the story it was thought the 1918 flu killed mostly young adults and pregnant women were particularly vulnerable and her mother, my great-grandmother was pregnant with her.</p>
<p>She didn&#8217;t have a lot of facts and figures about the pandemic. She didn&#8217;t remember if anyone died or what affect it had on her community, she just remembered how frightening it was to hear about it growing up. That something you couldn&#8217;t see, smell, taste or touch could wreck this much havoc on the world was terrifying to a little girl.</p>
<p>The estimates of how many people worldwide that died from the 1918 flu range from 17 million to as high 100 million. It infected 500 million people which represented about a third of the world&#8217;s population. In the U.S., between 500,000 to 800,000 people died and 28% of the population, 105 million, were infected.</p>
<p>As my wife and I have practiced social distancing, staying home and out of stores as much as possible I have thought a lot about my grandmother and what her family lived through in early 1900&#8217;s. I thought about how her family got information. Radio wasn&#8217;t available nationally until the late 1920&#8217;s and early 30&#8217;s. Her family may have had access to a local paper, but the &#8220;news&#8221; would have been mostly local features, obituaries, and crop prices.</p>
<p>Instead of radio, television, Facebook or Twitter in the 1900&#8217;s you got your information at the fence post that separated your farm from your neighbors farm. That&#8217;s how news spread, that&#8217;s how information was disseminated, from fence post to fence post and even in today&#8217;s high-tech world of instant access that form of communication still remains.</p>
<p>As many of you know, I live in the deep, red state of South Carolina run by the Dishonorable Henry &#8220;Foghorn Leghorn&#8221; McMaster. Governor Leghorn, anxious to please his orange master, along with the Governors of Georgia and Florida are all rolling back the Coronavirus restrictions even though COVID-19 infections and deaths continue to rise in their respective states, including mine.</p>
<p>Here is the thing that is so frustrating about this, unlike my grandmother and her family in the 1900&#8217;s, Henry &#8220;Foghorn Leghorn&#8221; McMaster has access to plenty of information, data, and smart people. And just so we are very clear on this point, I am not categorizing Trump or Pence as one or any of those smart people. As a matter of fact, I am not sure it is fair to other human beings to even categorize them as people. But nevertheless, the Governors of South Carolina, Georgia and Florida have all publicly declared that Trump is smarter than everyone else and they will defend him, and his bone headed decisions and assertions to OUR death.</p>
<p>So if you need a haircut, or a massage, or your nails done or want to go bowling, or work on your tan at the beach, or even touch-up your tattoo come to Dixie but remember &#160;&#8220;Look away, look away, look away Dixie Land&#8221;. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>

				<p>&#8220;If Russia or any other country or person has Hillary Clinton&#8217;s 33,000 illegally deleted emails, perhaps they should share them with the FBI!&#8221; &#8211; Trump tweet 7-27-16</p>
<p>We all heard it or have seen it, Trump telling the media at a July 2016 press conference at the Doral resort &#8220;Russia, if you&#8217;re listening, I hope you&#8217;re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press. Let&#8217;s see if that happens&#8221; which he followed-up with tweet above.</p>
<p>Recently, on February 29th of 2020, Trump gave a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) where he &#8220;attempted&#8221; to rewrite history about his infamous request of Russia. Trump&#8217;s new version: &#8220;Remember this thing, &#8216;Russia, if you&#8217;re listening&#8217;?&#8217; Remember, it was a big thing, in front of 25,000 people. &#8216;Russia if you&#8217;re&#8230;&#8217; It was all said in a joke. They cut it off right at the end so that you don&#8217;t then see the laughter, the joke. And they said, &#8216;He asked. He asked for help.&#8217; Right? Russia, if you&#8217;re listening&#8230; A very famous &#8212; they cut that thing so quick at the end because they didn&#8217;t want to hear the laughter in the place and me laughing. It was just &#8216;boom.&#8217; These are really dishonest people.&#8221;</p>
<p>I know this sounds like an oxymoron but the great thing about Trump, for those of us whose brains are not turned into MAGA mush, is the multitudes of evidence available to us that prove he is a lying sack of shit. From his own tweets, to video of his rally&#8217;s, press conferences, etc. Trump has, since day one of his presidency, attempted to rewrite his history one week, one day, one hour at a time.</p>
<p>In Trump&#8217;s new version of the Russia request, &#8220;It was all said in a joke&#8221; there are hundreds of video sources from varied news organizations, including Fox News, that cannot confirm or prove his assertion that the audience was laughing after he made this statement. None. There were a few gasps but no laughing. We can all watch the tape ourselves. Hell, for that matter so can Trump.</p>
<p>Trump has operated in this manner over his entire career. The thing you must remember about him is that he didn&#8217;t manufacture a widget. Trump&#8217;s &#8220;product&#8221; is his image, something that required his and his staff&#8217;s constant attention. It was important for Trump to stay in the news, so he said shit, lots of shit that got him press coverage. And if the coverage was unflattering, he lied claiming he didn&#8217;t say it, or it was taken out of context. But always, the bottom line was the coverage, good, bad or indifferent.</p>
<p>What Trump sells, and what got him elected was a brand, like a box of cereal. MAGA didn&#8217;t vote for him based on his intellect, or his moral character, of which he has neither. They picked him for the same reason they buy B&amp;M Baked Beans or Van Camp&#8217;s Pork &amp; Beans, their perception of the brand.</p>
<p>Once again Trump is attempting to rewrite another history, his lack of response to the emerging Coronavirus pandemic back in January. What he and his handlers are doing is a two-prong approach to the rewrite, find a scapegoat, China, the Democrats, the World Health Organization, and qualify his earlier tweets and speeches as attempts not to panic the country while he alone was making &#8220;decisive&#8221; decisions to save us from ourselves.</p>
<p>Never mind that in February he was &#8220;busy&#8221; making speeches at his redneck rallies, playing golf, and hanging out with his fat cat buddies at Mar-a-Lago.</p>
<p>The fun and sad part of the last three and half years is the mounds of evidence that make it crystal clear that Trump is a Buffon without a plan, without a qualified staff of advisors, without any inkling of any idea of what it takes to be the President of the United States. He is a brand, like Cap&#8217;n Crunch or Oscar Mayer Beef Franks and like any brand there is always an alternative to buy which is what Trump fears the most.</p>

<p>Back in the 1960&#8217;s and 70&#8217;s my family vacationed in the Myrtle Beach area, Garden City to be specific. From Charlotte, you drive down Hwy. 74 to 601, then 151 to 378 through Conway to Myrtle Beach. I always loved the drive from Charlotte to the beach because we weaved through landscapes, pine forest and swamps, so different from the Piedmont region I lived in.</p>
<p>If you know anything about the Myrtle Beach area you know that the 60&#8217;s and 70&#8217;s were boom times for the region. Snowbirds who originally were headed to Florida decided that Myrtle Beach was far enough South. A massive Air Force base brought personnel in and most decided to stay once their enlistment was up. Land was cheap to buy and regulations that dealt with clearing and filling in swamp land were non-existent. It was the wild, wild west of tract home building.</p>
<p>The way developers cleared acres of land back then was to take a bulldozer, knock every tree down and stack them in big piles. Then they would pour diesel fuel on the stack, strike a match and create the world&#8217;s biggest bonfires. The piles of wood would smolder for weeks and every week several new sites were cleared, and new bonfires were created. It seems, in my child&#8217;s mind, that Myrtle Beach was on fire for close to 15 years.</p>
<p>Hwy. 378 follows the Great Pee Dee River and crosses it right before you get to Conway. That&#8217;s where the smoke would begin to fill the air, smoke from hundreds of smoldering wood piles in the swamps. That&#8217;s when I knew we were close to the beach.</p>
<p>There is an assortment of environmental regulations in place today to prevent developers from raping and scorching the earth like they used to in Myrtle Beach. You can&#8217;t just slash-and-burn or fill-in wetlands because of your property rights, &#8220;it&#8217;s my land and I&#8217;ll do whatever the hell I want to with it&#8221;. The welfare of other human beings, other creatures, our world is taken into consideration today. As the old saying goes, Your Liberty To Swing Your Fist Ends Just Where My Nose Begins and a developers rights to fill our lungs with smoke because it was a &#8220;cheaper&#8221; alternative was certainly a practice that deserved to be regulated and eventually snuffed out.</p>
<p>When Trump and the dead squirrel he calls hair leave Washington in January along with his spray tan box manufactured by Earl Scheib he will be remembered for many things. Here is my list in no particular order:</p>
<ol>
<li>He was incompetent.</li>
<li>An absolute Buffon and moron.</li>
<li>He was corrupt, immoral, unethical and dishonest.</li>
<li>He was a childish and immature.</li>
<li>He was unprepared for the enormity of the job.</li>
<li>He was undereducated and unqualified for the position.</li>
<li>He accomplished very little.</li>
<li>He ruined our economy.</li>
<li>He eroded the moral fiber of our country.</li>
<li>He gave racist a voice and validation.</li>
<li>He divided our nation and encouraged the division.</li>
<li>He alienated our allies, the world.</li>
<li>He persecuted immigrants and those of different faiths and beliefs.</li>
<li>He saddled future generations with an insurmountable debt.</li>
<li>He set the environmental progress we had made (clean air, clean water, alternative fuels) back at least 50 years.</li>
</ol>
<p>Since I am not a Republican or a Conservative or a fucking idiot, I can&#8217;t name one positive achievement, one accomplishment he will be remembered for.</p>
<p>My kids, 30 and 27, are concerned about two major things. Two things that really bother them going forward, how divided this country is today, and how little regard a segment of our population has for the environment.</p>
<p>Trump has made it very clear that he doesn&#8217;t give a flying flip about the earth or our health. If allowing oil and coal companies to pollute our air and water will get him more campaign money and get him re-elected so be it. His view on the environment mirrors his view on life, if it doesn&#8217;t help me, I don&#8217;t give a rat&#8217;s ass about it and he proved that again today. Trump&#8217;s EPA is preparing to reverse an Obama rule, surprise, surprise, that forced coal-fired power plants to cut their mercury emissions.</p>
<p>But here is the fun part of this story, utility companies are pushing back on the potential loosening of mercury requirements. Even though utility companies are not known for their eco-consciousness, they are smart enough to realize that their customers are. A similar pushback occurred in the auto industry when Trump reversed another Obama rule about emissions. Again, automakers were smart enough to know that consumers were demanding more eco friendly vehicles and have, to date, not change their emissions standards.</p>
<p>But the U.S. coal industry has criticized the mercury rule and blamed it for putting hundreds of coal-fired power plants out of business. If you recall, along with telling us that Mexico would be paying for his wall, the other promise Trump made during his campaign was to bring coal back. Fortunately, like his Mexico &#8220;success&#8221;, the coal industry has lost thousands of jobs since Trump made that bullshit promise. Rather than propping-up an ancient fuel source that poisons the world a progressive, forward thinking man would have promised to retrain and create new opportunities for the coal work force. But Trump is a dinosaur, just like coal, who is unable to see beyond the one day market gains or his poll numbers. Tomorrow means nothing to Trump. He is only looking for gratification and self-indulgent praise for today.</p>

Hell turn the audio off so your soul doesn&#8217;t explode from all the bullshit being spewed. Watch it so you can see a 72-year-old man act like the spoiled eight-year-old that he really is. Watch him smirk with pride as this &#8220;slick&#8221; production, with cameo appearances by the regular Fox News talking heads, tries to explain away why Trump sat on his fat, white, wide ass for so long before he acted on the Coronavirus. At least he thought the video accomplished that.</p><p>But then one, brave CBS reporter asked the question everyone else was thinking. After watching Trump&#8217;s timeline video of how &#8220;decisive&#8221; he acted Paula Reid asked, &#8220;The video has a complete gap the month of February.&#8221; And the eight-year-old responded accordingly:</p><p>Trump: On January 30&#8212;</p><p>Reid: What did your administration due in February with the time that your travel ban bought you?</p><p>Trump: A lot.</p><p>Reid: What?</p><p>Trump: A lot. And in fact, will give you a list what we did. In fact, part of it was up there. We did a lot.</p><p>Reid: It wasn&#8217;t up there. The video had a gap.</p><p>Trump: Look, look, you know you&#8217;re a fake. You know that. Your whole network, the way you cover it is fake. And most of you&#8211;and not all of you, but the people are wise to you. That&#8217;s why you have a lower&#8211;a lower approval rating than you ever had before times probably three.</p><p>Reid: 20 million people are now unemployed.</p><p>Trump: And when you ask me that question&#8212;</p><p>Reid: &#8211;Tens of thousands are dead, Mr. President&#8212;</p><p>Trump: &#8211;Let me ask you this. Why didn&#8217;t Biden&#8211;why didn&#8217;t&#8211;why did Biden apologize? Why did he write a letter&#8212;</p><p>I am not sure where he was going with the &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t Biden&#8211;why didn&#8217;t&#8211;why did Biden apologize?&#8221; except by now we all know that his fall back position is to blame Hillary, Obama, Comey, Biden, Democrats, Nancy, Adam, Fake News, Deep State, blah, blah, blah, blah.</p><p>Just as a reminder, let me help you fill in the February gap.</p><p>Feb. 7 (tweet): &#8220;&#8230;&#8230; as the weather starts to warm &amp; the virus hopefully becomes weaker, and then gone.&#8221;</p><p>Feb. 10: &#8220;I think the virus is going to be &#8212; it&#8217;s going to be fine.&#8221;</p><p>Feb. 14: &#8220;We have a very small number of people in the country, right now, with it. It&#8217;s like around 12. Many of them are getting better. Some are fully recovered already. So we&#8217;re in very good shape.&#8221;</p><p>Feb. 19: &#8220;I think it&#8217;s going to work out fine. I think when we get into April, in the warmer weather, that has a very negative effect on that and that type of a virus. So let&#8217;s see what happens, but I think it&#8217;s going to work out fine.&#8221;</p><p>Feb. 24 (tweet): &#8220;The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. &#8230; Stock Market starting to look very good to me!&#8221;</p><p>Feb. 25: &#8220;You may ask about the coronavirus, which is very well under control in our country. We have very few people with it, and the people that have it are &#8230; getting better. They&#8217;re all getting better. &#8230; As far as what we&#8217;re doing with the new virus, I think that we&#8217;re doing a great job.&#8221;</p><p>Feb. 26: &#8220;Because of all we&#8217;ve done, the risk to the American people remains very low. &#8230; When you have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero. That&#8217;s a pretty good job we&#8217;ve done.&#8221;</p><p>Feb. 28: &#8220;I think it&#8217;s really going well. &#8230; We&#8217;re prepared for the worst, but we think we&#8217;re going to be very fortunate.&#8221;</p><p>Feb. 28: &#8220;It&#8217;s going to disappear. One day, it&#8217;s like a miracle, it will disappear.&#8221;</p><p>Feb. 28: &#8220;This is their new hoax.&#8221;</p><p>Trump was right he has done a lot. He has helped 15 million people lose their jobs and he is certainly responsible for the deaths of almost 25,000 Americans because, after all, he has &#8220;total authority&#8221; which also means he must accept the total blame.</p><p class="entry-utility">

Birds and snakes, and aeroplanes</p><p>
And Lenny Bruce is not afraid</p>
 
<p class="ujudUb">Eye of a hurricane, listen to yourself churn</p><p>
World serves its own needs</p><p>
Don&#8217;t mis-serve your own needs</p><p>
Speed it up a notch, speed, grunt, no, strength</p><p>
The ladder starts to clatter</p><p>
With a fear of height, down, height</p><p>
Wire in a fire, represent the seven games</p><p>
And a government for hire and a combat site</p><p>
Left her, wasn&#8217;t coming in a hurry</p><p>
With the Furies breathing down your neck</p>
 


<p class="ujudUb u7wWjf">Team by team, reporters baffled, trumped, tethered, cropped</p><p>
Look at that low plane, fine, then</p><p>
Uh oh, overflow, population, common group</p><p>
But it&#8217;ll do, save yourself, serve yourself</p><p>
World serves its own needs, listen to your heart bleed</p><p>
Tell me with the Rapture and the reverent in the right, right</p><p>
You vitriolic, patriotic, slam fight, bright light</p><p>
Feeling pretty psyched</p>
 
<p class="ujudUb xpdxpnd">It&#8217;s the end of the world as we know it</p><p>
It&#8217;s the end of the world as we know it</p><p>
It&#8217;s the end of the world as we know it and I feel fine</p>
 
<p class="ujudUb xpdxpnd">Six o&#8217;clock, T.V. hour, don&#8217;t get caught in foreign tower</p><p>
Slash and burn, return, listen to yourself churn</p><p>
Lock him in uniform, book burning, bloodletting</p><p>
Every motive escalate, automotive incinerate</p><p>
Light a candle, light a motive, step down, step down</p><p>
Watch your heel crush, crush, uh oh</p><p>
This means no fear, cavalier, renegade and steering clear</p><p>
A tournament, a tournament, a tournament of lies</p><p>
Offer me solutions, offer me alternatives and I decline</p>
 
<p class="ujudUb xpdxpnd">It&#8217;s the end of the world as we know it (I had some time alone)</p><p>
It&#8217;s the end of the world as we know it (I had some time alone)</p><p>
It&#8217;s the end of the world as we know it and I feel fine (time I had some time alone)</p><p>
I feel fine (I feel fine)</p>
 
<p class="ujudUb xpdxpnd">The other night I drifted nice continental drift divide</p><p>
Mountains sit in a line, Leonard Bernstein</p><p>

<p>Back when Donald was just candidate Trump, I was doing some contract work for a local developer. The developer was trying a assemble some smaller properties to put them together to make one big property. He hired me to track down the owners, make offers, close on the properties and then get them cleaned-up. Several of the properties had remnants of a house or other out-buildings on them.</p>
<p>I hired a good ole boy, Chad, from the northern part of the county, an area we call the &#8220;Dark Corner&#8221;, to come tear down, clean-up and haul off the debris. What Chad was hired to do wasn&#8217;t rocket science. Basically all he needed to get the job done was a hammer, a crowbar, a pair of gloves, a pick-up truck, a strong back and enough sense not to get bit by a snake or stuck by a nail.</p>
<p>One hot day I brought Chad and whoever he happened to find to help him a cooler full of ice-cold Gatorade. Every day Chad asked me the same question,&#160;&#8220;You got my money?&#8221;&#160;Yes Chad, I always answered.&#160;&#8220;Well why don&#8217;t you just give it to me now then you ain&#8217;t got to come back&#8221;.&#160; I don&#8217;t mind coming back is what I told him.</p>
<p>Chad saw the Hillary sticker on the back of my car. &#8220;If you don&#8217;t mind me asking, why you voting for that bitch?&#8221;&#160;Who are you voting for, Trump I asked?&#160;&#8220;Damn right!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So, if you don&#8217;t mind me asking, why are you voting for that blowhard piece of shit?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cause fucking Trump tells it like is. He don&#8217;t give a shit what nobody thinks.&#8221;</p>
<p>As you can tell this was a riveting, and deeply profound political conversation.</p>
<p>Our world is filled with Chad&#8217;s and we need them. Chad&#8217;s do the work that folks like me don&#8217;t want to do. They keep Budweiser, Pork Rind manufactures, NASCAR and Tattoo Parlors in business. Not so much Dentist or Deodorant companies, but without Chad&#8217;s our economy would come to screeching halt. Chad&#8217;s are not intellectual giants they are simple minded folks and their pleasures are simple minded as well.</p>
<p>Chad&#8217;s don&#8217;t read books or have existential thoughts. If they aren&#8217;t working, they are smoking and drinking, and if they aren&#8217;t smoking and drinking, they are screwing, or thinking about screwing, or talking about screwing. Is it any wonder that the Chad&#8217;s of the world love Donald Trump? Hell, I get it.</p>
<p>What Chad see&#8217;s in Donald Trump is a fancy piece of white trash that wears expensive suits and has a hot wife with fake tits. Honestly that is all Trump really is, white trash in a fancy box with a red ribbon. The differences between Chad and Trump are few except for one big one, Trump&#8217;s Daddy had money. Chad&#8217;s Daddy got Chad&#8217;s Mom knocked-up, probably in high school. Trump is where he is, and who he is because of Fred Trump. Simply stated, he is a member of the lucky sperm club. If Fred had been Chad&#8217;s Daddy, hell he might have been President. And if Donald had been the by product of Chad&#8217;s Mom getting knocked-up by Chad&#8217;s Daddy, Donald would have been the redneck with tattoos on his neck cleaning-up our properties asking, &#8220;You got my money?&#8221;</p>
<p>I understand why the Chad&#8217;s of the world love Trump. Those simple creatures that take great pride and joy in filling the cab of their truck up with the smell of a noxious fart that makes their girlfriend squeal. They don&#8217;t view Trump as an equal but as their protector. Trump encourages them to be rednecks, to be antisocial, to be racist, to be white trash. He doesn&#8217;t care if they smoke, or drink or get &#8220;fucked-up&#8221; or chase ass. In three years how much concern have we heard from Trump about our health, or drug use? Little to none.</p>
<p>Trump&#8217;s attitude about himself is very simple to figure out, I am rich, I am smart, leave me the fuck alone and do what I say. Chad&#8217;s feel the same way about themselves. They may not have cash wealth but they are rich in the things that make them happy. We may not consider them smart but they are clever enough to survive and Chad&#8217;s have survived in this country for 250 years. But most of all Chad&#8217;s want all of us to leave them the fuck alone, just like Donald. They don&#8217;t want us all up in their business. They don&#8217;t want you, or me, or the government telling them what they can or can not do.</p>
<p>When I asked Chad who he was voting for I already knew the answer. I also knew that Chad doesn&#8217;t vote. Hell, Chad has probably never voted in his life. But make no mistake about it if he did vote, if he could vote, Trump is his man despite the fact that Donald has made Chad&#8217;s meager existence harder to maintain and certainly harder to be proud of.</p>

Most folks assumed he inherited it or that he was born with money, but the reality was that Dan started the company himself with two desk, two chairs, two phones and one employee. At the time of his death seven years ago he had offices in five counties and probably controlled 60% of the residential real estate market.</p><p>If you have ever heard Zig Ziglar speak or read one of his books that was Dan. Positive, optimistic, backslapping, the kind of larger than life personality that makes some people run in a different direction to get away from him. He called everybody Buddy&#8230;..everybody. Even if he knew your name you were Sam Buddy or Sarah Buddy.</p><p>I was at a conference one year that Dan and his wife Kate were attending. It had been a long three days full of boring speakers and technical information. On the last night there was a cocktail party. I had a few drinks and talked to a few people, but I was ready to go home. I saw Kate sitting at a table by herself, so I went over to join her. In the background we could hear Dan working the room with his trademark, Buddy this and Buddy that. I had known Dan and Kate for twenty plus years and they were friends with my in-laws, so I was comfortable asking her this question, &#8220;Does Dan ever turn-off or is he like that all the time?&#8221; Kate, a charming Southern lady with a dry, wicked sense of humor, smiled at me and said, &#8220;He is like that all the time, even walking around the house in his underwear.&#8221; I didn&#8217;t need that visual but it certainly drove the point home.</p><p>Dan was a successful businessman for a number of reasons. First, despite his sunny disposition if he needed to be serious about addressing a problem or confronting an issue he did it in a steady, reassuring way. Over the course of 40+ years trust and dependability carried Dan, and his organization over several economic bumps in the road. Second, and probably most importantly, Dan surrounded himself with smart, and competent people many that went on, much to Dan&#8217;s pride, to become competitors. It was not in Dan&#8217;s nature to hold people back. His entire existence was built on lifting people up, helping them move ahead, and forward.</p><p>Despite a massive company bearing his name. Despite driving around town and seeing his name plastered on signs in front yards in every neighborhood you never got the feeling that his ego was more important than his family, his employees, or his community. He lived life as a humble man, albeit a very jolly and loud one, and when he died, he was mourned by thousands who knew him as a friend, a boss, a mentor and their Buddy.</p><p>I write all this so you understand what a real leader, a real human being looks like and I can promise you the &#8220;orange wonder&#8221; occupying 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. isn&#8217;t the kind of leader or man my friend Dan was.</p><p>This week has been another shit show for Trump. While he has assigned one superlative after another about the excellent, tremendous, incredible, great job HE is doing more Americans become infected and more Americans die from COVID-19. And while hospitals and health care providers continue to plead, and beg for more equipment, supplies and help Trump tells all that continue to listen to him that they have all that they need.</p><p>Think about it, it&#8217;s just Wednesday and already Trump has fired the person responsible for overseeing the $2 trillion relief package. Why? Because Trump realized that acting inspector general for the Defense Department, Glenn Fine was a &#8220;by the book&#8221; kind of guy, just the kind of &#8220;accountable&#8221; person Trump refuses to have in his administration. Trump is getting ready to treat that $2 trillion like it is his own personal piggy bank. He wants it, he needs it and Fine wouldn&#8217;t have let him have it so he got fired.</p><p>Then Trump attempted to shift the blame for his lack of response to the World Health Organization (WHO) even stating that the United States would put a &#8220;very powerful hold&#8221; on WHO funding. The truth is WHO did correctly identify the scale of the virus and attempted to warn Trump and his administration very early on. Instead of accepting, planning and communicating the gravity of what was headed our way we got &#8220;&#8230;&#8230; as the weather starts to warm &amp; the virus hopefully becomes weaker, and then gone.&#8221;</p><p>We also learned that Peter Navarro, who serves as Assistant to the President, Director of Trade and Manufacturing Policy, and the national Defense Production Act policy coordinator, a very smart guy, wrote two memos to Trump the first of the year. Navarro&#8217;s memos warned that the Coronavirus could become a &#8220;full blown pandemic&#8221; causing trillions of dollars in economic damage and risking the health of millions of Americans. Trump claims, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t see them. I didn&#8217;t look for them either&#8221;. Later Trump stated &#8220;I&#8217;m a cheerleader for this country. I don&#8217;t want to create havoc and shock.&#8221; Ask the families of the 12,905 people that have died to date from the Coronavirus how they feel about their &#8220;cheerleader&#8221;? Ask the millions of Americans that have lost their jobs if they are feeling &#8220;havoc and shock&#8221; yet? I bet they are.</p><p>I could add to the list, the resignation of Trump&#8217;s acting Navy secretary, everyone is acting, Thomas Modly and the very fucked-up things he said about the ousted commander of the USS Theodore Roosevelt, Capt. Brett Crozier who has been diagnosed with COVID-19. Or the removal of White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham, number four in three years but who&#8217;s counting. She has the distinction of never, ever giving a single press briefing but she certainly spent a lot of time on Fox News. But what&#8217;s the point of piling on?</p><p>For those of us that are fully awake. For those of us that are conscious. For those of us that see Trump for who he really is, a conman, a grifter, a delusional, and mentally ill narcissist just remember, &#8220;It&#8217;s going to disappear. One day, it&#8217;s like a miracle, it will disappear.&#8221; Take heart America, in time, like a miracle, Trump will disappear and fade from our sight as well and his &#8220;legacy&#8221; will be just a sad footnote in the history of this great country. What we will be left with is a sullen, lonely, bitter old man, living at Mar-a-Lago until it is repossessed, making a few guest appearances on the Sean Hannity Show until it is cancelled along with a few thousand old, fat white people still wearing tattered MAGA baseball caps made in China.</p><p class="entry-utility">

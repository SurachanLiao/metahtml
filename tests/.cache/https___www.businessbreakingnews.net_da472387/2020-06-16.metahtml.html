Mumbai&#8217;s 1441 Pizzeria&#8217;s gourmet DIY pizza kit helps people recreate the flavours of their famous wood-fired pizza.

In your DIY box, you will get a half-baked pizza base, which is made from Italian Flour, a portion of Italian tomato sauce, imported Mozzarella cheese and other fresh ingredients depending on your choice.&#8221; &#8230; <a href="https://www.businessbreakingnews.net/2020/05/riding-covid-19-storm-restaurants-rewrite-home-delivery-rules-with-special-menus-diy-kits/" class="more-link">[Read more...] <span class="screen-reader-text">about Riding COVID-19 storm: Restaurants rewrite home delivery rules with special menus, DIY kits</span></a></p></article><article class="post-74065551 post type-post status-publish format-standard entry"><p>Women were very much part of Akbar&#8217;s effervescent cultural experimentation. Akbar&#8217;s first major dispute with his milk brother Adham Koka occurred over Adham Khan&#8217;s appropriation of treasured dancing girls from Baz Bahadur&#8217;s court. These women were highly coveted by Padshah and courtiers alike because it was well known that Mandu was a great cultural centre and these dancing girls would add to the lustre of the Mughal court. There were women among the miniature artists and at least three women artists were listed among Abu&#8217;l Fazl&#8217;s list of Mughal maestros and that leads us to wonder how many more there may have been. &#8230; <a href="https://www.businessbreakingnews.net/2020/05/mythological-women-revered-stories-of-historical-women-censored-in-india-says-historian-ira-mukhoty/" class="more-link">[Read more...] <span class="screen-reader-text">about Mythological women revered, stories of historical women censored in India, says historian Ira Mukhoty</span></a></p></article><article class="post-74068467 post type-post status-publish format-standard entry"><p>In the Rs 20 lakh crore fiscal stimulus announced by the government, there is a credit line to MSMEs worth Rs 3 lakh crore which is going to be 100 percent backed by CG and covers both interest and principal. Additionally, the government plans to provide Rs 20,000 crore of subordinate debt to MSME promoters which could be used as equity. The government will provide Rs 4000 crore to CGTSME which in turn will provide partial credit guarantee to banks under this scheme. The other schemes provide full and partial guarantees to NBFCs, HFCs and MFIs to enable them to raise liquidity and capital. Thus, we are back to not just CGs but the possibility of multiple CGs being governed by multiple agencies. &#8230; <a href="https://www.businessbreakingnews.net/2020/05/credit-guarantees-of-1970s-make-a-comeback/" class="more-link">[Read more...] <span class="screen-reader-text">about Credit guarantees of 1970s make a comeback</span></a></p></article><article class="post-74068470 post type-post status-publish format-standard entry"><p>Now that payment deadlines have been relaxed due to COVID-19, the Moneycontrol Ready Reckoner will help keep your date with insurance premiums, tax-saving investments and EMIs, among others. &#8230; <a href="https://www.businessbreakingnews.net/2020/05/pseb-5th-8th-and-10th-result-2020-declared-here-s-how-to-check/" class="more-link">[Read more...] <span class="screen-reader-text">about PSEB 5th, 8th and 10th result 2020 declared: Here&#8217;s how to check</span></a></p></article></main>

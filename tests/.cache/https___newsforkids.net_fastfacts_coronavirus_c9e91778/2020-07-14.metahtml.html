<article><p>COVID-19 is the name given to a new coronavirus disease that began in Wuhan, China in December, 2019. Though the illness is similar to a cold for most people, in some cases it can cause death. The disease has had a terrible impact in China and has quickly spread to many other countries.</p><p>&#8220;COVI&#8221; stands for &#8220;coronavirus&#8221;, &#8220;D&#8221; is for &#8220;disease&#8221;, and the &#8220;19&#8221; represents the year the virus appeared. </p><p>Since COVID-19 first appeared, the disease has spread all through China and to many other countries around the world.</p><p>Coronaviruses Coronaviruses are <span class="nfkd" title="Viruses are tiny germs that can cause diseases." rel="tooltip">viruses</span> that have a spiky ring around them like a crown when viewed with a powerful microscope. Though there are many coronaviruses which affect animals, before COVID-19, only six coronaviruses were known to affect humans. Four of these cause common colds. The other two cause more serious lung illnesses, and can be deadly.</p><p>COVID-19 has surprised scientists in several ways. At first it was thought that the disease couldn&#8217;t spread easily between humans. That&#8217;s not true. But it seems that people can have the disease for a while without showing any signs that they have it.</p><p>Though many people have died from the disease, most people who get it recover. For about 80% of the people who get the disease, the effects are mild &#8211; like a common cold. The virus seems to be much more serious for patients who are older or already sick. Children seem to be less affected than others.</p><p>Governments around the world are working hard to limit the spread of the coronavirus.</p><p>So far there is no cure for COVID-19, but many of the treatments that are used for other illnesses like the flu are also helpful in dealing with the effects of the coronavirus <span class="nfkd" title="To infect is to pass a disease on to someone or something. Someone or something that is infected has a disease." rel="tooltip">infection</span>. Scientists are trying to find medicines which can treat the disease. </p><p>Scientists around the world are also working hard to develop a <span class="nfkd" title="A vaccine is a special medicine that trains the human body to fight a disease." rel="tooltip">vaccine</span>  which could prevent the disease. That process needs to be handled very carefully, so it could be some time before a vaccine is actually ready to use in humans.</p><p><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/02/28/809580453/just-for-kids-a-comic-exploring-the-new-coronavirus" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">This comic</a> does a nice job of discussing the coronavirus in a clear way.

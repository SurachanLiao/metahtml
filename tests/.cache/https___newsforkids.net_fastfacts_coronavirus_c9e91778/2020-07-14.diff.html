Though the illness is similar to a cold for most people, in some cases it can cause death. The disease has had a terrible impact in China and has quickly spread to many other countries.</p><p>“COVI” stands for “coronavirus”, “D” is for “disease”, and the “19” represents the year the virus appeared. </p><p>Since COVID-19 first appeared, the disease has spread all through China and to many other countries around the world.</p> <del><img src="https://newsforkids.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/1280px-sars-cov-with-corona-500x391.jpg" alt="Novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 This transmission electron microscope image shows SARS-CoV-2—also known as 2019-nCoV, the virus that causes COVID-19. isolated from a patient in the U.S., emerging from the surface of cells cultured in the lab.

Though there are many coronaviruses which affect animals, before COVID-19, only six coronaviruses were known to affect humans. Four of these cause common colds. The other two cause more serious lung illnesses, and can be deadly.</p><p>COVID-19 has surprised scientists in several ways. At first it was thought that the disease couldn’t spread easily between humans. That’s not true. But it seems that people can have the disease for a while without showing any signs that they have it.</p><p>Though many people have died from the disease, most people who get it recover. For about 80% of the people who get the disease, the effects are mild – like a common cold. The virus seems to be much more serious for patients who are older or already sick. Children seem to be less affected than others.</p> <del><img src="https://newsforkids.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/cdc-2019-ncov-laboratory-test-kit-500x408.jpg" alt="CDC 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR Diagnostic Panel" width="500" height="408" class="size-medium wp-image-11394"></del> <p>Governments around the world are working hard to limit the spread of the coronavirus.</p><p>So far there is no cure for COVID-19, but many of the treatments that are used for other illnesses like the flu are also helpful in dealing with the effects of the coronavirus <ins><span class="nfkd" title="To infect is to pass a disease on to someone or something.

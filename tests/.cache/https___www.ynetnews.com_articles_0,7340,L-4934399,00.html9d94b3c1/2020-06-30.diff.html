"All activity is coordinated with Russia, who has been providing the forces with aerial backup and assisting in transferring weapons of their production." </p> <p><del></del></p><del> </del><p><del></del></p><del> </del><p><del></del></p><a class="artImageLightbox" href="https://besttv232-ynet-images1-prod.cdn.it.best-tv.com//PicServer5/2017/03/12/7643672/764363801001691640360no.jpg" title=""><p class="magnifyPiccitvCompId-76436722 enlarge_button" title=""><del></del></p><del><img src="https://besttv232-ynet-images1-prod.cdn.it.best-tv.com/PicServer5/2017/03/12/7643672/764363801001691640360no.jpg" border="0" width="640" title="Shiite Golan liberation brigade (Photo: Ronon Solomon's log)" alt="Shiite Golan liberation brigade (Photo: Ronon Solomon's log)"> Link: https://besttv232-ynet-images1-prod.cdn.it.best-tv.com//PicServer5/2017/03/12/7643672/764363801001691640360no.jpg </del></a> <p class="citv_title_wrap "><span class="citv_title cp-h3">Shiite Golan liberation brigade (Photo: Ronon Solomon's log)</span></p> <p>Solomon claimed that the Iraqi militia has an elite unit trained by Iran, which operates in similar fashion to Hezbollah's elite Radwan Force. "Iran provided the militia with multi barrel rocket launchers… and even though the rockets are not precise, they hold deadly impact, which has proven itself in Iraq against American bases and now, in pounding rebel outposts in northern Syria."</p> In recent months, there have been records of the Syrian militia fighters equipped with Russian T-90 tanks, which they probably received indirectly from Russia through the Syrian army, according to Solomon's assessment. He noted that "the fighting in Iraq and Syria has made them proficient in guerrilla warfare and urban warfare."

Jordan arrested the citizen, who was captured with 45 kilograms of powerful explosives. </p> <p>Sheikh al-Kabi, who heads the militia, occasionally exchanges his traditional garb with a military uniform: "He wanders back and forth on the Iraq—Iran axis, Syria and Lebanon … and holds meetings with security officials working from the Iranian government, and even visits in Lebanon with Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah."</p> <p class="flpRndrooter flpRndr dflt">Iraqi Shiite militia </p> <p class="killFloaterPotential">X</p> <p id="art_video_credit_id" class="art_video_credits cp-h3 fp6"><ins>Iraqi Shiite militia </ins></p><p class="sf_send_container"><ins></ins></p><h4><ins><a class="sf_close_button" name="div#sf_send_159942">סגור</a></ins></h4><h3 class="sf_embed_title"><ins>שליחה לחבר</ins></h3><p class="sf_inputs_container"><ins><span>כתובת דוא''ל של החבר</span><span>שמך</span><span>כתובת הדוא''ל שלך</span><span>נושא</span></ins></p><p class="captchaLabelContainer"><ins>הקלידו את הקוד המוצג</ins></p><p class="sf_captcha_container"><ins><a href="">תמונה חדשה</a></ins></p><p class="sf_sent sf_hidden"><ins>הסרטון נשלח לחברך</ins></p><p class="sf_embed_container"><ins></ins></p><h4><ins><a class="sf_close_button" name="div#sf_embed_159942">סגור</a></ins></h4><h3 class="sf_embed_title"><ins>הטמעת הסרטון באתר שלך</ins></h3><h3 class="sf_embed_code_title"><ins>קוד להטמעה:</ins></h3> <p>In September 2015, Al-Kabi gave a speech to his fighters in Aleppo, going so far as to directly accuse Israel of attacking his organization, a claim which to this day remains unproven. Al-Kabi neglected to specify where and where Israel had allegedly attacked, but this accusation is a first of its kind. </p> <p>Usually, the attacks attributed to Israel in Syria are meant to prevent arms shipments from being transferred to Hezbollah in Lebanon. However, on the backdrop of the formation of this brigade along with Netanyahu's quicksilver visit to Russia, it is quite possible that one day, Israel will find itself in conflict with this Shiite militia.</p> <p><ins><span class="art_footer_date">פרסום ראשון: 03.12.17, 23:46 </span></ins></p> </article>

Of note:</p><blockquote><p>According to reports circulating widely in Israeli media today,&#160;<strong>the United States has quietly given Israel the green light to assassinate Iran&#8217;s top military officer, Iranian Revolutionary Guards al-Quds Force commander Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani</strong>. The leader of Iran&#8217;s most elite force also coordinates military activity between the Islamic Republic and Syria, Iraq, Hezbollah, and Hamas &#8211; a position he&#8217;s filled since 1998 &#8211; and as Quds Force commander reports directly to the Supreme Leader of Iran, Ali Khamenei, and oversees Iran&#8217;s covert operations in foreign countries.</p></blockquote><p>We also recommend Zerohedge&#8217;s piece of today on&#160; the story.

Of note:</del></p><blockquote><p><del>According to reports circulating widely in Israeli media today, <strong>the United States has quietly given Israel the green light to assassinate Iran’s top military officer, Iranian Revolutionary Guards al-Quds Force commander Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani</strong>. The leader of Iran’s most elite force also coordinates military activity between the Islamic Republic and Syria, Iraq, Hezbollah, and Hamas – a position he’s filled since 1998 – and as Quds Force commander reports directly to the Supreme Leader of Iran, Ali Khamenei, and oversees Iran’s covert operations in foreign countries.</del></p></blockquote><p><del>We also recommend Zerohedge’s piece of today on  the story.

An American air raid on an Iraqi Shia militia last weekend triggered a heated protest at the US embassy complex in Baghdad’s heavily fortified Green Zone on Tuesday, where demonstrators smashed windows, set fires and chanted “death to America.” Washington claimed the raid was in retaliation for a militia rocket attack on a US base in Kirkuk, and that Iran provided backing for the assault, though offered no evidence.</del></p><p><del>************</del></p><h4><del><a href="https://www.rt.com/news/477353-iran-quds-commander-killed-strike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Original article Link: https://www.rt.com/news/477353-iran-quds-commander-killed-strike/ </a></del></h4><h4><del>Published to The Liberty Beacon from <a href="http://www.europereloaded.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EuropeReloaded.com Link: http://www.europereloaded.com/ </a></del></h4><p><del><img class="aligncenter jetpack-lazy-image" src="https://www.thelibertybeacon.com/wp-content/themes/mh-magazine/images/TLB%20Radio%20Network%207.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://www.thelibertybeacon.com/wp-content/themes/mh-magazine/images/TLB%20Radio%20Network%207.jpg"></del></p><h3><del>••••</del></h3><blockquote id="this_is_auto_added_by_site_manager_xys_dd_fff"><p align="JUSTIFY"><del><strong>The Liberty Beacon Project</strong> is now expanding at a near exponential rate, and for this we are grateful and excited!

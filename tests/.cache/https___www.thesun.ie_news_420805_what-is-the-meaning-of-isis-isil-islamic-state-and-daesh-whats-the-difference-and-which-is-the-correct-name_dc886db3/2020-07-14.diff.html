used by the terror group, which started in 1999 when it was formed by Jordanian militant Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.</p> <p>As far as they are concerned, the correct term is the Islamic State - but the British and US Governments are among those preferring to use the name Isil.</p> <p>The term ISIS is more commonly used within international news publications, and has been used as a label in official United Nations reports.</p> <p>Counter-terrorism expert Dr Anne Aly, a research fellow at Curtin University, said it is neither "here or there" what you call the terror group.</p> <p>She said it is more important to note that they call themselves the Islamic State, as it shows they are trying to create a state does not respect the borders of Iraq and Syria.</p> <p>In 2015 the BBC's Director General refused to drop the term Islamic State from the corporation's coverage.</p> <p>All BBC broadcasts and reports refer to the group as the "so-called Islamic State".</p> <p>At the time a BBC spokesman said the corporation had no choice but to refer to the group by the name it uses itself.</p> <p id="bc-video-5645923852001" class="brightcove  "><span

<article class="article theme-news"><p class="article__content"><p class="article__content article__content--intro">THE terrorist group is widely referred to Islamic State has slaughtered thousands and has inflicted terror across the globe.</p>
<p>The group is fighting for survival after humiliating military defeats and the debate continues over the official name of ISIS, Isil or Islamic State.</p>
<h2>What does ISIS stand for?</h2>
<p>Many people have heard of the term ISIS, which is an acronym for the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.</p>
<p>It can also mean the Islamic State in al-Sham, the Arabic name for the region, and the group have said its goal is to create a caliphate in this region.</p>
<p>The name ISIS has proved an issue for many companies and brands, as it also belongs to an ancient Egyptian goddess.</p>
<p>The murderous network &#8211; known for its barbaric public executions &#8211; was originally part of al-Qaeda before splitting with the group over differences in ideology and methods.</p> 
<p>It believes all Muslims should unite into a worldwide caliphate.</p>
<h2>What is the meaning of Isil?</h2>
<p>Isil is an acronym standing for Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.</p>
<p>This name was given to the group as it was thought to be more accurate to their geographical location as the Levant includes Syria, Palestine, Lebanon, Israel and Jordan.</p>
<p>Many&#160;governments and leaders, including Barack Obama and David Cameron, have used the term Isil as it is thought to be a better translation for al-Sham, which is the Arabic name for the area.</p> 
<p>In a statement released following the brutal beheading of American photojournalist James Foley, Mr Cameron&#8217;s office said: &#8220;The Prime Minister has condemned the barbaric and brutal murder of James Foley by Isil (Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant) in Syria.</p>
<p>&#8220;This will not change our commitment to tackling this appalling organisation and doing everything we can to keep our country safe.&#8221;</p>
<h2>What is the meaning of Daesh?</h2>
<p>The word Daesh is an acronym for al-Dawla al-Islamiya fi al-Iraq wa al-Sham.</p>
<p>The term is derived from a rough translation of Arabic words, including Arabic verb &#1583;&#1593;&#1587;, which means to tread underfoot or crush.</p>
<p>It can also be spelt DAIISH, Da'esh or Daech, and is a name which members of the terror group despise.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://blog.ap.org/announcements/now-we-say-the-islamic-state-group-instead-of-isil" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Associated Press</a> in 2014, ISIS threatened "to cut the tongue of anyone who publicly used the acronym Daesh".</p>
<p>Following the attacks in France, the French government started adopting this term instead of ISIS or Isil.</p>
<p>Former French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said: &#8220;This is a terrorist group and not a state.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not recommend using the term Islamic State because it blurs the lines between Islam, Muslims and Islamists.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Which is the correct name?</h2>
<p>The four competing names are just a few of the those used by the terror group, which started in 1999 when it was formed by Jordanian militant&#160;Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.</p>
<p>As far as they are concerned, the correct term is the Islamic State - but the British and US Governments are among those preferring&#160;to use the name Isil.</p>
<p>The term ISIS is more commonly used within international news publications, and has been used as a label in official United Nations reports.</p>
<p>Counter-terrorism expert Dr Anne Aly, a research fellow at Curtin University, said it is neither "here or there" what you call the terror group.</p>
<p>She said&#160;it is more important to note that they call themselves the Islamic State, as it shows they are trying to create a state&#160;does not respect the borders of Iraq and Syria.</p>
<p>In 2015 the BBC's Director General refused to drop the term Islamic State from the corporation's coverage.</p>
<p>All BBC broadcasts and reports refer to the group as the "so-called Islamic State".</p>
<p>At the time a BBC spokesman said the corporation had no choice but to refer to the group by the name it uses itself.</p>

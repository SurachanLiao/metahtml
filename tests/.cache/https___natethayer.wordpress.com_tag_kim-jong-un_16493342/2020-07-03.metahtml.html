		<p>Oops&#8230;.Sorry About that Austin, Texas: An Otherwise Excellent Example of Great Journalism was Also a Tad Off</p>
<p>The Korean Central News Agency Friday sent out one of the thousands of meticulously staged propaganda photographs they do each year, this one with a caption which included the description of an &#8220;urgent operation meeting on the Korean People&#8217;s Army Strategic Rocket Force&#8217;s performance of duty for firepower strike at the Supreme Command in Pyongyang.&#8221;</p>
<p>The picture showed Kim Jong Un sitting at a table with military commanders standing behind him. In the upper left, on the wall, was world map obscured in the background with some barely visible Korean language characters and several arrows pointing to different parts of an unmarked global map.</p>
<p>NKNews reporter James Pearson, with the eagle-eyed attention for out of the box details and curiosity which makes for a great reporter, didn&#8217;t focus on the staged people in the photo but on the aspects not designed by the propagandists who produced it to draw attention. One was the map in the top left hand portion of the photo. He translated the writing on the map which turned out to read &#8220;U.S. Mainland Strike Plan&#8221;.</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-1056" class="wp-caption-text">NKNews.org annotated photo titled &#8220;U.S. Mainland Strike Plan.&#8221; Original photo by KCNA. Translations and analysis by James Pearson NKNews.org</p>
<p>While this photo was released on the English language service of KCNA, whose target audience is enemy foreigners, it originally had appeared in the main North Korean Worker&#8217;s party organ, Rodong Sinbun, which targets North Korean citizens, and which often includes entirely different messages that the ruling party wants to send to its own population. What propaganda that appears in the North Korean language domestic press is very different than the propaganda meant for foreign consumption. Niether the map nor caption was either translated or highlighted in the KCNA English language broadcast photo. 
Pearson said: &#8220;Shortly after breakfast, I called my NK NEWS colleague in D.C. to tell him I&#8217;d spotted a KCNA picture that showed Kim Jong Un and his generals studying a not-so-subtle map with the title &#8216;US MAINLAND ATTACK PLAN&#8217; crudely printed on it. It could&#8217;ve been satire but, knowing how most (if not all) NK propaganda is very much intended for an internal audience, it made sense given reports on the ground in North Korea that the state was trying to create a &#8216;war-like&#8217; atmosphere domestically.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pearson, who is in Seoul, also noted three blurry arrows pointing to spots on an unmarked outline of a world map. He, in coordination with NKNews journalists in Washington, superimposed a Google map of the U.S. on the KCNA unmarked map and located where exactly the arrows were pointing to. One pointed at Hawaii; one at San Diego, California; one at Washington, D.C.; and one at Austin, Texas.</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-1057" class="wp-caption-text">Original March 29 KCNA official photo where Kim Jong-un signed off on the order at a midnight meeting of top generals to put its rocket units on standby to attack U.S. military bases and &#8220;judged the time has come to settle accounts with the U.S. imperialists in view of the prevailing situation&#8221;, the official KCNA news agency said. Note map has no markings or translations</p>
<p>Austin Texas? The home of Willie Nelson, hipsters, the South by Southwest music and cultural festival, and great barbecue?</p>
<p>Yep, that Austin. <a href="https://natethayer.wordpress.com/2013/03/31/oops-sorry-about-that-austin-texas/#more-1054" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a></p>

		<p>25 Years of Slam Dunk Diplomacy: Rodman trip comes after decades of basketball diplomacy between U.S. and North Korea as a central tool in nuclear bomb negotiations</p>

<p id="caption-attachment-995" class="wp-caption-text">Dennis Rodman Tweeting From Pyongyang</p>

<p>&#160;NBA bad boy Dennis Rodman&#8217;s circus troupe delegation to North Korea was greeted by ridicule by most of the world. But does the Kim dynasty&#8217;s longtime basketball obsession hold the seed that will open North Korea to the world?</p>


<p>U.S. diplomatic insiders were dismissive of the Rodman meeting last week, describing it as &#8220;goofball diplomacy&#8221;. But basketball has played a very real role in the often bizarre, you-can&#8217;t-make-this-stuff-up backroom antics of U.S.-Pyongyang diplomatic negotiations for 25 years.</p>
<p>A love of the game shared by Kim Jong Il and his successor, current North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, has on occasion put basketball on the same bench as nuclear warfare in top level talks between the U.S. and the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea.</p>
<p>Rodman&#8217;s visit is just the latest wacky chapter in a diplomatic story that has seen the hoop dreams of Kim Jong Il become an unlikely pawn in nuclear negotiations with the U.S.</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-996" class="wp-caption-text">North Korean Top Nuclear Negotiator, Head of the North American Affairs for the Foreign Ministry, and Dennis Rodman, Michael Jordan, and Scotty Pippin Fanatic, Ri Gun, with U.S. North Korean Top Envoy Christopher Hill</p>
<h1>The Bulls fanatic from North Korea</h1>
<p>In 1991, at a low point of relations between North Korea and the United States, Washington invited three North Koreans to a conference at George Washington University about peace on the Korean peninsula. At the time, the U.S. had no diplomatic relations with the DPRK, so the delegation from Pyongyang was attending in an &#8220;unofficial&#8221; capacity.</p>
<p>According to Gene Schmiel, then in charge of the Korea desk at the U.S. State Department, the &#8220;unofficial&#8221; North Korean delegation was led by a man in the Pyongyang &#8220;America department who spoke good English, was said to have an intelligence background, and close ties to the Dear Leader.&#8221;</p>
<p>That man was Ri Gun, a senior Pyongyang figure known to be close to Kim Jong Il and a lead member involved in every diplomatic exchange and nuclear and ballistic missile negotiations for the previous 25 years. Schmiel&#8217;s most vivid memory about the conference came when Gun revealed his passion for a very American pastime:</p>
<p>&#8220;After dinner, we went to their hotel room in Washington and [Gun] said &#8216;Oh My God! It&#8217;s eight o&#8217;clock! The Chicago Bulls are on TNT! Be quiet, we can talk during the commercials. Stop. No more talking! Michael [Jordan] and the Bulls are on TNT, and I&#8217;ve got to see if Scotty [Pippen] has gotten over his latest injury!&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Ri Gun &#8220;then moved to the TV, turned it on and stared transfixed at the opening jump ball of the NBA basketball between the Chicago Bulls and the Cleveland Cavaliers,&#8221; Schmiel recalled in an interview this week. &#8220;Ri Gun headed the delegation and talked about an interest in basketball and Michael Jordan&#8230;Scotty Pippen this and Michael Jordan that, the triangle defense this, three points shots. They cared more about the NBA than I did&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;We spent the rest of our time together that evening debating not high policy, but high quality basketball shooting and such arcana as whether the NBA should permit use of the zone defense. It was clear from our discussions that he had watched the NBA for many years. They cared more about the NBA than I did&#8221;,&#160;Schmiel added.</p>
<p>Gun was a fanatic for American basketball, particularly for the Chicago Bulls and the Detroit Pistons, the latter known as the NBA&#8217;s bad boys for their dirty play and habitual disregard for the rules of the game (of which Dennis Rodman was the poster-boy). Gun knew the nicknames of players, NBA history, and statistics. And he knew it because, Gun told Schmiel, &#8220;he got to watch games with the boss&#8221;.&#160;That &#8216;boss&#8217; would have been the then North Korean dictator Kim Jong Il. <a href="https://natethayer.wordpress.com/2013/03/05/25-years-of-slam-dunk-diplomacy-rodman-trip-and-history-of-u-s-north-korean-basketball-diplomacy/#more-994" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a></p>

		<p>What do Dictators Have In Common with American Animal Pets? Kim Il Sung, Hun Sen, Other Third World Dictators Have Bogus College Degrees</p>
<p>&#160;By Nate Thayer</p>
<p>After handing over all cameras, passing through metal detectors and patted down by soldiers of the Korean People&#8217;s Army checking for explosives and weapons, passing through a purification chamber with powerful jets of air to remove any specks of dirt clinging to unwashed foreign visitors, boarding the world&#8217;s longest moving walkway normally reserved for international airports, pausing to admire a large white statue of Kim Il-Sung bathed in a pink and blue lighting while music plays in the background, visitors to the mausoleum are granted access to a dimly lit room with high ceilings in the center of which is a glass coffin containing the actual corpse of&#160; Kim Il Sung.</p>
<p>After paying homage to the Great Leader, visitors are escorted to yet another room and issued audio headsets with a British accented English voice weeping in dramatic tone on the demise of the man described as the greatest leader in the history of mankind while viewing a giant world map depicting every place Kim visited during his lifetime, and mementos of gifts bestowed, personal possessions, and awards granted.</p>
<p>Prominently displayed there is a PhD Doctor of Philosophy diploma from Kensington University of Glendale California.</p>
 
<p>But Kensington University is a fake degree program long shuttered as a fraud degree issuing mill where it was once located run out of an obscure lawyer&#8217;s office in Glendale, California.</p>
<p>Kensington University has since been closed by the government of California since 1996 for being a fraudulent diploma mill issuing anything from a bachelor&#8217;s degree to a doctorate in exchange for cash requiring no actual work, without ever attending a single class or meeting an instructor, no classrooms, laboratories or dormitories with the entire campus housed in a lawyer&#8217;s office in a non-descript building in California. In its decision to close Kensington University the state Council for Private Postsecondary and Vocational Education ruled Kensington awarded degrees lacking &#8216;credible academic standards&#8221; with &#8220;little or no rigor or credible academic standards are necessary in order to be awarded an advanced degree at Kensington University.&#8221; It relocated to Hawaii until that state government shut it down for good in 2003. The State of Texas passed a law making it illegal to use a degree from Kensington University on a job application, and other states which refused to recognize the university included Maine, Oregon and Michigan.</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-921" class="wp-caption-text">Fatwah.com Leader with Kensington University Degree</p>
<p>These revelations have not, however, sufficiently concerned the Pyongyang government enough to deter them displaying the Kensington University PhD diploma alongside his embalmed corpse at his mausoleum in Kumsusan Memorial Palace, in Pyongyang, along with a peace medal from Japan, which lies next to his &#8220;Medal &#8220;For the Victory over Japan&#8221;&#8221; awarded by the also now late Soviet Union in a room dominated by large paintings and photographs of Kim Il-sung meeting various world leaders, most of whom have since been violently overthrown by their own people during popular revolutions, including Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, Colonel Muammar Gaddafi of Libya, Nicolai Ceau&#351;escu of Romania, Erich Honecker of East Germany, Gust&#225;v Hus&#225;k of former Czechoslovakia, Wojciech Jaruzelski of Poland, Todor Zhivkov of Bulgaria, J&#225;nos K&#225;d&#225;r of Hungary, Houari Boumediene of Algeria, and Moktar Ould Daddah of Mauritania.</p>
<p>Kim Il Sung is not the only high profile dubious political leader to have obtained a degree from Kensington University. <a href="https://natethayer.wordpress.com/2013/02/24/what-do-kim-il-sung-hun-sen-have-in-common-with-animal-pets-they-all-obtained-bogus-college-degrees/#more-916" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a></p>

		<p>North Korean Tourism Dwarfed by Visitors Paying Homage to Elvis, Thai Sex Change Tourists, Those Seeking Nose Jobs in South Korea; And 1/15 of UK Citizens Traveling Abroad for Dental Treatment;&#160;</p>
<p>In 2012, North Korea welcomed nearly 30,000 visitors, including 4000 westerners, and official state media trumpeted this week that foreign tourism is &#8220;booming&#8221; days after they exploded a nuclear bomb drawing global condemnation. State news organ KCNA said the number of foreign visitors to the North has grown since 2000 and has surged after 2009, citing a spike in European visitors but offering no statistics. &#8220;The global popularity of tourism to (North Korea) is booming,&#8221; they said, citing socialist accomplishments by the Kim family hereditary dynastic regime.</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-903" class="wp-caption-text">Tourists Bow Paying Homage to Kim Il Sung</p>
<p>Independent industry analysts have put the number of western visitors to North Korea at about 2,000 per year, but KCNA said this week tourists rose &#8220;sharply&#8221; from 2009.&#160; The respected independent NK News quoted Simon Cockerell, General Manager at <a href="http://www.koryogroup.com/">Koryo Tours</a>, the preeminent group tour operator to Pyongyang based in Beijing, saying numbers have spiked, but visitor numbers are so small &#8220;an unexpected increase of a few dozen can look like a large percentage surge.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is estimated that in 2012 perhaps 4,000 Western visitors traveled to the world&#8217;s most isolated nation, and KCNA said that &#8220;eye-catching achievements made by the country in the effort for building a thriving socialist nation in recent years are one of the attractions.&#8221;</p>
<p>But a tourism boom in North Korea is quintessentially relative. A cursory comparative look breaks the annual visitor arrivals to North Korea down to the equivalent of the number of tourists who arrive from abroad every 34 minutes in the U.S., and every 27 minutes in France.</p>
<p>Less foreign visitors travel to North Korea annually than take in the British Lawnmower Museum in the U.K. Foreign visitors to North Korea per year amount to less than 5% of those who visit the birthplace of Elvis Presley&#8212;Graceland in Memphis Tennessee which attracts 600,000 people annually to pay homage to the &#8220;King&#8221;. Graceland opened for tours on June 7, 1982. &#8220;We had no idea whether 30 people were coming, or 300, or 3,000 that first day, Fortunately, it was the latter,&#8221; said Jack Sodden, CEO of Elvis Presley Enterprises. They sold out all 3,024 tickets on the first day and the flow of tourists has remained steady, with an average of 600,000 annual visitors to the mansion.</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-904" class="wp-caption-text">The Elvis Presley Shrine at Graceland Draws More than 20 Times the Visitors than Visit North Korea Every Year</p>
<p>The entire annual number of foreign visitors to the Hermit Kingdom is less than 3% of those who trek to visit the home of one of capitalism&#8217;s most storied robber barons, the Biltmore Estate of the Vanderbilt family in America&#8217;s deep rural South, which attracts 900,000 visitors per year.</p>
<p>Fetish Con, an annual sex conference celebrating all things kinky, attracts more than 10,000 people annually worldwide to a U.S. city by people interested in the whips, toys, videos, outrageously high high-heels and black leather stiletto knee-high boots, and features such offerings as Kinky Karaoke, with fetish enthusiasts dressed in outfits ranging from very little to full-body latex. That is more than twice the total annual western visitors to all of North Korea at the moment.</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-905" class="wp-caption-text">Annual Sex Fetish Conference Draws More Visitors Than North Korea Does in an Entire Year</p>
<p>Each year about a half million leather clad bikers and their half naked girlfriends converge on the small town of Sturgis, South Dakota for the world&#8217;s largest motorcycle rally&#8212;more than 15 times the entire yearly total of foreigners who visit North Korea.</p>
<p>A more nuanced comparison makes the entire cumulative arrival of visitors to North Korea less than those who travel to Thailand for sex change operations. It stands, for instance as 1/15 of UK citizens who traveled abroad in 2011 for dental treatment. In 2006, Israel welcomed 15,000 foreigners who traveled there for medical procedures, bringing in $40 million of revenue. 30,000 people came to Iran in 2012 to receive medical treatment. About 1 million Californians go to Mexico for healthcare procedures, mostly to Tijuana seeking weight loss, and plastic surgery, in addition to alternative cancer treatments. According to the Secretary of Tourism of Baja California, Mexico in 2009, close to 8 million people went to Tijuana for some type of healthcare.</p>
<p>The most obvious comparison is in South Korea where in 2009, a total number of 60,000 medical tourists arrived, rising in 2010 to 80,000. The South Korean Ministry of Health has set the target for 2015 to up to 300,000 medical tourists. Currently, the most popular treatments for medical tourists are cosmetic procedures such as eyelid surgery, nose jobs, facelifts, and skin lightening.</p>
<p>There are no reports of any visitors choosing Pyongyang as a preferred destination for medical care.</p>
<p>So a surge in foreigners visiting Pyongyang is all a matter of perspective.</p>
 
<p>Tourists to North Korea must go on guided tours and must have their tour guides with them at all times. Photography is strictly controlled, as is interaction with the local population.</p>
<p>In 2002, the scenic Mount Kumgang close to the South Korea border was designated a special tourist destination, and South Korean tourist companies brought thousands of South Koreans to Mount K&#365;mgang until that was suspended in late 2008 after an elderly South Korean woman was shot dead by North Korean soldiers for veering off the designated tourist paths. When tours had still not resumed by May 2010, North Korea unilaterally seized hundreds of millions of dollars of South Korean real estate assets developed to accommodate tourists in the region.</p>
<p>In July 2005, the South Korean Hyundai Group signed an agreement with the North Korean government to open up more areas to tourism, including Baekdu Mountain and Kaesong, which was opened to tours for South Korean and foreign tourists in December 2007, with North Korea charging US $180 for a one-day trip, receiving several hundred tourists each week.</p>
<p>The tours to Baekdu Mountain were suspended in December 2008 after Pyongyang objected to South Korea activists sending balloons filled with propaganda messages critical of Kim Jong Il which floated into the North. When South Korea did not respond to North Korean demands to stop the propaganda balloons, North Korea suspended the Kaesong tours. The tours to Kaesong resumed in April 2010, but were again suspended the next month in May 2010 after Pyongyang sent clandestine spies into South Korean territorial waters and torpedoed a South Korean ship, the ROKS Cheonan, which sunk, killing dozens of South Korean navy sailors.</p>
<p>Chinese tourists make up the lion&#8217;s share of the still miniscule tourist industry. In April 2010, tourist trains from Dandong, China began a highly controlled 4-day trip to North Korea. Prior to that, the international train from Beijing to Pyongyang was the only train allowed for tourists to the North. In June 2011, Chinese citizens were allowed on controlled bus tours to a strictly delineated zone near the Chinese border focused on shopping for the first time, and in January 2012, were able to bring their own mobile phones into the DPRK for the first time without being confiscated by border authorities to be returned upon departing the country, but without a North Korean sim card, strictly prohibited in North Korea, the phones are useless as they are unable to make or receive calls. The number of Chinese tourists visiting North Korea fell 70 percent from 2010 to 2011, with Chinese tour operators citing restrictions on where tourists can travel&#8212;only the capital Pyongyang and Mt. Kumgang&#8211;for the lack of interest.</p>
<p>The leading tour company for non Chinese citizens desiring to visit North Korea, is the quirky, but highly professional and knowledgeable British run, Beijing based Koryo tours, which have been running curious visitors to the hermit Kingdom for 20 years.</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-841" class="wp-caption-text">Arrival Customs Gate at Pyongyang Airport</p>
<p>When visitors arrive by plane in Pyongyang, they land on an empty runway, and walk into an empty terminal. One visitor wrote &#8220;On a visit to North Korea I had a surreal experience as my Air China plane touched down at Pyongyang airport the music which was played into the passenger cabin was Isaac Watts&#8217; Christmas carol &#8220;Joy To The World&#8221;:</p>
<p>Joy to the World, the Lord is come!</p>
<p>Let earth receive her King;</p>
<p>Let every heart prepare Him room;</p>
<p>And let Heaven and nature sing.&#8221;</p>
<p>The nonexistent lines at customs efficiently immediately confiscate all mobile phones and electronic devices. Shortwave radios are sometimes allowed into the country&#8212;after they are taken in a back room and radio frequency access is sauntered to the state propaganda channel. Listening to foreign broadcasts is punishable by jail. Each visitor is met at the security gate by two government minders who accompany all visitors during every waking hour while in country.</p>
<p>Visitors can go to a handful of approved sites, which include visiting the captured US spy ship Pueblo, the war museum where guides lecture on American atrocities committed against Koreans, pay homage to the Kim clan at&#160; statues, and visit the $900 million building where Kim father and son lay embalmed, and houses thousands of gifts from every corner of the world given to the Kim&#8217;s when they were alive. The Palace of the Sun serves doubly as a museum, and visitors are forbidden from speaking and must remove their shoes and put on disposable plastic sleeves over ones feet to make sure no germs infect the sacred site.</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-800" class="wp-caption-text">Some favored the portrait of Kim Il Sung behind a gynecologist&#8217;s chair (insert &#8220;on-site guidance&#8221; joke here). I preferred the one of him sitting behind a desk double-fisting ears of corn.</p>
<p>A comparable experience is offered at the &#8220;International Friendship Exhibition&#8221; in Mount Myohyang-san, which has on display over 200,000 gifts given to Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il, carefully separated by country leaving the impression that the Kim&#8217;s have a fervent and massive global following. The gifts range from whole train cars and handguns from world leaders, to knickknacks from obscure communist sympathizers in the U.S. and Europe who are portrayed as famous renowned vanguard of these countries oppressed proletariat. Many of the groups one suspects have memberships in the single digits and the uninitiated might be shocked to learn that virtually none of their countrymen have ever heard of them. Other gifts include a stuffed crocodile in bow tie and waistcoat standing on two legs holding a cocktail tray and serving drinks, courtesy of the Sandinista National Liberation Front of Nicaragua, and a Tolpuddle Martyrs plate from the British parliamentary Labour party.</p>
<p>Formal attire is required of all visitors to both the mausoleum and gift repository museum, and all are mandated to bow to a statue of Kim Il-sung, march down marble corridors, pass through a wind tunnel to shake the dust from ones clothes, and then into a darkened room holding the embalmed body of Kim Il-sung where visitors line up in rows and must step forward three steps at a time, and bow three times from three different directions.</p>
<p>Then one is taken to another marble chamber where an audio recording is played of the reaction of North Korean&#8217;s when the Great Leader died which includes this typical clip: &#8220;All people were rending their hearts! And weeping scalding tears that as they hit the ground fossilized and became glittering pieces of stone! It was as if the earth itself had died!&#8221;</p>
 
<p>&#8220;After depositing our cameras and bags in the coat check room, we were instructed to line up in rows of four and walk to the security checkpoint&#8230;we were quickly forced back into a single line in order to get through the metal detector and subsequent pat down by soldiers of the Korean People&#8217;s Army. But then again, this is North Korea, and if you&#8217;re told to get in a row of four, you get in a row of four.</p>
<p>Having been checked for explosives, weapons, and cameras, we then encounter an incredibly long moving walkway. I was a bit surprised to see a standard airport feature in a somber mausoleum. We began walking on the moving walkway, as most people, save the exceptionally lazy, usually do, until we were quickly instructed by our guide that we were supposed to stand still and let the walkway slowly take us to our destination. So we stood there, quietly, and patiently, as the walkway delivered us to&#8230;yet another walkway. It seemed like we had traveled for a mile on these things. In fact, I&#8217;m willing to bet that, as with everything in the DPRK, it&#8217;s the longest moving walkway in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>The tourist then continues describing &#8220;standing before the large white statue of Kim Il-Sung, which was bathed in a beautiful pink and blue lighting&#8230;while music plays in the background. God, this place is so weird. And we haven&#8217;t even gotten to the actual corpse yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then one is taken to another room with another statue of Kim and given audio headsets &#8220;which contains a track of an over dramatic man with a British accent telling us how the death of Kim Il-Sung was basically the worst thing to ever happen in the history of mankind.</p>
<p>Finally, it was time to see the Great Leader himself. First, however, we had to be purified, and were led through a chamber with powerful jets of air that blew any specks of dirt off of us American Imperialists. Thoroughly cleansed, we entered a dimly lit room with high ceilings. In the center of the room was a glass coffin containing the body of Kim Il-Sung, which was draped with a blanket so that only the head was visible. In front of us, rows of somber North Koreans bowed before the coffin, under the vigilant gaze of ramrod straight white gloved soldiers clutching their polished Kalashnikovs&#8230;.Lenin&#8217;s Mausoleum truly has nothing on this place.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then it is on to another room with a &#8220;giant map showing all the places Kim managed to visit during his tenure, as well as his personal rail car and official vehicle.&#8221;</p>
<p>And then to another room &#8220;filled with all of the &#8220;awards&#8221; bestowed upon Kim Il-Sung by foreign governments and political parties. Most of them aren&#8217;t real awards, but rather trinkets with little value that have been put on display to give North Koreans the impression that their Great Leader was highly respected all over the world&#8230;I was quite amused to come across an honorary degree from Kensington University of Glendale, California.&#8221;</p>
 
<p>A cursory research of Kensington University reveals it is a fake degree program since eliminated as a fraud degree issuing mill by both the states of California and Hawaii, where it was once located run out of an obscure lawyer&#8217;s office in Glendale, California.</p>
<p>Kim Il Sung is not the only high profile dubious dictator to have obtained a degree from Kensington University. Tunisian dictator Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, since overthrown in a popular revolution and fled the country in January 2011, had a diploma from Kensington University hanging on his wall in his palace&#8211;a doctorate in political science awarded in 1999. The university was shut down by the state of California for granting diplomas by mail and having &#8220;little or no rigor or credible academic standards.&#8221;</p>
<p>The North Korean dictator didn&#8217;t go quite as far as the Cambodian dictator Hun Sen, who left school to join Pol Pot&#8217;s Khmer Rouge in the jungle as a teenager. He was awarded an Honorary Ph.D. in Political Science by Hanoi in 1991 and another honorary Ph.D. in Politics from the Southern California University for Professional Studies in the USA in 1995. But his most treasured accolade was when, in 1996, he was presented with an Honorary Ph.D. of Law by Iowa Wesleyan College, USA. He publicly declared that he was now an accredited lawyer and on September 15, 2004, Hun Sen was accepted and sworn in as a member of the Bar Association of Cambodia.</p>
<p>Dong Zong Chairman, Dr. Yap Sin Tian &#8211; a controversial Malaysian leader pushing for Chinese education bought his doctorates from the Internet, including a PhD from the Kensington University in 1993 and another doctorate in Business Administration from Kensington University in 1991.</p>
<p>Dr Yap is the chairman of the board of the New Era College. Kensington University has no classrooms, no laboratories, no dormitories, and its so-called campus is housed in a small Glendale office building in California. Students could earn anything from a bachelor&#8217;s degree to a doctorate &#8211; all without ever attending a single class or meeting an instructor, awarding inflated credits for &#8220;life experience&#8221;.</p>
 
<p>The California investigation revealed that students were awarded doctorates for four-months of &#8220;work&#8221;, by reading magazines and writing short reaction papers, according to the California report that resulted in closure of the diploma mill school by Californian authorities in 1996, whereupon it shifted its operations to Hawaii only to be shut down by the authorities there in 2003. It is also illegal in the State of Texas to use a degree from Kensington University.</p>
<p>Other graduates included Florida State Representative Jennifer Caroll, who was forced to resign from the National Commission on Presidential Scholars after being exposed for having a degree from Kensington University.</p>
<p>These revelations have not sufficiently concerned the Pyongyang government from displaying the degree&#160; awarded to Kim Il-sung, which is displayed alongside his embalmed corpse at his mausoleum in Kumsusan Memorial Palace, in Pyongyang.</p>
<p>Along with the fake Kensington University Doctorate degree, displayed also is a peace medal from Japan, which lies next to his &#8220;Medal &#8220;For the Victory over Japan&#8221;&#8221; awarded to him by the USSR. The room is dominated by large paintings and photographs of Kim Il-sung meeting various world leaders during their visits to North Korea and during Kim&#8217;s trips abroad, most of which have since been violently overthrown and executed by their own people during popular revolutions, including Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, Colonel Muammar Gaddafi of Libya, , Nicolai Ceau&#351;escu of Romania, Erich Honecker of East Germany, Gust&#225;v Hus&#225;k of former Czechoslovakia, Wojciech Jaruzelski of Poland, Todor Zhivkov of Bulgaria, J&#225;nos K&#225;d&#225;r of Hungary, Houari Boumediene of Algeria, and Moktar Ould Daddah of Mauritania.</p>
<p>Other leaders featured prominently at his tomb include Yasser Arafat of Palestine, former Soviet leaders Joseph Stalin, Nikita Khrushchev, Leonid Brezhnev, Konstantin Chernenko, and Mikhail Gorbachev, and other well-known people including Che Guevara, and former U.S. president Jimmy Carter, Chairman Mao Zedong of China, Fidel Castro of Cuba, and Josip Broz Tito of former Yugoslavia</p>
 
<p>Also on the tourist itinerary is a visit to the Demilitarized Zone, the most heavily mined piece of real estate on earth. The four lane highway typically has virtually no other vehicles. It is in fact a hundred kilometer long military air landing strip.</p>
<p>The leading European tour group is the British, excellently run Koryo Tours (koryogroup.com). Koryo Tours makes very clear what the prerequisites and terms of visiting are. Under a section titled &#8220;RULES&#8221;, the tour group says: &#8220;Please be aware that whilst we do the utmost for our tourists you are under very strict regulations as to what you can and cannot do and this is not negotiable. For example; you are not free to wander around on your own, there are photographic restrictions and video cameras are generally prohibited&#8230;.WE CANNOT TAKE JOURNALISTS INTO THE DPRK. We therefore ask all journalists to notify us of their position so we can suggest other alternatives.&#8221;</p>
<p>They continue: &#8220;It is therefore only advisable visiting the DPRK if you can tolerate the following points:</p>
<p>1) In the DPRK you will be under close scrutiny from the guides and security. Use of cameras causes the majority of problems. You can only take a photograph of what the guides allow. The public are obliged to report all photography. Taking photos of soldiers, at check points, poverty, sneaked photos and close ups of people without their express permission will cause serious problems. Photography when being driven around is also restricted&#8230;.DPRK regulations state that you cannot take a lens over 150 mm into the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>2) Leaving the hotel without the guides or the guides&#8217; express permission is not possible. If you are feelng the need for &#8216;a breath of air&#8217; then a casual stroll along the river is possible but only if accompanied with a guide. It is possible to stroll in the grounds of the hotel but please ask the guide and do not take your camera.</p>
<p>3) We are &#8216;invited&#8217; to the DPRK and therefore we ask our tourists to respect the Koreans and their vision of the Great Leader &#8211; this involves bowing at the 20 meter statue on Mansudae and on various other occasions. Chewing gum, eating sweets and wearing scruffy clothing in places of Korean national importance (such as Mansudae statue to Kim Il Sung, the Friendship Exhibition and Manyongdae birthplace of Kim Il Sung) will offend guides.</p>
<p>The tour company reemphasizes the point again and again: &#8220;If any of the above poses a problem it is advisable not to visit the DPRK&#8230;.&#8221;</p>
<p>The number of foreign visitors to the North has grown in the last decade and in 2009, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said &#8220;The global popularity of tourism to (North Korea) is booming,&#8221; without providing any details or numbers of visitors, citing the reason for the increase as Pyongyang&#8217;s &#8220;shining, socialist accomplishments&#8221; adding &#8220;Most tourists gave positive reviews about their experiences in (North Korea) on the internet and other media.&#8221;</p>

		<p>For Pyongyang, Global Digital Revolution for Foreign Eyes Only: You Tube Bans North Korean Video for Stealing Copyrighted U.S. Video Game Soundtrack: Pyongyang Dips its Toes Awkwardly Into the Global Information Age by Sending Propaganda Out and Forbidding Information In.</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-890" class="wp-caption-text">The North Korean Video Removed by You Tube for Copyright Violations</p>
<p>YouTube has removed another North Korean government video from the state run Uriminzokkiri You Tube site for copyright infringement, according to the excellent North Korean Tech website run by Martyn Williams. This propaganda video used the soundtrack from the video game &#8220;The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion&#8221; after a copyright complaint from ZeniMax Media, a Maryland-based computer game publisher.</p>
<p>North Korea, which maintains a remarkably large international patenting program having registered worldwide claims to tens of thousands of alleged inventions from machine tools to science research, regularly rips off music, movie clips, foreign news footage, cartoon characters, and protected technology from Androids to counterfeit brand name cigarettes.</p>
<p>The You Tube removal of the video game soundtrack comes on the heels earlier this month of another You Tube removal of another North Korean propaganda video using a computer-generated animation clip from Activision&#8217;s &#8220;Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3&#8221; following a complaint by Activision. North Korea released that video also on its official YouTube page showing New York being destroyed by a military attack after a cartoon space ship circles earth and zooms in on New York City being attacked. The caption in Korean read: &#8220;Somewhere in the United States, black clouds of smoke are billowing. It seems that the nest of wickedness is ablaze.&#8221;</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-891" class="wp-caption-text">Animation Clip from Activision&#8217;s &#8220;Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3&#8221; Illegally Used by Pyongyang on a Video Depicting a North Korean Spaceship Blowing Up New York Shortly Before They Detonated a Nuclear Bomb</p>
<p>The Uriminzokkiri social media site is based in China and designed for foreign consumption, and no North Koreans are allowed possession of technology to access even its governments own social media propaganda under penalty of being sent to harsh prison camps.</p>
<p>Increased publicity about Pyongyang&#8217;s increasing use of social media, including Twitter, Face Book, and You Tube has brought greater scrutiny and an increase of complaints of unauthorized use of copyrighted material could result in YouTube cancelling Pyongyang&#8217;s &#160;Uriminzokkiri &#160;account for repeatedly violating You Tube&#8217;s copyright policy agreement which all subscribers must agree to adhere to when opening an account.</p>
<p>North Korea announced they had opened a Gmail account last month on the eve of the visit of Google chairman Eric Schmidt, but the account was never activated as the <a href="mailto:DPRK@gmail.com">DPRK@gmail.com</a> name failed to meet Google&#8217;s requirement of a 7 character minimum for email addresses. As no North Korean&#8217;s are allowed access to email it is unlikely that Pyongyang seriously considered the aborted venture into the digital age a major setback.</p>
<p>In December, 2012, the same week Google Chairman Eric Schmidt announces he would visit North Korea is the state news agency KCNA revamped its website to include greater use of video, and photographs and a flashier less utilitarian style, but the update remains far from cutting edge.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kcna.kp/">kcna.kp</a>&#160;was created in October 2010 as Pyongyang first dipped its toes in the waters of the digital age and updated in April 2011. Before that, the official North Korean government website was registered in an obscure one room apartment in a building in Tokyo, the daily news made available days later arriving clumsily by obscured delivery to a website hosted by sympathetic ethnic Koreans in Japan who followed strict instructions from Pyongyang. &#160;That website, <a href="http://www.kcna.co.jp/">kcna.co.jp,</a> still delivers Pyongyang produced propaganda in a carefully edited, less comprehensive version of the .kp domain, according to the excellent website NK News operated by European Korea watchers.</p>
<p>The newly revamped KCNA website focuses on the big stories according to the worldview of Pyongyang, and is broken down into categories which include world news, mostly dedicated to obscure people, publications, and rarely heard of organizations paying homage to the Kim family, studying Juche ideology, detailing the activities breathlessly of the current Kim, or republishing the works of the Kim Grandfather, son, and current leader, his grandson. A prominent feature id dedicated to the indefatigable, brilliant, and universally revered Kim Jong-un, which replaced a similar category that highlighted his father until his death in December 2011.</p>
<p>Stories from African, South American, South Asian, Russian and Chinese alleged Juche devotees are ubiquitous, leaving a reader with the impression that there is a mass global following that views the Kim dynasty as the most advanced nation on earth. The most common theme is worldwide praises and gifts sent to Pyongyang supporting missile and nuclear advances.</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-896" class="wp-caption-text">KCNA has a newly revamped website which has a visitor registration that asks for numerous personal details but offers no additional access(Photo via NK NEWS)</p>
<p>A new section visitors to the revamped KCNA website encounter encourages user registration, asking for those who visit the site to give their name, birthday, sex, telephone, email, address, and nationality as requirements of registration process, but registering offers no additional to other content of the website, but would allow Pyongyang to determine the IP address of visitors.</p>
<p>Prior to 2010, the KCNA Japan based site was purely text, as it remains today, but the addition of the KCNA.kp domain included pictures and video for the first time, but is carefully created to prohibit linking to news articles, photos or videos on the site, as remains true with the newly unveiled revamping in December 2012, making it impossible for readers to share articles.</p>
<p>NK NEWS asked its own website to analyze the new KCNA website and quoted them as saying &#8220;the site still loads content in the top middle container upon clicking side news links. However, these clicks call an Ajax script with parameters to load the appropriate content, and then it seems they set JavaScript variables and utilize cookies to validate the request.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prior to 2010, Pyongyang had virtually no online footprint. Indeed, even cell phones were banned until 2008 in the country after a brief nascent program that peaked at about 20,000 mobile phones was abruptly extinguished in May 2004 after an explosion on a train was determined to have been triggered by a cell phone used as a detonator by still unidentified perpetrators hours after then leader Kim Jong Il passed through the area on his return from China in his private train.</p>
<p>Despite North Korea&#8217;s increased web presence, there remains virtually no access to North Koreans themselves, the target audience being foreigners who are deemed useful for state propaganda.</p>

		<p>Frequent Flyer&#8217;s Guide to North Korean Air: a Review of World&#8217;s Only One Star Airline</p>
<p>By Nate Thayer </p>
<p>Air Koryo, North Korea&#8217;s official airline, is rated the world&#8217;s only one star air carrier. But it is improving. In August, Pyongyang&#8217;s promise of being global technological leaders achieved a key milestone, when the national airline announced it would offer online reservations with &#8220;convenient reservations day and night&#8221;.</p>
<p>The official airline of North Korea now allows international travelers to book one of their eight weekly international flights, which accommodate the global hubs between Pyongyang and Beijing, Pyongyang and Shenyang, China, or Pyongyang and Vladivostok.</p>
<p>Air Koryo says customers can purchase additional room for their &#8220;black box&#8221; or for their &#8220;fat&#8221;, according to the Air Koryo website, which is inexplicably down at the moment</p>
<p>There is a hitch though; the airline doesn&#8217;t accept credit cards, so one has to use PayPal.</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-824" class="wp-caption-text">Air Koryo website for revolutionary new online bookings for reservations. Unfortunately they don&#8217;t accept credit cards</p>
<p>Air Koryo offers scheduled flights from Pyongyang to Beijing and Shenyang in China and Vladivostok in Russia.</p>
<p>There are a number of independent air travel rating services that rate the service. Skytrax, a company that ranks global air transport gives Air Koryo the only airline on earth a one-star rating that represents &#8220;very poor quality performance&#8221;.</p>
 
<p>Air Koryo&#8217;s website offers a one way business class fare from Pyongyang to Beijing, if you book online, of $374, which would seem prohibitive to most citizens of the isolated nation where per capita income is estimated at $1,800.</p>
<p>The website Terminal U, which offers &#8220;Air travel news &amp; views&#8221; recently wrote a detailed pictorial story titled &#8220;Flying on North Korea&#8217;s national airline, Air Koryo: &#8220;The zero star airline&#8221; by &#8220;Our writer, Gunnar Garfors&#8221; who &#8220; shares his experiences on board North Korea&#8217;s Air Koryo, where he inadvertently discovers the world&#8217;s smallest beef burger patty.&#8221;</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-858" class="wp-caption-text">The World&#8217;s Smallest Hamburger</p>
<p>Their crack correspondent Gunner writes: &#8220;My favorite airlines are all based in Asia. It just so happens that my least favorite airline is also Asian. North Korea&#8217;s national airline, Air Koryo offers you nothing that resembles quality on its flights to or from its hub in Pyongyang &#8211; but the experience is certainly worth writing home about.&#8221;</p>
<p>He continues that &#8220;Strange sounds and seat configurations are all part of the experience, as well as the revolutionary-like propaganda music played before and during take-off&#8221; and offers a colorful portrait where the stewardesses &#8220;wear white gloves and uniforms that must have won fashion awards in the 60s make on board announcements in a&#160;formal manner along the lines of: &#8216;The beverage service is about to commence, thanks to our Dear Leader Kim Jong-il.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
 
<p>Gunner then offers his assessment of in flight service, saying he &#8220;was given a complimentary copy of &#8220;The Pyongyang Times,&#8221; North Korea&#8217;s only English speaking newspaper. I should point out that in no other country would it be called a &#8220;newspaper.&#8221;</p>
 
<p>He then quoted from a story on the World Cup qualifying match between North Korea and South Korea in Seoul. &#8220;The match turned into a mess of tricks and swindles. It is as clear as day that this was the product of the Lee Myung Bak [the President of South Korea] clan&#8217;s moves of confrontation with the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea (DPRK) and the deliberate behavior of the dishonest forces instigated by the clan. We sternly condemn the behavior of the Lee clan, which misbehaves itself in every way in disregard of the nation and the idea of sport, as the anti-reunification and anti-national moves of confrontation with the DPRK and strongly urge the South Korean authorities to bear full responsibility and immediately apologies for the serious incident.&#8221;</p>
 
<p>Regarding the meal service, Gunner writes &#8220;You will get a tray with calories on it, but whether what&#8217;s on the tray can be called &#8216;food&#8217; is debatable.&#8221;</p>
 
<p>Gunner notes correctly that Air Koryo is largely banned from flying to Europe because it doesn&#8217;t meet international safety standards, but the Norwegian, whose bio says he &#8220;visits over 50 countries a year and is on a mission to visit all 198 countries in the world&#8221; and &#8220;his wildest journey so far was a trip to five countries on five continents in a single day &#8211; a world record&#8221; ends on a high note concluding &#8220;you won&#8217;t find a more unique in-flight experience anywhere else in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-854" class="wp-caption-text">Flipdown TV screens with homages to Kim (Sr) (Jr) )3rd) for passenger entertainment</p>
<p>In August, 2011, the official state Korean Central News Agency announced that there would be a scheduled Shanghai-Pyongyang air service available on Tuesday and Friday every week, but it turned out the scheduled route was limited to &#8220;Chinese volunteers&#8221; who wanted to visit North Korea for the 60th anniversary of the Korean War.</p>
<p>Air Koryo operates round trip flights between Pyongyang and Beijing on Tuesday, Thursdays, and Saturdays.&#160; It operates round trip flights between Pyongyang and Shenyang on Wednesdays and Saturdays.&#160; The flights always originate in Pyongyang and return the same day.</p>
 
<p>Business Insider magazine reported last year in a story headlined &#8220;On North Korea&#8217;s 1-Star Airline, You&#8217;ll Be Served One Sad-Looking Hamburger&#8221; that Japanese news website RocketNews24 offered a pictorial food review of Air Koryo&#8217;s service on Japanese news website and its correspondent, who was travelling economy, was served a hamburger and a cup of juice which &#8220;looks totally gross. The worst part? The burger was served cold. RocketNews24 surmises that the microwave is reserved for first-class customers only.&#8221;</p>
 
<p>RocketNews24 wrote &#8220;On our Japanese site, we run a regular column where we review the in-flight meals of airlines around the world. While we&#8217;ve yet to bring any of these to our English site, our latest review was just too good to keep to our Japanese readers. Ladies and gentlemen, we bring you the in-flight meal of North Korea&#8217;s state-owned carrier, Air Koryo. The meal under review was served to our correspondent during an economy class flight from North Korea&#8217;s Sunan International Airport to Beijing Capital International Airport. The contents of the meal included a hamburger and a cup of juice &#8211; nothing more, nothing less. The hamburger was topped with 2 thin onion slices and mayonnaise and came in wrapping with Chinese writing on it, suggesting it was made in China. The juice was available in either apple or orange. Regarding the taste of the hamburger, our correspondent tells us that both the buns and hamburger patty were incredibly dry, though this may partly be due to the fact that the hamburger was served to him cold. Our guess is that the microwave is reserved for first-class passengers only.&#8221;</p>
 
<p>Business Insider Magazine wrote in 2011 in a story titled&#8221; &#8220;North Korea&#8217;s Air Koryo Is The Worst Airline In The World&#8221; that &#8220;there&#8217;s only one airline in the world that has been deemed horrible enough to earn a dismal 1-star rating from leading airline reviewer SkyTrax. It&#8217;s North Korea&#8217;s state-owned airline: Air Koryo.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the business magazines airline review it asked: &#8220;In an industry already suffering from widespread negative perception, what makes Air Koryo stand out as the very worst? Customer service, food, safety or a little bit of everything?&#8221;</p>
<p>They then posted photographs from recent passenger Australian biomedical engineer Mark Fahey on his flight from Beijing to Pyongyang.</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-848" class="wp-caption-text">It gets so bad that they have to wipe the cabin down so that droplets dont bother the passengers a process that Joseph Ferris caught on camera on his flight.</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-833" class="wp-caption-text">For your refuses vomit bag</p>
<p>The website airlinemeals.com, a service devoted to rating in flight food quality on every commercial air carrier on earth, devotes a whole section to passenger reviews of Air Koryo&#8217;s cuisine.</p>

<p>In another review the meals slightly improved it seems.</p>

<p>Comments: &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Doesn&#8217;t fill you up much. Still better than what you would get on any US airline, though.</p>
<p>Rating (1-10): 5 stars</p>
<p>Although a review the next year fared decidedly worse:</p>

<p>Meal: &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Hot lunch &#8211; mystery chicken, canned fruit, nothing special.</p>
<p>Drink: &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; I had decent bottled water</p>
<p>Comments: &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Since this flight originated in Beijing, the food was at least identifiable. On the return flight which originated in Pyongyang, it was quite different and even more of a mystery&#8230; it was a roll with some kind of mystery pate on it</p>

<p>B y 2010, it appeared airline frequent flyers were getting used to bland fare:</p>

<p>Drink: &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Orange Drink with Pulp&#8221; (their words)</p>
<p>Comments: &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Airkoryo3.jpg &#8211; Blanched peanuts and &#8220;Orange Drink with Pulp&#8221;</p>
<p>On the aviation forum airliners.net, which bills itself as the wings of the web&#8221;, Gialloboy from Ireland posted on September 3, 2012 on his trip from Beijing to Pyongyang. &#8220;Woke up Tuesday morning with a rather bad hangover but managed to drag myself in the shower and ultimately into a cab to Beijing airport. Traffic was not too bad for a change and I arrived in Terminal 2 within 30 minutes. Did some last minute email (no Internet in the DPRK!) and drank some Isotonic drinks which made me feel a lot better.&#8221; The Irish lad offered copious detail for the frequent Pyongyang flyers that were to follow him. &#8220;Terminal 2 is nothing special and get&#8217;s a lot of flights to obscure places, including 2 Air Koryo flights to FNJ (Air China flies to FNJ from Terminal 2 by the way)&#8221;</p>
 
<p>&#8220;At 11 am I made my way past security and on towards Air Koryo&#8217;s check in. They actually have a separate J checkin and I had my boarding card and lounge pass within 60 seconds. Funny thing is that Korean Air operates check in desks for their flight to Seoul in the very next row of desks! Check in desk (used for J PAX). Went past immigration and visited the lounge. Air Koryo uses the Air China lounge which is again used by Korean Air! &#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Boarded quickly and settled into my comfy J seat. There are three rows in a 2-2 configuration; I was in row 2 and next to a quite friendly Danish businessman. We had some good conversation about his frequent trips to Pyongyang.</p>
 
<p>Unfortunately photos are not allowed inside Air Koryo planes so all shots are &#8220;sneaked&#8221;, the Danish businessman acted as my &#8220;wingman&#8221; and kept an eye on the FAs. There had been cases of travelers made to delete all of their pictures so I was extra careful. Air Koryo J class snaps, rather stylish and nice. I have no idea why they score only 1 star on Skytrax, I thought they were rather adequate for a 2 hour flight and probably offered more comfort than some US airlines.&#8221;</p>
 
<p>&#8220;Despite the flight being only 120 minutes we got a full meal, consisting of cold cuts and curry. Not bad at all! drinks were served also with a choice of water, soft drink and beer. Meal was followed by coffee. Note there was no milk, as everywhere in North Korea. Only powdered cream. FA consisted of a patriotic North Korean film: Thanks were paid to the Great Leader when we entered DPRK airspace and shortly after we touched down in FNJ. Surely this airport has one of the longest taxies anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>The TU204 at home base in FNJ&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the Irishman landed in Pyongyang.</p>
 
<p>&#8220;Arrivals is pretty new, the old Soviet style terminal has been bulldozed to the ground. We were in within 30 minutes and they had our mobile phonesJ.&#8221;</p>
 
<p>Busy day in FNJ!</p>
<p>Into town and first stop Arch of Triumph: People were training for the upcoming torch parade on Kim Il Sung square</p>
 
<p>The Irishman had a few comments on the discussion board: &#8220;Quoting theobcman (Reply 5):</p>
<p>&#8220;Also when you say they took your mobile phones at the airport, then what happens? Do they keep them until your return flight?&#8221;</p>
<p>He replied &#8220;You get the phone back when you are about to leave the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another intrepid traveler inquired &#8220;Is milk is not available in DPRK at all?&#8221;</p>
 
<p>Our Celtic correspondent helpfully explained &#8220;Not really, if anything else most Asians are lactose intolerant so there is not much of a demand for milk to begin with. Second dairy is very resource intensive to make, something the DPRK does not have a lot of.&#8221;</p>

<span><span><span><span><span>They're going to run out of money soon. E</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>v</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>er
since the Congess STOLE the money in </span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>t</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>he
"Social Security Fund," as soon as it was identified,
they've been paying Social Security out of the General Fund. And the
General Fund is running short. Now they're talking about added taxes,
cutting benefits, or finding other sources for the money to pay the
ever-rising number of people on Social Security. all this to "make
up for" the THEFT of the Social Security money by the
government. It must be nice to be able to steal from people and then
make them </span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>cough</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>
up the difference later when the bill comes due. That's exactly what
they're doing when they raise taxes to pay for their THEFT. And again
when they cut benefits.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
 
<p class="western">
<span><span><span><span><span>Those benefits were part of the agreement
with America made when Social Security was created. To reduce them
now is to abrogate that contract. Then consider how much more money
Social Security recipients could have made on the money they were
FORCED, at the point of a gun, to pay into the program if they had
invested the money elsewhere. The money </span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span>I</span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>
paid into the program alone would have made me a millionaire by now,
had I been able to invest it into the lowest-paying, but reliable
investments. But NO! They forced me to give it to them, and kept it
without paying me ANY interest, until they were good and ready to
give me back some of it. Now they want to ren</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>e</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>g
on the agreement!</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>
By the way: if you don't believe that "point of a gun"
statement, just try and NOT pay into Social Security while you're
working. (<a href="http://www.glennbeck.com/2017/12/29/the-number-of-people-on-social-security-isnt-sustainable-heres-the-problem/?utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=20171229GBDAILY&amp;utm_term=Glenn%20Beck">Glenn Beck</a>)</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="western">
<span><span><span><span><span><span>No, I'm not talking about </span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>Fox</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>
being in a conspiracy against anybody. I'm talking about the obvious
conspiracy to destroy </span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>Fox</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>
at any cost. It began, for most folks, when they got the scalp of
Roger Ailes with a phony sexual predator accusation, sans any kind of
proof. They "lucked out" when he fell shortly after and
died from his injuries. It gave him no time to fight. Then they went
after their biggest ratings-getter, Bill O'Reilly, and Ailes'
co-worker, Bill Shine. They went after O'Reilly, using a woman he</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>had
never met, quoting him saying things he never said. again, without a
scintilla of proof--only the unsupported word of one woman who had a
RECORD of such</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>
false</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>
accusations against various conservatives.</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span> Then a bunch of greedy women who wanted a payday jumped on the bandwagon.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
 
<p class="western">
<span><span><span><span><span><span>Then they went after Sean Hannity, but he fought back, and stopped
them in their tracks. Last year (before all this) </span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>Fox</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>
was atop the ratings, in an "unassailable position." </span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>They
appeared invincible after 15 years of ratings dominance, while </span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>CNN,</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>
their closest rival, languished with fast-dropping ratings. Then came
this series of false charges, which </span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>Fox's</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>
new bosses quickly "bought," and their ratings dropped so
fast they were THIRD fo</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>r</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>
the first time in many years. During this time, NOBODY claimed sexual
misconduct on the part of </span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>CNN</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>
employees. Isn't that strange that only conservatives were so
accused? With Media Matters being behind it all. If you can't see the
conspiracy, I feel sorry for you. But if you're reading this, you're
"smarter than the average bear," and CAN see it. (<a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/sean-hannity-sees-liberal-attempt-213119589.html">Yahoo News</a>)</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="western">
<span><span><span><span><span>I don't know how many were shot this most recent weekend, but over
the Fourth </span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>of July weekend, 84 people were shot, and 11 died. Rahm Emanuel, the</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>
liberal Dumocrat</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>
mayor, has asked for the assistance of the National Guard, to help
keep the peace. That's just one step below declaring full martial law
in Chicago.</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>
Now he's asking the UN to "occupy" his city.</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>
I've been in Chicago on business, and at the time had no idea how
dangerous it was just to be there. Many people are actually calling
Chicago as much of a war zone as Iraq or Afghanistan. That's saying a
lot. And the Dumocrat leadership (Obama's former left-hand man) has
no idea how to stop it, save to make more of the kind of laws that
have FAILED to stop it, so far. They aren't smart enough. (<a href="http://www.thenewsnerd.com/local/82-shot-chicago-considered-war-zone-military-deployed/">The News Nerd</a>)</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="western">
<span><span><span><span><span><span>Barack Hussein Obama was the worst thing that ever happened to the
United States of America. He did everything he could to UNDERMINE us,
in as many ways as he could. He spent $7 TRILLION dollars in just 8
years. More than ALL previous presidents, combined. He allo</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>w</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>ed

not "interfere" with his disastrous "peace agreement"
with Iran. He flatly refused to recognize the threat that Islamic
terrorism was to us, and allowed them to proliferate, all over the
world, through his inaction in stopping them. He fostered unlimited
Mu</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>s</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>lim
immigration--all young men of fighting age, DISGUISED as "refugees."
He "gutted" the military budget, so the military could not
do what they are supposed to do.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
 
<p class="western">
<span><span><span><span><span><span>Stories of flight squadrons that had
only one or two planes that could take off because of lack of parts
to repair their planes are rife. And not just in flight squadrons.
Parts are unavailable in all parts of the military</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>.</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>T</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>he

maybe not even ONE. Thank God for Trump, who has made it a plan to
bring our military back to strength, and has invested the money to
make it possible. Plus, he rescinded the Obama "rules of
conflict" to stop allowing the enemy the "first kill"
before we were allowed to respond. He is a saboteur and shou</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>l</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>d

</h3>

 


<p class="western">
<span><span><span><span><span>Liberals insist there is no such thing as logic. And everything they
do DEFIES logic. Like punishing achievement. Most intelligent people
would like to become rich. And high </span></span></span><span><span><span>achievers</span></span></span><span><span><span>
a</span></span></span><span><span><span>r</span></span></span><span><span><span>e
the ones that usually end up rich.</span></span></span><span><span><span>
Why then, do liberals constantly want to "tax the rich" at
higher rates than everybody else? (All the rich except for them, that
is) Most of the liberals who want to punish the rich are rich,
themselves. They just exempt themselves from the rules they set for
others. They push programs to allow MEN to enter women's most private
places. Places where young girls are NAKED, if they SAY they think
they're women that day. That is a major rejection of logic.
Intelligent people refuse to accept this, and they're accused of
bigotry, and all kinds of other names for their opposition. They want
to change the definition of marriage to include their "unions."
I have no problem with what they do to each other in private, but I
will NOT allow them to usurp the meaning of the word marriage. They
have been offered the exact same rights as those enjoyed under
marriage, but under another name, </span></span></span><span><span><span>and</span></span></span><span><span><span>
have rejected it, proving that all they want is to destroy the
meaning of the</span></span></span><span><span>w</span></span><span><span>ord</span></span><span><span><span>
marriage.</span></span></span><span><span><span>

<p class="western">
<span><span><span><span><span><span>Great Britain, having already made the fool mistake of almost banning
ALL guns and finding that doesn't &#8220;solve the gun problem,&#8221; are
now poised to make an even bigger mistake&#8212;banning all knives.
What's next? Banning stones? Having mostly banned all guns, they now
say &#8220;Knife crime is now a scourge on our society.&#8221; They call even
self defense with a knife a &#8220;knife crime.&#8221; In England, as here,
the anti-gunners are more interested in eliminating all means of self
defense for the citizens&#8212;unless, of course, you work for the
government, then, of course, you need to have the means to defend
yourself from all those wascally ILLEGAL guns&#8212;and to oppress those
who have none. What they are finding, of course, is the triumph of
the right to self defense. After they ban all knives, people will
find something else to use to defend themselves. And when they ban
that, something else. And so it goes. I recommend somebody start
teaching people how to use everyday objects in defending themselves.
They can't ban EVERYTHING.

president Trump is because he says so. There's only one proble</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>m</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>
with that. </span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>W</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>hat

that is</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>
complimentary to him, and continually run false stories AGAINST him.
Their "commentators" have constantly said, from that

walking down a street. What is not mentioned is his intimidation of
people who are smaller than he, including the clerk in th</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>e</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>
convenience store he was leaving after stealing some cigars. Walking
down a street? Yes</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>;</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>
right in the middle of the street, screwing up traffic, and when a
cop asked him to stop, he ATTACKED that cop, hoping to use his size
to overpower him. It didn't work.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
 
<p class="western">
<span><span><span><span><span><span>&#160;When he continued attacking, the
cop shot him, as would any intelligent person with a giant such as
this attacking. The city, anxious to appease the </span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>l</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>iberals,
charged him, tried him, and found him innocent, which sparked RIOTS
by disaffected criminals who thought this was an opportunity to "get"
a cop. In </span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Baltimore,
MD, six cops were charged with murder when Freddy Gray, a recent back
surgery patient, accidentally killed himself by banging his head
against the wal</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>l</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>
of a police "wagon" on his way to jail, in an attempt to
incriminate those cops. As in Ferguson, wiser heads prevailed, and
three of them were found innocent, and the charges were dropped on
the other three.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
 
<p class="western">
<span><span><span><span><span><span>But their careers were ruined, as was that of the
cop in Ferguson. Today, they're rioting in St. Louis after a cop was
</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>acquitted</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>
in the death of a black man. Never mind it was after a chase, and
that black man was fighting for all he was worth. This situation is
becoming all too common as people like those in "Black Lives
Matter" twist facts unmercifully to incriminate the cops, who
were doing their jobs</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>.
Yes, there ARE instances where cops shoot people (black and white)
unnecessarily. But those cases are rare. The problem is created when
"authorities" jump to appease the liberals, whose only
purpose is to give the cops a black eye.</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>
Nothing is ever said about the cops who have been killed from ambush
without warning, usually by a black man. Mentioning that would not
advance their rhetoric. Such instances make other cops VERY nervous.
They know they're right out there, in a conspicuous uniform, easy to
identify, while the bad guys are difficult to tell from honest
people.</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>

opinion might change, but that's doubtful. Anti-gun fools aren't
smart enough to recognize reality. She really thinks abuse victims
should have NO WAY to avoid serious injury, or even death at the
hands of their abusers. Does she have a better answer? No. She just
tells people what to do or not to do and is willing to take the
risk--for other people. The unfortunate truth is, she is right, at
least that anti gun fool cops and prosecutors will more than likely
arrest and imprison her when she DOES defend herself with her gun,
legally carried, or not. They shouldn't have the power to do that,
when it is clearly self defense. But they do. In any case, I'd rather
be in prison than in a coffin. (<a href="http://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/2017/07/bruce-krafft/huffington-post-domestic-abuse-victims-better-off-disarmed/">Truth About Guns</a>)</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<span><span><span><span><span><span>There is a former FBI informant ready to testify against Hillary
Clinton on the uranium deal. Victoria Toensing is his attorney, and
she won't reveal his name. This article, too, goes out of its way to
avoid naming him. This is a good thing if he is ever expected to
really testify against her. People in that position have a way of
DYING, before they can testify. And the ways they die are sometimes
IMPOSSIBLE. Like the one set to testify against Bill who "committed
suicide" by shooting himself in the head, TWICE. How he did that
is a real mystery, But not to the local "authorities," who
did a very sloppy "investigation." People dying before
testifying against BOTH Clintons has become so common that some
people have compiled LISTS of their names, and the supposed "causes
of their deaths." But nobody "official" seems to be
interested in looking into that. Maybe they're afraid of ending up on
that list.

<p class="western">
<span><span><span><span><span><span>Black Lives Matter thinks they are onto something. They're tapping
the built-in hatred for cops that is in ALL criminals. They think
they can translate that to others who don't intrinsically hate
cops--and incidentally white people. They take each and every case
where a cop shoots and kills a black person while he/she is
committing a crime, and twist it into a case of a cop shooting a
black person for nothing. Never mind it was for SOMETHING. They
promote that hatred, claiming that cops routinely "go hunting"
for black people to kill for sport, which is patently STUPID. Even
their basic premise is wrong. Yes, black lives matter. B</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>u</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>t
so do white lives. ALL lives matter, but they won't hear of that. If
somebody has the temerity to think ALL lives matter, they ridicule
them and try to discredit them by calling them names, chief of which
is "racist." It's STUPID to even THINK that cops routinely
"hunt" black people. They DO shoot white criminals, too</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>
mostly to stay alive</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>.
But BLM ignores that. Black officers shoot people, too. But they
ignore that, too.</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>

bright. If they were, they'd KNOW that the laws they support are
USELESS to stop, or even slow down gun violence, because the

they expect them to suddenly obey theirs? They need to find some kind

to insist on making USELESS laws nobody obeys. But that will never

going to happen as time goes on. He has eliminated many, many of
Obama's oppressive "regulations." Regulations he imposed by

Obama's requirement that everybody MUST buy his high priced health
insurance, and thereby "gutted" Obamacare. The premiums are

they will go down very soon. Yet those politically oriented

accidents recently. From ship collisions with private shipping to air
crashes due to lack of good maintenance, and the lack of spare parts,
to deaths of soldiers in training accidents. I'm sure the politicians
will not even CONSIDER the fact that all this is due to Obama's
stupid policies with regard to the military. They will want to fire
some generals, and even some lesser politicians or bureaucrats. They
will never go after the "Obama factor," always "missing
the mark." They will get rid of a lot of generals, but that will
not solve the problem. What WILL solve the problem is Donald Trump,
who is increasing the financing for the military a LOT. Eventually,
that will take care of the problem, even if most politicians never

<p class="western">
<span><span><span><span><span><span>The anti-gun fools are spreading the MYTH that a majority of
Americans WANT gun control. Evidence that this is a lie is the fact
that MOST of those silly &#8220;gun laws&#8221; are defeated. The very fact
that there is a big fight over gun rights should be an indicator to
intelligent people, but doesn't make a dent in the stone-like </span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>sculls</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>
of the anti-gun fools. What Americans want is &#8220;gun SAFETY.&#8221; The
laws that have been made, and are currently in place have done
NOTHING to stop, or even slow down &#8220;gun violence.&#8221; They are NEVER
going to stop gun violence with these laws because the people who use
guns for ill simply don't OBEY laws. To think that, all of a sudden,
they will obey THESE laws is imbecilic. But the anti-gun fools will
never &#8220;Tumble&#8221; to that. (<a href="http://www.orlandosentinel.com/opinion/os-ed-fewer-guns-means-less-violence-20170714-story.html">Orlando Sentinel</a>)</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

and they HATE it! They hate ANYTHING that is good for America because
whatever is good for America is bad for them. They rely on things
being bad because they can claim to "fix it." But they
never do. Whatever they do always makes it WORSE. The Dumocrats are

The proof is in every city that is run by Dumocrats. Take Detroit,
for instance. The infrastructure there is crumbling fast, and
everything Dumocrats do makes it worse. Look at the "gun
problem" in Chicago. Dumocrats have passed the tightest gun laws
in the nation, while gang members fighting over their "turf"
have caused the number of gun crimes to be also the highest in the
nation. That is a TESTAMENT to Dumocrat "governing."
Everywhere you look where Dumocrats run things is misery, while they
try to convince people that is "the new normal." Meanwhile,
where Republicans run things, things are much better.

Never mind it is going to cost 23 TRILLION, more money than ALL
previous administrations have spent, on EVERYTHING. We don't have it.
We'd have to borrow it. Our grandchildren, great grandchildren, and
great-great grandchildren would have to pay for it. But he doesn't
care. It's just OUR MONEY, not his. The same is true of other
liberals insisting on giving every living being a paycheck, whether
or not they work There's no telling how much THAT will cost, but they
don't even consider that</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>.</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>
And they're not considering what that will do to the economy if
people have no incentive to work because they'll get paid, anyway.
That's what socialism IS: stealing from the prod</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>u</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>cers
of new wealth for the benefit of those who, for whatever reason,

<p class="western">
<span><span><span><span><span><span>Anti-gun fools say that guns are manufactured ONLY to kill. They're
wrong&#8212;guns are also manufactured to SAVE people from being killed
by &#8220;bad guys&#8221; who MISUSE them. Without guns for self defense,
many more INNOCENT people will be killed by those who MISUSE their
guns for criminal purposes. What they don't know, or ignore, is that
ANYTHING can be used for good OR ill, and guns are no different. They
can be used to kill an enemy, or to provide food for the table. Fire
is another thing. It can be a big help by keeping you warm and by
allowing you to cook food to eat, or it can destroy huge areas and
kill many people if it is MISUSED. Then there's the hypodermic
needle. It is commonly manufactured for medical use, where it is
used, every day, to save lives, and make the lives of sick people
more comfortable. It can also be used by &#8220;druggies&#8221; to slowly
kill themselves by injecting poison into their veins to &#8220;get a
high.&#8221; Drug users commonly use &#8220;dirty needles&#8221; and often kill
themselves without knowing they're doing it. The point is, most
everything can be used for good or ill, including guns. (<a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-do-people-dislike-guns?redirected_qid=1738899">Quora</a>)</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<span><span><span><span><span><span>That's what socialism means to a country. The Free Market, which
collectivists (socialists, communists, progressivists, Fascists,
etc.) call capitalism, as an insult, means not only full shelves of
goods available, but the need for even more shelves to hold the
overage. Collectivism means children starving, and that has become
obvious in Venezuela, where the socialist society is crumbling before
our eyes because it produces NOTHING. The</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>r</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>e

their people's money. Then the</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>r</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>e's

<p class="western">
<span><span><span><span><span><span>Students at Berkeley are deathly afraid that a "conservative
speaker" will say something that resonates with people, with
which they don't agree. So they RIOT to keep ANYBODY with whom they
don't agree from making a speech, anywhere they can. Which only shows
the EMPTINESS of their positions. When Breitbart's Ben Shapiro came
to speak, it cost the university $600,000.00 for SECURITY so he COULD
speak. They have to know their ideas are meaningless, and they want
to keep people from finding that out, so they RIOT every time a
"conservative speaker" is scheduled to speak there. They
did so when Ann Coulter came to speak, and successfully kept her from
being able to say a word--there. But she had lots to say elsewhere
about her treatment by those campus liberal</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>
fools</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>
who know nothing</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>.</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>
They stopped her from talking on their campus, but students there are
able to hear what she says, elsewhere. </span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>T</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>hey
THINK they're censoring her, but they are only making her words more
meaningful.</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>

<p class="western">
<span><span><span><span><span>Anti-gun fool activists are asking, &#8220;Will Trump's new FBI Director
support common sense gun control? Good question. </span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>When
will they come up with some?</span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>
They certainly haven't yet. Every &#8220;gun control &#8220; measure they
have come up with so far does NOTHING to stop, or even slow down
&#8220;gun crime.&#8221; In fact, all they do is make it worse by making
honest, law-abiding people who actually OBEY laws defenseless in the
face of all the NON-law-abiding people who do NOT. That's NOT &#8220;common
sense,&#8221; that's a tragedy, since it gets innocent people KILLED.
&#8220;Gun-free zones,&#8221; for instance. There isn't a single mass
shooting that hasn't occurred IN a &#8220;gun-free zone.&#8221; Criminals
candidly tell us that they SEEK OUT gun-free zones in which to do
their &#8220;dirty deeds&#8221; because they can be pretty sure there won't
be any &#8220;law-abiding person&#8221; there who has a gun with which to
shoot back. Things like &#8220;gun locks,&#8221; and &#8220;safe storage&#8221; that
involve locked boxes that take MINUTES to open when the &#8220;bad guys&#8221;
already have their guns out and ready KILL people. All their other
&#8220;common sense gun laws&#8221; are just as bad. We will do well NOT to
support them. (<a href="http://www.outdoorlife.com/gun-news-will-wray-support-common-sense-gun-control">Outdoor Life</a>)</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="western">
<span><span><span><span><span>That's what a writer at </span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>Salon</span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>
thinks, anyway. She talks about Trump's &#8220;heavy handed&#8221;
enforcement of gun laws, which is completely non-existent. She
compared gun violence reports to the old &#8220;red line&#8221; policies of
the past (80 years ago), and found similarities. Thus, she determined
that gun control was racist. I really get tired of liberals always
coming out with new things that are &#8220;racist,&#8221; based on the
thinnest &#8220;evidence&#8221; possible, and which stretch the definition of
racism to the limit. She &#8220;found&#8221; that neighborhoods red lined 80
years ago have higher incidences of gun violence than anywhere else.
That does NOT indicate racism. It indicates the FACT that more people
LIVING in those neighborhoods COMMIT gun violence. It has nothing to
do with the fact that the neighborhood was &#8220;red lined.&#8221; Liberals
work HARD to try and convince the rest of us that as many things as
possible are actually racist, even if they have to twist the truth
unmercifully to accomplish it. By so doing, they cause the </span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>word</span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>
&#8220;racism&#8221; to become meaningless. (<a href="http://www.salon.com/2017/07/11/hotspots-for-gun-violence-track-closely-with-racist-redlining-policies-of-the-past/">Salon</a>)</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="western">
<span><span><span><span><span><span>Have you been wondering why there is so MUCH opposition to Donald
Trump as president? Most of it comes from the liberals, who CREATED
the problems that would, if allowed to continue, destroy this nation,
physically and financially.</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>
The rest comes from their dupes, some of whom are in the GOP.</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>
Trump promised to "drain the sw</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>a</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>mp"
in DC, and he is proceeding to do just that. and that scares the
"swamp dwellers" to death. They're sorely afraid he is
going to destroy their little swindles and schemes--and he will,
given time. He has already made a significant amount of progress, and
many swamp dwellers no longer dwell there. This frightens the rest,
and the more frightened they become, the higher the level of their
panic. </span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>T</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>hey
raise the level of opposition higher, and get more and more
desperate. Then they start making </span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>m</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>istakes
that will destroy THEM. The recent rail tragedy in </span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>W</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>ashington
State is a good example of what he talks about, regarding the
infrastructure, and he WILL do something about it.</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>

</h3>

 


<p class="western">
<span><span><span><span><span><span>If there were ANYTHING to legitimize "Kid Rock"s"
candidacy in the mind of thinking Americans, it is the opposition of
people like Al Sharpton, one of America's biggest racists, who
pretends to be ANTI-racist, spending his time extorting big money
people by threatening to accuse them of racism if they didn't give
him money. Sharpton is the bane of existence for anybody who has
money. Sooner or later he or Jesse Jackson will be on their doorstep,
demanding money not to accuse them of racism. What he says doesn't
mean anything any more, but he keeps on braying, trying desperately
to remain relevant. I laughed when I first heard of Kid Rock's
political ambitions, but after Sharpie....er, Sharpton objected to
his candidacy, I started to take it seriously. Sharpton can jump up
and down as much as he likes, and it will only make Kid Rock's
candidacy that much stronger.</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>

<a href="http://bullcutter.blogspot.com/2017/12/only-in-chicago.html">Only In Chicago</a>
</h3>

 


<p class="western">
<span><span><span><span><span>Chicago has some of the toughest &#8220;gun laws&#8221; in the country, ALL
of which violate the Second Amendment, but do NOTHING to stop those
who wish to do us ill from getting a gun. The Second amendment
clearly says, the right of </span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>ALL</span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>
Americans to be armed, </span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>&#8220;shall
NOT be infringed.&#8221;</span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>
But they make laws and regulations all the time that DO &#8220;infringe&#8221;
on that right, which is guaranteed by the Constitution. Example: In
Chicago, there has been a STRING of armed robberies, one of them
featuring a SIX-YEAR OLD, brandishing a gun. Show me ANYWHERE it is
legal for a six-year old to have and use a gun, never mind what this
one used it for! And somehow I suspect the guns those ADULTS used in
their robberies were</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>
NOT</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>
legally bought. It is obviously very easy to get guns in Chicago, and
the &#8220;bad guys&#8221; take full advantage of it. That's in SPITE of
those &#8220;tough gun laws. So what the hell </span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>good</span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>
are they? One day, the anti-gun fools will find a law that really
works, and I'll be right with them. But I'm not holding my breath
waiting. I'm not fond of turning blue. (<a href="http://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/boy-6-handgun-robbery-chicago-south-side-433339873.html">NBC Chicago</a>)</span></span></span></span></span></p>

</h3>

 


<p class="western">
<span><span><span><span><span><span>And while you're at it, investigate the accusers. The Dumocrats are
all out to "investigate" something</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>
for which</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>
there has never been ANY proof</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>,</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>
the idea that Trump conspired with the Russians to get elected.
Meanwhile, nobody's interested in investigating Hillary's KNOWN
collusion with the Russians to get elected. She bought and paid for
that "</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>r</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>eport"
that claims Trump hired prostitutes to pee on the bed Obama had slept
on in </span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>R</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>ussia,
nor her involvement in the scheme that gave the </span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>R</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>ussians
control over 20% of our </span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>u</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>ranium

side.</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>
At the same time, nobody's interested in checking out the backgrounds
of all those women who CLAIM to have been sexually abused by several
Republican politicians, including Donald Trump and Roy Moore. There
is not a SHRED of real evidence in any of these cases, and many of
the accusers have been IDENTIFIED as former Hillary staffers and
supporters otherwise. Others are KNOWN Trump haters. Why is nobody
interested in finding out about any bias they might have? (Just
common sense)</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

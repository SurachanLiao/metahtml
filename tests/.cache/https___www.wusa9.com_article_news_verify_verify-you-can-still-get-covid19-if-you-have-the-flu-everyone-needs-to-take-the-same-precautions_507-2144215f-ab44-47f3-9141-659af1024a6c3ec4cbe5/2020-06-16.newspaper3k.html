<h3>THE ANSWER:</h3>                                            </p>
                    <p dir="ltr"><br>No. Both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization said it&#8217;s possible to have COVID-19, the sickness caused by the coronavirus, and the flu at the same time. They are currently researching to see what interactions the viruses might have.</p>                                            <p class="article__section article__section_type_text">
<h3>WHAT WE FOUND:</h3>                                            </p>
                    <p dir="ltr"><br>A spokesperson for the CDC told VERIFY that, &#8220;It is certainly possible for someone to have more than one virus or other microbial infection at the same time.&#8221;<br><br>The CDC separately confirmed that it&#8217;s possible to have the flu and COVID-19 simultaneously.&#160;<br><br>So what does this mean for your body? Unfortunately, we don&#8217;t know yet.&#160;</p>                                            <p dir="ltr">The WHO said they&#8217;re currently researching that exact question.</p>                                            <p dir="ltr">They want to know how the coronavirus interacts with other viruses or illnesses.</p>                                            <p dir="ltr">But they can&#8217;t say yet if it puts people at more risk or changes symptoms.&#160;</p>                                            <p dir="ltr">Bottom line: Having the flu doesn&#8217;t prevent you from getting COVID-19.</p>                                            <p dir="ltr">And that&#8217;s important because this false idea could lead people with the flu to think they&#8217;re immune or don&#8217;t have to take the same precautions to avoid COVID-19.</p>                                            <p class="article__section article__section_type_embed">

</h1>

 <p> A heartbroken daughter has shared a picture of her mum in good spirits just hours before her life was cruelly snuffed out by coronavirus.</p> <p>Deborah Buchanan from County Antrim, says her mum Joan Wright, 75, requested she take one last family photograph before her body gave out to the cruel effects of Covid-19.</p> <p>She says she wanted to share the heartbreaking picture as a reminder for everyone to "wake up" to the dangers of the disease and continue to self isolate.</p> <p>Joan died in Furness General hospital in Cumbria last week.</p> <p>The last picture of her shows her hand in hand with her husband of 50 years, who is also hospitalised with Covid-19, and surrounded by her family.</p>     <figcaption class="publication-theme-indicator"><span class="caption">Deborah says her dad (pictured) also contracted coronavirus and remains in hospital</span> <span class="credit"> (Image: Deborah Buchanan)</span> </figcaption><p>Deborah Buchanan, from Newtownabbey says her mum was "talking and joking" just hours before she died.</p> <p>In a public Facebook post, she had choice words for those still to take the pandemic, which has claimed 30,000 lives in the UK, seriously.</p> <p>She said: "This is the reality of Coronavirus. Wake up and wise up. This is not going away anytime soon and more and more people are going to die. Don&#8217;t let it be your parent or grandparent or any member of your family who ends up like this. Stay away from those you love, and protect yourselves and them."</p> <p>Despite apparently socially isolating for weeks Deborah's parents both tested positive in hospital for COVID-19 on April 27 after being admitted to hospital.</p> <p>When she arrived she says her mum was on a ventilator, yet in good spirits, but just hours later her condition worsened.</p> <p>'We had to watch her gasp her last breaths and slip away in agony," Deborah said. "My dad says this is the worst thing he has ever felt in his life, he fears going to sleep incase he doesn&#8217;t wake up."</p>     <figcaption class="publication-theme-indicator"><span class="caption">Speaking about the final photo Deborah said: "She was happy, talking, joking, pulling faces and giving us grief as usual, she was doing well despite being on a ventilator"</span> <span class="credit"> (Image: Facebook)</span> </figcaption><p>She added: They hadn&#8217;t left the house in weeks but still picked this up and both took very unwell. My dad is still in hospital and not out of the woods yet, his heart is broken and he has to continue to fight to try and beat this."</p> <p>She is now calling on people to remain vigilant and continue to follow social distancing rules.</p> <p>"Please, stay at home, please do not go through the heartache we have had to. Ours isn&#8217;t over yet," she said.</p> <p>Speaking to Northern Ireland&#8217;s Sunday Life newspaper, Ms Buchanan said her parents had moved to Cumbria to spend their retirement.</p> <p>In an update she added "Although my parents did not leave the house in weeks, they did have care workers and medical professionals coming into their home.</p> <p>"So many people are asking how it&#8217;s possible when they didn&#8217;t leave, anything is possible with this virus."</p>

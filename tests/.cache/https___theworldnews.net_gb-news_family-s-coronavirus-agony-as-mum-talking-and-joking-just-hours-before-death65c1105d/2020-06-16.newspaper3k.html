Wake up and wise up. This is not going away anytime soon and more and more people are going to die. Don&#8217;t let it be your parent or grandparent or any member of your family who ends up like this. Stay away from those you love, and protect yourselves and them."</p> <p>Despite apparently socially isolating for weeks Deborah's parents both tested positive in hospital for COVID-19 on April 27 after being admitted to hospital.</p> <p>When she arrived she says her mum was on a ventilator, yet in good spirits, but just hours later her condition worsened.</p> <p>'We had to watch her gasp her last breaths and slip away in agony," Deborah said. "My dad says this is the worst thing he has ever felt in his life, he fears going to sleep incase he doesn&#8217;t wake up."</p>   <img alt="" src="https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article21973160.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_MAIN-Deborah-Buchanan.jpg">    <p class="credit"> (Image: Facebook)</p>    <p>She added: They hadn&#8217;t left the house in weeks but still picked this up and both took very unwell. My dad is still in hospital and not out of the woods yet, his heart is broken and he has to continue to fight to try and beat this."</p> <p>She is now calling on people to remain vigilant and continue to follow social distancing rules.</p> <p>"Please, stay at home, please do not go through the heartache we have had to. Ours isn&#8217;t over yet," she said.</p> <p>Speaking to Northern Ireland&#8217;s Sunday Life newspaper, Ms Buchanan said her parents had moved to Cumbria to spend their retirement.</p> <p>In an update she added "Although my parents did not leave the house in weeks, they did have care workers and medical professionals coming into their home.</p> <p>"So many people are asking how it&#8217;s possible when they didn&#8217;t leave, anything is possible with this virus."</p> </div>

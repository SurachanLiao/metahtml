She had <a href="https://coconuts.co/kl/news/accused-assassins-plea-not-guilty-kim-jong-nam-trial/">pleaded not guilty to the accusations</a>. No reason has been given for the swift turn of events.</p><p>Upon hearing the developments in her case this morning, Siti left the Shah Alam courtroom, and was escorted into a waiting car.</p><p>“I finished my job,” Siti’s lawyer, Gooi Soon Seng is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/11/kim-jong-nam-trial-siti-aisyah-released-after-charge-dropped">reported to have said</a>.</p><p>“She is a free person now, she will be going back to Indonesia.” She was later seen leaving the court in a car from the Indonesian embassy.</p><p>Both Siti, and another woman – Vietnamese national Duan Thi Huong – were arrested after they were seemingly captured on airport CCTV helping carry out Kim Jong-nam’s murder by smearing a nerve agent on his face in the middle of Kuala Lumpur International Airport 2. Had they been found guilty, both could have faced the death penalty.</p><p>Previously, the women had argued that they were <a href="https://coconuts.co/kl/news/kim-jong-nam-murder-suspect-thought-hit-prank-says-lawyer/">tricked into thinking they were taking part in prank on a Japanese game show</a>. In actuality, the two appear to have used VX nerve agent to kill Jong-nam in less than 20 minutes.</p><p>Last year, the prosecution made a motion to throw out the case; at the time, the judge ruled that both Siti and Duon should testify, not ruling out that the entire incident could have been a conspiracy between the women and their North Korean counterparts to assassinate the leader’s older brother. Jong-nam had previously been his father’s favorite son and next in line for succession until an embarrassing international incident saw him use a fake Dominican passport to enter Japan. Allegedly, he had just been trying to visit Tokyo’s Disneyland.</p><p>Jong-nam would come to be based in Macau, occasionally issuing public statements denouncing his brother’s regime as “a joke.” However, reports have since emerged that <a href="https://coconuts.co/kl/news/kim-jong-nam-believed-life-danger-hit-court-told/">he had become fearful of his brother’s ever-reaching arm, and his retaliatory actions</a>.</p><p>At the time of his death, Jong-nam was carrying 12 doses of VX nerve agent antidote in his bag.</p><p><span>Paywall: You’re outta here, Coconuts stories are free for all</span></p><p>We have removed our paywall on all Coconuts stories.

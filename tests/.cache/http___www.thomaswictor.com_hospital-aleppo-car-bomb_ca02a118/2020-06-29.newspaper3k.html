<div><p>Today the al-Dabeet Maternity Hospital in Aleppo, Syria, was heavily damaged. This is the official story <a title="Thomas Wictor is not fooled." href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/03/maternity-hospital-aleppo-deadly-blast-syria" target="_blank">from the Assad regime.</a></p>
<p>A maternity hospital in a government-controlled area of Aleppo has been badly damaged by rocket fire, killing at least three people, according to the state news agency. It was the sixth attack affecting a medical facility in nearly two weeks of fierce fighting that has left more than 250 people dead and the ancient city on the brink of a humanitarian catastrophe.</p>
<p>A shell struck the fuel tank of a military vehicle near al-Dabeet hospital, which exploded and badly damaged the building.</p>
<p>This is a lie. The reality is that a car bomb (vehicle borne improvised explosive device or VBIED) was used. We have distressing video of the immediate aftermath. Normally I wouldn&#8217;t post this, but you need to see the evidence. Also, someone must expose Iran and bear witness for the people of Aleppo.</p>
<p>With each passing day, Bashar al-Assad hastens his demise. He&#8217;ll be brought to justice. I promise.</p>
<h2>Hospital hit again</h2>
<p>The Assad regime and its Iranian allies are systematically destroying Aleppo&#8217;s medical facilities. This is Assad and the Iranian Quds Force holding civilians hostage. Assad will murder hostages until the Arab League backs off and lets him stay in power. The problem with giving in to murderous hostage takers is that they do it again and again.</p>
<p>Have you wondered why you never hear about the Somali pirates anymore? It&#8217;s because cargo ships hired armed security contractors, various navies sank the pirate mother ships, and unidentified commandos went ashore and killed everyone in the pirate villas.</p>
<p></p>
<p>They fired warning shots into the pirates. That way it didn&#8217;t matter if the pirates chose to ignore the warning, because the warning killed the pirates. The most effective warning is one that kills.</p>
<p>You won&#8217;t see any gratuitous gore in the video below, but people were seriously injured and killed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Syrians said that a rebel rocket hit a military fuel truck. Where&#8217;s the burning fuel? There is none, because it was a car bomb.</p>
<p>This is the rear axle of the car.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thomaswictor.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/car_bomb_axle.1.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-44298" src="http://www.thomaswictor.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/car_bomb_axle.1-300x188.jpg" alt="car_bomb_axle.1" width="300" height="188"></a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the front axle of the car, which was thrown across the street from the hospital.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thomaswictor.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/car_bomb_axle.2.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-44299" src="http://www.thomaswictor.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/car_bomb_axle.2-300x196.jpg" alt="car_bomb_axle.2" width="300" height="196"></a></p>
<p>There&#8217;s no evidence of a military fuel truck.</p>
<p>This is alleged to be the tail fin of the rebel rocket that did the damage.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thomaswictor.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/rocket_tail_fins.1.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-44300" src="http://www.thomaswictor.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/rocket_tail_fins.1-300x188.jpg" alt="rocket_tail_fins.1" width="300" height="188"></a></p>
<p>Below, as you can see with your own eyes, the broken edges of the metal (red arrow) are as rusty as the body of the rocket.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thomaswictor.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/rocket_tail_fins.2.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-44301" src="http://www.thomaswictor.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/rocket_tail_fins.2-300x210.jpg" alt="rocket_tail_fins.2" width="300" height="210"></a></p>
<p>Metal that was recently broken is shiny, not rusty.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thomaswictor.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/shovel.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-44351" src="http://www.thomaswictor.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/shovel-300x181.jpg" alt="shovel" width="300" height="181"></a></p>
<p>That rocket tail-fin arrangement was planted after the car bomb detonated.</p>
<h2>Hospital facade sheared off</h2>
<p>A classic sign of a car bomb is when the front of a building is peeled away.</p>
<p>The Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thomaswictor.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/alfred-p-murrah-federal-building.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-44302" src="http://www.thomaswictor.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/alfred-p-murrah-federal-building-287x300.jpg" alt="alfred-p-murrah-federal-building" width="287" height="300"></a></p>
<p>This is caused by a combination of blast (overpressure) and the destruction of load-bearing support structures.</p>
<p>Photos of the al-Dabeet Maternity Hospital show that the front peeled off and fell into the street.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thomaswictor.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/al-Dabeet_Maternity_Hospital.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-44303" src="http://www.thomaswictor.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/al-Dabeet_Maternity_Hospital-297x300.jpg" alt="al-Dabeet_Maternity_Hospital" width="297" height="300"></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.thomaswictor.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/al-Dabeet-Maternity-Hospital.2.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-44306" src="http://www.thomaswictor.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/al-Dabeet-Maternity-Hospital.2-244x300.jpg" alt="al-Dabeet Maternity Hospital.2" width="244" height="300"></a></p>
<p>There&#8217;s no evidence of burning fuel or fragmentation damage. The Iranian Quds Force and the Syrian Military Intelligence Directorate (<i>Shu&#8217;bat al-Mukhabarat al-&#8216;Askariyya</i>) use Pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) mixed with a plasticizer. This creates a massively powerful plastic explosive that can be used in small amounts.</p>
<p>Rebel rockets are filled either with ammonium nitrate and fuel oil (ANFO) or explosives harvested from artillery and mortar rounds. They&#8217;re nowhere near as destructive as PETN.</p>
<h2>The men who attacked the hospital</h2>
<p>This is was an Iranian Quds Force operation. Here&#8217;s the commander.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thomaswictor.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Quds_Force_commander.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-44304" src="http://www.thomaswictor.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Quds_Force_commander-300x188.jpg" alt="Quds_Force_commander" width="300" height="188"></a></p>
<p>He&#8217;s wearing the Iranian copy of the American desert camouflage uniform (DCU) in an urban environment. Why? All the other men except for one are uniformed in the Syrian Arab Army (SAA) copy of the American M81 woodland pattern Battle Dress Uniform (BDU). Well, commanders need to be visible.</p>
<p>This is another Quds Force member.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thomaswictor.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Quds_Force.2.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-44305" src="http://www.thomaswictor.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Quds_Force.2-300x188.jpg" alt="Quds_Force.2" width="300" height="188"></a></p>
<p>The Quds Force is the elite of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). Until recently, only the Quds Force carried out extraterritorial missions. However, so many have been killed that now the regular IRGC joins them in Yemen, Syria, and Iraq.</p>
<p>How do I know that the man in the sunglasses is a member of the Quds Force?</p>
<h2>Died in a hospital</h2>
<p>Major General Qassem Suleimani, the <a title="An ex-terrorist." href="http://www.thomaswictor.com/quds-force-chief-qassem-suleimani-is-still-dead-im-pretty-sure/" target="_blank">late head of the Quds Force.</a></p>
<p>Looks what he&#8217;s wearing on his finger.</p>

<p>Iranian military officers have a fetish for tacky silver rings with big, round gemstones.</p>

<p>They even wear them in the field.</p>

<p>Behold our suave Iranian murderer reporting the success of the car bombing to his bosses.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thomaswictor.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Quds_Force_commander.2.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-44312" src="http://www.thomaswictor.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Quds_Force_commander.2-300x188.jpg" alt="Quds_Force_commander.2" width="300" height="188"></a></p>
<p>He isn&#8217;t a soldier; he&#8217;s a terrorist. It takes no skill whatsoever to murder defenseless civilians.</p>
<p>You know what takes skill? Infiltrating tanks, armored vehicles, artillery pieces, aircraft, helicopter gunships, and thousands of men into a country&#8212;without being seen. It also takes incredible skill to fight your way across an entire nation, city by city, without killing civilians.</p>
<p>Syria is being liberated. The liberators must contend with pressures that most of us can&#8217;t imagine. That&#8217;s why they&#8217;re being thorough. You don&#8217;t want them to do a bad job. Their goal is to end the fighting forever.</p>
<h2>Blowing up a hospital? Fine by me!</h2>
<p>Today on Twitter, the person below tried to talk me out of my contention that Assad and the Quds Force blew up the al-Dabeet Maternity Hospital.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thomaswictor.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/DPRK_Jones.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-44313" src="http://www.thomaswictor.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/DPRK_Jones-300x214.jpg" alt="DPRK_Jones" width="300" height="214"></a></p>
<p>&#8220;DPRK&#8221; stands for &#8220;Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea.&#8221;</p>
<p>North Korea. &#8220;Jason&#8221; is a North Korean paid to both praise Assad and criticize the US on social media. But &#8220;Jason&#8221; is an idiot who knows nothing about munitions. After he told me for the third time that weapons don&#8217;t have signatures, I said that he was wasting my time, and if he didn&#8217;t stop tweeting me, I&#8217;d block him.</p>
<p>&#8220;How about if I block you, retard?&#8221; he asked and then proceeded to do so. It&#8217;s called the Flouncing Exit with a Pithy Parting Remark&#8482;.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not bothered by North Korean idiots. However, the plight of Syrians bothers me greatly.</p>
<p>So I want to reassure Syrians that soon you&#8217;ll be free. It can&#8217;t be done immediately, because there are too many insane people in the world. Look what happened to Iraq after the Coalition overthrew Saddam Hussein in three weeks. It was a disaster.</p>
<p><a title="Yes, it's all real." href="http://www.thomaswictor.com/revolution-warfare-geopolitics/" target="_blank">The Saudis and their allies know what they&#8217;re doing.</a> This will be your last war.</p>
<p>Be strong. Your freedom is coming, and then you can rebuild.</p>

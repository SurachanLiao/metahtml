</del> <h2>What does ISIS stand for?</h2> <p>Many people have heard of the term ISIS, which is an acronym for the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.</p> <p>It can also mean the Islamic State in al-Sham, the Arabic name for the region, and the group have said its goal is to create a caliphate in this region.</p> <p>The name ISIS has proved an issue for many companies and brands, as it also belongs to an ancient Egyptian goddess.</p> <p>The murderous network – known for its barbaric public executions – was originally part of al-Qaeda before splitting with the group over differences in ideology and methods.</p> <p>It believes all Muslims should unite into a worldwide caliphate.</p> <a href="#"><p><del><img class="wp-image-421424 size-thesun-article-image" alt="A propaganda photograph of an ISIS militant in Syria" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/nintchdbpict0002853666022.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" width="960" height="576"></del></p><del> Link: # </del></a><del> </del><p class="article__credit"><del>Alamy		</del></p><del> </del><a href=""><p class="article__gallery-count-value theme__copy-color"><del>5</del></p></a><del> A propaganda photograph of an ISIS militant in Syria	
	

</del> <h2>What is the meaning of Isil?</h2> <p>Isil is an acronym standing for Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.</p> <p>This name was given to the group as it was thought to be more accurate to their geographical location as the Levant includes Syria, Palestine, Lebanon, Israel and Jordan.</p> <p>Many governments and leaders, including Barack Obama and David Cameron, have used the term Isil as it is thought to be a better translation for al-Sham, which is the Arabic name for the area.</p> <p>In a statement released following the brutal beheading of American photojournalist James Foley, Mr Cameron’s office said: “The Prime Minister has condemned the barbaric and brutal murder of James Foley by Isil (Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant) in Syria.</p> <p>“This will not change our commitment to tackling this appalling organisation and doing everything we can to keep our country safe.”</p> <a href="#"><p><del><img class="wp-image-421425 size-thesun-article-image" alt="ISIS militants parade in 2014 in Raqqa, Syria" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/nintchdbpict0002920966731.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" width="960" height="473"></del></p><del> Link: # </del></a><del> </del><p class="article__credit"><del>Alamy		</del></p><del> </del><a href=""><p class="article__gallery-count-value theme__copy-color"><del>5</del></p></a><del> ISIS militants parade in 2014 in Raqqa, Syria	
	

</del> <h2>What is the meaning of Daesh?</h2> <p>The word Daesh is an acronym for al-Dawla al-Islamiya fi al-Iraq wa al-Sham.</p> <p>The term is derived from a rough translation of Arabic words, including Arabic verb دعس, which means to tread underfoot or crush.</p> <p>It can also be spelt DAIISH, Da’esh or Daech, and is a name which members of the terror group despise.</p> <p>According to the <a href="https://blog.ap.org/announcements/now-we-say-the-islamic-state-group-instead-of-isil" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Associated Press</a> in 2014, ISIS threatened “to cut the tongue of anyone who publicly used the acronym Daesh”.</p> <p>Following the attacks in France, the French government started adopting this term instead of ISIS or Isil.</p> <p>Former French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said: “This is a terrorist group and not a state.</p> <p>“I do not recommend using the term Islamic State because it blurs the lines between Islam, Muslims and Islamists.”</p> <a href="#"><p><del><img class="wp-image-421427 size-thesun-article-image" alt="The caliph of the self-proclaimed Islamic State, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

</del> <h2>Which is the correct name?</h2> <p>The four competing names are just a few of the those used by the terror group, which started in 1999 when it was formed by Jordanian militant Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.</p> <p>As far as they are concerned, the correct term is the Islamic State – but the British and US Governments are among those preferring to use the name Isil.</p> <p>The term ISIS is more commonly used within international news publications, and has been used as a label in official United Nations reports.</p> <p>Counter-terrorism expert Dr Anne Aly, a research fellow at Curtin University, said it is neither “here or there” what you call the terror group.</p> <p>She said it is more important to note that they call themselves the Islamic State, as it shows they are trying to create a state does not respect the borders of Iraq and Syria.</p> <p>In 2015 the BBC’s Director General refused to drop the term Islamic State from the corporation’s coverage.</p> <p>All BBC broadcasts and reports refer to the group as the “so-called Islamic State”.</p> <p>At the time a BBC spokesman said the corporation had no choice but to refer to the group by the name it uses itself.</p> <p class="bc-video-holder"><span class="article__bc_video-caption">Russia Defence Ministry look like fools after Tweeting video of a computer game and claiming it was US military assisting

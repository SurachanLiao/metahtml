		There is much confusion surrounding the official name of the terror group	
	

<h2>What does ISIS stand for?</h2>
<p>Many people have heard of the term ISIS, which is an acronym for the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.</p>
<p>It can also mean the Islamic State in al-Sham, the Arabic name for the region, and the group have said its goal is to create a caliphate in this region.</p>
<p>The name ISIS has proved an issue for many companies and brands, as it also belongs to an ancient Egyptian goddess.</p>
<p>The murderous network &#8211; known for its barbaric public executions &#8211; was originally part of al-Qaeda before splitting with the group over differences in ideology and methods.</p>
<p>It believes all Muslims should unite into a worldwide caliphate.</p>

<h2>What is the meaning of Isil?</h2>
<p>Isil is an acronym standing for Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.</p>
<p>This name was given to the group as it was thought to be more accurate to their geographical location as the Levant includes Syria, Palestine, Lebanon, Israel and Jordan.</p>
<p>Many&#160;governments and leaders, including Barack Obama and David Cameron, have used the term Isil as it is thought to be a better translation for al-Sham, which is the Arabic name for the area.</p>
<p>In a statement released following the brutal beheading of American photojournalist James Foley, Mr Cameron&#8217;s office said: &#8220;The Prime Minister has condemned the barbaric and brutal murder of James Foley by Isil (Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant) in Syria.</p>
<p>&#8220;This will not change our commitment to tackling this appalling organisation and doing everything we can to keep our country safe.&#8221;</p>

<h2>What is the meaning of Daesh?</h2>
<p>The word Daesh is an acronym for al-Dawla al-Islamiya fi al-Iraq wa al-Sham.</p>
<p>The term is derived from a rough translation of Arabic words, including Arabic verb &#1583;&#1593;&#1587;, which means to tread underfoot or crush.</p>
<p>It can also be spelt DAIISH, Da&#8217;esh or Daech, and is a name which members of the terror group despise.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://blog.ap.org/announcements/now-we-say-the-islamic-state-group-instead-of-isil" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Associated Press</a> in 2014, ISIS threatened &#8220;to cut the tongue of anyone who publicly used the acronym Daesh&#8221;.</p>
<p>Following the attacks in France, the French government started adopting this term instead of ISIS or Isil.</p>
<p>Former French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said: &#8220;This is a terrorist group and not a state.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not recommend using the term Islamic State because it blurs the lines between Islam, Muslims and Islamists.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Which is the correct name?</h2>
<p>The four competing names are just a few of the those used by the terror group, which started in 1999 when it was formed by Jordanian militant&#160;Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.</p>
<p>As far as they are concerned, the correct term is the Islamic State &#8211; but the British and US Governments are among those preferring&#160;to use the name Isil.</p>
<p>The term ISIS is more commonly used within international news publications, and has been used as a label in official United Nations reports.</p>
<p>Counter-terrorism expert Dr Anne Aly, a research fellow at Curtin University, said it is neither &#8220;here or there&#8221; what you call the terror group.</p>
<p>She said&#160;it is more important to note that they call themselves the Islamic State, as it shows they are trying to create a state&#160;does not respect the borders of Iraq and Syria.</p>
<p>In 2015 the BBC&#8217;s Director General refused to drop the term Islamic State from the corporation&#8217;s coverage.</p>
<p>All BBC broadcasts and reports refer to the group as the &#8220;so-called Islamic State&#8221;.</p>
<p>At the time a BBC spokesman said the corporation had no choice but to refer to the group by the name it uses itself.</p>

				<h2>Have they been defeated?</h2>
<p>What is being hailed as the &#8220;final battle&#8221; against ISIS is set to clear the village of Baghouz in Syria on February 11.</p>

<p>Warplanes have been dropping huge bombs after being called in by SDF troops, according to reports.</p>
<p>SDF spokesman Mustafa Bali said: &#8220;We will launch an attack to end the Daesh (ISIS) presence or they will turn themselves in.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are no other options for them. We confirm there are no negotiations and no intention to have negotiations.&#8221;</p>

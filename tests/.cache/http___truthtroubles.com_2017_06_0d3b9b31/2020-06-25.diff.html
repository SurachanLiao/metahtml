102-year-old time capsule buried in its base.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="zn-body__paragraph speakable"><ins>Removal of the <a href="https://forestparkmap.org/confederate-memorial" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Confederate Memorial in Forest Park Link: https://forestparkmap.org/confederate-memorial </a>began Monday as part of an agreement between St. Louis and the Missouri Civil War Museum.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="zn-body__paragraph speakable"><ins>The copper time capsule was sealed in the center of the very bottom of the monument about a month before it was completed, said Mark Trout, executive director of the Missouri Civil War Museum, who knew about the capsule’s existence from historical documents.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="zn-body__paragraph"><ins>“We knew it was in there somewhere, so we were careful as we chipped away at something like 40 tons of concrete until we got to the very bottom,” Trout said.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="zn-body__paragraph"><ins>There, workers found a stone tablet that read, “On this spot, a monument will be erected in memory of the soldiers and sailors of the Confederacy.” The monument was dedicated in 1914.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="zn-body__paragraph"><ins>Inside the capsule, Trout expects to find documents, a magazine with an article about the monument, as well as a letter to whomever would access the trove, he said.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="zn-body__paragraph"><ins>Given that the time capsule was placed so far into the monument’s base, the letter’s writer must have known that future readers only would access it if the monument were destroyed or disassembled.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="zn-body__paragraph"><ins>“That’s probably the saddest thing,” Trout said.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="zn-body__paragraph"><ins>Still, there will undoubtedly be some surprises in the capsule.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="zn-body__paragraph"><ins>“We know a couple of things inside of it, (but) we don’t know everything,” he said.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="zn-body__paragraph"><ins>The capsule is about 18 inches long by 10 inches deep and 10 inches tall, Trout said. It’s expected to be opened at an upcoming fund-raiser for the Missouri Civil War Museum.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="zn-body__paragraph"><ins></ins></p><h3><ins>Debate over Confederate symbols</ins></h3><ins> </ins><p class="zn-body__paragraph"><ins>The St. Louis monument’s removal comes as communities across the South have taken a more critical eye toward public symbols of the Confederacy.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="zn-body__paragraph"><ins>Opponents say the monuments inappropriately glorify the rebellion’s history of slavery and promote the “Lost Cause” ideology, which holds that states’ rights was the Confederacy’s core driver, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary.

The relief, sculpted by George Julian Zolnay, depicts a family and a soldier as he heads off to war.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="zn-body__paragraph"><ins>The monument had attracted graffiti and criticism, and the city recently decided to remove it. The Missouri Civil War Museum sued, challenging the piece’s ownership.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="zn-body__paragraph"><ins>The two parties <a href="https://www.stlouis-mo.gov/government/departments/mayor/news/city-settlement-civil-war-museum.cfm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached a settlement Monday Link: https://www.stlouis-mo.gov/government/departments/mayor/news/city-settlement-civil-war-museum.cfm </a>under which the museum agreed to pay for the monument’s removal and storage until a new permanent location can be found, the city said.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="zn-body__paragraph"><ins>The monument is now in protective storage, Trout said. It will need some preservation work before it can be displayed again. The museum must find a Civil War museum, battlefield, or cemetery outside St. Louis as the monument’s new home, the city said.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer"><ins>CNN’s Emanuella Grinberg contributed to this report.</ins></p><ins> </ins></section><p class="robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing"><ins></ins></p><h3 class="sd-title"><ins>Like this post?

Trump wrote on Twitter last week that China’s efforts have “not worked out,” a declaration that came after the death of American college student Otto Warmbier a few days after returning to the United States following 17 months of detention in North Korea.</ins></p><p><ins>Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the administration was moving to cut off the Bank of Dandong from U.S. financial markets in an effort to block millions of dollars of transactions that funnel money into North Korea for use in its weapons programs.</ins></p><p><ins>Under the sanctions, U.S. citizens also will be generally prohibited from doing business with Sun Wei and Ri Song Hyok, who are accused of establishing and running front companies on behalf of North Korea, and Dalian Global Unity Shipping Co., which is accused of transporting 700,000 tons of freight annually, including coal and steel products, between China and North Korea.</ins></p><p><ins>The administration announced the sanctions just hours before South Korea’s new president, Moon Jae-in, arrived at the White House for a two-day summit with Trump. Moon campaigned on a platform of greater engagement with Pyongyang, and he has questioned the need for the U.S.-backed THAAD missile defense system that is being installed on the peninsula, which Beijing and Pyongyang have opposed.</ins></p><p><ins>Mnuchin said that the United States is “in no way targeting China with these actions” and that U.S. officials “look forward to continuing to work closely with the government of China to stop the illicit financing in North Korea.”</ins></p><p><ins>Mnuchin added that this “very significant action” sends the message that the United States will follow the money trail leading to North Korea and continue to crack down on those assisting the country.</ins></p><p><ins>“North Korea’s provocative, destabilizing and inhumane behavior will not be tolerated,” Mnuchin said. “We are committed to targeting North Korea’s external enablers and maximizing economic pressure on the regime until it ceases its nuclear and ballistic-missile programs.”</ins></p><p><ins>China has repeatedly made clear it opposes “unilateral” sanctions in addition to those agreed to by the United Nations Security Council. Only last week, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said his country opposed the “long-arm jurisdiction” of the United States in this matter.</ins></p><p><ins>“We have repeatedly stressed this stance in our communication with the United States, and the U.S. side is also clear about it,” he said during a regular news conference.</ins></p><p><ins>In a separate announcement, administration officials said they had approved an arms package for Taiwan that includes advanced rocket and anti-ship missile systems — another measure China has repeatedly said that it firmly opposes.</ins></p><p><ins>The package is slightly larger than one that was put on hold at the end of the Obama administration, the officials said, but includes largely the same weapons capabilities.</ins></p><p><ins>The sale is considered relatively modest compared with past arms packages. Still, China views the self-ruled island as part of the country and is likely to oppose any such arms transfers.</ins></p><p><ins>As president-elect, Trump broke with protocol and accepted a congratulatory phone call from Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen in December, angering Xi.</ins></p><p class="pb-subscribe-headline"><ins>The story must be told.</ins></p><p class="pb-subscribe-subline"><ins>Your subscription supports journalism that matters.</ins></p><p class="pb-subscribe-button"><ins><a class="pb-subscribe-link" href="https://subscribe.washingtonpost.com/acquisition/?promo=display_hp_subsbnr&amp;oscode=RPWH&amp;wpsrc=CM0000449&amp;tid=s_028&amp;destination=http://www.washingtonpost.com/pb/politics/us-announces-sanctions-on-chinese-bank-arms-sales-package-for-taiwan/2017/06/29/c0b66e3c-5d0b-11e7-a9f6-7c3296387341_story.html">Try 1 month for 99¢ Link: https://subscribe.washingtonpost.com/acquisition/?promo=display_hp_subsbnr&amp;oscode=RPWH&amp;wpsrc=CM0000449&amp;tid=s_028&amp;destination=http://www.washingtonpost.com/pb/politics/us-announces-sanctions-on-chinese-bank-arms-sales-package-for-taiwan/2017/06/29/c0b66e3c-5d0b-11e7-a9f6-7c3296387341_story.html </a></ins></p><p><ins>Lt.

Like most Americans I wish that our President would be banned from Twitter as long as he is still our President because he does tend to say many things that are beneath the dignity of the Office he holds. Mr. Trump in my opinion has done many things to show his lack of knowledge since he has been in Office like not knowing that his favorite former President had died more than 15 years before the Civil War ever started yet was speaking about how he was distraught about that war. He has shown that he knew basically nothing about issues in the Middle East even though he liked to brag how he knew more than our military Generals knew and he has made it clear that he has no need for morning briefings from our Intelligence Agency Heads. Yet to me the most embarrassing thing he has done yet is how he acted at the group photo at the last NATO Summit. When he pushed the Prime Minister out of the front row center spot that he, Mr. Trump wanted to be in, he actually embarrassed me that he was even an American let alone our President.</p><p>Most of us probably remember at least a little bit about the young man in California that was nicknamed the ‘affluenza’ brat from a wealthy family who killed 4 people (if I remember correctly) while driving a car while drunk. His lawyer was able to get him off with just probation and no jail time because he had been raised ‘to wealthy’ to know right from wrong. He must have had an amazing lawyer and or an incompetent Judge for that verdict to have happened. You would think that a child who is being raised in a home where the family is in need of nothing would be a very grateful young person and not a menace to society but this is not always the reality. There is also another issue here in America where our legal system does not tolerate parents if they in any way discipline their child and the children know this so many act out like pure spoiled brats. Yet when a child acts out at school the courts then blame the parents for doing a bad job of raising their child when in many cases it is the politicians and courts that are to blame and not the parents.</p><p>I have always been a person who has been pleased when someone I know accomplishes something like being able to purchase a new car or is able to buy a new house or even be able to purchase a new living room suite or a new lawn mower. I have always been pleased when a person through their hard work or even good luck is able to become quite wealthy, as long as they did it honestly and decently. When a person obtains their wealth through stealing from other people then I have no respect for them.</p><p>Donald Trump grew up in a very wealthy household and all I can say about that is, good for him. His Dad taught him many things in his childhood years, some good some bad, just like most parents do. Donald Trump was given millions from his Dad when he graduated college and all I can say to that is, good for him. The issue I have with Donald Trump is his pure greed and huge ego as those two issues are an embarrassment to any person whom possesses them. Mr. Trump has bullied and stolen his way into becoming the billionaire that he is on the backs of anyone he felt he could ‘get over’ on. He has proven without any doubt that money is his God and when this is so a person tends to act like an immature habitual liar just as he is today and it appears that he has always been. I will end this commentary with this one thought and hope, for our Nations sake I really hope that somehow Mr. Trump would grow up and act like a responsible adult and quit acting like a little spoiled affluenza child in an old man’s body.</p> <p class="robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing"><ins></ins></p><h3 class="sd-title"><ins>Like this post?

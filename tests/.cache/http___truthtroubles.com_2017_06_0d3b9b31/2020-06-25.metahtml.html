<ul class="el__storyhighlights__list">
<li class="el__storyhighlights__item el__storyhighlights--normal">The time capsule was buried deep in a Confederate monument in St. Louis</li>
<li class="el__storyhighlights__item el__storyhighlights--normal">The capsule dates to 1914, and many of its contents remain a mystery</li>
</ul>

 



<p class="zn-body__paragraph speakable">(CNN)&#160;Workers taking down a controversial Confederate monument in St. Louis have discovered a 102-year-old time capsule buried in its base.</p>

<p class="zn-body__paragraph speakable">Removal of the&#160;<a href="https://forestparkmap.org/confederate-memorial" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Confederate Memorial in Forest Park</a>began Monday as part of an agreement between St. Louis and the Missouri Civil War Museum.</p>
<p class="zn-body__paragraph speakable">The copper time capsule was sealed in the center of the very bottom of the monument about a month before it was completed, said Mark Trout, executive director of the Missouri Civil War Museum, who knew about the capsule&#8217;s existence from historical documents.</p>
 
 
<p class="zn-body__paragraph">&#8220;We knew it was in there somewhere, so we were careful as we chipped away at something like 40 tons of concrete until we got to the very bottom,&#8221; Trout said.</p>
<p class="zn-body__paragraph">There, workers found a stone tablet that read, &#8220;On this spot, a monument will be erected in memory of the soldiers and sailors of the Confederacy.&#8221; The monument was dedicated in 1914.</p>

<p class="zn-body__paragraph">Inside the capsule, Trout expects to find documents, a magazine with an article about the monument, as well as a letter to whomever would access the trove, he said.</p>
<p class="zn-body__paragraph">Given that the time capsule was placed so far into the monument&#8217;s base, the letter&#8217;s writer must have known that future readers only would access it if the monument were destroyed or disassembled.</p>
<p class="zn-body__paragraph">&#8220;That&#8217;s probably the saddest thing,&#8221; Trout said.</p>
<p class="zn-body__paragraph">Still, there will undoubtedly be some surprises in the capsule.</p>
<p class="zn-body__paragraph">&#8220;We know a couple of things inside of it, (but) we don&#8217;t know everything,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p class="zn-body__paragraph">The capsule is about 18 inches long by 10 inches deep and 10 inches tall, Trout said. It&#8217;s expected to be opened at an upcoming fund-raiser for the Missouri Civil War Museum.</p>
<p class="zn-body__paragraph">
<h3>Debate over Confederate symbols</h3>
</p>
<p class="zn-body__paragraph">The St. Louis monument&#8217;s removal comes as communities across the South have taken a more critical eye toward public symbols of the Confederacy.</p>
<p class="zn-body__paragraph">Opponents say the monuments inappropriately glorify the rebellion&#8217;s history of slavery and promote the &#8220;Lost Cause&#8221; ideology, which holds that states&#8217; rights was the Confederacy&#8217;s core driver, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. Supporters claim they see the monuments as symbolic tributes to a proud Southern heritage.</p>

<p class="zn-body__paragraph">The issue rose to prominence in 2015, after a&#160;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2015/06/23/us/dylann-roof-photographs/index.html">self-declared white supremacist who posed with the Confederate battle flag</a>&#160;shot and killed nine people at an iconic African-American church in Charleston, South Carolina. Since then, cities including New Orleans and Orlando have moved to take down Confederate monuments in their public areas.</p>
<p class="zn-body__paragraph">The Confederate Memorial in St. Louis&#8217; Forest Park features a 32-foot-high granite shaft with a relief figure of &#8220;The Angel of the Spirit of the Confederacy,&#8221;&#160;<a href="https://forestparkmap.org/confederate-memorial" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Forest Park</a>. The relief, sculpted by George Julian Zolnay, depicts a family and a soldier as he heads off to war.</p>
<p class="zn-body__paragraph">The monument had attracted graffiti and criticism, and the city recently decided to remove it. The Missouri Civil War Museum sued, challenging the piece&#8217;s ownership.</p>
<p class="zn-body__paragraph">The two parties&#160;<a href="https://www.stlouis-mo.gov/government/departments/mayor/news/city-settlement-civil-war-museum.cfm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached a settlement Monday</a>&#160;under which the museum agreed to pay for the monument&#8217;s removal and storage until a new permanent location can be found, the city said.</p>
<p class="zn-body__paragraph">The monument is now in protective storage, Trout said. It will need some preservation work before it can be displayed again. The museum must find a Civil War museum, battlefield, or cemetery outside St. Louis as the monument&#8217;s new home, the city said.</p>

<span class="pb-caption">GFS weather model analysis of maximum temperatures in the Middle East Thursday afternoon. (WeatherBell.com)</span></p><p>A city in southwest Iran posted the country&#8217;s hottest temperature ever recorded Thursday afternoon, and may have tied the world record for the most extreme high temperature.</p><p>Etienne Kapikian, a forecaster at French&#160;meteorological agency MeteoFrance,&#160;<a href="https://twitter.com/EKMeteo/status/880464412611661824">posted to Twitter</a>&#160;that the city of Ahvaz soared to &#8220;53.7&#176;C&#8221; (128.7 degrees Fahrenheit). Kapikian said the temperature is a &#8220;new absolute national record of reliable Iranian heat&#8221; and that it was the hottest temperature ever recorded in June over mainland Asia. Iran&#8217;s previous hottest temperature was 127.4.</p><p><a href="https://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/OIAW/2017/06/29/DailyHistory.html?req_city=Ahvaz&amp;req_statename=Iran&amp;reqdb.zip=00000&amp;reqdb.magic=35&amp;reqdb.wmo=40811&amp;MR=1">Weather Underground&#8217;s website indicates</a>&#160;the temperature in Ahvaz climbed even higher, hitting 129.2 degrees at both 4:51 and 5 p.m. local time.</p><p>

But Burt&#160;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2016/10/25/new-analysis-shreds-claim-that-death-valley-recorded-earths-hottest-temperature-in-1913/?utm_term=.e65461c52d5f">posted a devastating critique</a>&#160;of that measurement in October 2016, concluding it was &#8220;essentially not possible from a meteorological perspective,&#8221; and that the weather observer committed errors.</p><p>For the 129.2 degree-reading Ahvaz posted on Weather Underground to stand and match the highest modern global temperature, it will require review by the World Meteorological Organization.</p><p>The scorching temperature reading was brought about by a dome of heat centered over the Middle East.</p><p>The excessively hot air over Ahvaz, a city of 1.1 million people, felt even more stifling due to high humidity. As the temperature climbed into the high 120s, the dew point, a measure of humidity, peaked in the low 70s; a high level for the desert location (due to air flow from the Persian Gulf, to the south). The heat index &#8212; a measure of how hot it feels factoring in the humidity &#8212; exceeded 140 degrees. This combination of heat and humidity was so extreme that it was&#160;<a href="http://www.nws.noaa.gov/os/heat/heat_index.shtml">beyond levels the heat index was designed to compute</a>.</p><p>In the Persian Gulf city of Jask, Iran, about 800 miles southeast of Ahvaz, the humidity was even more suffocating. The&#160;<a href="https://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/OIZJ/2017/6/28/DailyHistory.html?req_city=Jask&amp;req_state=&amp;req_statename=Iran&amp;reqdb.zip=00000&amp;reqdb.magic=102&amp;reqdb.wmo=40893">dew point on Wednesday morning hit 91.4 degrees</a>. Dew points above 90 are quite rare. The highest dew point ever measured&#160;on Earth is 95 degrees (35 Celsius), set at Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, on July 8, 2003.</p><p>Thursday marked the second straight day of record heat in Ahvaz. On Wednesday,&#160;<a href="https://twitter.com/UNFCCC/status/880182720688685058">it hit 127.2 degrees</a>&#160;(52.9 Celsius), breaking the record for Iran&#8217;s hottest June temperature, only to be exceeded the next day.</p><p>These Iranian temperature extremes come just a month after several locations in the Middle East recorded their hottest May temperatures during another exceptional heat wave.</p><p>On May 28, the western Pakistani town of Turbat hit 128.3 degrees (53.5 Celsius), tying the all-time highest temperature in that country and the world record temperature for May,&#160;<a href="https://www.wunderground.com/cat6/historic-heat-wave-sweeps-asia-middle-east-and-europe">according to Weather Underground meteorologist Jeff Masters</a>.</p><p>At the same time&#160;<a href="https://www.wunderground.com/cat6/historic-heat-wave-sweeps-asia-middle-east-and-europe">Masters reported</a>&#160;that at the military base of Konarak in eastern Iran, the temperature reached 127 degrees, &#8220;destroying the record of the highest temperature ever recorded in May in Iran (50.5&#176;C in Bostan in May 1999).&#8221;</p><p>All of these record-breaking temperatures in recent years, including Thursday&#8217;s reading in Ahvaz as well as those set in Kuwait and Death Valley in 2016 and 2013, represent temperature extremes consistent with what climate scientists expect to see in a warming world.</p><p>The National Academy of Sciences&#160;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2016/03/11/links-between-climate-change-and-extreme-weather-are-increasingly-clear-and-present/?utm_term=.78cb03fb9fd9">published a report in 2016</a>&#160;that said worsening heat waves are among the weather events that can be most easily connected to human-caused climate change.</p><p>A&#160;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2015/10/26/climate-change-could-soon-push-persian-gulf-temperatures-to-lethal-extremes-report-warns/?tid=a_inl&amp;utm_term=.ca1b52beef9b">study published in the journal Nature Climate Change in 2015</a>&#160;cautioned that by the end of the century, due to climate change, temperatures in the Middle East may become too hot for human survival.</p></article><p class="comment-summary-count"><span id="echo_container_1498798353292_65" class="echo_container comment-vars echo-counter format_short comments processed">103</span></p><p class="comment-summary-display"><span class="comment-display">Comments</span></p><ul class="social-tools-bottom inline">

Trump wrote on Twitter last week that China&#8217;s efforts have &#8220;not worked out,&#8221; a declaration that came after the death of American college student Otto Warmbier a few days after returning to the United States following 17 months of detention in North Korea.</p><p>Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the administration was moving to cut off the Bank of Dandong from U.S. financial markets in an effort to block millions of dollars of transactions that funnel money into North Korea for use in its weapons programs.</p><p>Under the sanctions, U.S. citizens also will be generally prohibited from doing business with Sun Wei and Ri Song Hyok, who are accused of establishing and running front companies on behalf of North Korea, and Dalian Global Unity Shipping Co., which is accused of transporting 700,000 tons of freight annually, including coal and steel products, between China and North Korea.</p><p>The administration announced the sanctions just hours before South Korea&#8217;s new president, Moon Jae-in, arrived at the White House for a two-day summit with Trump. Moon campaigned on a platform of greater engagement with Pyongyang, and he has questioned the need for the U.S.-backed THAAD missile defense system that is being installed on the peninsula, which Beijing and Pyongyang have opposed.</p><p>Mnuchin said that the United States is &#8220;in no way targeting China with these actions&#8221; and that U.S. officials &#8220;look forward to continuing to work closely with the government of China to stop the illicit financing in North Korea.&#8221;</p><p>Mnuchin added that this &#8220;very significant action&#8221; sends the message that the United States will follow the money trail leading to North Korea and continue to crack down on those assisting the country.</p><p>&#8220;North Korea&#8217;s provocative, destabilizing and inhumane behavior will not be tolerated,&#8221; Mnuchin said. &#8220;We are committed to targeting North Korea&#8217;s external enablers and maximizing economic pressure on the regime until it ceases its nuclear and ballistic-missile programs.&#8221;</p><p>China has repeatedly made clear it opposes&#160;&#8220;unilateral&#8221; sanctions in addition to those agreed to by the United Nations Security Council. Only last week, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said his country opposed the &#8220;long-arm jurisdiction&#8221; of the United States in this matter.</p><p>&#8220;We have repeatedly stressed this stance in our communication with the United States, and the U.S. side is also clear about it,&#8221; he said during a regular news conference.</p><p>In a separate announcement, administration officials said they had approved an arms package for Taiwan that includes advanced rocket and anti-ship missile systems &#8212; another measure China has repeatedly said that it firmly opposes.</p><p>The package is slightly larger than one that was put on hold at the end of the Obama administration, the officials said, but includes largely the same weapons capabilities.</p><p>The sale is considered relatively modest compared with past arms packages. Still, China views the self-ruled island as part of the country and is likely to oppose any such arms transfers.</p><p>As president-elect, Trump broke with protocol and accepted a congratulatory phone call from Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen in December, angering Xi.</p><p class="pb-subscribe-headline">The story must be told.</p><p class="pb-subscribe-subline">Your subscription supports journalism that matters.</p><p class="pb-subscribe-button"><a class="pb-subscribe-link" href="https://subscribe.washingtonpost.com/acquisition/?promo=display_hp_subsbnr&amp;oscode=RPWH&amp;wpsrc=CM0000449&amp;tid=s_028&amp;destination=http://www.washingtonpost.com/pb/politics/us-announces-sanctions-on-chinese-bank-arms-sales-package-for-taiwan/2017/06/29/c0b66e3c-5d0b-11e7-a9f6-7c3296387341_story.html">Try 1 month for 99&#162;</a></p><p>Lt.

President Trumps latest immature tweets about the two folks who do a radio program called &#8216;The Morning Joe&#8217;. Like most Americans I wish that our President would be banned from Twitter as long as he is still our President because he does tend to say many things that are beneath the dignity of the Office he holds. Mr. Trump in my opinion has done many things to show his lack of knowledge since he has been in Office like not knowing that his favorite former President had died more than 15 years before the Civil War ever started yet was speaking about how he was distraught about that war. He has shown that he knew basically nothing about issues in the Middle East even though he liked to brag how he knew more than our military Generals knew and he has made it clear that he has no need for morning briefings from our Intelligence Agency Heads. Yet to me the most embarrassing thing he has done yet is how he acted at the group photo at the last NATO Summit. When he pushed the Prime Minister out of the front row center spot that he, Mr. Trump wanted to be in, he actually embarrassed me that he was even an American let alone our President.</p><p>Most of us probably remember at least a little bit about the young man in California that was nicknamed the &#8216;affluenza&#8217; brat from a wealthy family who killed 4 people (if I remember correctly) while driving a car while drunk. His lawyer was able to get him off with just probation and no jail time because he had been raised &#8216;to wealthy&#8217; to know right from wrong. He must have had an amazing lawyer and or an incompetent Judge for that verdict to have happened. You would think that a child who is being raised in a home where the family is in need of nothing would be a very grateful young person and not a menace to society but this is not always the reality. There is also another issue here in America where our legal system does not tolerate parents if they in any way discipline their child and the children know this so many act out like pure spoiled brats. Yet when a child acts out at school the courts then blame the parents for doing a bad job of raising their child when in many cases it is the politicians and courts that are to blame and not the parents.</p><p>I have always been a person who has been pleased when someone I know accomplishes something like being able to purchase a new car or is able to buy a new house or even be able to purchase a new living room suite or a new lawn mower. I have always been pleased when a person through their hard work or even good luck is able to become quite wealthy, as long as they did it honestly and decently. When a person obtains their wealth through stealing from other people then I have no respect for them.</p><p>Donald Trump grew up in a very wealthy household and all I can say about that is, good for him. His Dad taught him many things in his childhood years, some good some bad, just like most parents do. Donald Trump was given millions from his Dad when he graduated college and all I can say to that is, good for him. The issue I have with Donald Trump is his pure greed and huge ego as those two issues are an embarrassment to any person whom possesses them. Mr. Trump has bullied and stolen his way into becoming the billionaire that he is on the backs of anyone he felt he could &#8216;get over&#8217; on. He has proven without any doubt that money is his God and when this is so a person tends to act like an immature habitual liar just as he is today and it appears that he has always been. I will end this commentary with this one thought and hope, for our Nations sake I really hope that somehow Mr. Trump would grow up and act like a responsible adult and quit acting like a little spoiled affluenza child in an old man&#8217;s body.</p><p class="robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing"><h3 class="sd-title">Like this post?

  <p>The last plenum took place in April, when Mr Kim called on the US to make a &#8220;bold decision&#8221; while threatening to put his country on a &#8220;new path&#8221;.</p>
    

            
              
              
                
                  











  
  
  
  






                
              
            

            
            
          
            
    <p>&#8220;Presumably we will learn what happens next,&#8221; he tweeted, suggesting important new policy guidance, with the possibility that may involve a return to the byungjin policy of simultaneous military and economic development.</p>

    <p>On Tuesday, North Korea warned <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/north-korea-nuclear-deadline-christmas-gift-us-kim-jong-un-trump-a9230751.html" target="_blank" class="body-link">time was running out before its year-end deadline</a> and threatened an unwelcome Christmas gift for the US, but experts said its decision may have already been made.</p>

    <p>&#8220;The door has closed.

    <p>Mount Paektu is enshrined in North Korean revolutionary myth as the birthplace of Mr Kim&#8217;s father, Kim Jong-il, and a key military base for his grandfather, Kim Il-sung, during the struggle against Japanese colonial rule.</p>
    

            
              
              
                
                  











  
  
  
  






                
              
            

            
            
          
            
    <p>The third-generation leader&#8217;s visit to the peak read like an attempt to burnish his leadership credentials and prepare the country for a policy shift. Previous visits to the mountain have come before major decisions.</p>
    

            
              
              
                
                  











  
  
  
  






                
              
            

            
            
          
            
     

    

            

            
            
          
            
    <p>&#8220;It is of remarkable historic significance that Kim Jong-un, the great leader of our revolution who opens up the period of a great leap for the development of the revolution, personally left the sacred trace in the revolutionary battle sites in [the] Mount Paektu area, the source of the lifeline of the revolution and inexhaustible patriotism, through knee-high virgin snow,&#8221; KCNA reported.</p>

    <p>He said Korean people needed to have a proper understanding of the &#8220;revolutionary traditions&#8221; of Mount Paektu, and claimed this would help them &#8220;demonstrate the country&#8217;s dignity and honour before the world&#8221;.</p>
    

            
              
              
            

            
            
          
            
    <p>This spirit, he added, would enable them to overcome &#8220;the unprecedented blockade and pressure imposed by the imperialists,&#8221; and help them &#8220;get prepared for the harshness and protracted character of our revolution&#8221;.</p>

</span></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">
The debt was only paid back in 2015. Academics at University College London have created a database which tracks the slave-owners who benefited.</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">
Many of them had links to or founded some of the UK's biggest companies including Greene King, P&amp;O, RSA Insurance, Barclays and even the Bank of England.</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">
The sums paid out are not to be sneezed at: Benjamin Greene, founder of the Greene King brewery and pubs chain, was granted nearly &#163;500,000 in today's money when he surrendered rights to three plantations in the West Indies.&#160;</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">
Simon Fraser, one of the founder members of the Lloyd's of London insurance market, was given nearly &#163;400,000 to surrender an estate in Dominica.</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">
The Bank of England apologised for its part in the kidnapping and transportation of thousands of slaves, promising to remove portraits of those involved in this 'unacceptable part of English history'.</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">
Greene King and Lloyd's of London were also quick to apologise for their past role in the slave trade after news of their links were published.&#160;</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">
They have offered to make amends for their slave legacy, saying they will fund projects to help black and other ethnic minorities. They are right to do so, and to have reacted so promptly.</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">
Cynics might say they did so to avoid any damage done to the brand if those same protesters who have been pulling down statues of slave-owners were to boycott their pints or insurance services.&#160;</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">
That view seems unfair. Greene King's boss, Nick Mackenzie, sounded genuinely mortified by the brewery's 'inexcusable' past.&#160;</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">
More pertinently &#8211; and more importantly for future generations &#8211; he said the company's website would be updated to include the history of its slave-owner founder.&#160;</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">
Similar contrition has been shown by Lloyd's of London, and the insurer will also be contributing to charities. But the banks, which also have links to the slave trade &#8211; Lloyds, RBS, HSBC and Barclays &#8211; have yet to comment on the UCL report.</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">
Many will question where this thirst for raking over history will take us. Should every company in Britain, which was in existence at the relevant time, go through its archive to see what lies buried?</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">
There are all manner of skeletons they would prefer did not come rattling out of the cupboard. The fortunes of many of our Victorian ancestors were built on the labour of women and children in the workhouses of the industrial revolution. Should their relatives be compensated?</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">
And what about recent transgressions?</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">
The list of corporates with dodgy not-so-distant pasts is long: clothing giants that make their fortunes from sweat-factories in Asia, banks such as HSBC laundering money for Mexican drug lords, or Standard Chartered channelling funds for Hezbollah.</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">
Should they pay back their victims &#8211; assuming they can be identified?</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">
Will there be boycotts as there was of Barclays in the 1980s over apartheid in South Africa? What about buying oil from rich Middle Eastern states which didn't stop slavery until the 1960s?&#160;</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">
When people drive their Porsche, do they worry about the Nazi past of its founder? These are delicate issues.&#160;</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">
This is not a cop-out but one way for firms to look at the past is to identify whether there are direct victims, or heirs to those victims. If so, make reparations to them.</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">
If Lloyd's and Greene King, now owned by Hong Kong's richest man Li Ka-Shing, want to give something back, that's good.</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">
What is of more importance is that they spend their charity money wisely on those who are truly disadvantaged.&#160;</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">
The cash should go to help those who face barriers to opportunity because of race and because of deprivation. Otherwise, companies should apologise and move on.</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">
Signs of a bounce</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">
The Bank of England has moved quickly to pump an extra &#163;100billion into the economy after April's shocking GDP numbers, the biggest one month drop on record.</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">
Policymakers voted 8-1 to increase the size of the bond-buying programme but also to keep interest rates at a record low of 0.1 per cent.</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">
It would be silly to be too cheerful but the Bank also said the latest demand numbers are not quite as 'negative' as expected.&#160;</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">
Translated into ordinary lingo, that sounds like the Brits have rediscovered shopping again and spending figures for May and June look better than could possibly be hoped for.</p>

</h3>

 Soldiers climbing over their trench on the first day of the Battle of the Somme, 1 July, 1916.
</span></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>
Why hasn&#8217;t Anzackery&#8217;s ever-rising tide washed Frederic Manning and The Middle Parts of Fortune further up the Australian literary shore?</p>
</p><p>
<p>
Every Father&#8217;s Day and every Christmas publishers search, with increasing desperation, for fresh presentations of the Australian Great War experience. On that basis, one might have expected a combat novel lauded by Ernest Hemingway, TS Eliot, Ezra Pound, TE Lawrence and other immortals to exert more of a cultural presence.</p>
</p><p>
<p>
But while Frederic Manning &#8220;revivals&#8221; have been announced ever since the 1960s, the canon invoked during Anzac season still somehow begins and ends with Wilfred Owen, Siegfried Sassoon, Robert Graves and, perhaps, Charles Bean.</p>
</p><p>
<p>
The problem might be traced to Manning&#8217;s marked divergence from the rugged Digger archetype celebrated by Bean and his acolytes.</p>
</p><p>
<p>
The son of a wealthy Sydney financier, Frederic was always delicate and bookish. At the age of just 15, his parents allowed him to depart for England with his much-older tutor, the Reverend Arthur Galton &#8211; a man who&#8217;d once moved in the same Oxford circles as Oscar Wilde and Lord Alfred Douglas. Together, they moved into the tiny village of Lincolnshire, where they maintained an intense (but perhaps non-sexual) relationship that shaped the boy into a scholar-aesthete like his mentor.</p>
<a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uHX1POGoAiQ/Xuut18484lI/AAAAAAAASoo/PQ4DX3PYljQpBGKWSWEdd5mq-l5hU8AywCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/record-australia-great-war-.jpg"><p>
Biographer Verna Coleman describes Manning as &#8220;the Last Exquisite&#8221;, both because of the delicacy of his prose and because of a brittleness that prevented him from capitalising on his early literary success. By 1928, his peers regarded Manning as talented but strangely old-fashioned: a chain-smoking, semi-alcoholic asthmatic with a bad back and poor digestion, more attuned to the aestheticism of the 1890s than contemporary modernism, and congenitally incapable of completing a major work.</p>
 
<p>
But that year the publisher (and fellow veteran) Peter Davies urged Manning to write about his experiences on the Somme &#8211; and locked him in his apartment until he did so. Supposedly, Manning wrote his loosely-fictionalised account entirely without revision, with Davies forestalling procrastination by rushing each chapter from the typewriter straight to print.</p>
 
<p>
The Middle Parts of Fortune appeared anonymously in a volume only available to subscribers, with a bowdlerised edition subsequently released to the public under the title Her Privates We (another reference to the bawdy passage in which Hamlet declares fortune &#8220;a strumpet&#8221;).</p>
 
<p>
The problem was language: rather unexpectedly Manning, the fastidious aesthete, had reproduced the genuine wartime vocabulary instead of the euphemisms to which other (more obviously transgressive) novelists resorted.</p>
 
</a><p>
<a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uHX1POGoAiQ/Xuut18484lI/AAAAAAAASoo/PQ4DX3PYljQpBGKWSWEdd5mq-l5hU8AywCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/record-australia-great-war-.jpg"><span>As a result, today his book cuts through the distancing of time. We&#8217;re accustomed to thinking of our great-grandparents enduring the trenches with Edwardian stoicism. Manning&#8217;s characters, however, respond to gunfire and mud with F and C bombs, just as we would.</span></a></p>
<p>
Yet in other ways The Middle Parts of Fortune also conveys the deep gulf between now and then.</p>
 
<p>
It follows the experiences of a private called Bourne &#8211; an obvious surrogate for Manning &#8211; for a few months on the Somme and Ancre fronts.</p>
 
<p>
Critics have praised the book for celebrating the ordinary soldier, largely because its protagonist stays in the ranks rather than accepting the commission to which his education suits him. Yet Manning portrays Bourne as more misfit than egalitarian, alienated from the English officers as an Australian who didn&#8217;t attend a public school, and separated from the other men by his erudition.</p>
 
<p>
Indeed, isolation defines the war, an experience that, despite moments of camaraderie, every man endures in solitude.</p>
 
<p>
&#8220;One by one,&#8221; Manning writes, &#8220;they realised that each must go alone, and that each of them already was alone with himself, helping the others perhaps, but looking at them with strange eyes, while the world became unreal and empty, and they moved in a mystery, where no help was.&#8221;</p>
 
<blockquote>
   <p>
The highly strung, deeply repressed man [was] always slightly out of kilter with his era</p>
</blockquote>
 
<p>
It&#8217;s that profound atomisation, conveyed in Manning&#8217;s finely wrought prose, that makes the book&#8217;s brief and hallucinatory battle scenes so terrifying, with modern combat a sensory overload inflicted on the individual psyche.</p>
 
<p>
Famously, Wilfred Owen describes his subject as &#8220;the pity of war&#8221;. Manning takes a very different approach.</p>
 
<p>
&#8220;To call [war] a crime against mankind,&#8221; he says in his introduction, &#8220;is to miss at least half its significance; it is also the punishment of a crime.&#8221;</p>
 
<p>
Where militarists like Ernst J&#252;nger show the conflict redeeming men through violence, Manning sees wartime suffering as facilitating a peculiar authenticity, as his characters &#8220;turn [&#8230;] from the wreckage and misery of life to an empty heaven and from an empty heaven to the silence of their own hearts&#8221;.</p>
 
<p>
<a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uHX1POGoAiQ/Xuut18484lI/AAAAAAAASoo/PQ4DX3PYljQpBGKWSWEdd5mq-l5hU8AywCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/record-australia-great-war-.jpg"><span>The book is not, then, in any sense a pacifist or antiwar novel. The critic Arnold Bennett went so far as to describe it as &#8220;inspiring&#8221; because it &#8220;compels in the reader a reluctant belief that war is glorious after all.&#8221; But that&#8217;s not quite right either. After all, Manning describes heroism as &#8220;indistinguishable from despair&#8221;, an assertion that no militarist would make but one that reflects his almost existentialist preoccupation with the individual personality in extremis.</span></a></p>
<a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uHX1POGoAiQ/Xuut18484lI/AAAAAAAASoo/PQ4DX3PYljQpBGKWSWEdd5mq-l5hU8AywCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/record-australia-great-war-.jpg"><p>
We might go so far as to say that Manning&#8217;s war reflected Manning&#8217;s peace. The highly strung, deeply repressed man always slightly out of kilter with his era seems to have experienced the Battle of the Somme as an intensification, almost to the point of liberation, of the isolation he already felt.</p>
 
<p>
The final words of The Middle Parts of Fortune encapsulate the theme of one of the strangest, most compelling books from the Great War.</p>
 
<p>
&#8220;They sat there silently,&#8221; the novel ends, &#8220;each man keeping his own secret.&#8221;</p>

Everywhere, brands, individuals, organisations and institutions are rushing out #BlackLivesMatter solidarity statements. They should.

</p><p>
<p>
The death of George Floyd at the hands of police inspired what is indisputably a mass uprising across modern democracy. The footage provoked human outrage but also existential horror, and with it a powerful &#8211; physical &#8211; instinct to act. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/13/australia-protests-thousands-take-part-in-black-lives-matter-and-pro-refugee-events-amid-health-warnings" target="_blank">March</a>. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2020/jun/17/players-take-a-knee-before-kick-off-as-premier-league-football-returns-video" target="_blank">Kneel</a>.

Do anything you can, immediately, that might &#8211; just might &#8211; help the terrifying violence to stop.</p>
</p><p>
<p>
There are sophisticated considerations being made by <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/16/opinions/gone-with-the-wind-how-to-deal-with-racist-art-yang/index.html" target="_blank">critics and activists</a> about how to frame and manage a vast archive of texts, such as Gone With the Wind, that inherently propagandise racism or anything else straddling the spectrum of dangerous prejudice. Without giving into censorship, it&#8217;s time to redeploy the classification systems we already use for film, television, video games and other cultural products to identify these artefacts of our culture in a context that&#8217;s honest about their nature. Alongside the pre-broadcast information that a film may contain &#8220;adult themes&#8221;, I&#8217;d suggest additional warnings describing &#8220;deeply racist drivel that purports damaging stereotypes, misrepresents history and lies to you about humanity itself&#8221; is long overdue.</p>
<p>
But what to do with the statuary is another question, given that while monuments continue to occupy public space they are not artefacts of a past &#8211; they proclaim the state-sanctioned values of the present. Hence when the allies marched into Berlin in the second world war, no one was defending &#8220;<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-build-upon-our-heritage-not-tear-it-down" target="_blank">heritage</a>&#8217;&#8217; value in keeping <a href="https://www.life.com/history/after-the-fall-photos-of-hitlers-bunker-and-the-ruins-of-berlin/" target="_blank">Nazi eagles flying</a>. One finds it unfathomable to imagine the survivors of Ba&#8217;athist repression comfortable with Saddam Hussein-themed decorations.</p>
 
<p>
I&#8217;ve criticised Australia&#8217;s own monumentalising before, and the enduring supremacies conveyed when women are half of the population <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/06/women-made-of-stone-lets-fix-how-we-memorialise-female-achievement" target="_blank">yet 3% of the statues</a>. Recently, Paul Daley presented a chilling list of local memorials that commemorate massacres of Indigenous Australians and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/postcolonial-blog/2020/jun/10/the-toppling-of-statues-overseas-might-give-australia-pause-to-reconsider-who-we-celebrate" target="_blank">celebrate racists</a>.</p>
 
<p>
Representation matters, and the question demanded by the moment is why there are any Australians out in <a href="https://twitter.com/LatimoreJack/status/1271450765274411009?s=20" target="_blank">self-conscious nationalistic dress-ups</a> &#8220;protecting statues&#8221; of those who don&#8217;t represent the modern Australia that they live in. Dare I suggest that if they wish to celebrate true Australian achievement in statuary, they drop a dollar into the GoFundMe fundraiser for a statue of <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/nova-peris-statues-for-equality" target="_blank">Nova Peris OAM</a>? Not only would they be commemorating the first Indigenous Australian to win Olympic gold &#8211; an athlete who reached Olympic level in two separate sports and a community leader who became a federal senator &#8211; they&#8217;d be making an active contribution to helping Australia&#8217;s public monuments look <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography_of_Australia" target="_blank">a bit more like, you know, Australia.</a></p>

<p>
The time is now not merely to celebrate the real achievements of Australian diversity, but to interrogate how racism flourishes in white Australia because we keep role modelling the examples of white racists.</p>
 
<p>
It&#8217;s 2020, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/postcolonial-blog/2017/aug/25/statues-are-not-history-here-are-six-in-australia-that-need-rethinking" target="_blank">this country yet heaves with memorials to Cook</a>, Macquarie, Batman and Mitchell; men who defined &#8220;civilisation&#8221; to themselves and others by participating in &#8211; let&#8217;s not euphemize this &#8211; land theft and race murder. But it took until 2019 for a statue to be erected to a white Australian whose example represents the far more worthy &#8211; and familiar &#8211; shared Australian values of fairness, solidarity and humility.</p>
 
<p>
By Lakeside Stadium, Melbourne, stands a statue of Peter Norman, the Australian 1968 Olympic 200m silver medallist who stood in solidarity with black American athletes John Carlos and Tommie Smith on their medal dais, wearing an Olympic Project for Human Rights badge as they gave their era-defining black power &#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salute_(2008_film)" target="_blank">salute</a>&#8221;. At a moment of his greatest personal triumph, he ceded his spotlight to a more noble cause &#8211; and was ostracised from the Australian sporting community as a result.</p>
 
<p>
And yet Carlos said of him: &#8220;There&#8217;s no one in the nation of Australia that should be honoured, recognised, appreciated more than Peter Norman for his humanitarian concerns, his character, his strength and his willingness to be a sacrificial lamb for justice.&#8221; Both Smith and Carlos were pallbearers at his funeral.</p>
 
<p>
It&#8217;s conspicuous that Aboriginal artists like Richard Bell <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/australia-culture-blog/2014/feb/21/richard-bell-asylum-seeker-policy-is-a-manifestation-of-australian-racism" target="_blank">have long memorialised Norman</a>. Nova Peris herself says he &#8220;epitomised human decency and his stand for human equality immortalised him with that iconic picture. A stadium named in his honour has my full support.&#8221;</p>
 
<p>
There is a statue to Smith and Carlos&#8217;s salute at San Jose State University, where Norman&#8217;s own space at the dais is left empty. It was his own suggestion to keep the space empty. He wanted visitors to the site to show they would also stand beside them.</p>
 
<p>
In this time where white Australians are grappling with their own role and responsibility in accounting for racial injustice, to learn Norman&#8217;s name and model his behaviour is a critical cultural instruction.</p>

<p>
Once again, physicists have confirmed one of Albert Einstein's core ideas about <a href="https://www.livescience.com/37115-what-is-gravity.html">gravity</a> &#8212; this time with the help of a neutron star flashing across space.</p>
<p>
The new work makes an old idea even more certain: that heavy and light objects fall at the same rate. Einstein wasn't the first person to realize this; there are <a href="https://archive.org/details/lawsofmotionanth0000unse/page/8/mode/2up">contested accounts</a> of Galileo Galilei demonstrating the principle by dropping weights off the Tower of Pisa in the 16th century. And suggestions of the idea appear in the work of the 12th-century philosopher <a href="https://archive.org/details/studiesinabulbar00pine">Abu'l-Barak&#257;t al-Baghd&#257;d&#299;</a>. This concept eventually made its way into <a href="https://www.livescience.com/20296-isaac-newton.html">Isaac Newton</a>'s model of physics, and then Einstein's theory of general <a href="https://www.livescience.com/32216-what-is-relativity.html">relativity</a> as the gravitational "strong equivalence principle" (SEP). This new experiment demonstrates the truth of the SEP, using a falling <a href="https://www.livescience.com/neutron-star.html">neutron star</a>, with more precision than ever.</p>
<p>
The SEP has appeared to be true for a long time. You might have seen this video of Apollo astronauts dropping a feather and a hammer in the vacuum of the moon, showing that they fall at the same rate in lunar gravity.</p>
</p><p>
<p>
But small tests in the relatively weak gravitational fields of <a href="https://www.livescience.com/earth.html">Earth</a>, the moon or the sun don't really put the SEP through its paces, according to Sharon Morsink, an astrophysicist at the University of Alberta in Canada, who wasn't involved in the new study.</p>
<p>
"At some level, the majority of physicists believe that Einstein's theory of gravity, called general relativity, is correct. However, that belief is mainly based on observations of phenomena taking place in regions of space with weak gravity, while Einstein's theory of gravity is meant to explain phenomena taking place near really strong gravitational fields," Morsink told Live Science. "Neutron stars and black holes are the objects that have the strongest known gravitational fields, so any test of gravity that involves these objects really test the heart of Einstein's gravity theory."</p>
<p>
Neutron stars are the collapsed cores of dead stars. Super dense, but not dense enough to form black holes, they can pack masses greater than that of our sun into whirling spheres just a few miles wide.</p>
<p>
The researchers focused on a type of neutron star called a pulsar, which from Earth's perspective seems to flash as it spins. That flashing is a result of a bright spot on the star's surface whirling in and out of view, 366 times per second. This spinning is regular enough to keep time by.</p>
<p>

<p>
This pulsar, known as J0337+1715, is special even among pulsars: It's locked in a tight binary orbit with a white dwarf star. The two stars orbit each other as they circle a third star, also a white dwarf, just like Earth and the moon do as they circle the sun.</p>
<p>
(Researchers have already shown that the SEP is true for orbits like this in our solar system: Earth and the moon are affected to exactly the same degree by the sun's gravity, measurements suggest.)</p>
<p>
The precise timekeeping of J0337+1715, combined with its relationship to those two gravity fields created by the two white dwarf stars, offers astronomers a unique opportunity to test the principle.</p>
<p>
The pulsar is much heavier than the other two stars in the system. But the pulsar still falls toward each of them a little bit as they fall toward the pulsar's larger mass. (The same thing happens with you and Earth. When you jump, you fall back toward the planet very quickly. But the planet falls toward you as well &#8212; very slowly, due to your own low gravity, but at the exact same rate as a feather or a hammer would if you ignore air resistance.) And because J0337+1715 is such a precise timekeeper, astronomers on Earth can track how the gravitational fields of the two stars affect the pulsar's period.</p>
<p>
To do so, the astronomers carefully timed the arrival of light from J0337+1715 using large radio telescopes, in particular the Nan&#231;ay Radio Observatory in France. As the star moved around each of its neighbors &#8212; one in a quick little orbit and one in a longer, slower orbit &#8212; the pulsar got closer and farther from Earth. As the neutron star moved farther away from Earth, the light from its pulses had to travel longer distances to reach the telescope. So, to a tiny degree, the gaps between the pulses seemed to get longer.</p>
<p>
As the pulsar swung back toward Earth, the gaps between the pulses got shorter. That allowed physicists to build a robust model of the neutron star's movement through space, explaining precisely how it interacted with the gravity fields of its neighbors. Their work built on a technique used in an earlier paper, published in the journal <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0265-1/">Nature</a> in 2018, to study the same system.</p>
<p>
The new paper, published online June 10 in the journal <a href="https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2020/06/aa38104-20/aa38104-20.html">Astronomy and Astrophysics</a>, showed that the objects in this system behaved as Einstein's theory predicts &#8212; or at least didn't differ from Einstein's predictions by more than 1.8 parts per million. That's the absolute limit of the precision of their telescope data analysis. They reported 95% confidence in their findings.</p>
<p>
Morsink, who uses X-ray data to study the mass, widths, and surface patterns of neutron stars, said that this confirmation isn't surprising, but it is important for her research.</p>
<p>
"In that work, we have to assume that Einstein's theory of gravity is correct, since the data analysis is already very complex," Morsink told Live Science in an in an email. "So tests of Einstein's gravity using neutron stars really make me feel better about our assumption that Einstein's theory describes the gravity of a neutron star correctly!"</p>
</p><p>
<p>
Without understanding the SEP, Einstein would never have been able to develop his ideas of relativity. In an insight he described as "the most fortunate thought in my life," he recognized that objects in free fall don't feel the gravitational fields tugging on them.</p>
<p>
(This is why astronauts in orbit around the Earth float. In constant free fall, they don't experience the gravitational field that holds them in orbit. Without windows, they wouldn't know Earth was there at all.)</p>
<p>
Most of Einstein's key insights about the universe begin with the universality of free fall. So, in this way, the cornerstone of general relativity has been made that much stronger.</p>

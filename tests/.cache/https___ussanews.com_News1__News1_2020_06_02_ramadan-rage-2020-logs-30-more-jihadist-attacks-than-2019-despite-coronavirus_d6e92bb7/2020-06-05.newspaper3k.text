Ramadan Rage: 2020 Logs 30% More Jihadist Attacks than 2019 Despite Coronavirus

By: Edwin Mora, Breitbart, May 31, 2020:

Jihadis were more prolific during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan this year despite the Chinese coronavirus pandemic and the associated lockdowns, carrying out at least 242 attacks, about 30 percent more than the 187 last year, data compiled by Breitbart News reveals.

Islamic terrorists carried out an average of about eight attacks per day this year, compared to an average of six daily assaults in 2019. Three weeks into Ramadan this year, it appeared the number of deaths and injuries would exceed those from the same period last year, but the attacks became less lethal towards the end.

Breitbart News’ tally covers 30 days, starting from Ramadan’s first full day on April 24 through May 23.

Jihadis killed at least 867 people and injured 813 others across 20 countries during the holy month this year.

On average, jihadis killed 29 people and maimed 27 others each day during Ramadan this year.

Last year, however, the holy month was slightly bloodier, resulting in at least 911 fatalities (30 per day) and 1,006 injuries (34 per day).

The 1,680 casualties this year represent a drop of over ten percent from the 1,917 last year.

Jihadis have been responsible for nearly 10,000 casualties during the past five Ramadans combined: 2020 (867 killed; 813 wounded), 2019 (911 killed; 1,006 injured), 2018 (841 killed; 1,014 wounded), 2017 (1,639 killed; 1,704 wounded), and 2016 (421 killed; 729 wounded).

The Afghan Taliban remains the deadliest (423 deaths; 379 injuries) group during Ramadan this year, again followed by the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) and its affiliates (228 killed; 258 wounded).

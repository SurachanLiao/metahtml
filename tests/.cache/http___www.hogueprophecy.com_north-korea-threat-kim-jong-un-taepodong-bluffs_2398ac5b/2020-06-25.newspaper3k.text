Prophecy News Flash: (11 March 2013)

Friends,

What did Dennis Rodman say to Kim Jong Un??

The bleached afro, multi-tatooed and lip-ear and nosed ringed-punctured, eccentric athlete, former player for the legendary Chicago Bulls professional team that included Michael Jordan. There was “the worm” as his teammates affectionately called, sitting in Pyongyang watching a basketball game the other week along side his host, the socialist premier of chubbiness, the young “Un” and late-twenty something baby-faced kid-dictator Kim Jong Un. He is the third Doctor Evil impersonator in line of socialist suzerainty of North Korea after his grandfather Kim Il Sung and father Kim Jong Il went off to the sweet oblivion of atheist paradise. The Worm sat next to Dr. Evil young Un looking like he had stepped out of an Edgar Rice Burroughs pulp fiction novel about John Carter of Mars. As Auntie Entity said to Mad Max, “What a pair!”

The the US State Department did not want to touch that picture. They did not want to know where it had been afterwards or what Rodman would have said to the new North Korean leader as he is taking his first fat baby steps as an autocrat. The State Department made it quite clear in official channels to Pyongyang that the Worm was not a diplomatic Ping-Pong-player-ploy-to-China moment to melt the ice between North Korea and the US like happened in the 1970s that paved the way for Nixon to come to China to rock the world and roll with Papa-Oooh-Mao-Mao Zedong.

Rodman was the wrong man to play even Forest Gump in a fictional attempt to ping pong Pyongyang for a new US-North Korea easing of tensions. Perhaps Rodman was there to help promote Donald Trump’s new reality show retread of The Apprentice – because soon as Rodman came back to the US of A, the Donald’s A team of bigger than life – and smaller on subtle, over the top – Apprentice Celebrity All Stars, including the Worm, launched Episode One of the much hyped and Donald Trumped-up reality show.

After the error errant of dippy cartoon diplomacy “Wormed” his way home, Little Kim did the “Un” thinkable. The worm turned and Dennis was not to blame but a new UN regimen of sanctions passed a short time later punishing the North Korean regime for test-firing a sizable nuclear weapon in an underground test. The Korean War which had been put on hold since an armistice was signed in 1953 by North Korea with the Republic of South Korea and US forces dominating the UN military “police action” was now suspended by Kim Jong Un-equivocally.

Before now, the UN sanctions did more to hurt millions of marginally employed, hungry and even starving North Koreans. The new sanctions one cut to the marrow of the illicit North Korean commie-mafia’s pipeline to smuggle money in and out of the Soviet-style hermit anachronistic kingdom via diplomatic immune sources, literally by the North Korean diplomatic mule carrying suitcases full of cash, luxury goods to the Young-Un. His father, Kim John Il would turn in his grave if the $300-dollar-bottle Hennessey cognac were now blocked from entry.

Then, add to the ghost of Kim Jong “Il”-sult to injury, North Korea’s last political friend in the world, The People’s Republic of China, the same regime that had in 1950 sent and saw mostly consumed a million Red Chinese soldiers. The regime that saved grandfather Kim Il Sung’s “Il”-conceived invasion of South Korea, actually signed the UN Security Council’s resolution of new sanctions.

That is how fed up Beijing is with Pyongyang’s No-Dong Scud missile prongs, test nuke bombing and Taepodonging ICBM missile threats directed recently by Kim Jong Un-abashedly at the United States.

This is a significant escalation in an old ruse of North Korean leaders, especially since the fall of their Soviet Union patron at the end of the Cold War in the early 1990s. Each Kim has played the “I’ll jump and take the Korean Peninsula with me!” bluff. This attempt to wave missile-tipped Armageddon, chased with North Korean television images of serried ranks of goose stepping soldiers, rows of TV prop missiles, North Korean army units, sometimes with halos around their helmeted noggins charging hither and thither, usually is done to blackmail concession from the US and China that keep the tenuous autocratic regime afloat. Usually when one Kim dies from Jong or Sung-“Il”ness, there is a period a few years before and after the power shift to a new heir where the heir apparent has to create military incidents on the DMZ with South Korea to show the new leader has the ballistic balls. It also happens that after the new Kim “Chee” of power is crowned with incessant military parades along sterile Pyongyang boulevards and skyline with grotesque heroic statues that some incident taking it too the brink of a suicidal jump into full-scale war is threatened. Yet never has a new Kim entertained the Un-thinkable rejection of what has been a relatively peaceful and stabilized six decades of a North Korean-UN armistice.

The usual Pyongyang threat to open the war again has hitherto not happened until now. Moreover, Kim Jong Un threatens UN and US in particular with test firing his Taepodong 2 missile at US territory adding that soon he will top it with a nuclear warhead in a preemptive nuclear attack!

I have been writing for a number of years here at Hogueprophecy about this bluff of national and regional abyss jumping, (See North Korea, Kim Jong Il and Kim Jong Un). I predicted that one day the kooky succession of Kims will cry “I’m going to jump!” one too many times to the point that China will step back and hold its head in its hands and America will reply in so many words and actions, “Go ahead, jump!”

Then the jig, the jive and this Jerk-brinksmanship ploy will be up and Kim Jong Un-redeemable, after which we will see the beginning of the implosion of the North Korean regime.

This article is posted on the day South Korean and US forces practice the long planned military maneuvers that North Korea has been aware would happen for over a month. Little kid Kim threatens to leave the 60-year armistice agreement if the drills go forward. A number of my readers in South Korea are writing in about it.

STEVEN

I live in South Korea outside of Seoul, about 20 miles or so from the North Korean border. I wanted to see if you think that North Korea and South Korea will end up in another Korean War. My wife, who happens to be Korean, thinks nothing will happen and that she has been living here all her life. I tend to disagree. This new president has more guts than the last and already stated that she would attack the North Korean leadership if North Korea decided to attack again like the shelling 2 years ago. Thank you and I hope to hear from you.

HOGUE

The new South Korean President Park Geun-hye is finally some one who looks at decades of threats to “jump” by North Korea as worthy of saying, at last, “OK, Jump!” Moreover, she is counter-threatening that if there is another North Korean incident during her presidency she will immediately strike back militarily at the North Korean leadership. This former daughter of fascist South Korean dictator Park Chung-hee is no shrinking violet and she seems to know how to deal with a group of bullies. My father in the Depression years did a lot of street fighting and eventually was an Army Air Force boxer. He used to tell me, “Always punch out at the loud mouth leading the gang first.”

Park’s will “park” a missile right down the mouth of the young Un. Decapitation of the North Korean regime will hurt it the most..

Now, when my dad learned his fisticuff skills in Depression Era Watts, Los Angeles, gangs settled their disputes with their fists. The escalation to knives, hand guns and now semi-automatic rifles makes his “hit the bully mouth first” a simplistic and anachronistic solution. It is a whole other and unpredictable matter when rather than punching a loudmouth you blow off the head and hope the body of the regime will then fall.

One way or another, this bluff of the North Koreans is coming to a head this year. Whether it leads to a resumption of the Korean War bloodbath or cuts the head off the dragon leaving the North Korean regime dying with a lifeless nerve twitching allowing for a reunification ot the Koreas Kim Jong Un’s regime has escalated its bluff game to the limits of suspended belief.

This is one of many subjects addressed in detail in Predictions for 2013, which is scheduled for release around Easter 2013.

<p>Pyongyang erupts following reports circulating in Chinese media</p>

<p>NKNews.org</p>

<p>In the wake of North Korean state media Thursday issuing vitriolic objections of the &#8220;sordid hackwork of rubbish media&#8221; who alleged their young dictator underwent plastic surgery to look like his grandfather, Chinese government censors have ordered Chinese media to &#8220;not report, comment on, or redistribute stories about the personal lives of North Korean leaders (such as face-lifts).&#8221;</p>
<p>North Korea erupted after months of silence over repeated news reports that Kim Jong Un had undergone plastic surgery to look like his grandfather Kim Il Sung, with official media denouncing &#8220;sordid&#8221; and &#8220;false reports&#8230; released by enemies&#8230; which the party, state, army and people can never tolerate.&#8221;</p>
<p>But what seemed to set Pyongyang off in a particularly virulent tizzy was not months of speculative South Korean rumor suggesting the young Kim had undergone plastic surgery, but rather a Chinese report posted last week by Shenzhen TV, which cited a diplomatic source who had spoken to a North Korean official while on a private visit to Pyongyang&#160;and confirmed the plastic surgery&#160;rumors.</p>
<p>KCNA referenced the Chinese report today, &#8220;Those hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership of the nation should not expect any mercy or leniency.&#8221; And reacting to a diplomatic demarche from Pyongyang to Beijing, China&#8217;s central propaganda authorities subsequently issued a directive to their journalists on January 24 reading:</p>
<blockquote><p>Central Propaganda Department: Strictly observe propaganda and reporting regulations concerning foreign affairs. Do not report, comment on, or redistribute stories about the personal lives of North Korean leaders (such as face-lifts).</p></blockquote>
<p>The previous day, on January 23, the provincial government state censors of Guangdong province issued another directive saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>Guangdong Propaganda Department: North Korea objects to Shenzhen Satellite TV&#8217;s report that Kim Jong-un had a face-lift. Do not report this incident, including Xinhua&#8217;s clarification. (January 23, 2013)</p></blockquote>
<p>What was particularly noteworthy was that the Chinese censors had specifically ordered their media to censor their country&#8217;s own state media report from Xinhua in a bid to prevent Chinese citizens from reading their own governments official propaganda, which had in this case been written for consumption by a foreign audience.</p>
<p>It is not unusual for both North Korean and Chinese state media to issue reports only in foreign languages and not in native Korean or Chinese, targeting and limiting the audience who is able to access it.</p>
<p>The January 24 Chinese censor&#8217;s directive reference to &#8220;Strictly observe propaganda and reporting regulations concerning foreign affairs&#8221; comes on the same day that Pyongyang released a blistering rejection of a new UN Security Council resolution imposing sanctions and condemning the north for its December rocket launch.</p>
<p>That statement issued today by the supreme power body of the regime, the National Defense Commission (NDC), vowed that North Korea would launch &#160;&#8220;a variety of satellites and long-range rockets which will be launched&#8230;one after another and a nuclear test of higher level&#8221; in an &#8220;upcoming all-out action.&#8221; The NDC went on to dismiss &#8220;all the illegal resolutions adopted by the &#8220;United Nations Security Council.</p>
<p>The NDC statement is significant as is targets Beijing, as much as the U.S. or ROK.</p>
<p>&#8220;The keynote of the resolution was worked out through backstage dealing with the U.S. as a main player and it was adopted at the UNSC with blind hand-raising by its member nations,&#8221; said KCNA in a clear reference to Pyongyang&#8217;s only significant ally, Beijing. &#160;&#8220;This shows, at the same time, that those big countries, which are obliged to take the lead in building a fair world order, are abandoning without hesitation even elementary principle, under the influence of the U.S. arbitrary and high-handed practices, failing to come to their senses.&#8221;</p>
<p>Regarding the report on Kim Jong Un&#8217;s plastic surgery, apparently Pyongyang communicated their grievances to Beijing and China&#8217;s ruling party instructed the official party media organ, Xinhua, to debunk the stories. &#160;As such, this Tuesday Xinhua issued a report that cited two of its correspondents in Pyongyang who&#160;denied the plastic surgery rumors.</p>
<p>The rumours of Kim Jong Un having a&#160;face lift&#160;have been fed by Pyongyang&#8217;s propaganda apparatus for months who have carefully crafted a meticulous written and pictorial narrative trying to evoke similarities between Kim Jong Un and his grandfather, including through his dress, haircut, gestures and public appearances.</p>
<p>Following the new censorship directive, Xinhua said that &#8220;there have been no news reports in North Korea about Kim Jong Un&#8217;s plastic surgery&#8221; and that there was &#8220;nothing suspicious&#8221; about Kim resembling his grandfather since they carry the same genes. While Kim tries to dress, walk and smile like his grandfather, together this just aims to give the impression that he &#8220;holds the people dear,&#8221; Xinhua reported.</p>
<p>The official Chinese censorship directives were first reported by China Digital Times, a Berkeley California based website that monitors Chinese censorship of news reports. &#8220;Chinese state media does make a distinction for news coverage intended for domestic consumption,&#8221; said Anne Henochowicz, translation coordinator for China Digital Times. Chinese journalists and bloggers often refer to these official censorship instructions as &#8220;Directives from the Ministry of Truth.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Chinese censorship comes at a particularly sensitive time due to internal Chinese press freedom issues and relations between Pyongyang and Beijing.</p>
<p>The order by Beijing to all media and bloggers to &#8220;refrain from writing on the personal lives of North Korean leaders&#8221; also came just two days after Beijing took an unusually adversarial position against Pyongyang by signing the unanimous United Nations Security Council resolution that imposed new sanctions on North Korea for their December launch of a long range ballistic rocket.</p>
<p>Aside from the UNSC resolution, Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi said China does not support North Korea&#8217;s nuclear weapons program at a meeting with a delegation sent by South Korea&#8217;s President-elect to Beijing. &#8220;I believe South Korea under Park&#8217;s leadership will achieve its growth targets of the new era,&#8221; Yang was quoted by the official South Korean news agency, Yonhap, as saying during a meeting with the delegation. &#8220;South Korea is very important to China, and our strategic relations will develop into a new stage and take a big leap down the road.&#8221;</p>

<p>China issues Censorship Order on North Korea Reporting After Pyongyang Erupts at &#8220;sordid hackwork by rubbish media&#8221;</p>
<p>Chinese Official Directive Orders Press &#8220;not report, comment on, or redistribute stories about the personal lives of North Korean leaders (such as face-lifts)&#8221;</p>

<p>In the wake of North Korean state media issuing Thursday particularly vitriolic objections of the &#8220;sordid hackwork of rubbish media&#8221; who have alleged their young dictator has undergone plastic surgery to look like his grandfather, Chinese government censors have ordered Chinese media to &#8220;not report, comment on, or redistribute stories about the personal lives of North Korean leaders (such as face-lifts).&#8221;</p>
<p>North Korea has erupted after months of silence over repeated news reports that Kim Jong-Un had plastic surgery to look like his grandfather, Kim Il Sung, with official media denouncing &#8221;sordid&#8221; and &#8220;false reports&#8230; released by enemies is a hideous criminal act which the party, state, army and people can never tolerate,&#8221; said Korean Central News Agency on Wednesday, calling it &#8220;sordid hackwork by rubbish media.&#8221;</p>
<p>But what seemed to set Pyongyang off in a particularly virulent tizzy was not months of speculative South Korean news reports suggesting the young Kim had undergone plastic surgery, but rather a Chinese report last week by China&#8217;s Shenzhen TV who cited a diplomatic source who, on a private visit to Pyongyang, had spoken to a North Korean official who confirmed the plastic surgery rumours. KCNA referenced the Chinese report,</p>
<p>&#8220;Those hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership of the nation should not expect any mercy or leniency,&#8221; said the KCNA.</p>
<p>Apparently reacting to a diplomatic demarche from Pyongyang to Beijing, the Beijing central authorities issued a directive January 24 reading: &#8220;Central Propaganda Department: Strictly observe propaganda and reporting regulations concerning foreign affairs. Do not report, comment on, or redistribute stories about the personal lives of North Korean leaders (such as face-lifts).&#8221;</p>

<p>The previous day, on January 23, the provincial government state censors of Guangdong province issued another directive saying: &#8220;Guangdong Propaganda Department: North Korea objects to Shenzhen Satellite TV&#8217;s report that Kim Jong-un had a face-lift. Do not report this incident, including Xinhua&#8217;s clarification. (January 23, 2013)&#8221; &#24191;&#19996;&#30465;&#22996;&#23459;&#20256;&#37096;&#65306;&#28145;&#22323;&#21355;&#35270;&#25253;&#36947;&#20102;&#37329;&#27491;&#24681;&#25972;&#23481;&#24341;&#21457;&#20102;&#26397;&#40092;&#22806;&#20132;&#25239;&#35758;&#65292;&#27492;&#20107;&#19981;&#35201;&#25253;&#36947;&#65292;&#21253;&#25324;&#26032;&#21326;&#31038;&#30340;&#28548;&#28165;&#20063;&#19981;&#35201;&#25253;&#36947;&#12290;</p>
<p>What was particularly noteworthy was Chinese censors had specifically ordered Chinese media to censor China&#8217;s own state media report from Xinhua, in a bid to prevent Chinese citizens from reading their own governments official propaganda, which in this case was written for consumption by a foreign audience.</p>
<p>It is not unusual for both North Korean and Chinese state media to issue reports only in foreign languages and not in native Korean or Chinese, targeting and limiting the audience who is able to access it.</p>
<p>Apparently, Pyongyang issued a demarche to Beijing, and the Chinese ruling party instructed the official Chinese party media organ, Xinhua, to debunk the stories, and Xinhua issued a report Tuesday, citing two of its correspondents in Pyongyang who&#160;denying the plastic surgery rumours. Xinhua had its correspondents in Seoul and Pyongyang write a detailed background of the story which has circulated in the often gossip fueled and unverifiable rumor filled South Korean media, concluding that media stories that Kim Jong-un has had plastic surgery six times to resemble his grandfather. The story has been reported for months in South Korean, Japanese, and other foreign media, but was reported recently on a Chinese news website, and then reported as fact on Shenzhen Satellite TV in recent days.</p>
<p>The official Chinese censorship directives were first reported by Chinese Digital Times, a Berkeley California based website that monitors Chinese censorship of news reports and issues that strictly control what Chinese media can report on and filter news or online discussion on issues the ruling Chinese party deems sensitive. &#8220;Chinese state media does make a distinction for news coverage intended for domestic consumption,&#8221; said Anne Henochowicz, translation coordinator for China Digital Times. &#8220;This Xinhua report was likely made for foreign consumption, including Taiwan and Hong Kong, which wold explain why it was written in both Chinese and English.&#8217;</p>
<p>Chinese journalists and bloggers often refer to these official censorship instructions as &#8220;Directives from the Ministry of Truth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Those hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership of the nation should not expect any mercy or leniency,&#8221; official North Korean central News Agency said Thursday. &#8220;Time will clearly show what dear price the human scum and media in the service of traitors of South Korea, slaves of capital, will have to pay,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Time will clearly show what dear price the human scum and media in the service of traitors of South Korea, slaves of capital, will have to pay,&#8221; the Korean Central news Agency said Wednesday.</p>
<p>The rumours of Kim Jong-un having a facelift have been fed by Pyongyang&#8217;s propaganda apparatus who for months carefully crafted a meticulous written and pictorial narrative trying to evoke similarities between Kim Jong-Un and his grandfather, including through his dress, haircut, gestures and public appearances.</p>
<p>Xinhua cited as evidence of the stories falsehood that &#8220;There have been no news reports in North Korea about Kim Jong-un&#8217;s plastic surgery&#8221; and that there was &#8220;nothing suspicious&#8221; about Kim resembling his grandfather since they carry same genes.</p>
<p>While Kim tries to dress, walk and smile like his grandfather, this just aims to give the impression that he &#8220;holds the people dear,&#8221; Xinhua said.</p>
<p>The Chinese censorship comes at a particularly sensitive time for both internal Chinese press freedom issues and relations between Pyongyang and Beijing.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Chinese Journalists in the Southern province of XXX publicly refused to follow orders to censor reports on corruption, with the staff of the Southern Weekly holding public demonstrations.</p>
<p>On January 7, state censors from the central Beijing government&#8220;Ministry of Truth&#8221; issued the following: &#8220;Central Propaganda Department: Urgent Notice Concerning the Southern Weekly New Year&#8217;s Message Publication Incident: Responsible Party committees and media at all levels must be clear on three points related to this matter: (1) Party control of the media is an unwavering basic principle; (2) This mishap at Southern Weekly has nothing to do with Guangdong Propaganda Department Head Tuo Zhen; (3) External hostile forces are involved in the development of the situation. Every responsible work unit must demand that its department&#8217;s editors, reporters, and staff discontinue voicing their support for Southern Weekly online. Starting tomorrow, media and websites in all locales must prominently republish the Global Times editorial &#8220;Southern Weekly&#8217;s &#8216;Message to Readers&#8217; Is Food for Thought Indeed.&#8221; (January 7, 2013).&#8221;&#20013;&#23459;&#37096;&#65306;&#20851;&#20110;&#21335;&#26041;&#21608;&#26411;&#26032;&#24180;&#29486;&#36766;&#20986;&#29256;&#20107;&#20214;&#30340;&#32039;&#24613;&#36890;&#30693;&#65292;&#21508;&#32423;&#20027;&#31649;&#20826;&#22996;&#21644;&#23186;&#20307;&#65292;&#23545;&#20110;&#27492;&#27425;&#20107;&#20214;&#65292;&#24517;&#39035;&#26126;&#30830;&#20197;&#19979;&#19977;&#28857;&#65306;&#19968;&#65292;&#20826;&#31649;&#23186;&#20307;&#26159;&#19981;&#21487;&#21160;&#25671;&#30340;&#22522;&#26412;&#21407;&#21017;&#65307;&#20108;&#65292; &#21335;&#26041;&#21608;&#26411;&#27492;&#27425;&#20986;&#29256;&#20107;&#25925;&#19982;&#24191;&#19996;&#30465;&#22996;&#23459;&#20256;&#37096;&#38271;&#24249;&#38663;&#21516;&#24535;&#26080;&#20851;&#65307;&#19977;&#65292;&#27492;&#20107;&#30340;&#21457;&#23637;&#26377;&#22659;&#22806;&#25932;&#23545;&#21183;&#21147;&#20171;&#20837;&#12290;&#21508;&#20027;&#31649;&#21333;&#20301;&#24517;&#39035;&#20005;&#26684;&#35201;&#27714;&#20854;&#37096;&#38376;&#30340;&#32534;&#36753;&#65292;&#35760;&#32773;&#21644;&#21592;&#24037;&#19981;&#24471;&#32487;&#32493;&#22312;&#32593; &#32476;&#19978;&#21457;&#35328;&#25903;&#25345;&#21335;&#26041;&#21608;&#26411;&#12290;&#21508;&#22320;&#23186;&#20307;&#12289;&#32593;&#31449;&#26126;&#22825;&#36215;&#20197;&#26174;&#33879;&#29256;&#38754;&#36716;&#21457;&#12298;&#29615;&#29699;&#26102;&#25253;&#12299;&#30340;&#31038;&#35780;&#12298;&#21335;&#26041;&#21608;&#26411;&#8220;&#33268;&#35835;&#32773;&#8221;&#23454;&#22312;&#20196;&#20154;&#28145;&#24605;&#12299;&#12290;</p>
<p>The order by Beijing to all media and bloggers to &#8216;refrain from writing on the personal lives of North Korean leaders&#8221; comes two days after Beijing on Tuesday took an unusually adversarial position against Pyongyang in signing a unanimous United Nations Security Council resolution that imposed new sanctions on North Korea for their December launch of a long range ballistic rocket, which most analysts say was testing the rocket delivery system for nuclear warheads designed to reach the United States.</p>
<p>&#8220;China maintains that the Security Council&#8217;s reaction should be prudent and moderate, and that it should work for the peace and stability of the (Korean) Peninsula and avoid the progressive escalation of tensions,&#8221; foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei said at a daily press briefing on Monday.</p>
<p>The U.S. and China hashed out a carefully worded agreement in private negotiations over the last month to win Beijing&#8217;s approval of the UN sanctions. &#8220;China and the US have many differences in principles over dealing with the satellite launch. That&#8217;s why the <a title="Posts tagged with UN" href="http://chinadigitaltimes.net/china/un/">UN</a> negotiations have lasted for more than a month,&#8221;Shi Yuanhua, a researcher on Korean studies at the Shanghai-based Fudan University, was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>Diplomats say the <a title="Posts tagged with U.S." href="http://chinadigitaltimes.net/china/us/">U.S.</a> circulated a draft resolution to the 15-member U.N. Security Council condemning the launch and expand existing sanctions.</p>
<p>Aside from the UNSC resolution, Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi said China does not support North Korea&#8217;s nuclear weapons program at a meeting with a delegation sent by South Korea&#8217;s President-elect to Beijing. &#8220;I believe South Korea under Park&#8217;s leadership will achieve its growth targets of the new era,&#8221; Yang was quoted by the official South Korean news agency, Yonhap, as saying during a meeting with the delegation. &#8220;South Korea is very important to China, and our strategic relations will develop into a new stage and take a big leap down the road.&#8221;</p>
<p>North Korean state media just released a statement by the supreme power body of the regime, the National Defense Commission Thursday January 24 vowing &#8220; a variety of satellites and long-range rockets which will be launched by the DPRK one after another and a nuclear test of higher level&#8221; in an &#8220;upcoming all-out action.&#8221; The NDC dismissed &#8220;all the illegal resolutions adopted by the &#8220;United Nations Security Council.</p>
<p>The NDC built on Wednesday January 23 KCNA official reaction to the UN security Council condemnation and sanctions taken after last month&#8217;s launch of a ballistic missile rocket designed as a delivery system for nuclear weapons, &#8220;that only when the denuclearization of the world is realized on a perfect and preferential basis including the denuclearization of the U.S., will it be possible to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula and ensure peace and security of the DPRK.&#8221;</p>
<p>The NDC statement is significant as is targets Beijing, as much as the US or ROK.</p>
<p>The National Defense Commission statement, according to KCNA said : &#8220;Our successful launch of satellite Kwangmyongsong 3-2 was a great jubilee in the history of the nation as it placed the nation&#8217;s dignity and honor on the highest plane and a spectacular success made in the efforts to develop space for peaceful purposes recognized by the world.</p>
<p>This being a hard reality, the U.S. at the outset of the year termed our satellite launch &#8220;long-range missile launch,&#8221; &#8220;wanton violation&#8221; of the UN resolutions and &#8220;blatant challenge&#8221; to world peace and security in a bid to build up public opinion on this. Finally, it prodded the UNSC into cooking up a new resolution on tightening sanctions against the DPRK.</p>
<p>The keynote of the resolution was worked out through backstage dealing with the U.S. as a main player and it was adopted at the UNSC with blind hand-raising by its member nations. This goes to clearly prove that the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK has entered a new dangerous phase. 
This shows, at the same time, that those big countries, which are obliged to take the lead in building a fair world order, are abandoning without hesitation even elementary principle, under the influence of the U.S. arbitrary and high-handed practices, failing to come to their senses.</p>
<p>Moreover, this also indicates that the UNSC, which should regard it as its mission to guarantee sovereign rights and security of its member nations, has turned into a defunct marionette international body on which no hope can be pinned.</p>
<p>The DPRK National Defence Commission solemnly declares as follows as regards the adoption of the entirely unreasonable resolution on the DPRK:</p>
<p>We totally reject all the illegal resolutions on the DPRK adopted by the UNSC.</p>
<p>We have never recognized all forms of base resolutions tightening sanctions cooked up by the hostile forces to encroach upon the DPRK&#8217;s sovereignty.</p>
<p>Sovereignty is what keeps a country and nation alive.</p>
<p>The country and the nation without sovereignty are more dead than alive.</p>
<p>The U.S. should clearly know that the times have changed and so have the army and the people of the DPRK.</p>
<ol>
<li>Along with the nationwide efforts to defend the sovereignty, the DPRK will continue launching peaceful satellites to outer space one after another. 
2. As the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK has entered more dangerous phase, overall efforts should be directed to denuclearizing big powers including the U.S. rather than the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. 
The army and people of the DPRK drew a final conclusion that only when the denuclearization of the world is realized on a perfect and preferential basis including the denuclearization of the U.S., will it be possible to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula and ensure peace and security of the DPRK. 
&#8220;Under this situation the DPRK can not but declare that there will no longer exist the six-party talks and the September 19 joint statement.&#8221; 
No dialogue on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula will be possible in the future even though there may be dialogues and negotiations on ensuring peace and security in the region including the Korean Peninsula. 
3. We will launch an all-out action to foil the hostile policy toward the DPRK being pursued by the U.S. and those dishonest forces following the U.S., and safeguard the sovereignty of the country and the nation. 
The UN Security Council resolution on expanding sanctions against the DPRK, which was adopted on the initiative of the U.S., represents the most dangerous phase of the hostile policy toward the DPRK.</li>

<p>Under the prevailing situation, the army and people of the DPRK will turn out in an all-out action to defend its sovereignty which is more precious than their own lives and frustrate the moves of the U.S. and its allies to isolate and stifle the DPRK.</p>
<p>We do not hide that a variety of satellites and long-range rockets which will be launched by the DPRK one after another and a nuclear test of higher level which will be carried out by it in the upcoming all-out action, a new phase of the anti-U.S. struggle that has lasted century after century, will target against the U.S., the sworn enemy of the Korean people.</p>
<p>Settling accounts with the U.S. needs to be done with force, not with words as it regards jungle law as the rule of its survival.</p>
<p>The world will clearly see how the army and people of the DPRK punish all kinds of hostile forces and emerge as a final victor while following the just road of defending its sovereignty, convinced of the justice of its cause.&#8221;</p>

		<p>North Korea Erupts at &#8220;sordid hackwork by rubbish media&#8221;: Vows a &#8220;dear price the human scum and media&#8221;will &#8220;have to pay&#8221;</p>
<p>By Nate Thayer</p>
<p>North Korea has erupted after months of silence over repeated news reports that Kim Jong-Un had plastic surgery to look like his grandfather, Kim Il Sung, with official media denouncing &#160;&#8220;sordid&#8221; and &#8220;false report&#8230; released by enemies is a hideous criminal act which the party, state, army and people can never tolerate,&#8221; said Korean Central News Agency on Wednesday, calling it &#8220;sordid hackwork by rubbish media.&#8221;</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-811" class="wp-caption-text">Kim Il Sung (L) and his Grandson (R)</p>
<p>What seemed to set Pyongyang off in a particularly virulent tizzy was not months of speculative South Korean news reports suggesting the young Kim had undergone plastic surgery, but rather a Chinese report last week by China&#8217;s Shenzhen TV who cited a diplomatic source who, on a private visit to Pyongyang, had spoken to a North Korean official who confirmed the plastic surgery rumours. KCNA referenced the Chinese report,</p>
<p>&#8220;Those hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership of the nation should not expect any mercy or leniency.</p>
<p>&#8220;Time will clearly show what dear price the human scum and media in the service of traitors of South Korea, slaves of capital, will have to pay,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-812" class="wp-caption-text">Statues of Kim Il Sung and his son Kim Jong Il in Pyongyang</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-813" class="wp-caption-text">Kim Jong Un on horse repeatedlly depicted in state media since he assumed power one year ago</p>
<p>Apparently, Pyongyang issued a demarche to Beijing, and the Chinese ruling party instructed the official Chinese party organ, Xinhua, to debunk the stories, and Xinhua issued a report Tuesday, citing two of its correspondents in Pyongyang who&#160; denied the plastic surgery rumours. Xinhua had its correspondents in Seoul and Pyongyang write a detailed background of the story which has circulated in the often gossip fueled and unverifiable rumor filled South Korean media, concluding that media stories that Kim Jong-un has had plastic surgery six times to resemble his grandfather was first reported in Seoul, then picked up by a Chinese news website, and then reported as fact on Shenzhen Satellite TV.</p>
<p>The rumours have been fed by Pyongyang&#8217;s propaganda apparatus who for months carefully crafted a meticulous written and pictorial narrative trying to evoke similarities between Kim Jong-Un and his grandfather, including through his dress, haircut, gestures and public appearances.</p>
<p>Xinhua cited as evidence of the stories falsehood that &#8220;There have been no news reports in North Korea about Kim Jong-un&#8217;s plastic surgery&#8221; and that there was &#8220;nothing suspicious&#8221; about Kim resembling his grandfather since they carry same genes.</p>
<p>While Kim tries to dress, walk and smile like his grandfather, this just aims to give the impression that he &#8220;holds the people dear,&#8221; Xinhua said.</p>

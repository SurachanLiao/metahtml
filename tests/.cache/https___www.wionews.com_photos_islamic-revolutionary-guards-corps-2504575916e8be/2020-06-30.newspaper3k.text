How Ayatollah Khomeini's feared Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps changed Iran

The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) was formed by the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in 1979. It is meant to preserve the ideals of the 1979 revolution which brought Khomeini to power after the overthrow of Shah of Iran by Khomeini's forces.

On the eve of the 18th anniversary of the September 11 attacks, the US government imposed new sanctions on Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps(IRGC). At the height of the Iran crisis, US President Donald Trump had called off airstrikes against Iran at the last minute in June after the Islamic republic's forces had shot down a US drone.

The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said it had brought down the unmanned Global Hawk surveillance aircraft as it was "violating Iranian air space" over the waters of Hormozgan province.

The Pentagon, however, denounced an "unprovoked attack" in international air space as President called it a "very big mistake". "This country will not stand for it, that I can tell you," said Trump.

On July 18, the Republican Guards had said they had detained the Panama-flagged for MT Riah for alleged fuel smuggling.

And a day later, they announced they had impounded the British-flagged Stena Impero in the Strait of Hormuz for breaking "international maritime rules".

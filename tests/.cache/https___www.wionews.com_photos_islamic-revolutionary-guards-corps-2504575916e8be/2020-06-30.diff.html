At the height of the Iran crisis, US President Donald Trump had called off airstrikes against Iran at the last minute in June after the Islamic republic's forces had shot down a US drone.</p> <p>The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said it had brought down the unmanned Global Hawk surveillance aircraft as it was "violating Iranian air space" over the waters of Hormozgan province.</p> <p>The Pentagon, however, denounced an "unprovoked attack" in international air space as President called it a "very big mistake". "This country will not stand for it, that I can tell you," said Trump.</p> <p>On July 18, the Republican Guards had said they had detained the Panama-flagged for MT Riah for alleged fuel smuggling.</p> <p>And a day later, they announced they had impounded the British-flagged Stena Impero in the Strait of Hormuz for breaking "international maritime rules".</p> <p class="new-desc-text">(Photograph:Reuters)</p> <p class="widget-type-view-11 video-play"><ins></ins></p><h2><ins>Iran's Elite Revolutionary Guards  </ins></h2><ins> </ins><p><ins>Earlier in the month, the Trump administration had announced sanctions against a network of firms, ships and individuals allegedly directed by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that blamed Iran for the attack asserting that it was “an unprecedented attack on the world’s energy supply”.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>President Trump later said US was "locked and loaded" to retaliate but added that he was still awaiting confirmation from Saudi Arabia on the source of the attacks even as the Suadi-led coalition said the weapons used in the drone strike on the Amarco oil facilities were "Iranian-made".</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The Saudi-led coalition reiterated the assessment that the Huthis were not behind it, pointing the finger at Iran for providing the weapons. As a result of the crisis, oil prices skyrocketed to a level not seen since the Gulf war in 1991.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="new-desc-text"><ins>(Photograph:AFP)</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="widget-type-view-11 video-play"><ins></ins></p><h2><ins>Art of asymmetric warfare  </ins></h2><ins> </ins><p><ins>IRGC-QF has mastered the art of asymmetric warfare deploying "unconventional" techniques in its attempt to win battles in the Middle East, both on the ground and in the air.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>In a recent press conference, Saudi Arabia said the Armaco attacks were a result of  Iran's Delta Wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) along with cruise missiles, openly pointing fingers at the IRG.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>“The attack was launched from the north and unquestionably sponsored by Iran,” the Saudi Defence ministry spokesman said.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="new-desc-text"><ins>(Photograph:AFP)</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="widget-type-view-11 video-play"><ins></ins></p><h2><ins>Israeli Merkava tanks  </ins></h2><ins> </ins><p><ins>According to Iran's Constitution, Islamic Pasdaran Revolutionary Corps has been formed to undertake the "responsibility of not only guarding and protecting the borders, but also the weight of ideological mission, i.e. striving on the path of God and struggle on the path of expanding the sovereignty of the law of God in the world."</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>According to Article 144 of Iran's constitution, "the Army of the Islamic Republic of Iran must be an Islamic army, committed to Islamic ideology and the people.

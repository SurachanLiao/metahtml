            <h2> Iran Revolutionary Guards  </h2>
           <p>On the eve of the 18th anniversary of the September 11 attacks, the US government imposed new sanctions on Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps(IRGC). At the height of the Iran crisis, US President Donald Trump had called off airstrikes against Iran at the last minute in June after the Islamic republic's forces had shot down a US drone.</p>

<p>The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said it had brought down the unmanned Global Hawk surveillance aircraft as it was "violating Iranian air space" over the waters of Hormozgan province.</p>

<p>The Pentagon, however, denounced an "unprovoked attack" in international air space as President called it a "very big mistake". "This country will not stand for it, that I can tell you," said Trump.</p>

<p>On July 18, the Republican Guards had said they had detained the Panama-flagged for MT Riah for alleged fuel smuggling.</p>

<p>And a day later, they announced they had impounded the British-flagged Stena Impero in the Strait of Hormuz for breaking "international maritime rules".</p>

            <h2> Iran's Elite Revolutionary Guards  </h2>
           <p>Earlier in the month, the Trump administration had announced sanctions against a network of firms, ships and individuals allegedly directed by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. The US alleged that it supplied oil to Syria worth tens of millions of dollars in a breach of US sanctions.</p>

<p>The US Treasury Department said that the Qods Force, the IRGC's elite foreign paramilitary and espionage arm profited financially by supplying Iranian oil and petroleum products, mostly to Syria, that this spring alone was worth more than $750 million.</p>

<p>"Treasury's action against this sprawling petroleum network makes it explicitly clear that those purchasing Iranian oil are directly supporting Iran's militants and terrorist arm, the IRGC-Qods Force," Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said.</p>

            <h2> Damaged oil/gas infrastructure from drone attacks  </h2>
           <p>In the latest escalation of tensions in the Middle East, Yemen's Houtini rebels launched a series of drone strikes on Amarco oil facilities in Saudi Arabia severely disrupting oil supplies. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that blamed Iran for the attack asserting that it was &#8220;an unprecedented attack on the world&#8217;s energy supply&#8221;.</p>

<p>President Trump later said US was "locked and loaded" to retaliate but added that he was still awaiting confirmation from Saudi Arabia on the source of the attacks even as the Suadi-led coalition said the weapons used in the drone strike on the Amarco oil facilities were "Iranian-made".</p>

<p>The Saudi-led coalition reiterated the assessment that the Huthis were not behind it, pointing the finger at Iran for providing the weapons. As a result of the crisis, oil prices skyrocketed to a level not seen since the Gulf war in 1991.</p>

            <h2> Art of asymmetric warfare  </h2>
           <p>IRGC-QF has mastered the art of asymmetric warfare deploying "unconventional" techniques in its attempt to win battles in the Middle East, both on the ground and in the air.</p>

<p>In a recent press conference, Saudi Arabia said the Armaco attacks were a result of &#160;Iran's Delta Wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) along with cruise missiles, openly pointing fingers at the IRG.</p>

<p>&#8220;The attack was launched from the north and unquestionably sponsored by Iran,&#8221; the Saudi Defence ministry spokesman said.</p>

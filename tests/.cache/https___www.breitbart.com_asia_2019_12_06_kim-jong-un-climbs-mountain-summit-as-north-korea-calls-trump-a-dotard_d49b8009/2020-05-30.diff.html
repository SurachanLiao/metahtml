The North Korean regime claimed Kim Jong-il, Kim Jong-un’s predecessor and father, was born on the mountain.</p><p>Last year, in a gesture meant to symbolize Kim Jong-un’s willingness to thaw relations with the south, he <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/asia/2018/09/20/kim-moon-mount-paektu/">toured</a> the summit of Mount Paektu with leftist South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who said that climbing the mountain was a lifelong dream.</p><p>The newspaper also affirmed the catchy slogan “Let us produce, study and live like the anti-Japanese guerrillas!” as a core command of the Workers’ Party of Korea (WPK), Kim’s communist cult. Imperial Japan committed a host of human rights atrocities against Koreans and colonized Chinese during World War II that continues to be a point of contention in both Koreas. In the North, however, Kim Jong-un regularly uses his propaganda outlets to stoke resentment against the Japanese people and has continued testing short-range missiles that could reach Japan, even when limiting long-range tests that could threaten U.S. territories.</p><p>The South Korean news service Yonhap <a href="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20191205003100325?section=nk/nk">suggested</a> that the combination of the Kim photo collections and essays by high-ranking officials urging North Koreans to embrace “self-reliance,” meaning a rejection of Western freedoms and acceptance of the hardships the non-elite endure under communism, were a sign that Pyongyang is not expecting any breakthroughs with the free world in the near future.</p><p>“As long as we have the revolutionary spirit of Mount Paekdu, and revolutionary spirit of self reliance, we can survive on our own and open the door for development and prosperity of our own style,” Yonhap quoted Vice Premier Kim Tok-hun as writing.</p><p>Choe Son Hui, North Korea’s first vice-minister of Foreign Affairs, also issued a statement Thursday carried by the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), North Korea’s regime news service, <a href="https://kcnawatch.org/newstream/1575615666-276354568/choe-son-hui-makes-statement">claiming</a> that the “waves of hatred of our people against the U.S. and the Americans … are getting higher and higher.”</p><p class="comp-box text-group">“It would be fortunate if the utterances of the use of military force and the title of figurative style made by President [Donald] Trump were a careless verbal lapse, but matter becomes different if they were a planned provocation that deliberately targeted us,” Choe warned. “If any language and expressions stoking the atmosphere of confrontation are used once again on purpose at a crucial moment as now, that must really be diagnosed as the relapse of the dotage of a dotard.”</p><p>Trump, present at the NATO summit in London this week, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2019/12/05/north-korea-response-trump-remark/2617148001/">said</a> the United States would use military force against North Korea “if we have to,” then referred to Kim Jong-un once again as “Rocket Man,” a nickname he gave him, Trump explained, because he “likes to send rockets up, doesn’t he?”</p><p>Follow Frances Martel on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/francesimartel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external">Facebook</a>and <a href="https://twitter.com/francesmartel" target="_blank" rel="noopener external">Twitter</a>.</p></article>

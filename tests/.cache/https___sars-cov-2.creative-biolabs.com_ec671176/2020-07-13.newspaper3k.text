Since the SARS epidemic at the end of 2002, Creative Biolabs has conducted extensive and in-depth research on coronaviruses. Especially for SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV with high infection rate, high morbidity and mortality, we have prepared a series of high-quality products for the development of anti-CoV drugs and vaccines. Benefit from the accumulated rich experience, we quickly developed corresponding products immediately after the outbreak of 2019-nCoV, to help fuel the process of developing targeted drugs and vaccines.

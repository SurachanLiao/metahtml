                           Early diagnosis is quite important for control of 2019-nCoV infection and life saving. The current situation necessitates the development of diagnostic assays with good sensitivity and specificity for 2019-nCoV. Creative Biolabs has established a 2019-nCoV IVD reagent development platform to aid companies and research institutes in the development of coronavirus reagents and assays.

                            The severity and emergency of SARS-CoV-2 infection spur an urgent need for antiviral drug and vaccine discovery. Equipped with cutting-edge techniques and vast experience, we are keeping up with current research hotspots and integrating all resources to provide scientific support and comprehensive services to promote the success of this combat.

                           Since the SARS epidemic at the end of 2002, Creative Biolabs has conducted extensive and in-depth research on coronaviruses. Especially for SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV with high infection rate, high morbidity and mortality, we have prepared a series of high-quality products for the development of anti-CoV drugs and vaccines. Benefit from the accumulated rich experience, we quickly developed corresponding products immediately after the outbreak of 2019-nCoV, to help fuel the process of developing targeted drugs and vaccines.

The current situation necessitates the development of diagnostic assays with good sensitivity and specificity for 2019-nCoV. Creative Biolabs has established a 2019-nCoV IVD reagent development platform to aid companies and research institutes in the development of coronavirus reagents and assays.

Especially for SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV with high infection rate, high morbidity and mortality, we have prepared a series of high-quality products for the development of anti-CoV drugs and vaccines. Benefit from the accumulated rich experience, we quickly developed corresponding products immediately after the outbreak of 2019-nCoV, to help fuel the process of developing targeted drugs and vaccines.

    <p align="left">TEHRAN 
      - The Jewish women in the back rows of the synagogue wear long garments 
      in the traditional Iranian style, but instead of chadors, their heads are 
      covered with cheerful, flowered scarves. The boys in their skullcaps, with 
      Hebrew prayer books tucked under their arms, scamper down the aisles to 
      grab the best spots near the lush, turquoise Persian carpet of the altar. 
      This is Friday night, Shabbat - Iranian style, and the synagogue in an affluent 
      neighborhood of North Tehran is filled to capacity with more than 400 worshipers. 
      </p>
    <p>It is one of the many 
      paradoxes of the Islamic Republic of Iran that this most virulent anti-Israeli 
      country supports by far the largest Jewish population of any Muslim country. 
      </p>
    <p>While Jewish communities 
      in Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Egypt, Morocco and Algeria have all but vanished, 
      Iran is home to 25,000 - some here say 35,000 - Jews. The Jewish population 
      is less than half the number that lived here before the Islamic revolution 
      of 1979. But the Jews have tried to compensate for their diminishing numbers 
      by adopting a new religious fervor. </p>
    <p>''The funny thing is 
      that before the Islamic revolution, you would see maybe 20 old men in the 
      synagogue,'' whispers Nahit Eliyason, 48, as she climbs over four other 
      women to find one of the few vacant seats. ''Now the place is full. You 
      can barely find a seat.'' Parvis Yashaya, a film producer who heads Tehran's 
      Jewish community, adds: ''We are smaller, but we are stronger in some ways.'' 
      </p>
    <p>Tehran has 11 functioning 
      synagogues, many of them with Hebrew schools. It has two kosher restaurants, 
      and a Jewish hospital, an old-age home and a cemetery. There is a Jewish 
      representative in the Iranian parliament. There is a Jewish library with 
      20,000 titles, its reading room decorated with a photograph of the Ayatollah 
      Khomeini. </p>
    <p>Khomeini protection</p>
    <p>Iran's Jewish community 
      is confronted by contradictions. Many of the prayers uttered in synagogue, 
      for instance, refer to the desire to see Jerusalem again. Yet there is no 
      postal service or telephone contact with Israel, and any Iranian who dares 
      travel to Israel faces imprisonment and passport confiscation. ''We are 
      Jews, not Zionists. We are a religious community, not a political one,'' 
      Yashaya said. </p>
    <p>Before the revolution, 
      Jews were well-represented among Iran's business elite, holding key posts 
      in the oil industry, banking and law, as well as in the traditional bazaar. 
      The wave of anti-Israeli sentiment that swept Iran during the revolution, 
      as well as large-scale confiscations of private wealth, sent thousands of 
      the more affluent Jews fleeing to the United States or Israel. Those remaining 
      lived in fear of pogroms, or massacres. </p>
    <p>But Khomeini met with 
      the Jewish community upon his return from exile in Paris and issued a ''fatwa'' 
      decreeing that the Jews were to be protected. Similar edicts also protect 
      Iran's tiny Christian minority. </p>
    <p>Just as it radically 
      transformed Muslim society, the revolution changed the Jews. Families that 
      had been secular in the 1970s started keeping kosher and strictly observing 
      rules against driving on Shabbat. They stopped going to restaurants, cafes 
      and cinemas - many such establishments were closed down - and the synagogue 
      perforce became the focal point of their social lives. </p>
     
    <p align="center">Jewish 
      school in Shiraz</p>
    <p>Iranian Jews say they 
      socialize far less with Muslims now than before the revolution. As a whole, 
      they occupy their own separate space within the rigid confines of the Islamic 
      republic, a protected yet precarious niche. </p>
    <p>Jewish women, like 
      Muslim women, are required by law to keep their heads covered, although 
      most eschew the chador for a simple scarf. But Jews, unlike Muslims, can 
      keep small flasks of home-brewed wine or arrack to drink within the privacy 
      of their homes - in theory, for religious purposes. Some Hebrew schools 
      are coed, and men and women dance with each other at weddings, practices 
      strictly forbidden for Muslims. </p>
    <p>''Sometimes I think 
      they are kinder to the Jews than they are to themselves. ... If we are gathered 
      in a house, and the family is having a ceremony with wine or the music is 
      playing too loud, if they find out we are Jews, they don't bother us so 
      much,'' Eliyason said. </p>
    <p>''Everywhere in the 
      world there are people who don't like Jews. In England, they draw swastikas 
      on Jewish graves. I don't think that Iran is more dangerous for Jews than 
      other places.'' </p>
    <p>Some problems exist 
       </p>
    <p>Testimony from Jews 
      who have left Iran suggests more serious problems than those cited by Jews 
      inside the country. In written testimony to a congressional subcommittee 
      in February 1996, an Iranian Jew complained of being imprisoned for two 
      years on trumped-up charges of spying for Israel. He also said his arrest 
      was preceded by harassment at work and pressure to convert to Islam. Inside 
      Iran, Jews say that they frequently receive alarmed telephone calls and 
      letters from relatives in the United States concerned about their well-being, 
      but that they themselves do not feel physically endangered. Their major 
      complaint is the inability to visit family in Israel, and what they say 
      is inadequate funding for Hebrew schools, which are administered by the 
      Iranian Ministry of Education. </p>
    <p>Although many Jews 
      hold jobs in government ministries or within state-owned firms, they say 
      they are unlikely to rise to top positions. In addition, Iran's strict Islamic 
      law, or ''sharia,'' contains many discriminatory provisions toward non-Muslims. 
      </p>
    <p>Jews 'part of Iran' 
       </p>
    <p>Still, Jewish leaders 
      say their community has far stronger roots in Iran than other Middle East 
      Jewish communities, which were virtually eradicated by massive immigration 
      to Israel in the 1940s and 1950s. Esther, the biblical Jewish queen who 
      saved her people from persecution in the fifth century B.C., is reputed 
      to be buried in Hamadan, in western Iran. The grave of the Old Testament 
      prophet Daniel lies in southwestern Iran. </p>
    <p>''We are different 
      from the Jews of the diaspora. You see the name 'Persia' in the Old Testament 
      almost as often as the name 'Israel.' The Iranian Jews are very much part 
      of Iran,'' said Gad Naim, 60, who runs the old-age home in Tehran. Iranian 
      Jews trace their history to the reign of Persia's King Cyrus. As the Bible 
      tells it, Cyrus conquered Babylonia in 539 B.C., liberated the Jews from 
      captivity, and raised funds for the rebuilding of their destroyed temple 
      in Jerusalem. The return of the Jews to Jerusalem at that time was accompanied 
      by a large migration to the lands that were then Persia, and now Iran. </p>
    <p>In Esfahan, an Iranian 
      city fabled for its intricate Persian tile work, the first Persian Jews 
      were settled under the reign of Cyrus. The ancient city was once known as 
      Dar-Al-Yahud (''House of the Jews'' in Farsi), and as late as the 19th century 
      it was the home of 100,000 Jews, according to Elias Haronian, head of Esfahan's 
      Jewish community. </p>
    <p>Today, the city is 
      a repository of Jewish lore. It has a cemetery with Jewish graves 2,000 
      years old, stunning synagogues and Jewish mausoleums with tiles to rival 
      those of the mosques - but a population of only 1,500 Jews. </p>
    <p>What happened to 
      the Jews? </p>
    <p>Some converted centuries 
      ago. Indeed, in Muslim villages surrounding Esfahan, a distinctive Jewish 
      dialect of Farsi is spoken, and Muslims still follow certain Jewish rituals, 
      such as lighting candles on Fridays. Others left for Tehran, or for California 
      or New York. Some went to Israel. </p>
    <p>''It is not that life 
      is so difficult for us, but a minority is a minority... We are like a glass 
      of water in the sea,'' Haronian said. Haronian, a petroleum engineer, worries 
      less about persecution than about the faltering Iranian economy, the lack 
      of job opportunities for his four children, and the shortage of suitable 
      Jewish spouses. ''There are very few Jewish boys here. There are so few 
      of us,'' said his 17-year-old daughter, Shirin. At Esfahan's Hebrew school, 
      students confided that they are deeply torn between a love of their homeland 
      and a desire to escape from the stifling isolation of Iran. </p>
    <p>The decision to stay 
      or go may rest largely on Mohammad Khatami, a relatively progressive cleric 
      who won a landslide election May 23 as the next president of Iran. Although 
      he is virulently anti-Israel in his public comments, Khatami was considered 
      sympathetic to the Jews during his term as Iran's minister of culture and 
      Islamic guidance. He paid a campaign visit to a social club for Jewish women 
      in Tehran. ''We expect more freedom, an easier life, not just for Jews, 
      for everybody,'' said Farangis Hassidim, an administrator of Tehran's Jewish 
      hospital. </p>
    <p>Not everyone in the 
      Jewish community favors liberalization of Iranian society. Arizel Levihim, 
      20, a prospective Hebrew teacher, said Judaism has fared better within the 
      confines of Iran's strictly religious society. ''I believe it is good for 
      women to keep their head covered. I think it is good to restrict relations 
      between boys and girls,'' Levihim said. ''I agree with the ideals of the 
      Islamic republic. These are Jewish values too."</p>

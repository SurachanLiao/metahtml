<p>They hurt one Chinese cop, all 1.4 bn Chinese will go after them. 
</p>
 
<p>This photo taken on Wednesday shows a protester (left) using a sharp object against a Hong Kong police officer (right), who was trying to detain a man (center) during an illegal rally. The man suspected of stabbing the officer in the shoulder was arrested on board a flight that was about to take off for London.</p>
 
 
 
<h3>DEMOCRACY&#8217;S REIGN OF TERROR</h3>
<p>The clip doesn&#8217;t show it, but here is the background before the above video starts:</p>
<p>Scene is Causeway Bay district near the main Hong Kong Central Library. A group of rioters, one of them holding a US flag, had strewn bricks dug up from pavements, using them as missiles against the police, while attempting to block the traffic light junction with garbage bins, etc. When police charged, a lone policeman chases after one of them who appeared to be directing the blockade. The chase crossed the road, and the video starts.</p>
<p>That rioter is in red shirt. But when the police caught up with him, they both fell. Policeman is surrounded by other rioters and a bunch of Press photographers, most of who &#8212; and this is standard riot SOP &#8212; are themselves rioters disguised in the yellow Press vest. (Press passes can be obtained at HK$20 each from the US NED-funded Hong Kong Journalists Association, HKAJ, no accreditation nor vetting necessary. The HKAJ along with two political parties were organizers of the riots since last June, 2019. The vests are optional with separate payment.)</p>
<p>The man to watch out for is on the left hand side of the screen, appearing with others from behind the pedestrian steel railing. He is in dark grey shirt, wearing a cap and repeatedly stabs the policeman on the shoulders as the latter got up, still hanging on to the suspect. (This is dedication to work.) Red shirt manages to free himself and escaped with another friend in sleeveless T-shirt. As they ran, the &#8216;Press&#8217; disperse and doesn&#8217;t intervene to help the policeman soon soaking in blood. Note, for example, a girl in yellow Press vest in front of the injured policeman, nonchalant.</p>
<p>None of all that is new. But contrast the situation (and events of the past) with years of Press propaganda reports (SCMP, New York Times, Washington Post, CNN), all drawn from pro-US Anglophile politicians who repeat the lie &#8212; repeated from Washington to London and in Mkini, Reuters offices &#8212; that China is suppressing all freedoms, freedom of expression, freedom of Press, silencing dissent, and that the new national security law would end HK autonomy, democracy and, with that, even more freedoms.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yet, without these freedoms, these &#8216;democracy protesters&#8217; (sic), continue their assault on the police, and that Causeway Bay incident was just one of 17 injuries caused on July 1, 2020. They included a policeman resting inside a parked police car that was set ablaze. Another three were injured after they were rammed by a motorcycle, flying the ISIS-like black flag from the rear seat.</li>
<li>Without those freedoms, they have the past year managed to injure more than 160 policemen, almost all ending up in hospitals, one set alight with gasoline bomb, a dozen attacked with acid.</li>
<li>Even without their freedoms, they manage to disrupt daily lives, attacked 91 subway Metros, and inflicted street terror on ordinary people, on top of arson and other terrorist acts.</li>
</ul>
<p>*</p>
<h3>UNIVERSITY OF HONG KONG &#8212; AGAIN!</h3>
<p>The man in dark shirt with an ice pick was masked from head to toe (top photo). But within six hours we identified that motherfucker then got him after he had cleared airport immigration, the plane door had closed, seated in his chair on a Cathay Pacific flight to London with a British National (Overseas) passport. His father was distraught (interview clip below):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;It is the fault of the Hong Kong University (HKU). They are the worse, they forced him, they won&#8217;t leave him alone and they don&#8217;t care if he has graduated&#8230;,&#8221; but they made him join the anti-Chinese demonstrations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The arrested suspect, Wong, age 24, was an engineering graduate of the HKU. Structured and largely taught by Anglo-American professors using English as the sole medium of instruction, the university is a racist, poisoned, anti-Chinese institution created in the exact image of Anglo-American universities.</p>
<p>We Chinese have a long, long memory.</p>
<p>But first, we&#8217;ll hammer that fucker with at least four charges which in combination will put him away for the rest of his life. Guaranteed! Next, we will hunt down and nail all his accomplices on that day, including his HKU girlfriend. After that his university mates and teachers, including the university vice-chancellor. These days, we have just the law to deal with all of them. In serious cases such as this one, trials can be conducted outside Hong Kong without those motherfucking Anglophile judges presiding.</p>

<p>To avoid facing the law and possibly jail, Steven Gan can run off to the US, his protector. This happened in dozens of cases in HK. Gan&#8217;s passport must be confiscated forthwith&#8230;</p>
<p>*</p>
 
<p>*</p>
<h3>JAIL FOR AN ANGLOPHILE</h3>
<p>Malaysiakini and its editor Steven Gan are on trial not because of any absence of law. There are <a href="https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/532693">on trial for contempt</a>, that is, for the presence of a law that holds the sanctity and the integrity of the judicial system beyond any doubt. Arguments follow&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>They hold in contempt not just the judiciary but all institutions of the government, including the King and the Parliament. The latest example of that contempt is given above, telling off the court to &#8216;be reasonable&#8217;. This means that, if Mkini and Gan are convicted, Premesh Chandran is saying, the court is &#8216;unreasonable&#8217; and even restricts the freedom of speech. Premesh&#8217;s speech is clearly an attempt to assert pressure on the court and undermine its independence in favor of Mkini. He and on behalf of Mkini clearly don&#8217;t care for the underlying principle of sub-judice, and they regard themselves as superior to court decisions. That&#8217;s contempt.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>They hold in contempt by relying not just on the spin and the omissions they commit in their so-called &#8216;news and views&#8217; but also with anonymous hatchet jobs committed through an army of anonymous readers, who clearly and unmistakably, support their work financially. This sort of speech-contempt is contained in Mkini&#8217;s court argument (above top image-extract). It is that there is no such law to restrict online posting therefore Mkini can permit anything in by shifting the burden of proof for an assertion that is never falsifiable. Which is, Steven Gan didn&#8217;t know. Instead of the Christian preacher proving that God exists, Mkini&#8217;s argument requires the church congregation to prove there isn&#8217;t any. This kind of syllogism and mental somersault are passe and trite and Steven Gan must be called out &#8212; and, because they employ it, must be made to pay for the trickery. That&#8217;s contempt.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Mkini et al hold themselves to be accountable to nobody, other than their foreign sponsors, on the pretext-premise that freedom of the Press is above the law, indeed above everything, so that they spit at the constitution which insists all are equal before the law. They hold as their motto: &#8216;Speaking Truth to Power&#8216; as if only they have possession of the truth (whatever that is) and that, dressed as free Press, all power is theirs while all other powers are fair game to be undermined. In freedom of speech, they insist that speech is not an act, even though this is demonstrably false: ISIS, Iraq, Zakir Naik et al. That&#8217;s contempt.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If Steven Gan doesn&#8217;t know beforehand the existence of a contemptuous post, then he must produce the administrator who knew and who let that in. If the administrator doesn&#8217;t know, then Gan must produce the subscribers who posted those comments. Where does the buck stop? Yet he will do none of the above, again on the pretext of freedom of speech, in effect giving not only himself a free pass but also anyone who gives money to Mkini! That&#8217;s contempt.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>There are other, extenuating circumstances that clearly indicate Mkini and Gan to be subversive forces that undermine the State of Malaysia and its position vis-a-vis the rest of the world:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Being started, financed, and corralled into existence by the USA, which makes regime change and international <a href="https://orinocotribune.com/venezuela-rejects-new-us-sanctions-against-iranian-tanker-captains/">subversion of legitimate governments</a> (Ukraine, Venezuela, Russia, China) as their corner stone of foreign policy, the foreign financing makes Mkini and Gan complicit, direct and active participants in US propaganda agenda and unlawful objectives. That&#8217;s contempt.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>That they actively collude with the US to break international law, in <a href="https://orinocotribune.com/venezuela-submits-new-documents-against-us-in-the-hague/">crimes against humanity</a>, to propagate self-serving foreign-armed aggression (Iran, Syria, Libya), to break normal relationships among nations and neighboring states (China, Philippines), to violate sovereignty of independent states (Venezuela, Cuba), and to foment violations of law within the borders of respective countries (China, Nicaragua, Bolivia). That&#8217;s contempt.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>That, in cahoots with the US foreign and financial interest, Mkini attempts to influence domestic politics, thereby undermining the UN safeguards for non-interference and the UN respect for the sovereignty of other states. A Malaysian example is the 14th General Elections: Mkini colluded with US interests (such as its Department of Justice) in order to influence public perception and thereby undermine the credibility of the then Malaysian government of Najib Razak so as to totally replace it. That&#8217;s contempt.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Acting in Malaysia, which has international obligations, and bound by Malaysian laws, the activities of Mkini and Steven Gan have ramifications on Malaysia&#8217;s national prestige abroad. Following in the footsteps of Reuters and Anglo-America, Mkini weaponizes &#8212; indeed, profits from &#8212; racist hatred and hatred for indigenous governments on an international scale to serve White man&#8217;s imperialist goals. None of Mkini activities, past and present, must be tolerated anymore. Enough is enough.</p>
<p>The danger of Mkini doing the work of its master, the USA, is plain for all to see in Hong Kong. There it has the Hong Kong Free Press and Apple Daily, both financed and directed by the CIA &#8216;NGO&#8217; front the National Endowment for Democracy (NED).</p>
<p>Mkini and its editors on its behalf must go to jail to serve as an example for the rest of the Press corp that the destiny of Malaysia is not for them to play with, that Malaysia doesn&#8217;t belong to Gan&#8217;s mother, that their days of acting with impunity are over, and that no matter who their rich and powerful masters may be, they are not above the law. That is, Malaysia&#8217;s judges must reassert the sovereign independence of the country they serve.</p>
<p>The decision of the court (below) is therefore correct! Next, go straight to jail. 
</p>
<p>The comeuppance of Mkini and Steven Gan has been long time coming&#8230;</p>
<p>*</p>

<h3>WHITE WORSHIPPING</h3>
<h3>ANGLOPHILE PENANG-LANG</h3>
<p>That, the above, is the Francis Light statue, and below is the Star newspaper report and note how, even 150 years later, they are so brain washed as to look at White people as saviors.</p>
<p>People like Mohd Kamal bin Abdullah who <a href="http://malaysiansmustknowthetruth.blogspot.com/2020/07/francis-light-statue-in-penang.html">posted the article</a> have no sense of national pride, nor history, nor a sense of racial and colonial justice, nothing, except to see White people as deliverers of culture, manners, thoughts, language, the ballot paper, and introduced God and Jane Austen to Kamal&#8217;s stupid, illiterate, uncivilized pendatang voodoo-barbarian grandparents from Sumatra.</p>
<p>This Kamal fella is exactly like Stevie Wonder Gan and Premesh &#8216;Speak Truth to Power&#8217; Chandran: an Anglophile always an Anglophile and Penang is full of these Anglo imitation motherfuckers. Here&#8217;s another moronic <a href="https://helenang.wordpress.com/">Anglophile Penang lang</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Francis Light is founder? Kamal has proof Francis Light &#8216;founded&#8217; the town? What does Kamal mean by founded? Light paved roads and introduced horse carts? As &#8216;founder&#8217;, Francis Light gave civilization to Kamal, taught him how to read in English, eat from plates not banana leaves, nibble scones in marmalade, and taught him how to fuck another Malaiyoo from the backside, like Anwar Ibrahim?</li>
<li>Vandals? How does Kamal know they are vandals? He met and interrogated them, and they confessed to being &#8216;vandals&#8217;? Maybe Penang showers in red paint.</li>
<li>Why vandals, and not &#8216;freedom fighters&#8217;? Or anti-racists?</li>
</ul>
<p>This Kamal podah &#8230;. Like Anglos, Anglophiles are convinced Columbus &#8216;founded&#8217; &#8212; better yet, &#8216;discovered&#8217; &#8212; America. For bigoted racist Anglophiles, history begins only with the Omputih, such nice people with an &#8220;English sense fairness&#8221; (the Malaiyoo Anglophile Zaid Ibrahim said that):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>GEORGE TOWN: Vandals have splashed red paint on the statue of George Town founder Captain Francis Light here.</p>
<p>The statue was erected 84 years ago to commemorate Francis Light&#8217;s contribution to the founding of George Town.</p>
<p>Checks by The Star showed that the statue had been cleaned but some paint marks were still visible.</p>
<p>The statue is a historical landmark in Penang and is located within the grounds of the famous Fort Cornwallis here.</p>
<p>It was sculpted by FJ Wilcoxson and cast at Burton&#8217;s Foundry in Thames Ditton, England. It was erected to celebrate the 150th anniversary of George Town.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fucking statue should be brought down and thrown into the Malacca Straits or, more profitably, used to pave roads. Instead, it is treated like deity and demi-god.</p>
<p>The world from Minneapolis to London is finally waking up to BLM, something we Chinese knew all along, that is, White racism but in Malaysia, slow as always, still worship their White masters, like Stevie, like Premesh, like Kamal. What a pile of spineless, multi-culti muhibbah Anglophile shit.</p>

<p>*</p>
<p>In HSBC meeting rooms&#8230;</p>
<p>How it all began: Entrapment, the invention of a crime against Huawei</p>
<h3>HSBC CEOs EXCHANGED JAIL</h3>
<h3>TO AID USA ANTI-CHINA CAMPAIGN</h3>
<p>In Canadian court documents: HSBC traded drug-money prosecution by the FBI in return for manufacturing a crime against Huawei, with Reuters acting as the Press tip-off.</p>
<p>Below, documentary on how it began: HSBC&#8217;s drug-money dealings.</p>
 
<p>*</p>
 
<p>In nearly all countries, banker-client meetings, like lawyer-client meetings are protected by law. That report, above, ought to have landed the reporter and editor in jail. Nothing happened.</p>
<p>But note the Reuters report had cited &#8216;internal investigation by HSBC&#8217;. What &#8216;investigation&#8217; when the only reference in it is a set of MS power-point presentation slides used in a 2016 meeting between HSBC America and Meng Wanzhou to open a corporate bank account in California for Huawei?</p>
<p>Facts to note:</p>
<ul>
<li>(a) What is HSBC investigating when all that there is, is Huawei opening a bank account for its fledgling American business? Do they &#8216;investigate&#8217; you if your company opens a corporate account? The most that they do is called &#8216;due diligence&#8217;.</li>
<li>(b) What is HSBC investigating supposedly over a &#8216;suspected front company&#8217; that was operating not in America but in Iran, and that was four years before the HSBC meeting, and it had no HSBC account?</li>
<li>(c) What is HSBC investigating: that Huawei dealt with Iran which is subject to neither US law nor (internationally illegal) US sanctions, both having no jurisdiction over non-US companies?</li>
</ul>
<p>In all cases, (a) to (c), the subject matter &#8212; that is, trade with Iran &#8212; had nothing to do with the HSBC.</p>
<p>But, solely on the basis of that meeting, and the power-point presentation Meng made at the meeting, the crime of &#8216;secretly dealing&#8217; with Iran was invented &#8212; that is selling handphones &#8212; and that was by a defunct company four years prior and which Huawei didn&#8217;t own.</p>
<p>See, how contrived the US justice system: they want to fix you and they can&#8217;t even create a proper fig leaf argument.</p>
<p>To give, however, that invention of crime a legal and public legitimacy, Reuters was thus recruited &#8212; i.e. given an &#8216;exclusive&#8217; &#8212; of Huawei having &#8216;secret dealings&#8217; with Iran and hiding that from the US, as if that were a fact.</p>
<p>Note the date of the Reuters report (image above), Feb 26, 2019, was almost three months after Meng Wanzhou was abducted in Vancouver airport on transit, Dec 1, 2018. Or to restate that time line: Having nothing on Meng, the US government invented something, anything, then have Reuters do the dirty laundry work, in order to give justification for her arrest and extradition.</p>
<p>Even at that point, from December 2018 (her abduction) to February 2020 (Reuters report), Meng had not been charged! She was formally charged in absentia only in July 2019 so that the next month, in August, those US charge documents could be produced and sent to Canada&#8217;s government to buttress its court case of extraditing her.</p>
<p>Those prosecution documents are available online. Reading through them, you can see they made direct references to Reuters as a tip-off, i.e. for alerting the US Department of Justice (DOJ) which, in turn, used the 2016 HSBC-Meng meeting as proof of attempt to cheat the US and evade sanctions.</p>
<p>Now, contrast Meng&#8217;s supposed crime with HSBC itself, laundering drug cartel money, spread over a decade or more, until it became untenable for US and was exposed in 2012. Not one HSBC executive was prosecuted, though the sum of money laundered through worldwide via HSBC accounts exceeded US$10 billion.</p>
<p>In 2016 when Reuters said HSBC conducted an &#8216;internal investigation&#8217; against Huawei, the latter had also reached a deal with DOJ to pay a fine of US$1.6 billion but no prosecution, provided&#8230; this, this and that.</p>
<p>The same method was used against Goldman Sachs over 1MDB: no prosecution for the scam but pay a fine and help the US and its pro-US Malaysian politicians nail Najib Razak. It was time for regime change in Malaysia. To help the US drum up the case they brought in the Press, in that case, Sarawak Report and Malaysiakini and the Edge. That&#8217;s propaganda SOP; it is why you want to own Steven Gan and Clare Rewcastle-Brown. If HSBC CEOs are willing to be bought, why wouldn&#8217;t little media turds?</p>

<p>We Chinese are more determined than ever to see that HSBC will never last long operating on Chinese soil, and that includes Hong Kong where it has monopoly on the retail and mortgage markets. Because its CEOs work as a regime change agents for the US then they and the bank will be treated as foreign threats, undermining the interest of Chinese. We have just the kind of law and punishment for them motherfuckers &#8212; this we swear in the name of Huangdi.

<p>That <a href="https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/527865">offer above</a> took the UK 23 years since 1997, more than 30 since China and the White man dealed to return Chinese territory without us having to take it back by force. If the UK had done so earlier, we Chinese won&#8217;t have to come looking for those Anglophile motherfuckers (see Deck of Cards).</p>
<p>But, in the above headline, note the word &#8216;may&#8216;. And note &#8216;path to&#8230;&#8216;. Why maybe? Why &#8216;path to&#8217;? How does the path meander? Through the Valley of the Shadow of Death? How long is the path? 100 years? This is the trouble with White people. They want to do propaganda, but that ends up deluding the people they support. Not us Chinese. 
</p>
<p>In propaganda, White Reuters and Anglophile Stevie Gan <a href="https://shuzheng.wordpress.com/2020/05/29/peoples-uprising-in-usa-corrupt-stevie-gan-and-his-charlie-truths/">spinning for White Anglo-Saxon American power</a> is as thick as blood-money. Wonder what Stevie&#8217;s cut and payoff in the Reuters-Mkini contract.</p>
<p>Reuters is financed by the UK government, as the CIA front the National Endowment for Democracy &#8216;NGO&#8217; which owns Steven Gan and Mkini is financed by the US. The point? White Power has got Malaysia locked in and covered front and back, with Anglophile Stevie as middleman. Small wonder, Malaysia is so fucked: lawyers and MPs, Anglophile DAP, PKR, Bersatu, Amanah, in that order towards White loyalty. (See nearer bottom of post, Corona Anglo-America Spin.)</p>

<h3>Canada&#8217;s Draconian Law</h3>
 
<p>*</p>
<p>Anglophiles, Charles Santiago, Andrew Khoo, Steven Gan, Reuters, et al are so racist &#8212; that is, they consider Chinese as a pathologically inferior specie to White people &#8212; wait now for&#8230;</p>
<h3>THE ANGLO-AMERICA COVID SPIN</h3>
<p><a href="http://syedsoutsidethebox.blogspot.com/2020/05/successful-chinese-corona-vaccine-ready.html">on this</a>:</p>
 
<p>*</p>
<h3>VACCINE &amp; THE RACIST ANDREW CHARLIES 
</h3>
<p>Before the Covid vaccine even enters the market (above), I&#8217;d wager anyone the &#8216;Free&#8217; Press and media spin will happen soon, starting in the USA followed by its paid agents in Malaysia, Taiwan, HK, India, Korea.</p>
<p>America has already send out word &#8212; Steven Gan, for example, would surely have received it &#8212; on how to discredit China. So vile are these people: the world can die in the interim, as Americans are dying, but so what?</p>
<p>Reason? Money. We are talking in terms of hundreds of US billions per year on a thing and a production that&#8217;s like taking a drop of spittle, dilute then split into millions of vials per drop. The spittle cost is such a pittance that even the plastic vial is more expensive, or the freight. But the global market is guaranteed. 
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Xi Jinping has told us Chinese a few days ago: Let&#8217;s sell it at cost, that is, next to nothing. Why make money&#160; on this kind of a thing? It won&#8217;t make our people happier, anyway. We listened, and our people agree.</p>
<p>We Chinese already have trillions in US dollar holdings and we want to dump them, not to make more &#8212; over spittle!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>America, on the other hand, must slow down China so that their Big 4 Pharma companies which control 80%+ of the world&#8217;s drug supply can have the first leg in, the market share, then set the price. America tried to buy the German and French companies experimenting on vaccine, but both the latter refused to sell.</p>
<p>All that is what comes with Anglo-America free market, free individual ideology: Me First. America First. Malaysian First. Not everybody first. That is, somebody must be second &#8212; so long as it ain&#8217;t them Anglos.

<p>This racism is emblematic in Anglophiles (the Charlies, Stevies and Andrews), having appropriated White culture. Go to <a href="http://lifeofaannie.blogspot.com/2020/05/the-unfortunate-political-appointments.html">Annie for example</a>. Each of her posts starts, without fail, with, &#8220;I&#8221;. I this, I that. &#8220;<span class="item-snippet">I have so far&#8230;&#8221; These are very narcissistic, selfish people.</span></p>

<p>See the arched bridge? How do you do it? How do you bend a piece of wood?</p>
<p>It is an all-timber engineering without bricks, mortar and nails that White people &#8212; and Anglophiles in coconut trees &#8212; can&#8217;t master even today. So much yada, yada.</p>

<p>*</p>
<h3>THE SECOND RETURN OF HONG KONG</h3>
 
<p>This is Hong Kong&#8217;s badge of security</p>
 
<p>*</p>
<p>Below, the actual documents, original in Chinese. Should disputes arise in interpretation, the Chinese language version will prevail.</p>
<p>Law is gazetted effective 23:00 hours June 30, 2020, and will cover media and Press propaganda in particular those circulated from Hong Kong, and affects individually and as group the reporter, editor and their sources even if unstated, even if the &#8216;source&#8217; works as toilet cleaner at the Reuters office.</p>
 
<h3>NSL in Nutshell</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Formal announcement (in translation): <span id="pressrelease" class="fontSize1">The Law of the People&#8217;s Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (the National Security Law) was gazetted for promulgation today (June 30) and took effect at 11pm the same day.</span> 
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Law has 66 Articles.</p>
<p>Principles</p>
<p>(&#8230;in non-legal English and shall not constitute a replacement of the original in Chinese.)</p>
<ul>
<li><span id="pressrelease" class="fontSize1">(1) The Office for Safeguarding National Security of the Central People&#8217;s Government (CPG) has an overarching responsibility for national security affairs relating to the HKSAR, while the HKSAR bears the constitutional duty of safeguarding national security. The CPG shall establish an office for safeguarding national security in the HKSAR;</span></li>
<li><span id="pressrelease" class="fontSize1">(2) The NSL is a national law and applicable throughout China but tailor-made for circumstances which, because of historical reasons, are most unusual in Hong Kong, itself subject to multiple threats from all sides, undermining as a result the People&#8217;s Republic of China. In safeguarding national security, the HKSAR shall uphold the principle of the rule of law;</span></li>
<li><span id="pressrelease" class="fontSize1">(3) The HKSAR shall establish and improve relevant institutions and their duties in safeguarding national security;</span></li>
<li><span id="pressrelease" class="fontSize1">(4) Stipulations are made on what constitutes four categories of crimes that endanger national security and their corresponding penalties; and, 
</span></li>
<li><span id="pressrelease" class="fontSize1">(5) Stipulations are made in relation to jurisdiction of cases, application of laws and procedures.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>*</p>
<p>Applications</p>
<p>(general categories)</p>
<ul>
<li>Under the CPG, Chinese government shall establish a distinct security department with its own personnel. D<span id="pressrelease" class="fontSize1">edicated units under the jurisdiction of the department have already been established and starts work July 1, 2020.</span></li>
<li><span id="pressrelease" class="fontSize1">A Committee for Safeguarding National Security of the HKSAR chaired by the Chief Executive will be established to take up national security affairs and bear the major responsibility for safeguarding national security. It will be under the supervision of and be accountable to the CPG.</span></li>
<li>Hong Kong Chief Executive can establish judges. <span id="pressrelease" class="fontSize1">A dedicated department under the Department of Justice is responsible for the prosecution of national security offences.&#160;</span><span id="pressrelease" class="fontSize1">Unless national secrets are involved, the trial shall be held in open court and all judgements be announced to the public.</span></li>
<li>News media, Press and organisations are not above the rule of law. They shall be equal before the law and, hence, subject to close monitored and their organizations and/or staff, individually or collectively liable.</li>
<li><span id="pressrelease" class="fontSize1">CPG can authorize investigating serious crimes under existing laws or under the National Security Law, investigations include intercept of communication and/or covert surveillance of persons suspected, on reasonable grounds, to have involved in the commission of a national security offence.</span></li>
<li>Under s<span id="pressrelease" class="fontSize1">pecified circumstances, a trial may be held outside the procedures previously defined, and includes trial in-camera. Specified circumstances are:</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span id="pressrelease" class="fontSize1">(a) the case is complex due to the involvement of a foreign country or external elements, thus making it difficult for the HKSAR to exercise jurisdiction over the case;</span></p>
<p><span id="pressrelease" class="fontSize1">(b) a serious situation occurs where the HKSAR Government is unable to effectively enforce the National Security Law; (Ed: in Chinese, the term unable includes unwilling, as had been repeatedly and previously demonstrated by Secretary for Justice Teresa Cheng) or 
</span></p>
<p><span id="pressrelease" class="fontSize1">(c) a major and imminent threat to national security has occurred.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Prosecutable offences include and not limited to:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
<ol>
<li>inciting hatred against the legitimate national Chinese or local government, and the sovereignty and sanctity of the nation of the People&#8217;s Republic,</li>
<li>damages and/or disruption to public/private infrastructure, including transport, electrical and electronic systems, thereby affecting essential functioning of society,</li>
<li>secession,</li>
<li>subversion,</li>
<li>terrorism,</li>
<li>spying.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Penalties in order of severity: minimum 3 years, 5 years, 10 years and up to life imprisonment, all without parole or good behavior-condition release. Funding anti-Chinese activities, even if it&#8217;s just a dime online, is minimum five years in slammer.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Like criminal law, the security law is applicable and, where practical, enforceable on foreigners resident in HK, Macau, Taiwan and mainland. Hence, the national character of the law.</li>
</ul>
<p>*</p>
<p>National Security and HSBC</p>
<p>PS: The term &#8216;nationality&#8217; is never discussed because Anglos presumed they know and they have the last word. Suffice to say, the Chinese word &#22269;&#27665; hold a different meaning. Consequently, the NSL also protects individual Chinese. An attack on one without provocation, without just cause, is an attack on all, that is the nation of Chinese. Meng Wanzhou is case in point, not because she is rich but because she is Chinese. This puts HSBC, its senior executives especially, liable under NSL. That, plus their money laundering past, their drug trade financing since 1841, and illicit transfer of monies to rioters, we swear they will pay. Don&#8217;t doubt the Chinese resolve to settle the score. Here&#8217;s a tip to Chinese serving HSBC: leave and disappear in the Amazon jungles.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>This time last year, 2019: Anglophiles</p>
 
 
<p>*</p>
<p>Yesterday, 2020: Second Return of HK</p>
 
<p>*</p>
 
<h3>How does freedom arise?</h3>
<p>Some two or three weeks ago, the Hong Kong Police launched a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/HKPChannel">YouTube site</a>.</p>
<p>In yesterday&#8217;s riots, July 1, they reported the event live, simultaneous from two or more locations, and while doing inserted announcements about where roads and areas (principally in Causeway Bay) had been blocked or closed because of the pro-US disturbances. The problem yesterday was small beer, the police had handled events 100 times worse.</p>
<p>In the live stream (below, 7 hours long) you can tell right off how the Press, typically Anglo-American ones, CNBC, Reuters and Mkini, lied in their reports, singularly to stick to the US spin of an anti-Chinese narrative campaign. That they believe their campaign will succeed to turn the Chinese against the authorities is because that sort of spin come from an Anglo-American (hence Anglophile) culture, facets of which you see a lot in Mkini, every day. In their culture, they regard authority as antagonistic, separate and outside of society.</p>
<p>Not so we Chinese. We see authorities &#8212; the police in particular &#8212; as social vanguards, with both duty and responsibility to serve us and protect us from enemies, even those within. (Also see the one from mainland China about the fireman, next clip.) Each time, each era they have lived up to the trust we place on them and expectations derived thereof. Conversely, enemies of the Chinese will be punished severely; the society demands it. Hence, the NSL.</p>
<p>So confident are we about our authorities that the live stream received 540,000 views within a space of ten hours.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s written in our old books in which freedom is such:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Let the prince be the prince, the minister be the minister, the father be the father, the son be the son&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>The British handover of Hong Kong on 1997 July 1 was a fraud because, ask yourself this, what did White people hand over? A bunch of Anglophile motherfuckers? Today, 23 years later, we wipe clean the slate. And we&#8217;d clear the deck of those motherfuckers, starting with the like of Claudia Mo Bowring &#8212; when we&#8217;re done with her, she&#8217;d be squealing like a pig.</p>
<p>That, or they better leave Chinese territory and go back to the land to which they owe their loyalty.</p>
<h3>2020, July 1</h3>
<h3>Truly Back to the Motherland</h3>
 
 
<p>This year&#8217;s celebration will be greater and more joyous than 1997.</p>

<h3>Where does the US want HK to go?</h3>
<p>The title immediately above is purely rhetorical, intended to help you understand real affairs by anchoring yourself to a specific phenomenon today, which requires understanding it, truly understand, in order to know what comes next. But prediction is easy. Put a kettle of water on a fire, predict the outcome.</p>
<p>For our purpose we pick Kosovo because it is a short, illustrative case contained in clip below.</p>
<p>A precedent example is important because it gives a real life feel, coming from the past, but detached from the propaganda that surrounds us, when delivered to us by the like of Reuters and Malaysiakini. Such propaganda would be delivered under titles like, &#8220;US Senate passed a HK Autonomy Act&#8221;, &#8220;protection of human rights&#8221;, &#8220;save Malaysia&#8221; or &#8220;Stand with Hong Kong&#8221;.</p>
<p>Below is Kosovo as it is happening, though you won&#8217;t see it from Reuters (for obvious reasons). It&#8217;s unnecessary for our purpose to know the detail history so the nugget of information provided is sufficient: Breakup of Yugoslavia, US material and ideological support, a Kosovo &#8216;freedom fighter&#8217; becoming President, Clinton, and so&#8230;.</p>
<p>America&#8217;s Crimes Against Humanity</p>
 
<p>Now, after the above, see the next clip below. Before that&#8230;</p>
<p>It is intended to show that political games played, say, today, by the like of US, its agents such as Joseph Lim Guan Eng or Martin Lee or Joshua Wong (next segment) have real life consequences. These consequences are often most unexpected, and comes down on a leisurely Sunday.</p>
<p>By consequences we mean the price paid to play those games. This may be paid days or years later, but always paid for by other people which we typically say, &#8216;the innocent&#8217;. Often those consequences are innocuous. But, if you&#8217;d take the trouble, it is possible to trace backwards, to the origins, i.e. roots &#8212; empirically &#8212; to the US and the like of the Lims, Lees and Wongs.</p>
<p>In another phrasing, the clip below showing the family below suddenly ended. To see why, you&#8217;d have to go back to Kosovo clip. Even though happening in two different spacetime, the same unseen forces are involved, the identical forces.</p>
<p>The energy force that boils water a thousand years ago, still boils water today.</p>

<p>*</p>
<p>The Moment Death visited a Family 
</p>
 
<p>Clip Explanation</p>
<p><span class="style-scope yt-formatted-string" dir="auto">The distressing footage shows the moment playtime turned to death and mayhem as an airstrike struck in Iraq. Two were killed, reportedly members of the Kurdistan Workers&#8217; Party (PKK), while the six wounded were apparently all from the same family.</span></p>
<p><span class="style-scope yt-formatted-string" dir="auto">Footage shows the moment they are playing in a river. Then a loud bang. It is north of Sulaimani city, a popular place for families to go on picnics.</span></p>
<p><span class="style-scope yt-formatted-string" dir="auto">Since June 15, </span><span class="style-scope yt-formatted-string" dir="auto">Turkey conducts daily airstrikes on northern Iraq, taking over from where America left off in the latter&#8217;s efforts to break up Iraq and Syria, the latter bordering Sulaimani, as was Yugoslavia broken up, hence Kosovo, as is still being carried out in Hong Kong and Xinjiang. 
</span></p>
<p>*</p>

<p>Now, return to Hong Kong. Below perfectly illustrates the games (talked earlier about) being played. We know how that game will end up, that is, like Kosovo, like the Iraqi family.</p>
<p>How do we know?</p>
<p>Because you see the same forces involved, the same sort of propaganda, the same daily spin, the same MO. It is as easy as predicting the outcome of putting a pot of water under a fire. The water will boil.</p>
<p>*</p>
<h3>What dogs say behind closed doors?</h3>
<p>Hear from Joshua Wong et al (below) what the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/fakedemocraticparties/videos/2641050502831414/">Mike Pompeo&#8217;s State Department has been telling</a> them recently, and in their turn what Wong tells his &#8216;freedom fighters&#8217;. Listening to the clip, you have an idea as to the subject of their conversations as well as the broad general direction into,</p>
<ul>
<li>what had transpired between the US and pro-US <a href="https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/531800">&#8216;pro-democracy&#8217;</a> politicians prior to the Hong Kong coup attempt launched in June 2019,</li>
<li>what was exchanged between the ex-Kosovo fascist president and the US State department,</li>
<li>what was exchange between the US and Ukraine&#8217;s <span class="ILfuVd"><span class="e24Kjd">Petro Poroshenko,</span></span> the fascist leader who seized power after the Maidan coup of 2014, and</li>
<li>what the US instructs <a href="https://www.malaysiakini.com/">Malaysiakini</a>, Steven Gan et al. It&#8217;s all the same MO.</li>
</ul>
<p>The clip is in Chinese, and for those who don&#8217;t understand it, below are the <a href="https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/531800">talking points HK&#8217;s pro-US, politicians</a>. They are the same from a year ago we know about:</p>
<ul>
<li>(a) financial payments of 20,000 to 30,000 per person,</li>
<li>(b) persevere, continue to attack Hong Kong government,</li>
<li>(c) reassurance that money is no problem, and</li>
<li>(c) if you need to run away from the law, Pompeo&#8217;s doors are open.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="title style-scope ytd-video-primary-info-renderer">&#28207;&#29544;&#32068;&#32340;&#12300;&#39321;&#28207;&#30526;&#24535;&#12301;&#20839;&#37096;&#26371;&#35696;&#35611;&#35441;&#22823;&#26333;&#20809;&#65281;</h3>
<h3 class="title style-scope ytd-video-primary-info-renderer">&#20098;&#28207;&#20808;&#37586;&#40643;&#20043;&#37586;&#20043;&#27969; &#36067;&#28207;&#36067;&#22283;&#20043;&#24677;&#26292;&#38706;&#28961;&#36986;&#65281;</h3>
 
<p>*</p>
<p>While all that Joshie shit goes on behind closed doors, this is what Joshua Wong tweets to the public &#8212; almost the same day &#8212; mouthing the same platitudes, seeking a place in parliament although he has been instigating school kids to riot, although he has concluded Hong Kong has no democracy, no universal suffrage, and no freedom &#8212; the same talking points regurgitated by Reuters, NYT and Malaysiakini.</p>
 
<p>Can you see why we are going to finish him (and others) this year, never mind what the Anglophone world says. For a reminder to the answer: Go back to Kosovo, to the family in Sulaimani, Iraq.</p>
<p>We conclude this segment with Max Blumenthal&#8217;s expose on the US propaganda regime directed by the CIA front, the National Endowment for Democracy which also (happens) to pay Steven Gan and sponsors Malaysiakini.</p>
<p>Blumenthal&#8217;s reporting (below) is self-explanatory. But, from it, can you tell the identical MO in US directing and fabricating tales of torture and supposed human rights abuses that, invariably, are the prelude to regime change? (It happened in Libya, Iraq, and happening in Iran and Venezuela.)</p>
<ul>
<li>The North Korea Human Rights Act and the Hong Kong Human Rights Act.</li>
<li>Park Yeonmi and Joshua Wong.</li>
<li>The exploitation of children for political purposes: When feted in western Press, Park was 15; Wong 14. Greta Thurnberg was 16. Of the 9,000 plus arrested in the HK 2019 riots since last June, 41 percent were under 18, some still in Standard 6 primary. Kids were paid to disguise as Press reporters; last month one arrested in a riot was 13, two weeks ago 11. In the Tiananmen riots, Chinese agents for the US used children to buy food and go to the market.</li>
<li>The Oslo Freedom Forum for North Korea and for China. 
</li>
<li>The unrelenting use of especially Anglophone Press propaganda, all controlled by the US, media distributed across America, from UK and Malaysia. For example, <a href="https://www.ted.com/speakers/yeonmi_park">Park appears on TED talks</a>, never mind the endless lies.</li>
<li>Never ending contradictory accounts which are internally inconsistent, and always, always impossible to verify.</li>
<li>The same talking points: freedom, human rights, democracy.</li>
<li>The paid uses of support opposition political and NGO groups, in Malaysia represented by Charles Santiago, Rais Hussin, Yeo Bee Yin, but usually people formerly from the media or academics who can put together a spin, with some coherence, hopefully.</li>
<li>Bribery, lots of money changing hands. Park was paid a base sum of US$12,500 a month (speaking fees are separate for example, and expenses), three times the US per capita income, and not bad for an ex-North Korean farm girl. Joshua Wong gets a lump sum payment for each propaganda project, from the NED alone US$250,000 as &#8216;consultant fee&#8217; for the Occupy Central project in 2014 when he was 18. In his personal bio distributed to the Press he was described at the time to be a University of HK student but if you check the enrollment there, his name won&#8217;t show up. He had only registered for an external certificate course after failing his university entrance exam. All these are matters of record but the Press will never verify. Why? Because it interferes with the spin &#8212; Student Activist, Poster Boy of Democracy, a <a href="https://twitter.com/joshuawongcf/status/1274608542247337984">David and Goliath</a>., the last of which, if you think it through, has to be for an Anglophile and western market only because the Chinese never heard of those names much less appreciate the biblical metaphor.</li>
</ul>
<p>An Anglophile sucker is born every minute.</p>

<p>Now, you can see why the West, Anglo-America in particular

<li>
<ul>
<li>(a) want China destroyed and</li>
<li>(b) want regime change from Bolivia and Venezuela to Iran and Syria.</li>

<h3>THE CANCER WITHIN</h3>
<p>The story we hear have been the same everywhere, in every poor country we touched base with.</p>
<p>It is the same colonial MO, why Mexico is kept poor, why Africa, and why India wishes to keep weak all its neighbors, from Pakistan and Nepal to Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. The flip side: imagine what a strong country can do.</p>
<p>Along comes China, saying &#8212; and actually doing it the next day:</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll help you build a strong country. For we ourselves are the proof!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then we see that that the biggest stumbling block isn&#8217;t the American or European or White people. The reason is because we don&#8217;t need them, not their money, not their technology, not their language nor their God and people.</p>
<p>Rather the problem is with our own people: the enemies inside, neo-colonial slaves, apologists and especially the dogs &#8212; Anglophiles &#8212; people like Steven Gan and Rais Hussin and Joseph Lim Guan Eng and Joshua Wong and Anson Maria Elizabeth Chan.</p>
<p>Those within our borders, and they are just a handful of loud-mouths, the Joshies and the Ansons, we can deal with and we&#8217;ll fix them. But the Stevies and Rais Hussins? Their own country must deal with them.</p>
<p>Kill the motherfuckers we say!</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a national, democratic human right &#8212; to be alive, to be rich, to be strong, to be independent, truly independent, to have your own culture, in control of your own destiny and thoughts, all of which requires one to be freed from the cancer within, the White man&#8217;s underlings first and foremost.</p>

<h3>Confirms China-US Bipolar World Order</h3>
<p>What does Beidou mean for the World?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>June 23 is the day the last of the Beidou satellite system of 30 is firmly in place.</li>
<li>It demonstrates China&#8217;s ability to protect its assets in space from American attacks.</li>
<li>Chinese global reach of its military, technology and economic power is now confirmed to equal USA. Each time America hijacks a ship or attack a country, or deliver guns to Taiwan, we&#8217;ll know in seconds exactly where and when.</li>
<li>Any country that wants the same information are welcomed to ask us. Payment via Taobao and in Renmimbi. No US dollars please. Russian ruble is okay. Gold is better.</li>
<li>When Hong Kong rioters gather to rally and burn, we will also know where and when. We will even have profile photos of the ringleaders. Prosecution will be a breeze. When they run off to Taiwan in fishing boats, we will have the precise co-ordinates to blow the vessels out of the water.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/brianleungkp?lang=en">Brian Leung Kai-ping </a><span class="st">&#26753;&#32380;&#24179;, below, we know where you are, which city, street, which floor. We got Beidou to help us; it&#8217;s better than GPS! If not this year then next, but sooner or later, you have to pay up for the destruction of the Hong Kong Legislative chambers. Remember July 1, 2019? The bill is HK$50 million. Of course, if you like to know, the remaining cost to Hong Kong <a href="https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201911/06/P2019110600524.htm">repairs and restoration</a> is HK$8 billion. That&#8217;s not yet counting the cost of two lives, now dead, and the medical bills to 3,000 injuries. You could ask Uncle Sam for the money. The Fed has only to press, Print. And from you, we accept US dollars! Or you might ask Mike Pompeo. Even Nancy Pelosi; we hear she is worth at least US$380 million, the richest woman in Congress. Democracy costs money, and is expensive, No? BTW, you should read your Bible more often and listen to Jesus: Vengeance is ours.</span><span class="st">)</span></p>

<h3>ANGLOPHILE DOG WITH JUST A LOT OF BARK</h3>
 
<p>Clip&#8217;s main storyline:</p>
<p>With nothing of substance, and incompetent and corrupt to the core, India relies on ethnicity and religious division to mobilize a nation, like all Anglophiles (like Anglophile Malaysia?), like White Anglo-America, and like the way it conduct its foreign relations. A third rate country but with so much spittle, blowing lots of air. So Anglophile.</p>

<p>The general outline is accurate. In the details, though, they were numerous errors: where the fleets were built, by whom, names of places Zheng He had docked, causes of domestic wars, why the voyages were abandoned, China&#8217;s internal conditions at the time.</p>
<p>Regardless, you get a taste of what those voyages meant to China and the world, as well as the cultural, technological and military superiority of the Chinese. Recall that it was 100 years before the Europeans sailed into the oceans; the US and the UK hadn&#8217;t yet existed. Nor Australia, Canada and New Zealand.</p>
<p>History would have been vastly different had China continued the voyages: no colonialism, no White imperialism, no slavery, and no Black Lives Matter. The Chinese would then take nothing that didn&#8217;t belong to them so that the idea of an &#8220;assertive China&#8221; is typical Anglophone propaganda, Anglophiles preoccupied with their juvenile idea of &#8216;power.&#8217;</p>

<h3>THE ANGLOPHILE NIGGERS OF AMERICA</h3>
 
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;The 20th Century Uncle Tom: You can always tell him apart (from the White man). He has no interest in any religion of his own. He believes in a White Jesus, a White Mary, White Angels, White Christmas. He wants to be so White that when he dies he can go to a White heaven. &#8230;</p>
<p>With the White man, he wants to eat with him, he wants to sleep with him, he wants to marry his woman, his daughter, sister, and if you didn&#8217;t watch him closely enough he will marry your wife.</p>
<p>But all this is not his fault. It&#8217;s the result of 400 years of brain washing. It has taken a man black on the outside and turned him white on the inside; his brains is white, his heart is white so that when he talks he is talking down to you &#8212; like the White man&#8230;.&#8221; &#8212; Malcolm X, Speech 1963, Michigan.</p>

<p>A 5,000-year-old proud and accomplished nation &#8212; that is, China and the Chinese &#8212; will see the end of the Anglophiles.</p>
<p>We will right the wrongs of history, as much as is possible, that were committed on a global scale, for hundreds of years, enslaving millions upon millions, from the aborigines of Australia to Canada. History must be returned to its rightful path &#8212; the true people of their lands.</p>

<h3>THE ANGLOPHILE THAMBIS OF INDIA</h3>
<p>A Third Rate Power</p>
<p>From Slavery to White Man&#8217;s Poodle Dog 
</p>
<p>This brief post is about the legacy of Western colonialism, today being accompanied by the decline of the Anglo-American Anglophiles, before acting like a bullying colonialist power all because they speaka Inglish, feted in London and Washington, feeling great surrounded by coattails in timber reading rooms, raised on a Jane Austen diet, eat with a knife and fork, play cricket, have soccer clubs, calling themselves Manchester United, having learned to count (improperly) in English, and therefore, feels superior and sufficient to make them to feel powerful over people. Like Anglophiles in Malaysia&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>like Stevie Wonder Gan,</li>
<li>like Lady Annie,</li>
<li>like Hannah Yeoh,</li>
<li>like Ambiga,</li>
<li>like Maria Chin,</li>
<li>like Kadir Jasin,</li>
<li>like Rais Hussin,</li>
<li>like Phar Kim Boy,</li>
<li>like Mahathir Mohamad,</li>
<li>like Joseph Lim Guan Eng,</li>
<li>like Nathaniel Tan,</li>
<li>like Wong Chen,</li>
<li>like Joshie Hong,</li>
<li>like Bob Teoh,</li>
<li>and on and on and on and on&#8230; the entire shebang. (For another partial list, see <a href="http://www.rockybru.com.my/">this</a> where they even name themselves after some white motherfucker, a people without pride, without roots, and will happily suck some White dick all because cozying up to White man makes them feel great: &#8220;Why you no speaka Inglish?&#8220;)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>*</p>
<p>Well, with the decline of the West, the Thambi&#8217;s Anglophile days are over.</p>
<p>Clip immediately below explains the origins of India&#8217;s fight with China but it also informs about the beginnings of the Indian&#8217;s Anglophile days, his conceit and his endless fights with the neighbors, Nepal, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, even poor, poor Maldives, an ocean away.</p>
<p>Oddly, the explaining had to be done by Russians (certainly not by Anglophiles) who, from afar, are able to see the obvious and see things clearer than especially the people inside India, or those Indians who migrated to Anglo-America imaging it as a superior pot of milk and honey. There is no mystery to the Indian myopia: When the Anglophile copies White ways, they also copy the latter&#8217;s racist bigotry.</p>
<p>And, the Russian explanation is correct because, before the latest troubles from India, recall the mamak Kutty named Mahathir Mohamad: Same Anglophile culture, same warmongering attitude, same bigotry, same racism.</p>
<p>So fond are Anglophiles for White culture that they believe only White people know how to govern, have democracy, are humane, have human rights, and can do science and be rich. All this in spite of their barbaric, voodoo religious culture and their genocidal and murderous records, their treatment of weaker peoples, all happening today even in Anglophile countries like India where the Anglophile elite routinely order the killing of minorities (Never reported. But see, for example, writings by <span class="ILfuVd"><span class="e24Kjd">Arundhati Roy.</span></span>) Hence, to combat the inconvenient historical truths, they rely on Press propaganda to change the story, in the same way Anglo-America relies on the same, for example, in those narratives coming out of Reuters and Malaysiakini.</p>
<p>Notice, too, that the same Anglophile racist bigotry is at work in Hong Kong: the US/UK meddling and the Anglophiles (supported by propaganda from Indians in HK) rioting for a year in order to drive out the Chinese from their land on the pseudo justification that they were raised in Anglo-Saxon culture and therefore Hong Kong belongs to Anglo-America (see, for example, Horace Chin Wan &#38515;&#20113;&#26681; and Jack Lee Kai-tik &#26446;&#21855;&#36842;<span>)</span>. The point isn&#8217;t whether such justifications make sense &#8212; they are not intended for that purpose. The point, instead, is who wields the power and who has the gun to hang on to the Truth. 
</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Origins of India&#8217;s Anglophile Wars</p>
 
<p>*</p>
 
<p>Question: Why is the White American government willing to watch its people die?</p>
<p>Answer, because four in five deaths are not Whites but natives, Blacks, other minorities and people of color. Anyway, White people who die are almost entirely old people.</p>
<h3>THE ANGLOPHILE AZLEES OF MALAYSIA</h3>
<p>The Anglo-American way of watching people die is, in the words, below, of the Anglophile <a href="https://twitter.com/fatbidin?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Zan Azlee</a>, just &#8220;pruning&#8221; the world of the weaker and inferior species. And Azlee works at Malaysiakini, where they share the same bigotry, steeped in the same Anglophile culture, speaking the same English, and all equally imbecile and illiterate.</p>
<p>See what I mean in saying, the Anglophiles inherit the Anglo Saxon racist bigotry. Would Zan Azlee have any qualms working for Hitler in the Auschwitz gas chambers? Answer, No! &#8220;I am,&#8221; he&#8217;d say, &#8220;just helping Mother Nature prune dead leaves.&#8221;</p>
<p>A vestige of a White colonial legacy, there are millions of these Anglophile Azlee motherfuckers running around the world who can&#8217;t see how sick in the head they are but believe, instead, themselves to be a superior specie.</p>

<li class="sidebox"><h2>Erich Maria Remarque</h2>			<p>"No," he said quickly. "Never. Stay friends? Try to grow a small rose garden on the ashes of broken feelings? No, this will never work for you and me. It happens only after small affairs and it looks fake. Love should not be spoiled by friendship." 
* 
No one can become stranger than the person you once loved. 
* 
How clumsy a person behaves when he is truly in love! How quickly his self-confidence fades! And how lonely he feels; all his praised experience seems to be gone, just like fog, and he feels so weak and helpless. 
* 
Love cannot stand explanations. It requires actions. Love wants to be eternal. That is the source of the torture it causes us. 
* 
"I have always thought a woman should not tell a man she is in love with him. Her shining and happy eyes should bear witness to that." 
* 
"You have to break your principles sometimes. Otherwise they bring you no joy." 
* 
"Whatever you can&#8217;t get always seems better than whatever you have. This is the romance and the stupidity of our life." 
* 
"Nothing&#8217;s lost yet," I said. "You only lose someone when he&#8217;s dead." 
*

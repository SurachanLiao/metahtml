They hurt one Chinese cop, all 1.4 bn Chinese will go after them.



This photo taken on Wednesday shows a protester (left) using a sharp object against a Hong Kong police officer (right), who was trying to detain a man (center) during an illegal rally. The man suspected of stabbing the officer in the shoulder was arrested on board a flight that was about to take off for London.

DEMOCRACY’S REIGN OF TERROR

The clip doesn’t show it, but here is the background before the above video starts:

Scene is Causeway Bay district near the main Hong Kong Central Library. A group of rioters, one of them holding a US flag, had strewn bricks dug up from pavements, using them as missiles against the police, while attempting to block the traffic light junction with garbage bins, etc. When police charged, a lone policeman chases after one of them who appeared to be directing the blockade. The chase crossed the road, and the video starts.

That rioter is in red shirt. But when the police caught up with him, they both fell. Policeman is surrounded by other rioters and a bunch of Press photographers, most of who — and this is standard riot SOP — are themselves rioters disguised in the yellow Press vest. (Press passes can be obtained at HK$20 each from the US NED-funded Hong Kong Journalists Association, HKAJ, no accreditation nor vetting necessary. The HKAJ along with two political parties were organizers of the riots since last June, 2019. The vests are optional with separate payment.)

The man to watch out for is on the left hand side of the screen, appearing with others from behind the pedestrian steel railing. He is in dark grey shirt, wearing a cap and repeatedly stabs the policeman on the shoulders as the latter got up, still hanging on to the suspect. (This is dedication to work.) Red shirt manages to free himself and escaped with another friend in sleeveless T-shirt. As they ran, the ‘Press’ disperse and doesn’t intervene to help the policeman soon soaking in blood. Note, for example, a girl in yellow Press vest in front of the injured policeman, nonchalant.

None of all that is new. But contrast the situation (and events of the past) with years of Press propaganda reports (SCMP, New York Times, Washington Post, CNN), all drawn from pro-US Anglophile politicians who repeat the lie — repeated from Washington to London and in Mkini, Reuters offices — that China is suppressing all freedoms, freedom of expression, freedom of Press, silencing dissent, and that the new national security law would end HK autonomy, democracy and, with that, even more freedoms.

Yet, without these freedoms, these ‘democracy protesters’ (sic), continue their assault on the police, and that Causeway Bay incident was just one of 17 injuries caused on July 1, 2020. They included a policeman resting inside a parked police car that was set ablaze. Another three were injured after they were rammed by a motorcycle, flying the ISIS-like black flag from the rear seat.

Without those freedoms, they have the past year managed to injure more than 160 policemen, almost all ending up in hospitals, one set alight with gasoline bomb, a dozen attacked with acid.

Even without their freedoms, they manage to disrupt daily lives, attacked 91 subway Metros, and inflicted street terror on ordinary people, on top of arson and other terrorist acts.

UNIVERSITY OF HONG KONG — AGAIN!

The man in dark shirt with an ice pick was masked from head to toe (top photo). But within six hours we identified that motherfucker then got him after he had cleared airport immigration, the plane door had closed, seated in his chair on a Cathay Pacific flight to London with a British National (Overseas) passport. His father was distraught (interview clip below):

“It is the fault of the Hong Kong University (HKU). They are the worse, they forced him, they won’t leave him alone and they don’t care if he has graduated…,” but they made him join the anti-Chinese demonstrations.

The arrested suspect, Wong, age 24, was an engineering graduate of the HKU. Structured and largely taught by Anglo-American professors using English as the sole medium of instruction, the university is a racist, poisoned, anti-Chinese institution created in the exact image of Anglo-American universities.

We Chinese have a long, long memory.

But first, we’ll hammer that fucker with at least four charges which in combination will put him away for the rest of his life. Guaranteed! Next, we will hunt down and nail all his accomplices on that day, including his HKU girlfriend. After that his university mates and teachers, including the university vice-chancellor. These days, we have just the law to deal with all of them. In serious cases such as this one, trials can be conducted outside Hong Kong without those motherfucking Anglophile judges presiding.

To avoid facing the law and possibly jail, Steven Gan can run off to the US, his protector. This happened in dozens of cases in HK. Gan’s passport must be confiscated forthwith…

JAIL FOR AN ANGLOPHILE

Malaysiakini and its editor Steven Gan are on trial not because of any absence of law. There are on trial for contempt, that is, for the presence of a law that holds the sanctity and the integrity of the judicial system beyond any doubt. Arguments follow…

They hold in contempt not just the judiciary but all institutions of the government, including the King and the Parliament. The latest example of that contempt is given above, telling off the court to ‘be reasonable’. This means that, if Mkini and Gan are convicted, Premesh Chandran is saying, the court is ‘unreasonable’ and even restricts the freedom of speech. Premesh’s speech is clearly an attempt to assert pressure on the court and undermine its independence in favor of Mkini. He and on behalf of Mkini clearly don’t care for the underlying principle of sub-judice, and they regard themselves as superior to court decisions. That’s contempt.

They hold in contempt by relying not just on the spin and the omissions they commit in their so-called ‘news and views’ but also with anonymous hatchet jobs committed through an army of anonymous readers, who clearly and unmistakably, support their work financially. This sort of speech-contempt is contained in Mkini’s court argument (above top image-extract). It is that there is no such law to restrict online posting therefore Mkini can permit anything in by shifting the burden of proof for an assertion that is never falsifiable. Which is, Steven Gan didn’t know. Instead of the Christian preacher proving that God exists, Mkini’s argument requires the church congregation to prove there isn’t any. This kind of syllogism and mental somersault are passe and trite and Steven Gan must be called out — and, because they employ it, must be made to pay for the trickery. That’s contempt.

Mkini et al hold themselves to be accountable to nobody, other than their foreign sponsors, on the pretext-premise that freedom of the Press is above the law, indeed above everything, so that they spit at the constitution which insists all are equal before the law. They hold as their motto: ‘Speaking Truth to Power‘ as if only they have possession of the truth (whatever that is) and that, dressed as free Press, all power is theirs while all other powers are fair game to be undermined. In freedom of speech, they insist that speech is not an act, even though this is demonstrably false: ISIS, Iraq, Zakir Naik et al. That’s contempt.

If Steven Gan doesn’t know beforehand the existence of a contemptuous post, then he must produce the administrator who knew and who let that in. If the administrator doesn’t know, then Gan must produce the subscribers who posted those comments. Where does the buck stop? Yet he will do none of the above, again on the pretext of freedom of speech, in effect giving not only himself a free pass but also anyone who gives money to Mkini! That’s contempt.

There are other, extenuating circumstances that clearly indicate Mkini and Gan to be subversive forces that undermine the State of Malaysia and its position vis-a-vis the rest of the world:

Being started, financed, and corralled into existence by the USA, which makes regime change and international subversion of legitimate governments (Ukraine, Venezuela, Russia, China) as their corner stone of foreign policy, the foreign financing makes Mkini and Gan complicit, direct and active participants in US propaganda agenda and unlawful objectives. That’s contempt.



That they actively collude with the US to break international law, in crimes against humanity, to propagate self-serving foreign-armed aggression (Iran, Syria, Libya), to break normal relationships among nations and neighboring states (China, Philippines), to violate sovereignty of independent states (Venezuela, Cuba), and to foment violations of law within the borders of respective countries (China, Nicaragua, Bolivia). That’s contempt.



That, in cahoots with the US foreign and financial interest, Mkini attempts to influence domestic politics, thereby undermining the UN safeguards for non-interference and the UN respect for the sovereignty of other states. A Malaysian example is the 14th General Elections: Mkini colluded with US interests (such as its Department of Justice) in order to influence public perception and thereby undermine the credibility of the then Malaysian government of Najib Razak so as to totally replace it. That’s contempt.



Acting in Malaysia, which has international obligations, and bound by Malaysian laws, the activities of Mkini and Steven Gan have ramifications on Malaysia’s national prestige abroad. Following in the footsteps of Reuters and Anglo-America, Mkini weaponizes — indeed, profits from — racist hatred and hatred for indigenous governments on an international scale to serve White man’s imperialist goals. None of Mkini activities, past and present, must be tolerated anymore. Enough is enough.

The danger of Mkini doing the work of its master, the USA, is plain for all to see in Hong Kong. There it has the Hong Kong Free Press and Apple Daily, both financed and directed by the CIA ‘NGO’ front the National Endowment for Democracy (NED).

Mkini and its editors on its behalf must go to jail to serve as an example for the rest of the Press corp that the destiny of Malaysia is not for them to play with, that Malaysia doesn’t belong to Gan’s mother, that their days of acting with impunity are over, and that no matter who their rich and powerful masters may be, they are not above the law. That is, Malaysia’s judges must reassert the sovereign independence of the country they serve.

The decision of the court (below) is therefore correct! Next, go straight to jail.



The comeuppance of Mkini and Steven Gan has been long time coming…

WHITE WORSHIPPING

ANGLOPHILE PENANG-LANG

That, the above, is the Francis Light statue, and below is the Star newspaper report and note how, even 150 years later, they are so brain washed as to look at White people as saviors.

People like Mohd Kamal bin Abdullah who posted the article have no sense of national pride, nor history, nor a sense of racial and colonial justice, nothing, except to see White people as deliverers of culture, manners, thoughts, language, the ballot paper, and introduced God and Jane Austen to Kamal’s stupid, illiterate, uncivilized pendatang voodoo-barbarian grandparents from Sumatra.

This Kamal fella is exactly like Stevie Wonder Gan and Premesh ‘Speak Truth to Power’ Chandran: an Anglophile always an Anglophile and Penang is full of these Anglo imitation motherfuckers. Here’s another moronic Anglophile Penang lang.

Francis Light is founder? Kamal has proof Francis Light ‘founded’ the town? What does Kamal mean by founded? Light paved roads and introduced horse carts? As ‘founder’, Francis Light gave civilization to Kamal, taught him how to read in English, eat from plates not banana leaves, nibble scones in marmalade, and taught him how to fuck another Malaiyoo from the backside, like Anwar Ibrahim?

Vandals? How does Kamal know they are vandals? He met and interrogated them, and they confessed to being ‘vandals’? Maybe Penang showers in red paint.

Why vandals, and not ‘freedom fighters’? Or anti-racists?

This Kamal podah …. Like Anglos, Anglophiles are convinced Columbus ‘founded’ — better yet, ‘discovered’ — America. For bigoted racist Anglophiles, history begins only with the Omputih, such nice people with an “English sense fairness” (the Malaiyoo Anglophile Zaid Ibrahim said that):

GEORGE TOWN: Vandals have splashed red paint on the statue of George Town founder Captain Francis Light here. The statue was erected 84 years ago to commemorate Francis Light’s contribution to the founding of George Town. Checks by The Star showed that the statue had been cleaned but some paint marks were still visible. The statue is a historical landmark in Penang and is located within the grounds of the famous Fort Cornwallis here. It was sculpted by FJ Wilcoxson and cast at Burton’s Foundry in Thames Ditton, England. It was erected to celebrate the 150th anniversary of George Town.

The fucking statue should be brought down and thrown into the Malacca Straits or, more profitably, used to pave roads. Instead, it is treated like deity and demi-god.

The world from Minneapolis to London is finally waking up to BLM, something we Chinese knew all along, that is, White racism but in Malaysia, slow as always, still worship their White masters, like Stevie, like Premesh, like Kamal. What a pile of spineless, multi-culti muhibbah Anglophile shit.

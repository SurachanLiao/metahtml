Trauma resulting from emergency situations, such as acts of terrorism or natural disasters, affects us all, directly or indirectly, and can be devastating, according to the National Center for Trauma-Informed Care. It is essential that the behavioral healthcare system is able to aggressively respond to the immediate and long-term behavioral health care needs of those adversely affected by trauma. OhioMHAS collaborates with many partners to develop strategies to meet the behavioral health care needs of Ohioans - during emergencies or after traumatic experiences.

	<p>Trauma resulting from emergency situations, such as acts of terrorism or natural disasters, affects us all, directly or indirectly, and can be devastating, according to the <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/nctic" target="_blank">National Center for Trauma-Informed Care</a>.&#160;It is essential that the behavioral healthcare system is able to aggressively respond to the immediate and long-term behavioral health care needs of those adversely affected by trauma. OhioMHAS collaborates with many partners to develop strategies to meet the behavioral health care needs of Ohioans -&#160;during emergencies or after traumatic experiences.</p>

It&#8217;s undeniable that Norway&#8217;s landscapes are breathtaking, so when someone disrupts the land in some way, we often scowl. But what if that disruption barely scratches the surface of the landscape, blending into nature in a way that is unmatched?<br>

<br>
The Hunting Lodge by Snohetta is the perfect example of that. This lodge set deep in the western mountains of Norway along the Akrafjorden Fjord looks to be one with nature. It&#8217;s expertly crafted utilizing steel beam construction that&#8217;s covered with timber. Its top is covered in green moss that matches the landscape, hiding it from planes or helicopters that might pass above. The result is a beautiful, warm and cozy getaway that can only be reached by horseback or foot. It can house up to 21 people, and it has a central fireplace to mark the gathering point. <p>It&#8217;s undeniable that Norway&#8217;s landscapes are breathtaking, so when someone disrupts the land in some way, we often scowl.

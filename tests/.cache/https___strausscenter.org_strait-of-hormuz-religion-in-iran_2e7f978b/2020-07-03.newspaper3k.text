Sunni and Shi'i are the two largest branches of Islam, with the overwhelming majority of Iranians practicing Shi'i Islam. About 90 percent of Iranians practice Shi'ism, the official religion of Iran.[i] By contrast, most Arab states in the Middle East are predominantly Sunni.

The rift between Shi'is and Sunnis occurred early in Islamic history when the Muslim community split over who should succeed the Prophet Muhammad as the caliph, or "leader of the community." Shi'is, followers of Muhammad's son-in-law Ali, believe that only descendents of the prophet should be leaders of society. Sunnis believe members of the community, or shura, should consult and decide on who the caliph should be. The disagreement has historically resulted in schism and civil war.[ii]

Although religious tensions between Shiite Iran and its Sunni Arab neighbors have not entirely subsided, Iran's regional relations have improved over the last decade, particularly with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE):

"The rapprochement with Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf states exemplifies the increasing importance of economics in Iran's foreign policy...Iran has been able to reverse its policies in the Gulf without serious internal opposition or dissent, which suggests that most elites recognize the need for better relations with the Gulf states."[iii]

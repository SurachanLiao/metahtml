Soleimani, a cunning and ruthless military commander, was the mastermind behind Iran&#8217;s relentless drive to achieve a regional hegemony in the Middle East. His major achievements include securing Bashar al-Assad&#8217;s victory in the Syrian civil war; turning Iraq into an Iranian satellite; making Hezbollah into a potent and well-equipped military force; igniting the Houthi rebellion in Yemen; overseeing the development of sophisticated drones and cruise missiles which, in a massive September 2019 attack on Saudi oil facilities, showed they can evade U.S. dense air-defenses; and accelerating Iran&#8217;s march to the bomb since the U.S. withdrew from the 2015 nuclear&#160;deal.</p>
<p>The United States struck a significant and potentially risky blow against Iran, killing the leader of the nation&#8217;s elite Quds Force in an airstrike in&#160;Iraq.</p>
<p>The Pentagon confirmed the death of Quds Force Commander General Qassem Soleimani in a statement late Thursday, saying the strike was launched, &#8220;at the direction&#8221; of U.S. President Donald&#160;Trump.</p>
<p>It further described the strike as a &#8220;decisive defensive action to protect U.S. personnel&#160;abroad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;General Soleimani was actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region,&#8221; the statement&#160;said.</p>
<p>&#8220;This strike was aimed at deterring future Iranian attack plans,&#8221; it said. &#8220;The United States will continue to take all necessary action to protect our people and our interests wherever they are around the&#160;world.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Defense Department statement shared few details of the strike itself, but Iraqi officials said a rocket struck a convoy traveling near Baghdad International Airport late&#160;Thursday.</p>
<p>Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the deputy commander of Iranian-backed Iraqi militias, known as the Popular Mobilization Forces, also died in the strike, Iraqi officials said, adding other top officials may have been killed, as&#160;well.</p>
<p>Even before the U.S. Defense Department confirmed the strike on Soleimani, photos claiming to show the Iranian general&#8217;s lifeless body were circulating on social&#160;media.</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told CNN on Friday that the strike killing the Quds Force commander thwarted an attack on&#160;Americans.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was actively plotting in the region to take actions &#8212; a big action, as he described it &#8212; that would have put dozens, if not hundreds, of American lives at risk. We know it was imminent,&#8221; Pompeo&#160;said.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, the State Department said the secretary of state phoned British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab and German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas to discuss the &#8220;defensive action to eliminate&#8221; Soleimani, and thanked them for their &#8220;recent statements&#8221; recognizing the continuing aggressive threat from Iran and its Quds&#160;force.</p>
<p>Iranian-backed militias in Iraq, as well as Iran&#8217;s Revolutionary Guards, also quickly confirmed the deaths of Soleimani and al-Muhandis, blaming the United&#160;States.</p>
<p>Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif called the U.S. strike an &#8220;act of terrorism,&#8221; tweeting it was an &#8220;extremely dangerous &amp; a foolish&#160;escalation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Iran Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, called for three days of national mourning and warned, &#8220;All Enemies should know that the jihad of resistance will continue with a doubled motivation, and a definite victory awaits the fighters in the holy&#160;war.&#8221;</p>

<p>David Kaiser writes at his blog <a href="https://locomotivebreath1901.blogspot.com/">LB1901</a> under the pseudonym, locomotivebreath1901.
In his spare time, David is a part-time wizard who trains fire breathing dragons to do party tricks, and hollywood stunts. He is married to that curvaceous raven haired beauty, Mrs. locomotivebreath1901, who wants nothing to do with fire breathing dragons. But she is rather fond of owls.</p>

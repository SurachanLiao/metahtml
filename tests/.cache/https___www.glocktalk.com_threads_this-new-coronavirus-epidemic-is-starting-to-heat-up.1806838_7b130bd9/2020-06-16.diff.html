I started tracking this back in December when Promed mail put out an alert. 
 
This is a “viral perfect storm” scenario. We are in the middle of the the worst flu season in over a decade and the Chinese festival has begun. 
 
This virus started in a wet market in Wuhan. It’s a Zoonotic virus that’s jumped to humans. I wasn’t too concerned until a week ago. That’s all changed now. China has assigned a separate Medical team to each serious/critical patient. You do that for patients showing signs of a “Cytokine storm.” This disease is going to tie up a lot of Medical personnel. 
 
The virus is believed to be mutating. China is bringing a Rapid Sequencer to Hubei province to check on this. Death rate is fluid, but appears to have gone from 1.5% to 3.8%. The virus also appears to be more contagious now. The case load is changing rapidly. It was 312 this morning and now it’s 560. It may be in 7 different countries. 
 
CDC has activated EOC. Who is considering raising raising the threat level as well. 
 
There is no vaccine and antivirals are of little use against Coronaviruses. 
 
The only bright spot is that China is now very open on its reporting and they are very good at containment of health threats.

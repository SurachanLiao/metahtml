he has a sister, you do know that

And others have mentioned why she is unlikely to matter. The previously mentioned list of other male Kim’s are the more relevant ones.

If Un dies, she will likely try to make every attempt to gain power regardless. Because she knows if she doesn’t, whoever eventually does take over will to try to kill off every last remaining member of the Kim family to remove any possible claim of legitimacy. This will be Game of Thrones s***.

The truth will set you free, but first it will piss you off. If Un dies, she will likely try to make every attempt to gain power regardless.

Clinically brain dead? Oh man it's over then. Who knows where NK will go now... probably be annexed by their commie friends up north.

Grave danger is when there is a shooter at your school. Grave condition is when a surgery didn't go well.



Maybe it is just me bugged by this. ''You can call it a germ, you can call it a flu, you can call it a virus, you can call it many different names, I'm not sure anybody even knows what it is.'' Does anyone else find is strange how the media is describing Kim as in "grave danger"?Grave danger is when there is a shooter at your school. Grave condition is when a surgery didn't go well.Maybe it is just me bugged by this.

The reason they wouldn't want North Korea is that it's got 25 million unskilled North Korean peasants in it. North Korea would be dead weight on the Chinese economy. That's absolutely not a reason to want to own a territory.

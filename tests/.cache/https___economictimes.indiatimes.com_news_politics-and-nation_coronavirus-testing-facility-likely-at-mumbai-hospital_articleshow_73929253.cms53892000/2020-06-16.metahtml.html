</p><p>An additional testing facility at the civic-run hospital here will help in getting faster results, the senior state health official said.
</p><p>"The plan is being discussed to share some load of NIV. The institute is getting swab samples from across the country for testing of novel coronavirus infection. If a similar testing facility is set up in <a href="/topic/Mumbai" target="_blank">Mumbai</a>, it will minimise the waiting period," she said.
</p><p>More and more samples are being received for testing at NIV, hence it is better to set up an additional examination facility in Mumbai at the earliest, the official said.
</p><p>"Health officials have communicated their views to higher authorities about setting up a coronavirus testing facility in Mumbai. We will come to know about it in the coming days," she added.
</p><p>As of now, six patients have been kept in observation wards at various hospitals in the state. Of these, four are in <a href="/topic/Pune" target="_blank">Pune</a>, and one each in Mumbai and Sangli district, another official said on Monday.
</p><p>Since January 18, state health officials have screened 8,878 passengers at Mumbai's Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport for the coronavirus infection, he said.
</p><p>No confirmed case of the deadly virus, which has killed 425 people in China till now, has been detected yet in Maharashtra.
</p><p>The coronavirus is a large family of viruses that cause illnesses ranging from common cold to acute respiratory syndromes, but the virus that has killed people in China is a novel strain and not seen before.
</p><p>Common symptoms of the novel coronavirus strain include respiratory problems like cough, shortness of breath and fever, according to the <a href="/topic/World-Health-Organisation" target="_blank">World Health Organisation</a>.
</p><p>The WHO has declared the coronavirus epidemic as a global health emergency.
</p><p>The virus - which first emerged in Wuhan city in China's central Hubei province - has spread to 25 countries, including India (three confirmed cases have been reported from Kerala), the US and the UK.

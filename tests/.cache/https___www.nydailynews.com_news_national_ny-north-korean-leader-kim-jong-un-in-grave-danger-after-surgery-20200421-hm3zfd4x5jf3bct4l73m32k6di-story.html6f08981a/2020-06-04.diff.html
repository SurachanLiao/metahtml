Kim commands a cult of personality in his country, and gaining insight about his situation often amounts to scanning state media reports and propaganda videos for clues.</ins></p><p class=""><ins>The Ministry of Unification, a department of the South Korean government that aims to unify the two countries, said on Friday that it was “inappropriate” to speculate about Kim’s noticeable absence.</ins></p><p class="crd--hd flex-container-row align-items-center"><ins></ins></p><h2 class="fte-hd"><ins>Most Read</ins></h2><ins> </ins><ul class="list-unstyled clln clln-vtl clln-crd "><li class="clln--it flex-container-row align-items-start rcom--it clln-it-bdr-btm rcom-nydn"><p class="recommender"><ins><a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/ny-man-filmed-killing-hit-ahmaud-arbery-with-truck-investigator-says-20200604-s4kqlnf3rfee5o2nzt2da77hsi-story.html#nt=related-content">Man who filmed Ahmaud Arbery killing hit him with truck before shooting, investigator says  Link: https://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/ny-man-filmed-killing-hit-ahmaud-arbery-with-truck-investigator-says-20200604-s4kqlnf3rfee5o2nzt2da77hsi-story.html#nt=related-content </a> </ins></p><ins> </ins></li><ins> </ins><li class="clln--it flex-container-row align-items-start rcom--it clln-it-bdr-btm rcom-nydn"><p class="recommender"><ins><a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/ny-ahmaud-arbery-murder-suspects-face-judge-in-court-hearing-20200604-bfskvsqpjzcmriaesetk4g3mbu-story.html#nt=related-content">Suspect was overheard saying, ‘f---ing n----r,’ after killing Ahmaud Arbery: investigator  Link: https://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/ny-ahmaud-arbery-murder-suspects-face-judge-in-court-hearing-20200604-bfskvsqpjzcmriaesetk4g3mbu-story.html#nt=related-content </a> </ins></p><ins> </ins></li><ins> </ins><li class="clln--it flex-container-row align-items-start rcom--it clln-it-bdr-btm lt-it rcom-nydn"><p class="recommender"><ins><a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/ny-huxley-stauffer-youtuber-adopted-son-investigation-20200603-b4vwrci62jeg3mzihfxlrzfngi-story.html#nt=related-content">Cops looking for Huxley Stauffer, YouTuber’s adopted son whom she ‘rehomed’  Link: https://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/ny-huxley-stauffer-youtuber-adopted-son-investigation-20200603-b4vwrci62jeg3mzihfxlrzfngi-story.html#nt=related-content </a> </ins></p><ins> </ins></li><ins> </ins></ul><p class=""><ins>Kim has disappeared from the public eye for health reasons at least once before.

And, the April attack of CIH (sometimes called Chernobyl) did a great deal of damage, but the virus took more than a year to spread. ExploreZip: A lot deadlier That makes ExploreZip a whole lot deadlier. Not only does the virus spread more quickly, but its method of wiping out files is more effective than CIH, said Greg Olson, operations manager at data recovery firm Ontrack International Inc.

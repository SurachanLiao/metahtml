</a> </h5> <p>Iran’s Ambassador to India Ali Chegeni denied the allegations. “Mr. Trump can say anything he likes, he can give any list of attacks that he likes. But this is a big lie. General Soleimani was a soldier, he was not involved in the targetting of innocents anywhere,” Mr. Chegeni said in an interview to The Hindu.</p><p>The Ministry of External Affairs declined to comment on Mr. Trump’s statement, which brought New Delhi into the rising tensions between Washington and Tehran.</p><p>Mr. Trump is believed to have referred to the car bombing of an Israeli diplomat in Delhi in February 2012. The diplomat, who was also the wife of the Israeli defence attaché, was injured in the attack along with three others. At the time, the Delhi Police’s special cell that investigated the case believed it was connected with attacks on Israeli diplomats in Tbilisi, Georgia as well as Bangkok, Thailand, and was reportedly carried out by IRGC agents at the time in retaliation for attacks on Iranian nuclear scientists. Delhi Police officials say the case has not moved since 2013, when the lone suspect, an Indian journalist with an Iranian news agency, was granted bail, a decision that was upheld in the Supreme Court.</p> <p class="also-view-container"><ins></ins></p><p class="also-view-head"><ins><span>Also Read</span> </ins></p><ins> </ins><a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-asked-for-proportionate-response-to-generals-killing-says-iran/article30478294.ece"><p><ins>US asked for proportionate response to general’s killing, says Iran </ins></p><ins>  Link: https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-asked-for-proportionate-response-to-generals-killing-says-iran/article30478294.ece </ins></a> <p>Mr. Chegeni said that by raising the issue, Mr. Trump was attempting to cover the U.S.’s action in killing the Iranian official while he was visiting Iraq after travelling to Syria for “anti-terrorism consultations”.</p><p>“Gen Soleimani fought against the ISIS, Jubhat Al Nusra, Al-Qaeda. He was invited to Syria and Iraq by their governments for advice and assistance on fighting these terror groups. So anyone who assassinated him, is for the terrorists. And if this was ordered by their President, as the U.S. says, then this is an act of state terrorism,” he noted.</p><h2>New Delhi expresses concern</h2><p>On Friday, India issued a statement that expressed concern over rising tensions between the U.S. and Iran, and “noted” the U.S.’s killing of the senior Iranian official.</p><p>When asked, Mr. Chegeni said he expected India would also “condemn the assassination of an official who was on a visit to another country on official invitation.”</p><p class="also-view-container"></p><p class="also-view-head"><span>Also Read</span> </p> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/thousands-in-baghdad-mourn-iranian-general-killed-by-us/article30477405.ece"> <del><img src="https://www.thehindu.com/static/img/1x1_spacer.png" alt="A demonstration in Karbala, Iraq, on Saturday against the U.S. air strike that killed Qasem Soleimani." title="A demonstration in Karbala, Iraq, on Saturday against the U.S. air strike that killed Qasem Soleimani." class="media-object lazy adaptive placeholder"></del> <p>Thousands in Baghdad mourn Iranian general killed by U.S. </p> </a> <p>He stated,“We expect India as our reliable friend to advise the United States to follow international norms and not destabilise the region.

The 3-day event, where U.S. Deputy National Security Advisor Matt Pottinger will also speak, could see India, which has attempted a “tightrope walk” in ties with both countries, caught in the middle again.</p><p>(with inputs from Saurabh <ins>Trivedi)</ins><p class="planTodayDiv text-center"><ins>You have reached your limit for free articles this month.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="planTodayDiv text-center"><ins>To get full access, please subscribe. </ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="signinlnk text-center"><ins>Already have an account ? <a href="https://subscription.thehindu.com/signup?utm_source=meterpaywall&amp;utm_medium=30479336&amp;utm_campaign=national" class="signintodayspaper">Sign in Link: https://subscription.thehindu.com/signup?utm_source=meterpaywall&amp;utm_medium=30479336&amp;utm_campaign=national </a> </ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="moreCliCk"><ins>Show Less Plan </ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Start your 14 days trial now. <a href="https://subscription.thehindu.com/recur_subscription?utm_source=meterpaywall&amp;utm_medium=30479336&amp;utm_campaign=national" class="signupextra">Sign Up Link: https://subscription.thehindu.com/recur_subscription?utm_source=meterpaywall&amp;utm_medium=30479336&amp;utm_campaign=national </a></ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="subscriptionbenefits"><ins></ins></p><h4 class="subscriptionbenefitstitle"><ins>Subscription Benefits Include</ins></h4><ins> </ins><h6 class="reasonforsubscrptionitemscontenttitle"><ins>Today's Paper</ins></h6><ins> </ins><p class="reasonforsubscrptionitemscontentlead"><ins>Find mobile-friendly version of articles from the day's newspaper in one easy-to-read list.</ins></p><ins> </ins><h6 class="reasonforsubscrptionitemscontenttitle"><ins>Faster pages</ins></h6><ins> </ins><p class="reasonforsubscrptionitemscontentlead"><ins>Move smoothly between articles as our pages load instantly.</ins></p><ins> </ins><h6 class="reasonforsubscrptionitemscontenttitle"><ins>Unlimited Access</ins></h6><ins> </ins><p class="reasonforsubscrptionitemscontentlead"><ins>Enjoy reading as many articles as you wish without any limitations.</ins></p><ins> </ins><h6 class="reasonforsubscrptionitemscontenttitle"><ins>Dashboard</ins></h6><ins> </ins><p class="reasonforsubscrptionitemscontentlead"><ins>A one-stop-shop for seeing the latest updates, and managing your preferences.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="reasonforsubscrptionitemscontent"><ins></ins></p><h6 class="reasonforsubscrptionitemscontenttitle"><ins>Personalised recommendations</ins></h6><ins> </ins><p class="reasonforsubscrptionitemscontentlead"><ins>A select list of articles that match your interests and tastes.</ins></p><ins> </ins><h6 class="reasonforsubscrptionitemscontenttitle"><ins>Briefing</ins></h6><ins> </ins><p class="reasonforsubscrptionitemscontentlead"><ins>We brief you on the latest and most important developments, three times a day.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>*Our Digital Subscription plans do not currently include the e-paper ,crossword, iPhone, iPad mobile applications and print.

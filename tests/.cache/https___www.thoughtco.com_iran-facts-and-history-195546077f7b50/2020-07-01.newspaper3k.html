<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-45" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"></p>
<p>The official language is Persian (Farsi), which is part of the Indo-European language family. Along with the closely related Luri, Gilaki and Mazandarani,&#160;Farsi is the native tongue of 58% of Iranians.</p>
<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-47" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"></p>

<p>The earliest archaeological findings from Persia date to the Paleolithic era, 100,000 years ago. By 5000 BCE, Persia hosted sophisticated agriculture and early cities.</p>
<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-84" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"></p>
<p>Powerful dynasties have ruled Persia, beginning with the <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/kings-and-emperors-called-the-great-195693">Achaemenid</a> (559-330 BCE), which was founded by Cyrus the Great.</p>
<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-86" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/alexander-the-great-116825">Alexander the Great</a> conquered Persia in 300 BCE, founding the Hellenistic era (300-250 BCE). This was followed by the indigenous Parthian Dynasty (250 BCE - 226 CE) and the <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/ancient-iran-persia-112508">Sassanian Dynasty</a> (226 - 651 CE).</p>
<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-88" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"></p>
<p>In 637, Muslims from the Arabian Peninsula invaded Iran, conquering the whole region over the next 35 years. Zoroastrianism faded away as more and more Iranians <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/spread-of-islam-in-asia-195600">converted to Islam</a>.</p>
<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-90" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"></p>
<p>During the 11th century, the <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/who-were-the-seljuks-195399">Seljuk Turks</a> conquered Iran bit by bit, establishing a Sunni empire. The Seljuks sponsored great Persian artists, scientists, and poets, including Omar Khayyam.</p>

<p>In 1219, <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/genghis-khan-195669">Genghis Khan</a> and the Mongols invaded Persia, wreaking havoc across the country and slaughtering entire cities. Mongol rule ended in 1335, followed by a period of chaos.</p>

<p>In 1501, the <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/what-was-the-safavid-empire-195397">Safavid dynasty</a> brought Shi'a Islam to Persia.

The Safavids were in and out of power throughout the 18th century, with the revolt of former slave Nadir Shah and the establishment of the Zand dynasty.</p>

<p>In 1921, the Iranian army officer Reza Khan seized control of the government. Four years later, he ousted the last Qajar ruler and named himself Shah. This was the origin of the Pahlavis, Iran's final dynasty.</p>
<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-102" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"></p>
<p>Reza Shah tried to rapidly modernize Iran but was forced out of office by the western powers after 15 years because of his ties to the Nazi regime in Germany. His son, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, took the throne in 1941.</p>
<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-104" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"></p>

<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-106" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"></p>

Many horrors! China microblog translate poorly English into. Say Beloved Successor of Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea Kim Jong Un dead from dying after assassin kill. No verification. Checking.
 


 

 
       
  



   

  <p class="body">OK, let's not get all <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/02/05/republican-candidate-airs-racially-charged-debbie-spenditnow-ad-during-super-bowl/" target="_blank">"Debbie Spenditnow"</a> here... but the Chinese microblogging community is all agog over rumors about the alleged assassination of Kim Jong-un, the recently installed latest "Dear Leader" of North Korea, a promotion occasioned by the convenient death of long-time dictator Kim Jong-il, who became dictator of that reclusive nation after the convenient death of his father and the nation's founder, Kim Il-sung.
 

Google Translate doesn't do that good of a job with Chinese, but let's see what they're saying on the <a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=zh-CN&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=s.weibo.com%2Fweibo%2F%2525E9%252587%252591%2525E6%2525AD%2525A3%2525E6%252581%2525A9%3Ftopnav%3D1&amp;act=url" target="_blank">microblog</a>.

"Kim Jong-un" - we found 32
 

 
Let's see who's saying what...
 

Someone identified as The outer world of Mars Penguin shares this.
 

 
China Times : go to the embassy on the road towards the X, the latest news will be released by the Chongqing press office microblogging, please pay attention to the microblogging as early as one second to change into Phoenix! / / @ fat Fang Hongwei : North Korea a major event ~ jinzhengen and national TV stations have Park Colonel
 

Then, there's a blockquote that says...
 

After reading the latest news to the pot washed Shenyang Military Region, today is not what action? Plane took off for dozens of vehicles! @ Guangzhou retirement a police inspector Tan tree survivor : Reliable sources: North Korea a major event! Sino-Korean border, the army build-up! @ Chen Chen entertainment nest : the latest news, the vehicles of the Korean Embassy in China surge in the number of times, from the initial 78 vehicles, up to now has been flooded with the embassy, &#8203;&#8203;some more than 80 vehicles, North Korea is certainly a big blow. . .
 

Gracious!  What else?
 

"Minus 8 Degrees of Ice" shares...
 

@ Bari Commentary : # live # bustling among Korea, the friends did not forget the "old friend": jinzhengen was assassinated and killed at 2:45 on the 10th. A slip of the circle of Korean media and foreign media, no relevant reports, should not the real news. February 16 Kim Jong-il 70-year-old birthday "Light Star Festival", the DPRK embassy some "changes" is not surprising. The recent news is that the Korean Central News Agency reported that on the 8th jinzhengen inspection of 324 troops. <a href="http://t.cn/zOwhO2S">http://t.cn/zOwhO2S</a>
 

That link takes you to the South Korean Yonhap News Agency, which doesn't say a word about Kim Jong-un going belly-up.  
 

Someone called "ByeJeff Peak Dance Wine Days" says:
 

 
North Korea may be a military coup] North Korean official media for four consecutive days supreme leader jinzhengen, any news reports, rumors of little-known middle-ranking officers Park Bend Colonel has been in control of the situation, and has occupied the station.
 

JinZhengen seems to be Chinese for Kim Jong-un.  See?  We learned something new.
 

This seems to be the latest poop.
 

Phoenix Video: microblogging hot] Korea councils dynamic has suddenly become the hot microblogging. According to various sources, the current situation of North Korean leader jinzhengen and vehicles in and out of the Korean Embassy, there is no official news. A proven News @ Phoenix video publishing the first time, please pay attention!
 

Okey doke.
 

Let's check the western media and see what's what.
 

<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/02/believing-the-unbelievable-why-kim-jong-un-death-rumors-wont-die/252938/" target="_blank">The Atlantic Magazine</a> looked into the rumor and concluded:
 

Is it possible that Kim's death really happened? Of course it is. This is North Korea; anything is possible. Is it credible? As of this moment, no. I and some Atlantic and Atlantic Wire colleagues tried to find the slightest suggestion of truth, or even the possibility of truth, and found nothing. With evidence so thin and so many reasons to believe that the story is nonsense, why have American readers and writers taken it so seriously? What has led -- is still leading -- so many people to not just believe this rumor but pass it on?
 

Well, when in doubt, go to the source.  In this case, t<a href="http://www.kcna.co.jp/index-k.htm" target="_blank">he official news agency of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea</a>, the same agency that waited 51 hours to inform the world of Kim Jong-il's heart attack and death.
 

Here's the top news... in Korean.

Goodness.  That looks sinister.  What's the translation?
 

Minister Lim hyeonjiryohae bukchanghwaryeokbaljeonryeonhapgieopso
 
(February 09, Pyongyang KCNA) on the 9th Prime Minister Lim important share of the country's electricity generation power station in charge of Greater bukchanghwaryeokbaljeonryeonhapgieopsoui ryohaehayeotda in local power generation status.
 

Prime Minister last wish of the great Kim Jong Il and the Workers' Party of Korea Central Committee Politburo Decision, the Central Committee, the Central Military Commission joint relief, joint editorial this year to fight the proposed power plant ever to carry through the task of putting together a technology management holding its hyoryul struggle mightily to raise as much as possible apart, looked back at various points in the enterprise.
 

Sector workers in the relationship between the local council was held.
 

Council the power production at a high level normalization halde the Great General's last wish to lodge gwancheol the vast differential birth acid stretch and Coal Quality Supervision and improve your business and facilities management, technology management from the technical regulations and standards, manning needs thoroughly to ensure that the importance of two was being emphasized.

Well, then.  I guess everything's OK.
 

Unless of course, it isn't.
 

The rumor is still a hot topic, trending on Twitter under the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/%22Kim%20Jong-Un%22" target="_blank">#KimJongUn.</a>
 

Wouldn't that be something if the little cartoon I animated 24 hours ago turned out to be true?

<p>What's the difference between democracy, monarchy, and theocracy? If you said all three are forms of government, you're right! But each one is run differently. A democracy is government run by the people (that's like the United States). A monarchy is government run by a king or queen. And a theocracy is government run by a religious leader. The Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini led an Islamic revolution in Iran, took the country away from the political leader called the Shah, and ran Iran as a theocracy from 1979 until his death in 1989.</p><p>Under the rule of the Ayatollah Khomeini, Iran became a symbol for fundamentalists throughout the Middle East because he led an Islamic revolution that turned a Western-like society into an Islamic state.</p><p>Ruhollah Khomeini was born in 1902 in Iran. He studied Islamic theology, became a religious teacher, and received the title of ayatollah (supreme religious leader). Khomeini believed that it was necessary to abandon material and earthly pleasures in order to better understand and obey the will of God. In time, he drew many students and followers to his way of thinking.</p><p>He and his followers attacked the Shah's support of Israel, friendship to America, and un-Islamic policies. The Ayatollah warned against political leadership and called for revolutionary action. Khomeini wanted Iran to be run by Islamic religious leaders.</p><p>In the late 1970s, huge demonstrations and strikes rocked cities in Iran. The middle class, merchants, and members of the military joined the poor and the extremely religious in calling upon the Shah to give up his rule. The Shah finally fled to the West. Khomeini took over the government.</p><p>Khomeini worked to remake Iran along his own religious vision in which the clergy governed the state. Religious students and clerics who could be counted on to strictly follow religious rules and values ran the government. The Ayatollah Khomeini was named Imam and declared leader of Iran for life.</p></td></tr></table> <del><br><br> <img src="../../../images/spacer.gif" width="25" height="1" alt="" border="0"></del> </div>

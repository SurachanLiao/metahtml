South Korea's Government has thrown some doubt on reports that North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un is seriously ill.

It comes after US media reported that the 36-year-old was gravely unwell following heart surgery, and is receiving treatment in a secret villa.

This is not the first time rumours have run rife about Kim's health, before being dismissed.

But North Korea is a deeply secretive nation, and very few details are known about its leader.

Here's what we know.

When did speculation about his health start?

Rumours about Kim's health started after the North Korean leader failed to show up at celebrations to mark his grandfather's birthday on April 15.

Marking the birth of the nation's founder is one of the biggest events on North Korea's calendar, so Kim's absence was definitely noted.

He last appeared in state media on April 12 when he inspected a "pursuit assault plane group".

But it's impossible to verify when the pictures of Kim were taken.

A website run by North Korean defectors, Daily NK, published claims that Kim has been struggling with cardiovascular problems since August 2019.

Daily NK said Kim's health had deteriorated in recent months due to smoking, obesity and overwork.

That prompted international journalists to get on the phone to their intelligence sources.

Jim Sciutto, CNN's chief national security correspondent said a US official told him Kim was in "grave danger" after surgery.

Another intelligence source told CNN that reports about Kim Jong-un's health were credible, but the "severity is hard to assess".

However, South Korea's Government and Chinese intelligence sources told Reuters that reports he was in critical condition were untrue.

No Korean or Chinese sources have denied Kim underwent heart surgery.

But South Korea's presidential office said that "no unusual signs" had been detected across the border.

What do we know about North Korea's leader?

No one knows much about Kim Jong-un.

We don't know his exact birth date (North Korean authorities say he was born in 1982, but South Korean intelligence officials believe it was 1983).

He is married to a woman called Ri Sol-ju, and it's believed they have at least one daughter together.

But that's according to retired US basketball player Dennis Rodman, who said he met their child during a visit to North Korea in 2013.

But some North Korean defectors and foreign affairs experts have speculated he has been unwell.

Have we heard rumours like this before?

In 2014, Kim was not seen publicly for nearly 40 days, and he even failed to attend an important parliamentary session.

That set off rumours that he may have been ousted by his political rivals.

But he then appeared in photographs walking with a cane.

State media took the rare step of confirming that he was suffering from an "uncomfortable physical condition".

Reports suggest he had gout, a painful form of arthritis which causes crystal-like deposits to build up in the joints.

Some North Korea experts say Kim has been limiting his public appearances because of the coronavirus pandemic.

Pyongyang continues to insist that it has not had a single confirmed case of COVID-19, despite sharing borders with China and South Korea.

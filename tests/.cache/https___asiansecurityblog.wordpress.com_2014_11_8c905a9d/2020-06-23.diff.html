After 10 years of endless meetings, papers, op-eds, and power-points, everyone seems to have realized it was a basically a huge mistake (which it was). The US and Korea recently agreed to push it off the 2020s, which is another way of saying it will probably never happen. </p><p align="justify">The irony is that almost as soon as reversion was agreed to last decade, the South Koreans got cold feet and tried to have it changed back. No one seems to have thought that closing down the Combined Forces Command would mean that Korea would have to do a lot more for its own defense and stop free-riding so much. Once that reality hit by the end of President Roh’s term, ‘US imperialism’ didn’t look so bad after all: it meant Seoul could continue to woefully under-invest in defense. So here we are at last, back to where we started from. And honestly, it is all for the best – <a href="https://asiansecurityblog.wordpress.com/2014/09/08/my-lowy-debate-on-whether-the-us-should-retrench-from-south-korea-part-2-no/">if the US is going to stay here</a>.</p><p align="justify">The essay follows the jump.</p> <p align="justify"><ins><a href="https://asiansecurityblog.wordpress.com/2014/11/28/my-lowy-essay-opcon-reversion-is-dead-the-10-year-soap-opera-is-finally-over/#more-3232" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">→</span> Link: https://asiansecurityblog.wordpress.com/2014/11/28/my-lowy-essay-opcon-reversion-is-dead-the-10-year-soap-opera-is-finally-over/#more-3232 </a></ins></p> <h3 class="sd-title">Share this:</h3><ul><li class="share-twitter"><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" class="share-twitter sd-button share-icon" href="https://asiansecurityblog.wordpress.com/2014/11/28/my-lowy-essay-opcon-reversion-is-dead-the-10-year-soap-opera-is-finally-over/?share=twitter" target="_blank" title="Click to share on Twitter"><span>Twitter</span></a></li><li class="share-facebook"><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" class="share-facebook sd-button share-icon" href="https://asiansecurityblog.wordpress.com/2014/11/28/my-lowy-essay-opcon-reversion-is-dead-the-10-year-soap-opera-is-finally-over/?share=facebook" target="_blank" title="Click to share on Facebook"><span>Facebook</span></a></li><li class="share-linkedin"><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" class="share-linkedin sd-button share-icon" href="https://asiansecurityblog.wordpress.com/2014/11/28/my-lowy-essay-opcon-reversion-is-dead-the-10-year-soap-opera-is-finally-over/?share=linkedin" target="_blank" title="Click to share on LinkedIn"><span>LinkedIn</span></a></li><li class="share-reddit"><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" class="share-reddit sd-button share-icon" href="https://asiansecurityblog.wordpress.com/2014/11/28/my-lowy-essay-opcon-reversion-is-dead-the-10-year-soap-opera-is-finally-over/?share=reddit" target="_blank" title="Click to share on Reddit"><span>Reddit</span></a></li><li class="share-pinterest"><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" class="share-pinterest sd-button share-icon" href="https://asiansecurityblog.wordpress.com/2014/11/28/my-lowy-essay-opcon-reversion-is-dead-the-10-year-soap-opera-is-finally-over/?share=pinterest" target="_blank" title="Click to share on Pinterest"><span>Pinterest</span></a></li><li class="share-tumblr"><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" class="share-tumblr sd-button share-icon" href="https://asiansecurityblog.wordpress.com/2014/11/28/my-lowy-essay-opcon-reversion-is-dead-the-10-year-soap-opera-is-finally-over/?share=tumblr" target="_blank" title="Click to share on Tumblr"><span>Tumblr</span></a></li><li class="share-email"><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" class="share-email sd-button share-icon" href="https://asiansecurityblog.wordpress.com/2014/11/28/my-lowy-essay-opcon-reversion-is-dead-the-10-year-soap-opera-is-finally-over/?share=email" target="_blank" title="Click to email this to a friend"><span>Email</span></a></li><li class="share-print"><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" class="share-print sd-button share-icon" href="https://asiansecurityblog.wordpress.com/2014/11/28/my-lowy-essay-opcon-reversion-is-dead-the-10-year-soap-opera-is-finally-over/" target="_blank" title="Click to print"><span>Print</span></a></li></ul><h3 class="sd-title">Like this:</h3><p class="likes-widget-placeholder post-likes-widget-placeholder"><span class="button"><span>Like</span></span> <span class="loading">Loading...</span></p></article> <article id="post-3227" class="post-3227 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-asia category-china category-islam category-middle-east category-pivot"><p align="justify"><ins>You think that guy to the left cares about China or ASEAN? Gimme a break. </ins></p><p align="justify"><ins>This is a point I have made again and again on this blog: Asia does not activate the racial/cultural/religious paranoias of Americans, especially conservatives, evangelical Christians (who are around 45% of the country), and the GOP. This is why we won’t stop fighting in the Middle East. The ‘America is a Judeo-Christian country’ crowd absolutely wants to stay and fight it out against the jihadis, because it fears/hates them in a visceral way it never will feel about east Asian geopolitics. China may be threatening in a traditional, state-to-state kinda way, but that doesn’t move people’s deep fears/beliefs/angst though. But the idea that Muslims might bring sharia to the West, build a mosque near ground-zero, or see their <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/no-muslim-holiday-on-montgomery-county-school-calendar-isnt-fair-or-pc/2014/11/12/ce1dee46-6ac0-11e4-a31c-77759fc1eacc_story.html">holidays treated equally Link: http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/no-muslim-holiday-on-montgomery-county-school-calendar-isnt-fair-or-pc/2014/11/12/ce1dee46-6ac0-11e4-a31c-77759fc1eacc_story.html </a> by Western public authorities is enough see a lot of Americans into a cultural panic. Hence the huge well of public opinion support to keep fighting and fighting in the Middle East. </ins></p><p align="justify"><ins>This is what Huntington grasped a long time ago with the clash of civilizations, but China is too different for most Americans to get excited about in a personal way. But Islam does provoke Americans like this; <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/world/2014/10/06/3576385/fox-news-host-visibly-angry-when-guests-dont-agree-agree-with-maher-and-condemn-islam/">just watch Fox Link: http://thinkprogress.org/world/2014/10/06/3576385/fox-news-host-visibly-angry-when-guests-dont-agree-agree-with-maher-and-condemn-islam/ </a>. Its focus on Islam is relentless and astonishing. So yes, the long war is still the long war, and the Chinese can sit back and watch the GOP insist that the US fight endlessly in the Gulf. </ins></p><p align="justify"><ins>The original essay is <a

align="justify"><ins>Admit it,  you miss the wild speculation about Kim Jong Un’s disappearance last month. It was lunatic fun, right? Was he dead? Was his sister in charge? WAS HE REPLACED BY ALIENS?!! Run for the hills! </ins></p><p align="justify"><ins>To me, in retrospect, the big story was not KJU’s disappearance, but the wild, almost lunatic conspiracy-theorizing it unleashed in the West. </ins></p><p align="justify"><ins>North Korea is a running punch-line in the West. Kim Jong Il was the villain in Team America. The story that the Norks found a unicorn a few years ago got play for weeks in the US for its sheer laugh value. So this essay was an effort to get a handle on this – why do Western media feel license to make any wild, preposterous claim they want about North Korea? Where does this bizarre obsession come from? There’s probably a good MA thesis in here actually if you were serious about it. </ins></p><p align="justify"><ins>The following essay was first published by the <a href="http://www.lowyinterpreter.org/post/2014/10/30/What-did-we-learn-from-all-the-Kim-Jong-Un-has-dissappeared-hysteria.aspx?COLLCC=2212766809&amp;">Lowy Institute Link: http://www.lowyinterpreter.org/post/2014/10/30/What-did-we-learn-from-all-the-Kim-Jong-Un-has-dissappeared-hysteria.aspx?COLLCC=2212766809&amp; </a>, and then <a href="http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/north-korea-the-mafia-lessons-the-kim-jong-un-has-11584">picked up by The National Interest Link: http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/north-korea-the-mafia-lessons-the-kim-jong-un-has-11584 </a>.

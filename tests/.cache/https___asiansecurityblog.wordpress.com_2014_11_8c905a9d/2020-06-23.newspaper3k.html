<p align="justify">This is a reprint of an <a href="http://www.lowyinterpreter.org/post/2014/11/26/Why-US-control-of-the-South-Korean-military-is-here-to-stay.aspx">essay first published</a> by the Lowy Institute a week ago.</p>
<p align="justify">The reversion of OPCON &#8211; operational wartime control of the South Korean military &#8211; to South Korea is finally over. <strong>After 10 years of endless meetings, papers, op-eds, and power-points, everyone seems to have realized it was a basically a huge mistake</strong> (which it was). The US and Korea recently agreed to push it off the 2020s, which is another way of saying it will probably never happen. </p>
<p align="justify">The irony is that almost as soon as reversion was agreed to last decade, the South Koreans got cold feet and tried to have it changed back. No one seems to have thought that closing down the Combined Forces Command would mean that Korea would have to do a lot more for its own defense and stop free-riding so much. Once that reality hit by the end of President Roh&#8217;s term, &#8216;US imperialism&#8217; didn&#8217;t look so bad after all: it meant Seoul could continue to woefully under-invest in defense. So here we are at last, back to where we started from. And honestly, it is all for the best &#8211; <a href="https://asiansecurityblog.wordpress.com/2014/09/08/my-lowy-debate-on-whether-the-us-should-retrench-from-south-korea-part-2-no/">if the US is going to stay here</a>.</p>

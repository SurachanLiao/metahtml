The Trump Book Club US president Donald Trump’s niece, Mary Trump, who also has a PhD in psychology, is the author of the latest Trump tell-all. Published Tuesday, Too Much and Never Enough focuses on the family that Mary Trump says turned her uncle into a narcissist who is “lost in his own delusional spin.” The Trump tell-all has become a genre in and of itself, with a growing list of books that examine the president from various angles. Perhaps your book club needs a little light reading to get it in the mood for what’s sure to be another tumultuous US election?

Charting TikTok influencers When the Indian government banned TikTok on June 29, hundreds of thousands of Indian content creators had the rug pulled out from under their feet. The number of Indian TikTok influencers—those with more than a thousand followers on the short-form video platform—was only second to those from the US (✦), according to a July 11 report by social media analytics firm HypeAuditor.

✦ For members: When diversity initiatives hurt diversity Mandatory diversity training, grievance procedures, and job tests—three of the most common diversity and inclusion initiatives employed by companies—produce results contrary to their stated goal. That’s according to a series of studies by academics Alexandra Kalev and Frank Dobbin who analyzed the effect of such programs on manager diversity at 829 US companies over three decades. How did we get here? Read more about why some common diversity initiatives actually decrease diversity and why diversity initiatives fail in our field guide on how to create an anti-racist company.

You asked about hugs Why can’t you hug someone if you both agree to hold your breath for the duration of the hug (say, three seconds) and then separate to six feet or more? —Amy Great question, and it makes us wonder why we’re not always asking about hugs. Last month, aerosol scientist Dr. Linsey Marr told the New York Times, “If you don’t talk or cough while hugging, the risk should be very low.” Of course, low risk and no risk are very different. And if you know someone is infected or is at risk it’s best to avoid hugs altogether. If you must hug, be sure to point your faces in opposite directions, and as you suggested—keep it brief and then back off. And if you really want to go the extra mile, check out this family’s makeshift plastic “hug glove” for inspiration.

How hotels are surviving the pandemic Image copyright: Reuters/Jorge Silva Safety first in Bangkok’s Mandarin Oriental hotel. Many luxury properties with high overhead expenses first responded to the pandemic by completely shutting their doors. Others offered free lodging and meals to first responders. Now hotels are at the stage where they’re once again trying to attract paying guests. That means drawing from the lessons of the initial Covid-19 wave to keep patrons safe while experimenting with new revenue-generating models—and re-evaluating the purpose of the hospitality industry in the process (✦).

Changing our waze Transportation habits are hard to break, but nothing spurs a rethink of your daily routine quite like a pandemic. Already, we’re seeing the impacts close to home: In an internal survey, 68% of New York-based Quartz employees said that even after the pandemic, they’d prefer to work remotely at least some of the time, and only 3% said they’d return to being full-time office creatures. Here’s how else Quartz is adjusting: Jackie Bischof, deputy membership editor (London) : “I got my bike serviced and am getting a lesson on cycling in central London from a biking nonprofit in case we get a coworking space or I need to go in for meetings.”

: “I got my bike serviced and am getting a lesson on cycling in central London from a biking nonprofit in case we get a coworking space or I need to go in for meetings.” Katherine Foley, health reporter (Washington, DC) : “We got a car. Well, technically, borrowing a car—but we’re buying one as soon as we have to give this one back. We haven’t taken the metro in ages; bikes will do around the city for now. And because we’re also planning to move farther away from the center of the city, having a car is gonna be a necessity.”

My slippers are fuzzy.”

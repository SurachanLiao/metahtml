Last month, aerosol scientist Dr. Linsey Marr <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/04/well/family/coronavirus-pandemic-hug-mask.html">told the New York Times</a>, &#8220;If you don&#8217;t talk or cough while hugging, the risk should be very low.&#8221; Of course, low risk and no risk are very different. And if you know someone is infected or is at risk it&#8217;s best to avoid hugs altogether. If you must hug, be sure to point your faces in opposite directions, and as you suggested&#8212;keep it brief and then back off.

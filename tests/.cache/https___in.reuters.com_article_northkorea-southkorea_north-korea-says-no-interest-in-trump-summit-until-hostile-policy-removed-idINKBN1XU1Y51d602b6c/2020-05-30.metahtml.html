But working-level talks in October between officials in Sweden ended with the North Korean envoy accusing the Americans of coming to the table empty-handed. </p><p>Choe, one of North Korea&#8217;s key nuclear negotiators, met Russian officials including Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Moscow on Wednesday, Yonhap said.  </p><p>Her remarks were the latest in a series of statements in recent weeks by senior Pyongyang officials calling for U.S. action, as a year-end deadline set by Kim for Washington to show more flexibility draws near. </p><p class="Attribution_content">Reporting by Hyonhee Shin; Editing by Alex Richardson</p><p class="StandardArticleBody_trustBadgeContainer"><span class="StandardArticleBody_trustBadgeTitle">Our Standards:</span><span class="trustBadgeUrl"><a href="http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html">The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</a></span></p></div>

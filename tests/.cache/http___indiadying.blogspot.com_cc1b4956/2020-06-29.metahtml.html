"The finance ministry on Tuesday said the agricultural sector <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/green-shoots-of-economic-revival-seen-across-sectors-finance-ministry/story-wB02jcVUZkEPeNyvj8OZ5I.html" target="_blank">would be the foundation of the country's economic growth and 'early green shoots'</a> of economic revival are visible with pickup in agricultural procurement, fertiliser sales, energy consumption, freight movement, digital transactions and forex earnings." Procurement of wheat has been a record 38.2 million tonnes and that of minor forest produces in 16 states hit a record Rs 794.2 million. <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/la-nina-likely-boost-for-southwest-monsoon-this-year/articleshow/76617261.cms" target="_blank">The southwest monsoon is expected to be better than normal this year</a> according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD) which has increased planting of oil seeds, coarse cereals, pulses and cotton. "As urban India witnesses large job losses and declining incomes, <a href="https://www.livemint.com/news/india/india-inc-s-big-bet-on-bharat-saving-the-day-11593009631355.html" target="_blank">businesses are looking at rural consumers of Bharat to rise to the occasion</a>," wrote Sayantan Bera. "A wide range of businesses, from manufacturers of tractors and two-wheelers to those selling fast moving consumer goods like biscuits, beverages and soaps, are pinning their hopes on rural India." While the gross domestic product <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/imf-india-economy-contraction-2020-6474451/" target="_blank">(GDP) of India as a whole is expected to contract by 4.5% this year</a>,&#160;the agriculture sector is expected to grow more then 2.5%. Unfortunately, a bumper crop due to a<a href="https://krishijagran.com/news/farmers-throwing-tomatoes-due-to-terrible-losses-an-analysis/" target="_blank"> good monsoon is not always good for farmers as prices drop</a> and they are unable to recover their costs. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-52081396" target="_blank">The sudden lockdown announced on 24 March</a> by Prime Minister Narendra Modi resulted in a precipitous drop in prices of farm products. "<a href="https://www.livemint.com/industry/agriculture/money-for-nothing-pumpkins-for-free-11588863832315.html" target="_blank">Farm gate prices plunged due to a supply disruption</a> -- from transporters quoting a higher price to ferry the harvest and mandis (wholesale markets) scaling down operations -- coupled with a fall in consumer demand and petty retailers disappearing from the roadside," wrote Bera. "While farmers were selling carrots for Rs 2 per kg and spinach for Rs 5 per kg, a few hours away in Delhi and Noida, consumers were paying over Rs 30 per kg." Farmers' incomes depend on whether <a href="https://vikaspedia.in/agriculture/market-information/minimum-support-price" target="_blank">the government is able to buy produce at minimum support price</a>, mandated for 22 crops plus sugarcane. <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/india-may-miss-tax-collection-target-for-2019-20-by-nearly-rs-2-5-lakh-cr-subhash-chandra-garg/articleshow/73382720.cms" target="_blank">Tax collections, both direct and indirect, are expected to fall this year</a>&#160;as consumer confidence<a href="https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/rbi-surveys-point-to-plummeting-confidence-rising-inflation-fears" target="_blank"> plummets and inflation expectations increase</a>. Over 50% of Indians are dependent on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture_in_India" target="_blank">agriculture, even as this sector contributes just about 15% to the GDP</a>&#160;so it is important to support it. <a href="https://www.india.com/business/petrol-diesel-prices-today-no-increase-in-fuel-rates-in-delhi-for-first-time-in-22-days-diesel-still-costlier-4069553/" target="_blank">Fuel prices in India have been skyrocketing</a> even as the price of crude <a href="https://oilprice.com/" target="_blank">oil in international markets has stayed below $40 per barrel</a>. This is because India now <a href="https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/oil-and-gas/india-now-has-the-highest-taxes-on-fuel-in-the-world/75590141" target="_blank">boasts of the highest taxes on fuel in the world</a>. This,<a href="https://www.livemint.com/news/india/truckers-struggle-to-start-ops-due-to-driver-shortage-11593049157856.html" target="_blank"> combined with a shortage of trucks due to an absence of drivers</a> who have returned to their villages, will naturally feed into retail prices of everything. High prices means a<a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/forex/rupee-set-to-crash-past-record-low-former-reliance-fx-head-says/articleshow/76616026.cms" target="_blank"> weaker buying power of the rupee, so the rupee may fall</a>, especially if foreign institutional investors (<a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/fiis-back-in-india-infuse-rs-23000-crore-in-7-sessions/articleshow/76252281.cms" target="_blank">FIIs) stop investing in our share and debt markets</a>.&#160;A weak rupee will&#160;raise price of imports, including oil, raising retail inflation even further. Our poor farmers are expected to shoulder the burden of rescuing the economy. Is it fair?</p>

"The global economy is in <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/morgan-stanley-economists-double-down-on-v-shape-global-recovery/articleshow/76389311.cms" target="_blank">a new expansion cycle and output will return to pre-covid crisis levels</a> by the fourth quarter, according to Morgan Stanley economists," wrote Enda Curran. "Predicting a 'sharp but short' recession, the economists say they expect global GDP growth will trough at -8.6% year on year in the second quarter and recover to 3.0% by the first quarter of 2021." "Data from the Fed (US Federal Reserve) on Thursday showed its peer banks around the world this week tapped it for the fewest dollars in nearly three months", which "Coupled with other indications of slackening demand for the Fed's bevy of emergency liquidity facilities, the reduction in currency swap usage is <a href="https://in.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-fed-conditions/global-dollar-crunch-appears-over-as-central-banks-rely-less-on-fed-backstop-idINKBN23T0HC" target="_blank">for many analysts a sign that global financial markets are returning to near-normal</a> after being upended by the coronavirus outbreak in February and March," wrote Dan Burns and Megan Davies. "<a href="https://in.reuters.com/article/germany-economy-ifo-economist/german-economy-to-rebound-in-third-quarter-from-double-digit-dip-in-second-quarter-ifo-idINKBN23V172" target="_blank">The German economy should return to a growth path in the third quarter</a> after an expected double-digit contraction between April and June, Klaus Wohlrabe, an economist at the Ifo institute said on Wednesday." <a href="https://www.newindianexpress.com/world/2020/may/25/german-activity-picks-up-cant-escape-official-recession-2147784.html" target="_blank">The German economy suffered falling output for two quarters</a>, which qualifies as a recession. "Gold, forests, property stocks, inflation-linked bonds - these are just some of the assets investors are pouring money into on the view that the recent <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/inflation-dog-may-finally-bark-investors-bet/articleshow/76493183.cms?from=mdr" target="_blank">explosion of government spending and central bank stimulus may finally rouse inflation</a> from its decade-long slumber." In 2008 governments relied mainly on monetary policies by central banks, but this time, fiscal spending has also increased. <a href="https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/annus-horribilis-2020-imf-s-grim-forecasts-11593015058491.html" target="_blank">The International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicts a 4.9% contraction of global GDP</a> this year and is not so sanguine about recovery next year. A majority of 160 economists polled by Reuters <a href="https://in.reuters.com/article/global-economy-inflation-poll/coronavirus-legacy-will-be-weak-global-inflation-economists-idINKBN23X0JR" target="_blank">predict a weak inflation because they expect a "deep slump in demand"</a> as the virus hits livelihoods. <a href="https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/3015/economics/why-inflation-makes-it-easier-for-government-to-pay-debt/" target="_blank">Governments love inflation because it reduces national debt</a>. However, if prices rise too far or too fast it may <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/271322/inflation-rate-in-india/" target="_blank">make people angry and there is a danger of losing elections</a>, as the Congress discovered in 2014. "UK debt is bigger than GDP for the first time in 57 years" as "<a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8439085/UK-debt-bigger-GDP-time-57-YEARS-amid-coronavirus-chaos.html" target="_blank">Public sector debt was fractionally below two trillion pounds</a> at the end of last month - equivalent to 100.9 percent of GDP." "The Federal Reserve struck the right tone in its first pandemic-era economic outlook, suggesting <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-poll/feds-gloomy-economic-outlook-about-right-say-economists-reuters-poll-idUSKBN23U009" target="_blank">years of extraordinary policy support for an economy facing a slow and long</a> slog back, according to a majority of economists in a Reuters poll," wrote Shruti Sarkar. <a href="https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/shapes-of-economic-recovery" target="_blank">Recovery can take many shapes</a>&#160;but investors will not risk their money until they know what to expect. That might slow things down even further. Perhaps, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irrationalexuberance.asp" target="_blank">some irrational exuberance</a> might help.</p>

</h3>

 


<p dir="ltr">
<a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/" target="_blank">The total number of cases of coronavirus in the world has risen over 9.7 million</a> with 491,797 deaths, according to Worldometer. In comparison, the H1N1 flu pandemic in 2009, also known as Swine Flu, affected "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_swine_flu_pandemic" target="_blank">700 million to 1.4 billion people -- or 11 to 21 percent </a>of the global population of 6.8 billion at the time". Some 150-575,000 people died. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/1918-pandemic-h1n1.html" target="_blank">The Spanish Flu, also a H1N1 virus, in 1918, infected 500 million people worldwide</a>, killing at least 50 million. Though the coronavirus has infected far fewer people it has caused <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/coronavirus-india-lockdown-vs-global-lockdown-covid-19-deaths-cases-cure-6399181/" target="_blank">much more economic pain due to lockdowns of entire economies</a>, with the International Monetary Fund predicting "<a href="https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/annus-horribilis-2020-imf-s-grim-forecasts-11593015058491.html" target="_blank">the world's gross domestic product (GDP) is set to contract by 4.9%</a> in 2020". The stimulus package, <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/summing-up-modis-covid-stimulus-takeaways-so-far-from-the-mother-of-all-incentives/articleshow/75758840.cms" target="_blank">amounting to a total of Rs 20 trillion announced by the Finance Minister</a> Nirmala Sitharaman over 5 days in May was actually just 1-2% of GDP. "The impact of the Atmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India) <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/stimulus-dent-to-fiscal-deficit-at-1-2-of-gdp-experts/articleshow/75794865.cms?from=mdr" target="_blank">on fiscal deficit is unlikely to be over 1-2% of GDP,</a> say experts." "State Bank of India chief economist Soumyakanti Ghosh and EY's chief policy adviser DK Srivastava pegged it at 1.01% of GDP or Rs 2.02 lakh crore (Rs 2.02 trillion)." Such a weak stimulus is likely to depress demand for a prolonged period leading to a weak recovery, wrote an editorial in the Mint. "The West's mega-stimulus, meanwhile, might have the unintended effect of inflating <a href="https://in.reuters.com/article/india-stocks-sensex-nifty/global-investors-drive-indian-shares-to-three-month-high-idINKBN23U0GD" target="_blank">asset price bubbles everywhere", as shown by the buoyant share markets</a> in India. Viruses cause a lot of misery to people. Smallpox killed 200 million people in the 20th Century alone. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200617-what-if-all-viruses-disappeared" target="_blank">So, wouldn't it be marvelous if all viruses disappeared? wondered Rachel Nuwer</a>. "If all viruses suddenly disappeared, the world would be a wonderful place for about a day and a half, and then we would all die -- that's the bottom line," says Toby Goldberg, an epidemiologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Zayed and colleagues analysed viral DNA found in the world's oceans and<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01329-w" target="_blank"> "found nearly 200,000 populations in five ocean zones around the globe</a>, with the species in each zone comprising their own viral community". Some viruses are 'phages', which means 'to devour', because they kill bacteria. "Phages are the primary regulator of bacterial populations in the ocean, and likely in every other ecosystem on the planet as well. If viruses suddenly disappeared, some bacterial population would likely explode; others might be outcompeted and stop growing completely. This would be especially problematic in the ocean, where more than 90% of all living material, by weight is microbial. These microbes produce about half the oxygen on the planet -- a process enabled by viruses." The old problem: <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantLiveWithThemCantLiveWithoutThem" target="_blank">can't live with them, can't live without them</a>.&#160; &#160;&#160;</p>

<a href="https://www.livemint.com/news/india/in-a-season-of-layoffs-here-s-where-jobs-can-be-found-11592915831636.html" target="_blank">The jobs market in India is beginning to pick after lifting of the lockdown</a>, wrote Gautam Das. "Now, with India opening up, delivery jobs continue to remain hot -- in fact, today, the entire logistics supply chain signals some sort of green shoots in India's employment market. "BPOs are rebounding" and "a higher demand for collection professionals in the financial industry is expected soon". On site healthcare for those quarantined at home and online education are also in demand. "Modern governments <a href="https://www.livemint.com/opinion/columns/corona-has-put-new-forms-of-economic-data-into-play-11592923502206.html" target="_blank">depend heavily on large surveys as well as administrative data to track</a> their respective economies," wrote Niranjan Rajadhyaksha. "Such data is the bedrock of estimates on gross domestic product (GDP), industrial production, farm output, inflation etc." "The covid-19 shock has disrupted the usual business of national statistics." Harvard University economist Alberto Cavallo has built an "alternative consumption basket" of spending by an average family in the US during the pandemic, showing "that consumer inflation in the US is higher than the official government estimate based on the country's traditional consumption basket". Usually, economic crises in emerging market (EM) economies are characterised by<a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/coronavirus-india-economic-crisis-6472983/" target="_blank"> high inflation and current account deficit due to loose monetary and fiscal policies</a>, but this time it is different, wrote Jehangir Aziz, so we need to "cut interest rates, increase liquidity support, and allow the fiscal deficit to widen". The Reserve Bank <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/rbi-cuts-repo-rate-by-40-bps-in-a-surprise-move-to-4/articleshow/75883472.cms" target="_blank">(RBI) has cut interest rate to its lowest level since 2000</a>, to 4%, down from above <a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/india/interest-rate" target="_blank">6% at the beginning</a> of 2019. Though the government <a href="https://www.newindianexpress.com/business/2020/may/24/rs-3-lakh-crore-relief-did-they-say-msmes-are-still-struggling-to-find-the-money-and-how--2147147.html" target="_blank">has earmarked Rs 3 trillion to recompense banks in case of defaults</a>, banks are reluctant to lend, especially to small businesses. Instead, banks are <a href="https://www.newindianexpress.com/business/2020/may/07/banks-park-rs-85l-cr-with-rbi-as-risk-aversion-rises-2140187.html" target="_blank">happy to earn a meager 3.75% by keeping their money safe</a> with the RBI. Aziz wants the RBI to cut interest rate more aggressively to forestall "the coming deflation" but a survey by the RBI showed that <a href="https://www.livemint.com/industry/banking/inflation-fears-rise-in-households-rbi-poll-11591295226356.html" target="_blank">85.3% of households expect inflation to accelerate</a> in the next three months. Aziz suggests increased government spending. Because, "Just like in any other EM economy, what matters today is assurance of medium-term growth and not a few higher or lower points of GDP in this year's fiscal deficit." "<a href="https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/gdp-data-indicates-india-came-wounded-to-coronavirus-battle-11590945066954.html" target="_blank">India's economy has entered the coronavirus crisis with multiple wounds</a>; and without tactical support of the government, growth would be tough to come," agreed Aparna Iyer. What would be the point of the government spending more to stimulate the economy<a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/another-hike-in-fuel-prices-diesel-crosses-rs-80-a-litre-mark-in-delhi/story-rUVJP9YJLlxZh8XQXSXopM.html" target="_blank"> if it takes the money back in higher taxes on fuel</a>,&#160;which would reduce spending by increasing costs of goods and services? The government always<a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/from-paranthas-to-shampoos-heres-listing-the-stranger-things-that-attract-gst/odd-items-that-attract-gst/slideshow/76340395.cms" target="_blank"> seeks to milk as much tax as it can from citizens</a>, to finance its promised subsidies, so it has no extra money for a stimulus. A conundrum.&#160; &#160;</p>

<p dir="ltr">
In claiming a forest of green shoots, "<a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/indicators/govt-rbis-prompt-policy-measures-helped-reinvigorate-economy-with-minimal-damage-finance-ministry-report/articleshow/76527633.cms" target="_blank">The finance ministry listed as many as 14 separate indicators across</a> manufacturing, services, finance and agriculture to back this up in a statement entitled 'Increase in Economic Activity-Improvement in Economic Indicators' issued on Tuesday, which saw the BSE Sensex breaching the 35,000 point mark for the first time since March 11, closing at 35,430, up 1.5%."&#160; "<a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/indicators/unemployment-rate-falls-to-pre-lockdown-level-cmie/articleshow/76528571.cms?utm_source=ETMyNews&amp;utm_medium=HPMN&amp;utm_campaign=AL1&amp;utm_content=20" target="_blank">The unemployment rate in India fell to its pre-lockdown level of 8.5%</a> in the week ended June 21 from the peak rate of 23.5% in April and May after the nationwide lockdown was imposed resulting in job losses for millions of workers," according to the Center for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE). However, a major reason for this drop is improvement in agriculture, and a subsidy MGNREGA. The Chief Economic Adviser <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/indias-top-adviser-sees-v-shaped-recovery-if-virus-is-contained/articleshow/76526512.cms" target="_blank">Krishnamurthy Subramanian predicted a V-shaped recovery if a vaccine</a> for coronavirus is discovered. Hallelujah! He did not say how you would vaccinate 1.3 billion people, how much it would cost and who will pay for it. "<a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/indias-economic-recovery-more-likely-to-be-u-or-w-shaped-and-not-v-analysts/articleshow/76508711.cms" target="_blank">India's economic recovery is more likely to be a 'U' or 'W' shaped</a> rather than 'V' as the impact of Covid-19 will be profound on a nation that was already struggling for growth prior to the pandemic, analysts said." Fortunately, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/l-shaped-recession.asp" target="_blank">no one predicted a 'L' shaped recovery</a> for India, although such a <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-these-economists-say-the-recovery-will-be-l-shaped-2020-05-11" target="_blank">probability is being discussed for the US</a>. Probably because, in India, "<a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/indicators/national-database-of-workers-in-informal-sector-in-the-works/articleshow/73394732.cms?from=mdr" target="_blank">Nearly 90% of the country's workforce is in the informal sector</a> with no minimum wages or any kind of social security." So, they must do something to avoid hunger. But not just the poor. "In a peculiar trend, the inequality gap in India is expected to narrow after the Covid-19 pandemic <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/indicators/inequality-gap-in-india-to-narrow-down-post-covid-19-sbi-report/articleshow/76527662.cms" target="_blank">even as per capita income (PCI) is projected to decline by 5.4%</a> during the ongoing fiscal to Rs 1.43 lakh, according to a State Bank of India (SBI) Research report released on Tuesday." We are becoming equally poor. "The Imperial College model shows that sustained moderate social distancing can save up to 1.9 million lives in India, roughly one-third of projected casualties," wrote Chairman of the PM's Economic Advisory Council Bibek Debroy and President of Copenhagen Consensus Bjorn Lomberg. But they estimate that "the total economic <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/policypundit/tackling-corona-in-india-why-the-sledgehammer-approach-is-doomed-to-fail/" target="_blank">cost of long-term moderate social distancing in India would likely be Rs 91 trillion</a> and could reach Rs 231 trillion", which, they think, is "a poor idea as social costs will outweigh benefits 7 to 1". If Debroy is Chairman of advice,&#160;<a href="https://scroll.in/article/963384/full-text-draconian-lockdown-incoherent-strategies-led-to-india-paying-a-heavy-price-say-experts" target="_blank">why did Prime Minister Narendra Modi impose a draconian lockdown without consulting experts</a>&#160;and why was it being <a href="https://thewire.in/government/india-covid-19-lockdown-failure" target="_blank">lifted when cases were rising exponentially</a>? If Debroy now thinks that 1.9 million Indians are worth sacrificing should he not lead the way by resigning his post? Rs 91 trillion for 1.9 million is Rs 45 million per Indian. We are so precious. Hallelujah in spades.&#160;</p>

<a href="http://indiadying.blogspot.com/2020/06/surely-india-practices-ethics-of-dharma.html">Surely, India practices ethics of Dharma?</a>
</h3>

 


<p dir="ltr">
"<a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/view-capitalism-needs-an-ethical-reboot/articleshow/76499083.cms" target="_blank">The rising concern over the uneven distribution of the fruits of capitalism</a> forewarned of a future when capitalism would eventually need saving from itself," wrote Prof Amit Kapoor and Harshula Sinha. Any alternative system may not "eliminate these problems as long as individuals do not change their motivations and practices, and we might end up with neither equality not efficiency. The solution instead lies in reworking the ethics underpinning capitalism." <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/dharma-religious-concept" target="_blank">The Hindu principle of Dharma is based on including</a> the community at large whereas capitalism is based on the Western concept that "puts the individual at the center". "Liberalism, political doctrine that takes<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/liberalism" target="_blank"> protecting and enhancing the freedom of the individual to be the central problem of politics</a>," says the Encyclopedia Britannica. "In the United States liberalism is associated with the welfare-state policies of the New Deal program of the Democratic administration of Pres Franklin D Roosevelt, whereas in Europe it is more commonly associated with a commitment to limited government and laissez-faire economic policies." "The largest corporations have reached the pinnacle because of the toil of its employees, who are sold the idea of corporate slavery as a prerequisite for success." "<a href="https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/VCX8OGsE1KSqzPUTX5kLHJ/Resentment-of-the-crazy-rich-isnt-just-envy.html" target="_blank">The resentment of the super-rich is probably not simply envy</a>," wrote Noah Smith. "It likely has to do with notions of fairness." Tech billionaires provide new services for the people and athletes and entertainers provide entertainment but "about 38% of Americans billionaires inherited at least a substantial part of their fortune". The concept of <a href="https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/MZfnnvsE0ibshnhzU1xBiK/Toppling-the-idol-of-shareholder-value.html" target="_blank">"maximizing shareholder value" is at the root of widening income inequality</a>, wrote Joe Nocera. "It explains why so few companies subsidize the local symphony or art museum any more. It is why drug prices have risen so obscenely, why airlines have made flying such a miserable experience and why wages have remained stagnant even as profits have soared." "Thirty years ago, economist William Baumol suggested that the future of capitalism might well belong to unproductive businesses, which <a href="https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/kYTte8GGcp3QzpepZahMSJ/Too-many-jobs-feel-meaningless-because-they-are.html" target="_blank">use power and influence to profit without necessarily benefiting society</a>," wrote Mark Buchanan. Such concerns are legitimate but the great danger is that in countries like India politicians use them to justify repressive policies in the name of helping the poor. India is the <a href="https://www.india-briefing.com/news/corporate-social-responsibility-india-5511.html/" target="_blank">only country in the world where companies are required by law to spend 2% of profits</a> on social projects. During the coronavirus-induced lockdown the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mha-order-directing-companies-to-pay-full-wages-to-employees-during-lockdown-withdrawn/articleshow/75813365.cms" target="_blank">government ordered companies to continue to pay workers for three months</a> even though production was shutdown. The order was withdrawn probably for fear of mass bankruptcies and consequent unemployment. However, Prof Kapoor's critique of capitalism is irrelevant to us because <a href="https://www.adamsmith.org/blog/india-and-the-tragedy-of-socialism" target="_blank">India is a socialist country with Socialism written into the preamble</a> of the Constitution, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-44193144" target="_blank">where inequality can be seen from space</a>. Capitalism creates inequality where some people are obscenely rich, whereas socialism creates equality in poverty. Politicians and civil servants are rich.&#160;</p>

</h3>

 


<p dir="ltr">
"According to <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2020/06/08/covid-19-to-plunge-global-economy-into-worst-recession-since-world-war-ii" target="_blank">World Bank forecasts, the global economy will shrink by 5.2% this year</a>. That would represent the deepest recession since the Second World War, the largest fraction of economies experiencing declines in per capita output since 1870, the World Bank says in its June 2020 Global Economic Prospects." "<a href="https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/more-than-80-indian-households-lost-income-during-lockdown-says-study-120051600071_1.html" target="_blank">About 84 percent of Indian households saw their incomes fall</a> last month under the world's strictest shelter-at-home rules, and many won't survive much longer without assistance," a study showed last month. In rural India, "A significant 68% of households said they had reduced food items in their meals,<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nearly-half-of-rural-households-eating-fewer-items-less-number-of-times-to-overcome-covid-crisis-survey/articleshow/75703178.cms" target="_blank"> 50% of households had reduced the number of times they were eating in a day</a> and 24% of households had borrowed food grains." "Having inflated balance sheets once again to keep a lid on long-term borrowing costs during the pandemic, central banks now face a conundrum over how to <a href="https://in.reuters.com/article/us-global-borrowing/column-central-banks-cant-back-off-now-mike-dolan-idINKBN23H318" target="_blank">keep the steep rise in government and company debt affordable</a> as markets anticipate the recovery," wrote Mike Dolan. "The Fed (US Federal Reserve) is debating on targeting the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/08/yield-curve.asp" target="_blank">different parts of the yield curve</a> to ease financial conditions in the economy," wrote Murthy Nagarajan. "The 10-year US yields are <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/bonds/global-central-banks-targeting-long-end-of-yield-curve-rbi-should-follow/articleshow/76461042.cms" target="_blank">trading at 0.80 percent and the 30-year yield is close to 1.80 percent</a>." The Japanese central bank is committed to keeping 10-year yield below 0.10 percent. The Reserve Bank (RBI) has been trying to <a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/india/interest-rate" target="_blank">bring down borrowing costs for the government by cutting interest rate</a> aggressively, bringing it down to 4% in an emergency meeting last month. However, "The spread in government securities between the five-year yield and 10-year is 80 basis points and the spread between 10-year and 30-year is another 60 basis points," which makes the 30-year yield very high considering the yield on 10-year bonds "has remained around 6 percent even after the 115 basis points repo rate cuts". The RBI has been twisting and switching to help the government. First it resorted to Operation Twist, at which it bought Rs <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/reserve-bank-of-india-operation-twist-omo-6178883/" target="_blank">100 billion worth of 10-year bonds with yield of 6.45% and sold bonds paying</a> 6.65%, 7.80%, 8.27% and 8.12%, all maturing in 2020, wrote George Mathew. But, short maturities mean that the government will have to redeem these bonds very soon, so the RBI attempted a <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/rbi-aim-to-conduct-rs-27000-crore-switch-auction-monday/articleshow/76324523.cms?from=mdr" target="_blank">'switch auction', during which it wanted to buy bonds worth Rs 270 billion</a>&#160;maturing in the next two years for longer term bonds because, otherwise, the government will have to redeem bonds worth Rs 2.29 trillion in the next two years. Investors were not enthused. "As governments and central banks shift from rescue to recovery mode", "After rolling out trillions of dollars worth of measures to prevent their economies and markets from collapsing, <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/business/guardians-of-the-world-economy-stagger-from-rescue-to-recovery/articleshow/76242427.cms?from=mdr" target="_blank">they are now doubling down with even more spending to backstop</a> a recovery as coronavirus lockdowns ease," wrote Enda Curran. Sadly, our piggy bank is empty. So the dance by the RBI. Not pretty.</p>

<div><p>MANILA, Philippines &#8211; The defense panel is studying the filing of a petition for review before the Supreme Court should the verdict of the Senate, sitting as an impeachment court, be to convict Chief Justice Renato Corona.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are still studying it thoroughly,&#8221; lead defense counsel former Associate Justice Serafin Cuevas told reporters Friday after the proceedings where Corona testified in his own defense.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>

					<p>Cuevas said that there was no appeal to whatever the impeachment court&#8217;s verdict would be except probably a petition for review before the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Senate President Juan Ponce Enrile made it clear on several occasions that their verdict would be final and could not be appealed anymore because the Senate was the only one authorized by the Constitution to decide on impeachment cases.</p><p>&#8220;The only remedy will be, probably, a petition for review alleging grave abuse of discretion,&#8221; Cuevas said.</p>
<p>&#8220;But if we will use it or not, will depend on the result of our research,&#8221; Cuevas said.</p><p></p><p>&#8220;If we see an opportunity, we will file [the petition]. But if there isn&#8217;t any, they we won&#8217;t,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The impeachment court has scheduled the final oral arguments on May 28, Monday. They will announce their verdict the following day.</p>

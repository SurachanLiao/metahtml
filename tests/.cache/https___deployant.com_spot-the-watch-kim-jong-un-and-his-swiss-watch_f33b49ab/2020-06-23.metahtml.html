Starting with the recent declaration of peace with South Korea and his commitment to seek &#8220;complete denuclearisation&#8221;, he is riding the popularity waves, so to speak. But we are not here to discuss his politics. Never! We are here to spot his watch. He was seen during the recent talks wearing a watch from design icon Movado.</p><p id="caption-attachment-35402" class="wp-caption-text">In this April 27, 2018, photo, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un speaks with South Korean President Moon Jae-in at Peace House of the border village of Panmunjom in the Demilitarized Zone, South Korea.&#160; (Korea Summit Press Pool via AP)</p><p>On his wrist?

The bezel appears to have a textured surface. Case diameter is a rather small 31mm.</p><p>The watch is in Movado Museum stainless steel with Black PVD, black dial with gold tone hands. The movement is quartz. We do not see the watch in the current <a href="http://www.movado.com/us/en/home">Movado catalog</a>&#160;and assume it is discontinued. A theory supported by a quick search on the internet which shows that the watch is sold out. The watch has a case diameter of 31mm, and looks rather small on his wrist.</p><p>Though information on his early life is rather scarce and often shrouded in mystery, it is believed that he attended school in Switzerland, and perhaps that&#8217;s where he picked up the Movado.</p><p>This concludes this episode of Spot the Watch.</p><p>Editor&#8217;s note: This STW is a true team effort. With Chelsey Chen bringing up the spot from pictures she saw on the internet, making the initial ID as a Movado.&#160; Resident spotter Nick Gould weighing in to nail the model as the Museum Black PVD, and the author writing up and confirming the spot.&#160;</p><p class="postinfo-label">Posted In</p><p class="category-list"><a href="https://deployant.com/category/news/" title="View all posts in News">News</a>, <a href="https://deployant.com/category/people/" title="View all posts in People">People</a></p><p class="postinfo-label">Tags</p><p class="hidden-tags"><a href="https://deployant.com/tag/kim-jong-un/" rel="tag">kim jong-un</a>, <a href="https://deployant.com/tag/movado/" rel="tag">movado</a></p><p class="label-text">What's your reaction?</p><p class="reaction-text">I Love It</p><p class="reaction-percentage iloveit size5">50%</p><p class="reaction-text">Cool</p><p class="reaction-percentage cool size1">12%</p><p class="reaction-text">It's OK</p><p class="reaction-percentage itsok size0">2%</p><p class="reaction-text">What?</p><p class="reaction-percentage what size1">10%</p><p class="reaction-text">I Hate It</p><p class="reaction-percentage ihateit size3">26%</p><p class="big-like"><a class="styled metric like-button do-like 35408" title="Likes"><span class="labeltext"> like</span></a></p><p class="label-text"> You might also like</p><p class="textfill"><span class="title-text">The Collector&#8217;s View: WatchTalk with Michael Biercuk</span></p><p class="wp-video">

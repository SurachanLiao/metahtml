<p> The building was designed to be interesting to look at, as well as functional. But leaks were found in the roof of the $107 million building shortly after completion. <a href="https://edmonton.ctvnews.ca/council-to-discuss-4m-increase-for-delayed-police-detachment-1.4628461">The roof was patched last fall, causing the budget to balloon by $4 million.</a></p>
<p> This past January, inspectors found 22 more leaks in the roof.</p>
<p> &#8220;It&#8217;s beautiful, it&#8217;s ready to open, but the roof is leaking, that&#8217;s frustrating,&#8221; said Coun. Bev Esslinger.</p>
<p> A report will go before city council next week to replace the entire roof, at a cost of $8 million, which the city would have to borrow.</p>
<p> &#8220;I&#8217;d rather not spend a penny of it, but at the same time to have a facility that I can&#8217;t use,&#8221; Esslinger said. &#8220;Seems ridiculous.&#8221;</p>
<p> The project was approved in 2012, before the current area councillor Jon Dziadyk was elected.</p>
<p> &#8220;It&#8217;s a beautiful building, I love it,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p> &#8220;The Police need and deserve a facility like this, perhaps the roof shouldn&#8217;t have been so elaborate in the first place.&#8221;</p>
<p> The building will replace the existing police station in northwest Edmonton, which doesn&#8217;t have any holding cells. The new building also has a training facility. Currently, the police department is renting gym space in Griesbach for training.</p>
<p> &#8220;Maybe we should have been a bit more modest and then this building would be up and running right now with the police actually in it.&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;I&#8217;m sure after this we&#8217;ll have a discussion about what could have happened differently, should we have designed it like that, at this stage, it&#8217;s figure out how to move forward,&#8221; said Esslinger.</p>
<p> The city has taken the original contractors to court. Councillors expect a settlement will cover the cost of the initial repairs and the new roof.</p>
<p> The city will choose from two possible designs for the new roof, more information about those options is expected to be revealed on Monday, as well as a timeline for the project.&#160;</p>

How do I search? Travel geeks can get the latitude and longitude of any airport, hotel, city, state, country, or zip code. To get started, enter your starting point and destination into the boxes above. If you want an airport, it's best to enter the 3-letter IATA code if you know it. For cities, include the state or country if possible. You can also enter more general locations like a state or province, country, island, zip code, or even some landmarks by name.

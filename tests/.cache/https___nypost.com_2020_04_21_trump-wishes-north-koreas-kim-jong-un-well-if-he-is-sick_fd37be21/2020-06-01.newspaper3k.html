<div><p>President Trump said Tuesday he doesn&#8217;t know whether North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is sick but wished him luck with any potential ailments.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can only say this: I wish him well,&#8221; Trump said when questioned about reports that Kim&#8217;s health <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/04/20/north-koreas-kim-jong-un-in-grave-danger-after-surgery-report/">was in dire condition</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;These are reports that came out, and we don&#8217;t know,&#8221; Trump told reporters.</p>
<p>CNN reported late Monday that US officials were monitoring intelligence suggesting the 36-year-old despot was in grave danger after undergoing surgery.</p>
<p>But South Korea&#8217;s government on Tuesday said there were no unusual signs suggesting Kim was ill.</p>
<p>Speculation about Kim grew <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/04/17/kim-jong-uns-absence-from-event-sparks-health-speculation/">since he skipped the celebration</a> of the birthday of his grandfather, the nation&#8217;s founder, Kim Il Sung, last Wednesday.</p>
<p>National security adviser Robert O&#8217;Brien <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/04/21/us-has-contingency-plans-in-place-if-kim-jong-un-dies-report/">told reporters</a> that the administration was &#8220;watching reports closely.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are monitoring these reports very closely and as you know, North Korea is a very closed society, there is not a free press there, they are parsimonious with the information they provide on many things, including the health of Kim Jong Un,&#8221; O&#8217;Brien said, adding that the US intelligence community and Defense Department were watching the situation.</p>

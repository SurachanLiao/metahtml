President Trump said Tuesday he doesn’t know whether North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is sick but wished him luck with any potential ailments.

“I can only say this: I wish him well,” Trump said when questioned about reports that Kim’s health was in dire condition.

“These are reports that came out, and we don’t know,” Trump told reporters.

CNN reported late Monday that US officials were monitoring intelligence suggesting the 36-year-old despot was in grave danger after undergoing surgery.

But South Korea’s government on Tuesday said there were no unusual signs suggesting Kim was ill.

Speculation about Kim grew since he skipped the celebration of the birthday of his grandfather, the nation’s founder, Kim Il Sung, last Wednesday.

National security adviser Robert O’Brien told reporters that the administration was “watching reports closely.”

“We are monitoring these reports very closely and as you know, North Korea is a very closed society, there is not a free press there, they are parsimonious with the information they provide on many things, including the health of Kim Jong Un,” O’Brien said, adding that the US intelligence community and Defense Department were watching the situation.

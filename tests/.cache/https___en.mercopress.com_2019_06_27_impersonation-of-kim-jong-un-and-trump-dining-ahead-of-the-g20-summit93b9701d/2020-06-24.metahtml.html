        <p>The residents of Japan&#8217;s capital were treated to the extraordinary sight of Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un casually dining together, just days before the G20 summit in Osaka, only to realize the pair in question were uncanny lookalikes.</p>

        <p>The seemingly germ-conscious duo were captured sharing some hand sanitizer before tucking into their meal. </p>
<p>However it seemed pretty difficult to enjoy a lunch &#8216;off the clock&#8217; while wearing their signature outfits, as amused bystanders stopped to take photos and videos. </p>
<p>The pretenders have been traveling the world, and causing some controversy along the way, with their lookalike act. </p>
<p>In February Australian Howard X, who impersonates Kim, said he and Canadian-born Trump impersonator Russell White were interrogated by Vietnamese police officers when they visited Hanoi ahead of the US-North Korea summit.</p>
<p>The pair have also been questioned by authorities in Singapore and angered several North Korean cheerleaders during an appearance at the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea.</p>

The results, so far, are encouraging, but researchers suggest that there is a long way to go until a safe and effective treatment is reached. Could the Zika virus be used for health? A new study suggests that it could, despite &#8211; or rather, because of &#8211; its tendency to target and destroy neural progenitor cells, which are brain stem cells that differentiate into neurons and glial cells in the central nervous system. This is why the babies of mothers infected with Zika during their pregnancy are often born with microcephaly. However, this might also make the Zika virus a viable &#8220;weapon&#8221; against glioblastoma stem cells, which are undifferentiated cells that promote the development of glioblastoma, a particularly aggressive form of brain cancer. The research was co-directed by Drs. Michael Diamond and Milan Chheda, both from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, MO, alongside Dr. Jeremy Rich, from the University of California School of Medicine in San Diego. &#8220;We knew that [the] Zika virus selectively targeted neuroprogenitor or stem cells in the brain in developing fetuses.

									  Have we mentioned lately that Mike 
									Pence is a lying weasel? The vice president 
									tried to plant the bloody glove of 9/11 on 
									Iranian General

									<a target="_blank" href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/887555/mike-pence-crams-3-inaccuracies-about-911-into-1-tweet-trying-justify-soleimani-strike">claimed</a> in a tweet Friday that
									<a target="_blank" href="https://www.wonkette.com/wingnuts-wish-donald-trump-a-happy-new-war">Soleimani,</a> who the US killed good and 
									dead, "assisted in the clandestine travel to 
									Afghanistan of 10 of the 12 terrorists who 
									carried out the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks 
									in the United States." These are all lies. 
									But the New York Times reacted as 
									if he just flubbed an answer on his early 
									21st century history midterm.</p> <p align="center"><del><img class="rm-shortcode" id="8f83d" src="https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMjQ4NDQ3OC9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTU4Mjk0ODM1NX0.8AA_ezPfNW9QgxVLG4KfcmMDSRVTrrT-qoNiPvZ9ZEc/img.png?width=980" width="700" height="606"></del></p> <p align="center">Sigh.New 
									York Times</p> <p>This Times headline reads as if "the 
									Public Record" was Pence's band from the 
									1990s before he went solo. He's on tour with 
									some classic war tunes and the Public Record 
									won't back him again. He'll have to settle 
									for some random session musicians. The 
									actual story here, for those of us who took 
									a journalism class once, is that the vice 
									president willingly spread falsehoods on 
									Twitter about Soleimani. He even got the
									<a target="_blank" href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/887555/mike-pence-crams-3-inaccuracies-about-911-into-1-tweet-trying-justify-soleimani-strike">number </a>of 9/11 hijackers wrong. There 
									were 19 angry men not 12. It's unclear why 
									he'd lie about that. Maybe Pence thought 19 
									was too close to 69. As
									<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/cmclymer/status/1213213116869349376?s=20">Charlotte Clymer </a>quickly pointed out, "Soleimani 
									quite literally helped the U.S. with 
									post-9/11 intelligence in Afghanistan 
									because he hated the Taliban." </p> <table width="100%" border="0"><tr><td><p align="center">Are You Tired Of

									the terrorist attacks. He wasn't. Ellen 
									Degeneres's buddy George W. Bush frequently
									implied a link. This was all 
									pre-Twitter so Bush and Dick Cheney couldn't 
									just lie in 280 characters or less like 
									Trump and Pence do with apparent impunity.
									</p> <blockquote>Bush, in his speeches, did not say 
										directly that Hussein was culpable in 
										the Sept. 11 attacks. But he frequently 
										juxtaposed Iraq and al Qaeda in ways 
										that hinted at a link. In a March speech 
										about Iraq's "weapons of terror," Bush 
										said: "If the world fails to confront 
										the threat posed by the Iraqi regime, 
										refusing to use force, even as a last 
										resort, free nations would assume 
										immense and unacceptable risks. The 
										attacks of September the 11th, 2001, 
										showed what the enemies of America did 
										with four airplanes. We will not wait to 
										see what terrorists or terrorist states 
										could do with weapons of mass 
										destruction."</blockquote> <p>Oh no! There are so many words! And 9/11 
									was one of them. Is 9/11 a word? We don't 
									have time to discuss that! Hussein will kill 
									us all unless we strike first! </p> <p>This is why liberal spoilsports like 
									myself warned against forgiving or worse 
									forgetting what the architects of Iraq did 
									not so long ago. We open ourselves up for a

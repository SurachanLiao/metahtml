									Vice President Pence Lies About Soleimani, 
									9/11 in Plain Sight Of Mother, Bible, 
									Half-Eaten Apple Pie<p>
									
									
									By Stephen Robinson</p>
									<p>January 05, 2020 "<a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/">Information 
									Clearing House</a>" - 
									&#160; Have we mentioned lately that Mike 
									Pence is a lying weasel? The vice president 
									tried to plant the bloody glove of 9/11 on 
									Iranian General
									<a href="https://www.wonkette.com/wtf-are-we-about-to-go-to-war-with-iran">
									Qasem Soleimani.</a> Pence
									<a target="_blank" href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/887555/mike-pence-crams-3-inaccuracies-about-911-into-1-tweet-trying-justify-soleimani-strike">
									claimed</a> in a tweet Friday that
									<a target="_blank" href="https://www.wonkette.com/wingnuts-wish-donald-trump-a-happy-new-war">
									Soleimani,</a> who the US killed good and 
									dead, "assisted in the clandestine travel to 
									Afghanistan of 10 of the 12 terrorists who 
									carried out the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks 
									in the United States." These are all lies. 
									But the New York Times reacted as 
									if he just flubbed an answer on his early 
									21st century history midterm.</p>
									
										 
									<p align="center">
									
									Sigh.New 
									York Times</p>
									<p>This Times headline reads as if "the 
									Public Record" was Pence's band from the 
									1990s before he went solo. He's on tour with 
									some classic war tunes and the Public Record 
									won't back him again. He'll have to settle 
									for some random session musicians. The 
									actual story here, for those of us who took 
									a journalism class once, is that the vice 
									president willingly spread falsehoods on 
									Twitter about Soleimani. He even got the
									<a target="_blank" href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/887555/mike-pence-crams-3-inaccuracies-about-911-into-1-tweet-trying-justify-soleimani-strike">
									number </a>of 9/11 hijackers wrong. There 
									were 19 angry men not 12. It's unclear why 
									he'd lie about that. Maybe Pence thought 19 
									was too close to 69. As
									<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/cmclymer/status/1213213116869349376?s=20">
									Charlotte Clymer </a>quickly pointed out, "Soleimani 
									quite literally helped the U.S. with 
									post-9/11 intelligence in Afghanistan 
									because he hated the Taliban." </p>

									<p>I can't get over the photo art the Times 
									used for an article about how the vice 
									president's a shameless liar. It's some
									<a target="_blank" href="https://www.wonkette.com/vps-wife-karen-pence-set-to-teach-the-art-of-bashing-queers">
									mother</a> and apple pie patriotic bullshit. 
									I would've gone with a shot of him picking 
									his nose not solemnly standing by the flag 
									with his hand plugging the gaping hole where 
									his soul escaped. </p>
									<p>Pence's press secretary kept shoveling 
									the manure.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">For those asking: 12 of the 19 transited through Afghanistan. 10 of those 12 were assisted by Soleimani. <a href="https://t.co/KSUI2kXmfX">https://t.co/KSUI2kXmfX</a></p>&#8212; Katie Waldman (@VPPressSec) <a href="https://twitter.com/VPPressSec/status/1213233878326009857?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 3, 2020</a></blockquote>   
									<p>This is probably news to the 2002-era 
									United States that
									<a target="_blank" href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/09/30/the-shadow-commander?verso=true">
									actively</a> worked with Soleimani to take 
									out their mutual enemy, the Taliban. Here's 
									what should concern you: The American 
									government has a bad habit of blaming 
									countries for 9/11 before we invade them. 
									Two years after 9/11, 7 out of 10 Americans
									<a target="_blank" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2003/09/06/hussein-link-to-911-lingers-in-many-minds/7cd31079-21d1-42cf-8651-b67e93350fde/">
									believed</a> Saddam Hussein was involved in 
									the terrorist attacks. He wasn't. Ellen 
									Degeneres's buddy George W. Bush frequently
									implied a link. This was all 
									pre-Twitter so Bush and Dick Cheney couldn't 
									just lie in 280 characters or less like 
									Trump and Pence do with apparent impunity.
									</p>
									<blockquote>
										Bush, in his speeches, did not say 
										directly that Hussein was culpable in 
										the Sept. 11 attacks. But he frequently 
										juxtaposed Iraq and al Qaeda in ways 
										that hinted at a link. In a March speech 
										about Iraq's "weapons of terror," Bush 
										said: "If the world fails to confront 
										the threat posed by the Iraqi regime, 
										refusing to use force, even as a last 
										resort, free nations would assume 
										immense and unacceptable risks. The 
										attacks of September the 11th, 2001, 
										showed what the enemies of America did 
										with four airplanes. We will not wait to 
										see what terrorists or terrorist states 
										could do with weapons of mass 
										destruction."</blockquote>
									<p>Oh no! There are so many words! And 9/11 
									was one of them. Is 9/11 a word? We don't 
									have time to discuss that! Hussein will kill 
									us all unless we strike first! </p>
									<p>This is why liberal spoilsports like 
									myself warned against forgiving or worse 
									forgetting what the architects of Iraq did 
									not so long ago. We open ourselves up for a 
									revival of a show we never liked in the 
									first place, one that technically
									<a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/14/arts/design/iraq-wars-art-momaps1-review.html">
									never ended. </a></p>

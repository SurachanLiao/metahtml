The first Iranian website for booking both hotels and hostels in Iran, was started by SevenHostels Group in May 2015. The purpose of starting such a website has been to solve a common difficulty that most foreign travelers face when they visit Iran; finding decent hostels or cheap hotels in Tehran or in other Iranian cities. Here on this website it's possible to book a bed/room at any hotel or hostel in Iran online; There are listings of hotels in Tehran, hostels in Tehran, hotels in Kashan, hostels in Kashan, hotels in Isfahan, hostels in Isfahan, hotels in Shiraz, hostels in Shiraz, hotels in Yazd, hostels in Yazd, hotels in Dizin, hotels in Shemshak, hotels in Hamadan, hotels in Tabriz, hotels in Ilam, hotel in Kerman, hotels in Varzaneh, hotels in Garmeh, hotels in Qazvin, hotels in Alamut, etc. The reason that it’s not easy to earn reliable information about hotels or hostels in Iran is not that there are few of them in this country, but that there are few hostels or hotels that have proper websites in English. Now, what could SevenHostels Group do to facilitate the process of earning reliable information about accommodation facilities in Iran?

Iran Accommodation; Hostels and Cheap Hotels in Tehran, Iran

First, and having a clear answer in mind to the question "what is a hostel?", several groups of professional Iranian tour guides were sent to major touristic cities in Iran. The first step for these people who know the tourism in Iran very well, was to gain reliable information about all backpacking hostels and budget hotels in Tehran, Iran's capital. Later on, the groups were sent to other cities like Kashan, Isfahan, Shiraz, Yazd, Alamut, Dizin, Tabriz, Ilam, Varzaneh, Qazvin, Garmeh, etc. with the same mission. The earned information included a list of all Iran accommodation facilities in different cities, their exact locations, a list of the facilities and services they offer, photos from the facilities, and finally of course the services’ prices. Needless to say, there are many hostel, hotels, or ecolodges in Iran that aside from accommodation, offer other services such as operating Iran tours or booking Iran train tickets, or even Iran bus tickets. The second step in creating such a platform was to process and classify the information that was earned by our inspectors. In this step all the hostels or hotels in Iran went through an objective process of assessment and were ranked. It is necessary to mention that SevenHostels Group has tried its best to follow the international ranking norms in its assessment process. It’s also necessary to mention that this process of assessment is a constant one; our inspectors visit the enlisted hostels and hotels regularly to make sure they follow the standards with which they’re introduced to the backpackers and other travelers.

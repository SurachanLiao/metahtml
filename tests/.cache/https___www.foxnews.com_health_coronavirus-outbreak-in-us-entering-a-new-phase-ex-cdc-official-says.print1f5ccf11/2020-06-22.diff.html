In addition, caregivers should devise a plan for how to provide care for patients should they contract the illness.</del></p><p><del>“As the trajectory of the outbreak continues, many people in the U.S. will at some point in time this year or next be exposed to the virus, and there’s a good chance many will become sick,” Messonnier said.</del></p><p><del><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/coronavirus-us-state-by-state-breakdown" target="_blank"><strong>CORONAVIRUS IN THE US: STATE-BY-STATE BREAKDOWN </strong> Link: https://www.foxnews.com/health/coronavirus-us-state-by-state-breakdown </a></del></p><p><del>She also asked for people to understand the need for “personal responsibilities” to protect those who are older and considered at risk for complications and to listen to local government officials regarding event cancellations and other guidance.</del></p><p><del>“We’re looking both at risk of exposure and risk of the individuals,” she said.</del></p><p><del>Some of those responsibilities include using good personal judgment before traveling.</del></p><p><del><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/infectious-disease/coronavirus" target="_blank"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE</strong> Link: https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/infectious-disease/coronavirus </a></del></p><p><del>“Domestic travelers should use good judgment,” Amler said, “considering the importance of the trip and the expected level of virus activity at the destination.”</del></p><p><del>As far as mass transit goes, Amler said the risk of boarding buses and trains each day is “not well characterized” yet, but for riders and those who must continue commuting, “the basic rules always apply – social distancing and avoidance of contact with people who are coughing, sneezing, etc.”</del></p><p class="url-description"><del><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/coronavirus-outbreak-in-us-entering-a-new-phase-ex-cdc-official-says" target="_blank">URL Link: https://www.foxnews.com/health/coronavirus-outbreak-in-us-entering-a-new-phase-ex-cdc-official-says </a></del></p><p class="url-address"><del>https://www.foxnews.com/health/coronavirus-outbreak-in-us-entering-a-new-phase-ex-cdc-official-says

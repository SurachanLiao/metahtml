In addition,&#160;caregivers should&#160;devise a plan for how to provide care for patients&#160;should they contract the illness.</p><p>&#8220;As the trajectory of the outbreak continues, many people in the U.S. will at some point in time this year or next be exposed to the virus, and there&#8217;s a good chance many will become sick,&#8221; Messonnier said.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/coronavirus-us-state-by-state-breakdown" target="_blank"><strong>CORONAVIRUS IN THE US: STATE-BY-STATE BREAKDOWN&#160;</strong></a></p><p>She also asked for people to understand the need for &#8220;personal responsibilities&#8221; to protect those who are older and considered at risk for complications and to listen to local government officials regarding event cancellations and other guidance.</p><p>&#8220;We&#8217;re looking both at risk of exposure and risk of the individuals,&#8221; she said.</p><p>Some of those responsibilities include using good personal judgment before traveling.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/infectious-disease/coronavirus" target="_blank"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE</strong></a></p><p>&#8220;Domestic travelers should use good judgment,&#8221; Amler&#160;said,&#160;&#8220;considering the importance of the trip and the expected level of virus activity at the destination.&#8221;</p><p>As far as mass transit goes, Amler said the risk of boarding buses and trains each day is &#8220;not well characterized&#8221; yet, but for riders and those who must continue commuting, &#8220;the basic rules always apply &#8211; social distancing and avoidance of contact with people who are coughing, sneezing, etc.&#8221;</p><p class="url-description"><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/coronavirus-outbreak-in-us-entering-a-new-phase-ex-cdc-official-says" target="_blank">URL</a></p><p class="url-address">

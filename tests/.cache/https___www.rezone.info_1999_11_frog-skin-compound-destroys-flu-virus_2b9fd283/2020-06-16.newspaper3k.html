According to researchers from the Emory Vaccine Center and the Rajiv Gandhi Center for Biotechnology in India, frog slime can destroy the H1 variety of influenza viruses. The discovery was published in Immunity and was led by senior author Joshy Jacob, Ph.D., associate professor of microbiology and immunology at the Emory Vaccine Center and Emory University School of Medicine. Prof. Jacob and graduate student David Holthausen collaborated on the research project with M.R. Pillai, Ph.D., and Sanil George, Ph.D., from the Rajiv Gandhi Center for Biotechnology. Previous research has shown that frogs&#8217; skins secrete mucus that contains &#8220;host defense peptides,&#8221; known to protect them from harmful bacteria. The new study reveals that the skin secretions from South Indian frogs act as &#8220;anti-flu peptides&#8221; and could prove useful in the antiviral drug arena. For example, anti-flu peptides could be an invaluable resource if there were a new influenza pandemic. Influenza pandemics occur when there is an outbreak of a novel influenza strain that emerges, infects, and spreads quickly and easily.

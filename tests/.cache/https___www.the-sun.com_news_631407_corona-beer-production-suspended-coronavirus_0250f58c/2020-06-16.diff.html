the one-million mark.</p> <p>Mexico has so far registered more than 1,500 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 50 deaths.</p> <p>Non-essential activities have been suspended for at least the month of April to slow the spread of coronavirus.</p> <p>News that production on Corona has been suspended sparked fears of a global shortage and sent beer fans flooding to stockists.</p> <p>Pictures from Mexico showed shoppers loading trolleys with hundreds of crates in the wake of the shock announcement.</p> <p>Grupo Modelo revealed on Thursday it will temporarily stop brewing Corona and other brands exported to 180 countries after its activities were declared non-essential under a government order aimed at curbing the spread of the coronavirus.</p> <p>The brewery said it was scaling down its operations to a "bare minimum" in line with the Mexican government's orders but suggested it could keep brewing beer if its operations were deemed to be agriculture.</p> <p>Agriculture and food production are among the key sectors which are still allowed to function under Mexican government orders.</p> <p>The brewer said in a statement: "If the federal government considers it appropriate to issue some clarification confirming beer as an agro-industrial product, at Grupo Modelo we are ready to execute a plan with more than 75 per cent of our staff working from home and at the same time guaranteeing the supply of beer."</p> <p>Grupo Modelo operates 11 breweries in Mexico and said the suspension will go into place from Sunday.</p> <p>The brewery will reduce operations to a level where they could resume once the suspension is lifted</p> <del><a href="#"><img alt=" Production of the beer is being cut back during the outbreak" class="lazyload" src=""> Link: # </a></del><p

<p>The northern state of Nuevo Leon where Heineken's Mexican operations are based said on Wednesday it would stop the distribution of beer, sparking panic-buying.</p> <p>The company suffered another blow last week when plans for a $1.5billion brewery on the U.S. border were rejected in a referendum.</p> <p>The plant was already two-thirds built but Mexico's government said it would not grant operating permits after the vote.</p> <p>Anheuser-Busch InBev, the brewer of Corona and other beers, said last month it believes it has lost $170 million in profits due to the <a

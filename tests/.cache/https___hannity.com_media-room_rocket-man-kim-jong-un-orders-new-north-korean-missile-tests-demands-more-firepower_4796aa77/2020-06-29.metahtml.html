                                 <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un tested another round of short-range missiles Thursday; openly defying the Trump administration and South Korea as talks to denuclearize the Korean peninsula have reportedly stalled in recent months.</p>
<p>&#8220;The South Korean joint chiefs of staff announced the launch in a statement, saying the missiles were fired from the northwest city of Kusong and traveled roughly 260 miles to the east. American negotiators are currently in South Korea for discussions on how to break the impasse following two high-level summits between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un that failed to secure any lasting changes,&#8221; reports <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/world-report/articles/2019-05-09/north-korea-launches-new-missiles">US News</a>.</p>
              
                                                 
            
                                                  

                                                  
                                            
<p>The test comes just days after North Korea fired multiple missiles into the sea, with officials claiming the tests were part of a &#8220;regular&#8221; and &#8220;routine&#8221; military exercise.</p>

                                 <p>Earlier this week, North Korean officials revealed that Kim Jong Un had decided to abandon his plan to launch four, long-range ballistic missiles towards the waters near Guam. The President harshly warned that any action against US soil would be met with &#8220;fire and fury&#8221; and that the military was &#8220;locked and loaded.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If he does anything with respect to Guam or any place else that&#8217;s an American territory or an American ally, he will truly regret it and he will regret it fast,&#8221; said President Trump.</p>

                                                                                                       
              
                                                   
                
                                                  
                                            
<p>Though North Korea said it would not attack the island, it warned that Kim could change his mind at any moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the Yankees persist in their extremely dangerous reckless actions on the Korean Peninsula and in its vicinity, testing the self-restraint of the DPRK, the [North] will make an important decision as it already declared,&#8221; said the statement.</p>

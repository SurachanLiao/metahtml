North Korean leader Kim Jong Un reportedly ordered his communist regime to further their ongoing rocket tests Friday; telling his military to increase the available “firepower” as nuclear negotiations with the Trump administration have largely stalled in recent months.

“The leader of North Korea ordered its military to boost its strike capability as he directed another missile firing, state media said on Friday, as tensions grew over tests that appeared to show development of a new advanced missile system,” reports Reuters.

“(Kim) stressed the need to further increase the capability of the defense units in the forefront area and on the western front to carry out combat tasks and keep full combat posture to cope with any emergency,” the KCNA news agency reported.

The new tests come as the United States recently ‘seized’ a North Korean cargo ship for violating UN sanctions and illegally transporting coal and other fuel to the Hermit Kingdom.

The Name of God <span class=GramE>The</span> Compassionate, the Merciful</span></i></b><span
style='font-size:13.5pt'> </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>The Messenger of God has said, &quot;Verily I
am leaving with you the two most valuable and weighty objects: the Book of God
and my household (the <span class=SpellE>Thaqalain</span>). Indeed these two
shall not part with each other until they join up with me by the pond&quot; (of
<span class=SpellE>Kowthar</span> in <st1:place w:st="on">Paradise</st1:place>
on the Day of Judgment). </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>(The Prophetic Tradition of <a
href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs0.htm#ank1"><span
class=SpellE>Thaqalain</span></a>) </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>To Allah belongs all praise. Glorified is Thy
Name, O God, bless <span class=SpellE>Muhammed</span> and his household who are
manifestations of Your Beauty and Magnanimity and the secret treasures of Your
Book, the Book that <span class=SpellE>crystallises</span> Your Oneness in all
Your Names and Divine Attributes, including the one that none but Yourself
knows. And let there be curse on those who oppressed the Prophet (SAW) and his
household, those that belonged to the wretched pedigree. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>At the outset to this prologue, it appears
proper to briefly comment on the two most exalted and momentous objects of
trust (<a
href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs0.htm#ank2">The <span
class=SpellE>Thaqalain</span></a>) , not on their transcendental, spiritual, or
mystical aspects, an area into which pens such as mine are unable to venture as
it is a domain of <a
href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs0.htm#ank3"><span
class=SpellE>molk</span></a>, the cognition of which covers all circles of
beings, from earth to heaven (<a
href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs0.htm#ank4"><span
class=SpellE>Malakoot-e-Aala</span></a>) ... (4) and beyond to His Divine
presence (<a
href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs0.htm#ank5"><span
class=SpellE>Lahoot</span></a>) ...(5) including circles that lie beyond the
comprehension of our intellects. Nor do I mean to comment on that which has
befallen humanity due to its negligence of the true nature and status of the
greater trust (<a
href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs0.htm#ank6"><span
class=SpellE>theql-e-akbar</span></a> ...(6) = The Holy <span class=SpellE>Quran</span>)
and that of the great trust (<a
href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs0.htm#ank7"><span
class=SpellE>theql-e-kabir</span></a> = The Household of the Prophet (SAW)),
which is greater than anything except the great trust which is great in the
absolute (<span class=SpellE>akbar-e-mutlaq</span>). Also I do not intend to
recount here all that has befallen these two most valuable divine trusts (The <span
class=SpellE>Thaqalain</span>) by the enemies of God and the treacherous
followers of the tyrants = (<a
href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs0.htm#ank8"><span
class=SpellE>Taghootian</span></a>) as these are too many for me to enumerate,
given my limited knowledge and time. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>I thought that I might make a passing remark
about what has happened to these two most valuable treasures. Perhaps the
phrase, &quot;... which will never part with each other until they join me by
the pond (<a
href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs0.htm#ank9"><span
class=SpellE>Howz</span></a>) ...(9) ...implies that after the death of the
Prophet (SAW), the Book of God and the household of the Prophet (SAW) shall
receive similar treatment. Whatever is made of one, the other suffers the same
until both descend on the Prophet (SAW) and unite with him by the Pond. Does
this union, this pond, indicate <a
href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs0.htm#ank10">the
merging of plurality with unity </a><span class=GramE>...(</span>10) as the
disappearance of drops in the sea? Or, does it mean something beyond the gamut
of human intellect and cognition? Moreover the cruelty to which these two
divine trusts, nay the entire humanity including the Islamic <span
class=SpellE>ummah</span> (nation), were subjected by the followers of the
tyrants and their stooges defy description by pen. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>It should be mentioned that the <span
class=SpellE>Thaqalain</span> <a
href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs1.htm#ank11"><span
class=SpellE>Hadith</span></a> ...(11) which is a <span class=SpellE>mutawatir</span>
(an unbroken chain of recorded traditions) Tradition has been quoted, cited and
adduced successively by Muslim <span class=SpellE>ulema</span> (<span
class=SpellE>foqaha</span>, learned religious authorities or jurists), in both <span
class=SpellE>Shia</span> and <a
href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs1.htm#ank12">Sunni </a>...(12)
denominations as proof positive for all mankind, especially for Muslims in all sects
and branches. References to this Prophetic tradition are frequently made in
such highly reliable Sunni sources like the famous 'Six <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'>Authentic Texts&quot;</b> (<a
href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs1.htm#ank13">The <span
class=SpellE>Sahah-e-Sitta</span></a>) <span class=GramE>...(</span>13) as well
as in countless Shiite cogent texts. This <span class=SpellE>hujjat</span> or
proof is binding on all Muslims who are accountable for it especially the <span
class=SpellE>foqaha</span> (Muslim religious jurists) as they cannot claim
ignorance of it. Let us now see what befell this book of God, this Divine Trust
and the bequest of the prophet of Islam. The sad events for which tears may
well be shed, began to take place following the martyrdom of <a
href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs1.htm#ank14"><span
class=SpellE>Hazrat</span> Ali (AS)</a> <span class=GramE>...(</span>14).
Selfish people, followers of <span class=SpellE>taghoots</span> (despotic,
pagan rulers) abused the Holy <span class=SpellE>Quran</span> as a mean by
which to establish anti-<span class=SpellE>Quranic</span> rules. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>To achieve this they forced off the scenes
the true interpreters of the <span class=SpellE>Quran</span> and others who had
received all of the Holy Book directly from the Prophet (SAW) and whose ears
still echoed with the voice of His Holiness Muhammad (SAW) as he had said,
&quot;... I am leaving with you the two most valuable objects...' Thus, the <span
class=SpellE>Quran</span>, which was to be man's guide to moral and material
life to the Last Day, was shelved and the rule of divine justice that was, and
still is, one of the ideals of the holy Book, was all forgotten. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Perversion of the Book, of Divine Traditions
and of God's religion reached a shameful stage, it became the rule. The more
this warped and distorted condition advanced, the more the Holy <span
class=SpellE>Quran</span> that had been sent down for the betterment of <span
class=GramE>man,</span> was forced into oblivion. The <span class=SpellE>Quran</span>
was sent down by the Omniscient God to <span class=SpellE>Hazrat</span>
Muhammad (SAW) to complete and seal such divine revelations (<a
href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs1.htm#ank15"><span
class=SpellE>Kashf</span> -e <span class=SpellE>Tomm</span>-e <span
class=SpellE>Muhammadi</span></a>) ...(15), <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:

rescue this issue of the divine attributes (<a

class=SpellE>Validah</span>-e <span class=SpellE>Eimul-Asmae</span></a>)
...(16) from tyranny and evil; to institute the rule of justice and equity and
to confer sovereignty to the Infallible and divine authorities (<a
href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs1.htm#ank17">The <span
class=SpellE>Masoomeen</span></a>) ...(17) that they in turn hand over such
divine sovereignty to qualified worthy persons, was removed from all areas as
though it had had no mission to guide mankind. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>In the hands of oppressive rulers and wicked <span
class=SpellE>akhunds</span> (<span class=SpellE>muslim</span> clergymen,
sometimes used in a derogatory manner), who were more decadent than the <span
class=SpellE>taghooti</span> (despotic) rulers the Holy <span class=SpellE>Quran</span>
was abused as an instrument of oppression, cruelty and corruption and was
distorted to justify acts of tyranny by the enemies of God. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Unfortunately, in the hands of conniving
enemies and ignorant friends, the Holy <span class=SpellE>Quran</span>, this
divine book that is empowered to decide man's destiny, has found no place anywhere
except in graveyards and at the gatherings for the dead. <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'>The instrument, that was to unite Muslims and all mankind and serve as
scripture for their lives and salvation, was turned into an instrument of
division and dispute among men or left the arena entirely.</b> We all witnessed
that whoever spoke of Islamic rule or of politics, which is the major role of
Islam and its Prophet (SAW), or of the <span class=SpellE>Quran</span> and
Islamic traditions, was regarded as one who had committed grave sins. The term <span
class=SpellE>akhund-a-siasi</span>, which means a political clergyman, came to
denote a profane canonist. These circumstances are still extant. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>In recent years <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:

class=GramE>who</span> sham Islam, undertaken to reprint and publish the Holy <span
class=SpellE>Quran</span>, <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>distorting sacred
verses</b> to serve their devilish ends. Such <span class=SpellE>Qurans</span>
are published with attractive calligraphy and binding and are distributed
everywhere with the aim of eventually removing the Holy Book from all scenes.
We all saw the <span class=SpellE>Quran</span> that <a

Reza Khan <span class=SpellE>Pahlavi</span></a> <span class=GramE>...(</span>18)
had printed. He succeeded in deceiving some people including a few Muslim <span
class=SpellE>akhunds</span> or preachers who, unaware of the aims of Islam,
praised him for it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>We

<p><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Women
who are capable of fighting take military training, which is a major
prerequisite for the <span class=SpellE>defence</span> of Islam and the Islamic

<h2>DEFINITIONS OF THE TERMS AND CONCEPTS EMBODIED IN THE WILL<o:p></o:p></h2>

<h3><a name=ank1>1) The prophetic tradition of </a><span class=SpellE><span
style='mso-bookmark:ank1'>Thaqalain</span></span><span style='mso-bookmark:
ank1'>:<o:p></o:p></span></h3>

<span style='mso-bookmark:ank1'></span>

<p>The <span class=SpellE>Thaqalain</span> Tradition is one of the best known
traditions quoted by many, including an amazing number of authoritative Sunni
sources, as coming directly from the person of the Prophet (SAW). Several
important points can be deduced from this and similar traditions: <o:p></o:p></p>

<p>a) As the holy <span class=SpellE>Quran</span> shall remain with the people
until the Last Day, in like manner, the Prophet's Household will remain to the
Last Day, <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>This means that the world will
never be without an Imam and true leader. <br>
</b>b) By means of these two great trusts the Prophet (SAW) has secured all the
scientific and religious needs of the Muslims and has designated his household
as reference sources of knowledge and insight. <br>
c) No muslin has the right to disown their (the Household's) guidance and
leadership. <br>
d) The entire body of knowledge and religious requirements and needs of the
people are vested in the Prophet's Household. <br>
e<b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>) If people obey the Prophet's
Household and adhere to their words they shall not go astray.</b> <o:p></o:p></p>

<h3><a name=ank2>2) The </a><span class=SpellE><span style='mso-bookmark:ank2'>Thaqalain</span></span><span
style='mso-bookmark:ank2'>:<o:p></o:p></span></h3>

<span style='mso-bookmark:ank2'></span>

<p><span class=GramE>The term '<span class=SpellE>Thaqalain</span>&quot; means
two '<span class=SpellE>Thegls</span>'.</span> In the explanatory accounts of
the traditions and narratives as well as in the interpretations of the holy <span
class=SpellE>Quran</span>, the term '<span class=SpellE>Theql</span>' is used
indicating various meanings and concepts such as 'weighty heritage&quot;, a
'great thing&quot;, &quot;weighty object', 'precious thing&quot;,
&quot;invaluable trust', etc. However, in the <span class=SpellE>Thaqalain</span>
<span class=SpellE>Hadith</span>, by the two trusts <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'>is meant the <span class=SpellE>Quran</span> and the holy Prophet's
Household. <o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The understanding and recognition of the worlds of being is
an important argument in philosophy. Philosophy proves the existence of a
number of worlds of which the one that is observable to the eyes and is felt by
other senses is the world of nature or '<span class=SpellE>Molk</span>&quot;. <o:p></o:p></p>

<h3><a name=ank4>4) </a><span class=SpellE><span style='mso-bookmark:ank4'>Malakoot-e-Aala</span></span><span
style='mso-bookmark:ank4'>:<o:p></o:p></span></h3>

<span style='mso-bookmark:ank4'></span>

<p>Philosophers and thinkers have reasoned the necessity of the existence of a
world standing as a dividing fine between the world of nature (<span
class=SpellE>Molk</span>) and the world of divinity (God). This world which is
separate from matter and conditions of time and place is absolutely called the
world of divinity (<span class=SpellE>Alam-e-Malakoot</span>). The philosophers
and the '<span class=SpellE>Orefa</span>&quot; or Gnostic, whose arguments are
confirmed explicitly by specific Islamic texts, <span class=GramE>maintain</span>
two stages for the world of divinity (<span class=SpellE>Malakoot</span>):
'High' and 'Low&quot;. The higher stage is termed (<span class=SpellE>Malakoot</span>-e
<span class=SpellE>Aala</span>) or the superior <span class=SpellE>Malakoot</span>
and is a world regarded as the birthplace of human intellect. The lower stage
is named the &quot;lesser <span class=SpellE>Malakoot</span>&quot; and is known
to be the world of illusion and fancy (<span class=SpellE>Alam-e-Methal</span>
or <span class=SpellE>kheyal</span>). <o:p></o:p></p>

<h3><a name=ank5>5) </a><span class=SpellE><span style='mso-bookmark:ank5'>Lahoot</span></span><span
style='mso-bookmark:ank5'>:<o:p></o:p></span></h3>

<span style='mso-bookmark:ank5'></span>

<p><span class=SpellE>Lahoot</span> implies the sacred essence of God which can
not be understood through the senses but can be proved through logical
reasoning and intellectual argument. As the Divine Essence comprises the entire
attributes and qualities of perfection, it is therefore considered the most
perfect world. <o:p></o:p></p>

style='mso-bookmark:ank6'>: </span><o:p></o:p></h3>

<p>It can be deduced from the wording of the <span class=SpellE>Thaqalain</span>
Tradition and from the accounts given by the ex-<span class=SpellE>pounders</span>
of <span class=SpellE>ahadith</span> and interpreters of traditions that the
Greater <span class=SpellE>Theql</span> (<span class=SpellE>Theql-e-Akbar</span>)
is the Holy <span class=SpellE>Quran</span>. <o:p></o:p></p>

<h3><a name=ank7>7) </a><span class=SpellE><span style='mso-bookmark:ank7'>Theql-e-Kabir</span></span><span
style='mso-bookmark:ank7'>:<o:p></o:p></span></h3>

<span style='mso-bookmark:ank7'></span>

<p>According to the sources concerned with the concepts of the <span
class=SpellE>Thaqalain</span>, the Great <span class=SpellE>Theql</span> (<span
class=SpellE>Theql-e-Kabir</span>) denotes the progeny or household of God's
messenger (SAW), that is, the <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Infallible
Imams. <o:p></o:p></b></p>

<h3><a name=ank8>8) The </a><span class=SpellE><span style='mso-bookmark:ank8'>Taghootian</span></span><span
style='mso-bookmark:ank8'>: </span><a name="ank3&gt;"><o:p></o:p></a></h3>

<span style='mso-bookmark:ank3&gt;'></span>

<p>The term &quot;<span class=SpellE>Taghootian</span>&quot; means followers of
<span class=SpellE>Taghoot</span>. It has been used in the <span class=SpellE>Quran</span>
on eight occasions. <span class=SpellE>Taghoot</span> was also the name of an
idol of the <span class=SpellE>Quraish</span> Tribe in pre-Islamic days. <b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>This name has been used to mean Satan</b>.
Most exegetes consider the word <span class=SpellE>Taghoot</span> applicable to
any idol, object or <span class=GramE>individual, that</span> may prevent one
from doing good, and drag him into perversion and perdition. &quot;<span
class=SpellE>Taghoot</span>&quot; has also been described as a rebel against
all goodness and the sublime values. <o:p></o:p></p>

<h3><a name=ank9>9) The </a><span class=SpellE><span style='mso-bookmark:ank9'>Howz</span></span><span
style='mso-bookmark:ank9'>:<o:p></o:p></span></h3>

<span style='mso-bookmark:ank9'></span>

<p>'<span class=SpellE>Howz</span>' means a pool, pond, water basin or ditch
dug in the ground to store water in. In Islamic literature the term '<span
class=SpellE>Howz</span>' usually precedes the word '<span class=SpellE>Kothar</span>'
thus meaning the <span class=SpellE>Kowthar</span> Pond, a stream located,
according to narratives, in <st1:place w:st="on">Paradise</st1:place> or in
here after (<span class=SpellE>Mahshar</span>). In this context, however, Imam
Khomeini (P.U.H) has interpreted the '<span class=SpellE>Howz</span>' as an
eternal reality implying a point at which unity is arrived at by the merger of
pluralities. Just as several creeks or streams emptying into the same pool
merge together and become one, at the Resurrection time the Holy <span
class=SpellE>Quran</span> and the Household of the Prophet (SAW) converge on
one other and form one entity. <o:p></o:p></p>

<h3><a name=ank10>10) The merging of plurality with unity:<o:p></o:p></a></h3>

<span style='mso-bookmark:ank10'></span>

<p>In philosophy &quot;plurality&quot; connotes the hierarchy of beings and the
variance of the phenomena of being, whether material or non-material <span
class=GramE>And</span>, 'unity&quot; conforms to the penultimate essence of
Divine Being which is the source and fountainhead of all beings in the
universe. In view of this definition, the station of convergence or union of
plurality with unity or oneness, a stage or station which is eternal and is
above plurality and below unity and is the medium by which, at the beginning of
creation, plurality has emerged from unity and, at the end of the world all
join up to form the ultimate oneness. <o:p></o:p></p>

<span style='mso-bookmark:ank11'></span>

<p class=MsoNormal>The word &quot;<span class=SpellE>Hadith</span>&quot;
literally means <span class=GramE>new,</span> recently occurred, fresh. It also
means news, speech, etc. In Islamic religious teachings it means words and
sayings as definitely coming from the persons of the Prophet (SAW) and or the
Infallible Imams (A.S). <o:p></o:p></p>

<h3><a name=ank12>12) The Sunni Muslims:<o:p></o:p></a></h3>

<span style='mso-bookmark:ank12'></span>

<p>The issue of the rightful succession of the prophet and the leadership of
the Islamic <span class=SpellE>Ummat</span> (nation) after his death caused
Muslims to branch off in two groups: The followers of Ali (A.S) and the
Infallible Imams who considered the caliphate the exclusive right of Imam Ali
(A.S) and his progeny and the group that did not believe so. The first <span
class=GramE>group are</span> named the <span class=SpellE>Shia</span> and the
other group is termed the Sunni. The Sunni group is divided into four creeds:
The <span class=SpellE>Hanafi</span>; the <span class=SpellE>Shafeii</span>;
the <span class=SpellE>Maleki</span> and the <span class=SpellE>Hanbali</span>.

the six correct volumes which the Sunni <span class=SpellE>Ulema</span>

style='mso-bookmark:ank14'> Ali (A.S):<o:p></o:p></span></h3>

<span style='mso-bookmark:ank14'></span>

<p>Ali (A.S), <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>the first Imam</b> of
Shiite Muslims, was born 600 <span class=GramE>ad</span>. <span class=GramE>to</span>
<span class=SpellE>Fatemeh</span> and <span class=SpellE>Abutaleb</span>
(latter is the paternal uncle of the Prophet (S-A.W). Ali (A.S) grew up in the
house of the Prophet since the age of 6. He was the first male person to accept
Islam and pledge himself to assist the Prophet (S.A.W). Early in his prophetic
mission when, by command of Allah, the Prophet (S.A.W) called his own kin to
Islam, he announced at a gathering of them: &quot;<span class=GramE><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>The</b></span><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'> first among you to believe and accept my faith shall succeed me!'</b>
He repeated this sentence three times and each time Ali was the only person who
professed his faith. On the <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>night of
migration</b> or <span class=SpellE>Hijrat</span> (of the Prophet from <st1:City
w:st="on">Mecca</st1:City> to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Medina</st1:City></st1:place>),
Ali betook himself into the Prophet's bed and slept there (the <span
class=SpellE>Quraish</span> had plotted to <span class=SpellE>terrorise</span>
the Prophet that night) and thus demonstrated his fidelity to him. The Prophet
(S.A.W) adopted Ali as his own brother and, on return from his last Hajj
pilgrimage, at a place called <span class=SpellE>Ghadir</span>, the Prophet
(S-A.W) publicly declared Ali (A.S) as the guardian of the Muslims and
Administrator of their affairs. Ali (A.S) was a companion of the Prophet in his
lonely days and his aide in hardships and dangers. For a period of 25 years
immediately after the Prophet's demise, Ali (A.S) remained aside, for some
reasons, of government administration and leadership. During this entire period
Ali (A.S) had assumed the status of an observer whose presence averted
deviation and perversion. After the third Caliph was killed, the <span
class=SpellE>Sehaba</span> or companions and a number of other people swore
allegiance to Ali (A.S) and selected him as their Caliph. Imam Ali (A.S)
administered the affairs of the Islamic world for nearly four years and nine
months. He restored the changes that had occurred after the Prophet (S-A.W) to
their pristine state. Opposition agents, whose interests were threatened, rose
on every side and, pretending to avenge the blood of the 3rd Caliph, set off
internal bloody wars that lasted during the entire period of Ali (A.S)'s rule,
until, finally, they martyred this unique man of history after the Prophet, by
the altar where he was saying prayers. It is extremely difficult to talk of Ali
(A.S)'s personality in a worthy manner. He had dedicated his entire life to
God's religion and was not remiss in this for the slightest moment. In his
modest home children such as <span class=SpellE>Hassan</span> and <span
class=SpellE>Hossein</span> (A.S) and <span class=SpellE>Zainab</span> (A.S)
were reared, persons who left deep imprints on the course of history and who,
as leader and mentor of seekers of truth carried, on their backs, the shining
torch of humanism through the darkness of times. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p>The term of Imamate of the 12th Shiite imam, <span class=SpellE>Hazrat</span>
<span class=SpellE>Hojjat</span> <span class=SpellE>ibn</span> <span
class=SpellE>Hasan</span> <span class=SpellE>Askari</span> (A.S) began when he
was only 6 years old. Because of the conditions prevailing at the time and by
God's will, <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>His Holiness went into
occultation.</b> The period of the Mahdi (A.S)'s occultation is divided in two
parts: the lesser or minor occultation (<span class=SpellE>ghaybat-e-sughra</span>)
which lasted 69 years. <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>During this
period his holiness was indirectly in communion with the people through the
medium of four representatives. Then began the grand or major occultation (<span
class=SpellE>ghaybat</span>-e-cobra) which has continued to this date and will
be effective until his advent and the triumph of Truth over falsehood</b>.
Islamic thought holds to the view that the extensive challenges of <span
class=SpellE>Hazrat</span> Mahdi (A.S) and his impending advent will be the
last link in the chain of the challenges and fights of the <span class=SpellE>ahl-e-haq</span>
or supporters of Truth against the <span class=SpellE>ahl-e-batel</span> or
adherents to falsehood. This means that the struggles of the followers of Truth
will continue throughout history and grounds for the victory of Truth becomes
better prepared with each passing day and <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>culminate
in the advent and rise of the promised Mahdi </b>(A.S) with the eventual dawn
of the light of Truth and Justice in man's horizons, marking his intellectual,
moral and social maturity. <o:p></o:p></p>

by <span class=SpellE>Hazrat</span> Ali (A.S), his children and by all other
Infallible Imams. Of the importance of this prayer, the saying of which was

<span style='mso-bookmark:ank27'></span>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>Hossein</span> (A.S) was the hero of <span
class=SpellE>Ashura</span> (the 10th day of <span class=SpellE>Muharran</span>
when Imam <span class=SpellE>Hossein</span> (A.S) was martyred), the greatest
epic event in man's history. He was born to Ali (A.S), the man of Justice and
chastity and Her Holiness <st1:place w:st="on"><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:

the symbol of a Muslim woman, in the 4th year ah. <span class=GramE>and</span>
was raised and reared under the care and supervision of a father such as Ali
(A.S), a grandfather such as Muhammad (S.A.W) and a mother like Fatima (A.S).
After the martyrdom of Imam <span class=SpellE>Hasan</span> (A.S) in 50 ah.,
caliph <span class=SpellE>Mua`viah</span> increased his pressure and ordered
all his governors to delete the names of the Shiite Muslims (followers of Ali
(A.S) from the rosters of the Muslim treasury and to apprehend and put to death
any one accused of sympathy for Ali (A.S). <span class=SpellE>Yazid</span>
succeeded his father <span class=SpellE>Mua`viah</span> as caliph and followed
the path of his sire. He ordered that <span class=SpellE>lmam</span> <span
class=SpellE>Hossein</span> swear allegiance to him and be slain should he
refuse. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p>Imam <span class=SpellE>Hossein</span> did not yield to <span class=SpellE>Yazid</span>,
this prototype of meanness and villainy. He resorted to the sword and undertook
the fundamental <span class=SpellE>Ashura</span> move that he might thus kindle
a light (of hope) amid the darkness (of oppression) and to initiate history's
eternal epic event. <span class=GramE>By sacrificing his ale including the
lives of himself, his kin and supporters in the path of God; Imam <span
class=SpellE>Hossein</span> (A.S).became a model and example for all those who
tread in the path of Truth.</span> Many books have been written about the
personality of Imam <span class=SpellE>Hossein</span> (A.S) and a great deal
has been talked about him. Friend and foe testify to Imam <span class=SpellE>Hossein's</span>
matchless courage, bravery, patience, forbearance, his challenge of cruelty and
injustice, his courtesy and humility, his kindness and his compassion. <o:p></o:p></p>

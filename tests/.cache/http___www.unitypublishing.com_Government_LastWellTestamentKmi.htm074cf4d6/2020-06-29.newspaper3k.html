<p><b>Know your
enemy!</b>&#160; This is the
reason I am publishing the last will and testament of the 20th Century
leader of Islam.&#160; In Islamic schools
children from the age of 4 or 5 are being taught to give their lives for Allah,
not just like Christian martyrs defending themselves, but to kill anyone who
does not believe like them. Kill even those who would like to live in peace with them.<p></p></p>

<p>Khomeini, the religious leader (Pope) of the Islamic world, insists
that everyone take the bible of Muhammed literally
and the Tradition, the Theqalain, as law.&#160; In the Theqalain
you will learn that you are the Taghoot,
and as such should be killed.&#160; His dream
and goal was to unite Shiite and Sunni but without compromising his views. In
his last will and testament he tries to convince all to this unity.&#160; <p></p></p>

<p>He claims that <b>now</b> is the time for the 12th
Imam, Mahdi, and with Mahdi's rule a just war will destroy all heretics and nations
that do not follow Allah.&#160; In order to
bring out the 12th Imam,
 Iran and all
those nations with them <b>must start a
world war</b> against all enemies of Allah.<p>&#160; They must start or cause 
World War III.</p></p>

<p>He makes it clear that the enemies of Allah
are the nations and leaders of The United States of America, Israel, Russia,
Iraqi, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt and international
Zionism.&#160; Know for sure&#160; by his own words that
if there is a war, <b>Iran</b><b>
will attempt to kill the kings of Saudi Arabia
and Jordan and the leaders
of Egypt
and Iraqi.</b> <p></p></p>

<p>I am convinced that there is already a World
War III and Iran
is the enemy.&#160; We, in America, will
have more 9-11s, maybe even atomic, and America-Israel will go to war on
Iranian soil.&#160; </p>
<p>On a personal level I do
not worry about this because America
will easily win this war and can take a few terrorist strikes without even
harming the economy. However --------------------????<p></p></p>

<p>There is one thing that will happen and it
will not only affect me and my family directly but it will affect everyone on
the face of the earth and there is nothing we can do about it.&#160; Iran will (they have even said that
they will) bomb and stop the oil flow through the Straights of Hormuz. <p></p></p>

<p>The oil from Iran,
Saudi Arabia, Iraqi, Kuwait, and even pipe lines from Russia pass
through the Straights of Hormuz.&#160; The Straights
are surrounded by Iranian land, Iranian ships, submarines, mines and
missals.&#160; There is no way we can stop Iran from
closing the Straights.&#160; And if they do,
you and I will be directly affected within a few weeks or days.&#160; <b>Half
the imported oil of the world goes through the Straights of Hormuz.</b>&#160; &#160;Iran will not fire missals at Israel but they will fire missals at the oil
fields of Saudi Arabia,
Iraqi and Kuwait.<p></p></p>

<p>Because <b>Iran</b><b> wants a world war</b> they will sacrifice
even their own profits from the oil to bring about victory.&#160; It will be a suicide of a nation, but it will
work because it will bankrupt the entire world.&#160;
<p></p></p>

<p>Although America
gets no oil from Iran, the
world wide oil is on the open market, and since America uses 35% of the world
supply, the oil will stop within a week.&#160;
When supplies of gas stop everything stops.&#160; Everything happens because of the energy of
gas.&#160; We get food because of gas, we get
water because of gas, and we get medical treatment because of gas.&#160; Almost all this gas comes from Moslem or
Anti-American countries.&#160; But because we
never attempted to get off this addiction it is now too late to stop what will
happen.<p></p></p>

<p>I am so convinced of this that my family, four
different houses, is preparing for a food, water, gas and medical
shortage.&#160; We are building a hot house
for vegetables, a food storage building, a water tank and a fuel storage tank.&#160; <p></p></p>

<p>Although the American military will prevail
over any and all Islamic attacks, it will take at least a year to overcome the gas
shortage that will be caused by Iran.&#160; I predict that this will cause civil unrest
in Europe, South America and Asia.&#160; If coordinated with Islamic riots like in Paris and more 9-11s it
could get worse. <p></p></p>

<p>Since I know that closing of the Straights of
Hormuz, along with bombing of the oil fields of the major oil producing
countries, and at the same time riots and 9-11s is the only way to harm the
west, do you think they do not know this also?<p></p></p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Richard
Salbato August 22, 2006&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
</p>

<p>The
following is the will and testament of our enemy.&#160; <b>At
least read the bold highlights</b>:<p></p></p>

<p><p>&#160;</p></p>

<p align="center"><b><i>In
The Name of God The Compassionate, the Merciful</i></b> </p>

<p>The Messenger of God has said, "Verily I
am leaving with you the two most valuable and weighty objects: the Book of God
and my household (the Thaqalain). Indeed these two
shall not part with each other until they join up with me by the pond" (of
Kowthar in Paradise
on the Day of Judgment). </p>

<p>(The Prophetic Tradition of <a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs0.htm#ank1">Thaqalain</a>) </p>

<p>To Allah belongs all praise. Glorified is Thy
Name, O God, bless Muhammed and his household who are
manifestations of Your Beauty and Magnanimity and the secret treasures of Your
Book, the Book that crystallises Your Oneness in all
Your Names and Divine Attributes, including the one that none but Yourself
knows. And let there be curse on those who oppressed the Prophet (SAW) and his
household, those that belonged to the wretched pedigree. </p>

<p>At the outset to this prologue, it appears
proper to briefly comment on the two most exalted and momentous objects of
trust (<a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs0.htm#ank2">The Thaqalain</a>) , not on their transcendental, spiritual, or
mystical aspects, an area into which pens such as mine are unable to venture as
it is a domain of <a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs0.htm#ank3">molk</a>, the cognition of which covers all circles of
beings, from earth to heaven (<a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs0.htm#ank4">Malakoot-e-Aala</a>) ... (4) and beyond to His Divine
presence (<a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs0.htm#ank5">Lahoot</a>) ...(5) including circles that lie beyond the
comprehension of our intellects. Nor do I mean to comment on that which has
befallen humanity due to its negligence of the true nature and status of the
greater trust (<a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs0.htm#ank6">theql-e-akbar</a> ...(6) = The Holy Quran)
and that of the great trust (<a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs0.htm#ank7">theql-e-kabir</a> = The Household of the Prophet (SAW)),
which is greater than anything except the great trust which is great in the
absolute (akbar-e-mutlaq). Also I do not intend to
recount here all that has befallen these two most valuable divine trusts (The Thaqalain) by the enemies of God and the treacherous
followers of the tyrants = (<a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs0.htm#ank8">Taghootian</a>) as these are too many for me to enumerate,
given my limited knowledge and time. </p>

<p>I thought that I might make a passing remark
about what has happened to these two most valuable treasures. Perhaps the
phrase, "... which will never part with each other until they join me by
the pond (<a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs0.htm#ank9">Howz</a>) ...(9) ...implies that after the death of the
Prophet (SAW), the Book of God and the household of the Prophet (SAW) shall
receive similar treatment. Whatever is made of one, the other suffers the same
until both descend on the Prophet (SAW) and unite with him by the Pond. Does
this union, this pond, indicate <a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs0.htm#ank10">the
merging of plurality with unity </a>...(10) as the
disappearance of drops in the sea? Or, does it mean something beyond the gamut
of human intellect and cognition? Moreover the cruelty to which these two
divine trusts, nay the entire humanity including the Islamic ummah (nation), were subjected by the followers of the
tyrants and their stooges defy description by pen. </p>

<p>It should be mentioned that the Thaqalain <a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs1.htm#ank11">Hadith</a> ...(11) which is a mutawatir
(an unbroken chain of recorded traditions) Tradition has been quoted, cited and
adduced successively by Muslim ulema (foqaha, learned religious authorities or jurists), in both Shia and <a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs1.htm#ank12">Sunni </a>...(12)
denominations as proof positive for all mankind, especially for Muslims in all sects
and branches. References to this Prophetic tradition are frequently made in
such highly reliable Sunni sources like the famous 'Six <b>Authentic Texts"</b> (<a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs1.htm#ank13">The Sahah-e-Sitta</a>) ...(13) as well
as in countless Shiite cogent texts. This hujjat or
proof is binding on all Muslims who are accountable for it especially the foqaha (Muslim religious jurists) as they cannot claim
ignorance of it. Let us now see what befell this book of God, this Divine Trust
and the bequest of the prophet of Islam. The sad events for which tears may
well be shed, began to take place following the martyrdom of <a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs1.htm#ank14">Hazrat Ali (AS)</a> ...(14).
Selfish people, followers of taghoots (despotic,
pagan rulers) abused the Holy Quran as a mean by
which to establish anti-Quranic rules. </p>

<p>To achieve this they forced off the scenes
the true interpreters of the Quran and others who had
received all of the Holy Book directly from the Prophet (SAW) and whose ears
still echoed with the voice of His Holiness Muhammad (SAW) as he had said,
"... I am leaving with you the two most valuable objects...' Thus, the Quran, which was to be man's guide to moral and material
life to the Last Day, was shelved and the rule of divine justice that was, and
still is, one of the ideals of the holy Book, was all forgotten. </p>

<p>Perversion of the Book, of Divine Traditions
and of God's religion reached a shameful stage, it became the rule. The more
this warped and distorted condition advanced, the more the Holy Quran that had been sent down for the betterment of man, was forced into oblivion. The Quran
was sent down by the Omniscient God to Hazrat
Muhammad (SAW) to complete and seal such divine revelations (<a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs1.htm#ank15">Kashf -e Tomm-e Muhammadi</a>) ...(15), <b>to unite humanity</b> and advance him to his rightful station; to
rescue this issue of the divine attributes (<a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs1.htm#ank16">Validah-e Eimul-Asmae</a>)
...(16) from tyranny and evil; to institute the rule of justice and equity and
to confer sovereignty to the Infallible and divine authorities (<a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs1.htm#ank17">The Masoomeen</a>) ...(17) that they in turn hand over such
divine sovereignty to qualified worthy persons, was removed from all areas as
though it had had no mission to guide mankind. <p></p></p>

<p>In the hands of oppressive rulers and wicked akhunds (muslim clergymen,
sometimes used in a derogatory manner), who were more decadent than the taghooti (despotic) rulers the Holy Quran
was abused as an instrument of oppression, cruelty and corruption and was
distorted to justify acts of tyranny by the enemies of God. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, in the hands of conniving
enemies and ignorant friends, the Holy Quran, this
divine book that is empowered to decide man's destiny, has found no place anywhere
except in graveyards and at the gatherings for the dead. <b>The instrument, that was to unite Muslims and all mankind and serve as
scripture for their lives and salvation, was turned into an instrument of
division and dispute among men or left the arena entirely.</b> We all witnessed
that whoever spoke of Islamic rule or of politics, which is the major role of
Islam and its Prophet (SAW), or of the Quran and
Islamic traditions, was regarded as one who had committed grave sins. The term akhund-a-siasi, which means a political clergyman, came to
denote a profane canonist. These circumstances are still extant. </p>

<p>In recent years <b>major satanic powers</b> have, through their puppet regimes who sham Islam, undertaken to reprint and publish the Holy Quran, <b>distorting sacred
verses</b> to serve their devilish ends. Such Qurans
are published with attractive calligraphy and binding and are distributed
everywhere with the aim of eventually removing the Holy Book from all scenes.
We all saw the Quran that <a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs1.htm#ank18">Muhammad
Reza Khan Pahlavi</a> ...(18)
had printed. He succeeded in deceiving some people including a few Muslim akhunds or preachers who, unaware of the aims of Islam,
praised him for it. <p></p></p>

<p><b>We
note that each year <a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs1.htm#ank19">King Fahd</a> ...(19) of Saudi Arabia spends a good deal of the
wealth of the people in printing the Holy Quran and
considerable publicity and propaganda material in support of anti-Quranic ideas propagating the baseless and superstitious
cult of <a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs1.htm#ank20">Wahhabism</a> ...(20). Fahd
abuses the Quran, urges negligent people and nations to side with the
superpowers. He uses the noble Islam and the Holy Book to destroy both. <p></p></b></p>

<p>We are proud, and our dedicated nation is
proud, that we adhere to a faith in which the Holy Quran
speaks of the unity of all Muslims and the oneness of mankind. We are proud
that our faith has retrieved the Quran from the
cemeteries and has saved this Holy Book as man's prescription for freedom from
all physical, mental and intellectual bonds that push him deeper into slavery
and nothingness. We are proud to be followers of a religion whose founder has
been designated by divine commandment and in which Ali ibn
Abi Taleb (AS), this
servant of God, free of all bonds and shackles of servitude and serfdom, has
been appointed to deliver mankind from all the chains of slavery and thraldom. We are honored that the book <a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs2.htm#ank21">Nahjul-Balagha</a> ...(21), which is next to the Quran, is man's great manuscript for salvation, moral and
material existence and the greatest instrument for just rule and government,
has our Infallible Imam, Ali (AS) as its author. </p>

<p>We are proud to have had as our leaders <a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs2.htm#ank22">the
Infallible Imams</a> ...(22), from Ali (AS) down to <a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs2.htm#ank23">Hazrat Mahdi (AS)</a> ...(23) who, by the grace of God,
lives in occultation, and watches our doings. </p>

<p>We are honoured to have
our Infallible Imams as authors of such exalted, superb and life-giving prayers
of supplication (referred to as <a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs2.htm#ank24">The
Ascending Quran (Quran-e-Sa-ed))
</a>...(24), as<a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs2.htm#ank25"> the Shabaniah prayer</a> ...(25), <a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs2.htm#ank26">the
Arafat Prayer</a> ...(26) of<a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs2.htm#ank27"> Imam
Hussein (AS) </a>...(27), <a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs2.htm#ank28">the Sahifah Sajjadiah</a> ...(28),
these psalms of <a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs2.htm#ank29">the
Household of Muhammad (SAW) </a>...(29), and <a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs2.htm#ank30">the Sahifah Fatimiah</a> ...(30)
revealed by the Lord to <a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs3.htm#ank31">Her
Holiness Fatima Zahra (AS) ..</a>.(31). We are honoured
to have had as<a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs3.htm#ank32"> our
fifth Infallible Imam, Baqer-ul-uloom (AS)</a> ...(32) (profound knowledge, a title given to the fifth
Imam), this superlative world personality whose true station can be appreciated
by none save Allah, His Prophet (pbuh) and the
Infallible Imams (pbut). </p>

<p>We are proud to be followers of<a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs3.htm#ank33"> the Jaaferi Faith</a> ...(33)
(Religion) whose <a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs3.htm#ank34">fiqh </a>...(34) (religious legislation and jurisprudence)
is a boundless ocean. We are proud of all our Infallible Imams (the 12 innocent
ones) and we are committed to follow them. <p></p></p>

<p><b>We are
honoured that our Infallible Imams (AS) suffered
imprisonment, banishment and finally attained martyrdom in their efforts to
advance Islam; to implement the teachings and commandments of the Holy Quran-of which the establishment of the sovereignty of
justice is but one dimension - and; to overthrow the rule of the oppressors and
of the arrogant. <p></p></b></p>

<p><b>Today,
we feel proud that we seek to re-institute the objectives of the Holy Quran and Tradition and that the various layers of our
nation sacrifice their lives, properties and loved ones for this holy cause. <p></p></b></p>

<p><b>We are
proud that our women, young and old, regardless of their status, are present
and active, side by side with the men, often more active than men, in all
scenes including cultural, economic and military areas. They strive, sometimes
more effectively than the men, for the propagation of Islamic teachings. <p></p></b></p>

<p><b>Women
who are capable of fighting take military training, which is a major
prerequisite for the defence of Islam and the Islamic
state. Our women have extricated themselves from the deprivations imposed on
them by the enemies of Islam and by the inadequate knowledge of friends of
Islamic tenets. They have bravely discarded the superstitions created by
enemies through some ignorant preachers. <p></p></b></p>

<p><b>Those
women who are unable to fight in the war fronts serve behind the front-lines
with such ardour and courage that makes the hearts of
their men tremble with delight and it throws fear in the heart of enemies and
makes ignorant individuals who are worse than foes shake with anger and fear.
Often we hear our women, in a manner like that of <a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs3.htm#ank35">Hazrat Zainab</a> ...(35), cry out loud saying that they have given children
in the path of God and Islam and are proud of it. They realise
that what they get in return is far above the blessings of Heaven, let alone
the material things of this world. <p></p></b></p>

<p>Our nation, indeed all Islamic nations as
well as the meek and oppressed are pleased to see that their enemies, who are
the enemies of Almighty God, of Islam and of the Holy Quran,
are indeed savages who do not desist from committing any criminal acts to
promote their mean purposes and who are unable to tell a friend from a foe in
achieving treacherous goals. <p></p></p>

<p><b>The USA is the
foremost enemy of Islam.</b> <b>It is a terrorist state by nature that has
set fire to everything everywhere and its ally, the international Zionism does
not stop short of any crime to achieve its base and greedy desires, crimes that
the tongue and pen are ashamed to utter or write. The stupid idea of a <a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs3.htm#ank36">Greater
Israel </a>...(36) urges them to commit any shameful
crime. <p></p></b></p>

<p><b>The
Islamic nations and the mustazafeen (the meek, the
oppressed) peoples of the world are pleased to have <a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs3.htm#ank37">Hussein
of Jordan</a> (37) a professional, itinerant criminal, <a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs3.htm#ank38">Hasan of Morocco</a> ...(38) and <a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs3.htm#ank39">Hosni Mubarak</a> ...(39) of
Egypt, fellow-mangers of Israel, as enemies. These are fellow-criminals with Israel and commit any act of treason against
their own nations to serve the USA.
We cheer to have <a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs3.htm#ank40">Saddam,
the Aflaqi </a>...(40) as an
enemy whom friend and foe know to be a criminal, a violator of human rights and
international laws and whose betrayal of the peoples of Iraq and of the Persian
 Gulf Emirates, has been no less than his betrayal of our country
and people. We and the oppressed peoples of the world are delighted to be
objects of criminal accusations by the superpowers through the international
mass media under their control. <p></p></b></p>

<p><b>What
can be a better source of pride than the fact that the USA with all its
military might, its boastfulness, its claims, its mass media and its allies
among puppet regimes, has been so dumbfounded and disgraced in its dealings
with the dauntless Iranian nation and the land of His Holiness Baqiyatullah (a title of the 12th infallible imam, Hazrat Mahdi (AS) who is now in occultation) that it does
not know which way to turn and who to turn to?!! <p></p></b></p>

<p><b>This
is not the work of anyone or anything except divine assistance that has
awakened nations, particularly the Iranian Muslim nation and has guided it from
darkness into light: The Light of Islam. <p></p></b></p>

<p><b>I now
take this opportunity to advise the oppressed and noble nations, including our
own, to stay firmly on this divine straight path that leads neither to the
atheistic (Mulhid) East nor
to the oppressive, pagan West, but to the path which the Almighty God has
decreed for us. <p></p></b></p>

<p><b>I
further advise not to be negligent even for a single moment in being grateful
for this blessing. Let no polluted hand of a superpower, or its agents, whether
domestic or foreign, affect your determination and will. <p></p></b></p>

<p><b>Know
that the rowdier the Eastern or Western satanic power gets, the more proof it
is for your divine support and God shall reward and punish the deserving ones
in the best fashion in this and in the other worlds. "Truly, He is the
Lord of all blessing and in His hand lies the dominion over all things".(The Quran, Sura
23, AI-Muminun, the Believers, verse 88). <p></p></b></p>

<p>I earnestly ask all Muslim nations to follow
the practices and traditions of the Infallible Imams (AS) in <b>respect of political, social, economic and
military affairs and to sacrifice for their sake whatever may be required.</b> <p></p></p>

<p>Also, I would like to enjoin on all of you to
safeguard and observe the Fiqh sunnati
(<a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs4.htm#ank41">Traditional
fiqh</a>) ...(41) or religious canons for these set
forth the schools of prophetic mission and Imamate and guarantee the growth and
development of the nations through their <a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs4.htm#ank42">primary
and secondary decrees</a> ...(42)' both of which are schools of Islamic
jurisprudence. <p></p></p>

<p>My advice is that you do not deviate an iota from the teachings of both schools of
Islamic fiqh and not listen to the whisperings of the
slinking (Satan) who are the enemies of religion and truth. Be sure that even a
minor step toward deviation may be a prelude to the fall of the religion, of
the tenets of Islam and of the divine rule of justice. Do not ever miss <a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs4.htm#ank43">the
Friday mass prayers</a> ...(43) and <a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs4.htm#ank44">the
daily congregational</a> ...(44) prayers (Salaat-al-Jumah
and Salaat-al-Jamaat.). The Friday Congregational
Prayer is one of the greatest divine blessings for the Islamic Republic of Iran, it reflects the political dimension of prayers. Also,
never neglect<a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs4.htm#ank45"> the
mourning ceremonies</a> ...(45) commemorating the martyrdom of the Innocent
Imams particularly that of the <b>Master of
All Martyrs his Holiness Abi Abdullah Hussein</b>
(AS), may God, His Angels, the prophets and saints bless his great, valiant
soul! </p>

<p>Let all know that the decrees of the Imams
(AS) regarding the <b>observance of this
great epic event</b> of Islam and all the curses levied against the enemies of<a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs4.htm#ank46"> Ahl-e Bayt (the Household of the
Prophet</a> ...(46) are, in fact, the heroic cries of nations against agents of
tyranny throughout history. You should know that the damnation and curses
against the then injustices of<a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs4.htm#ank47"> the Bani Omayyads</a> ...(47), who
were annihilated and cast into the Hell, reflect the cries of protest by the
people against the oppressors of the world and it is the perpetuation of such
cries of protest that shatters oppression. It is necessary that the crimes of
the tyrants in each age and era be regularly condemned in the cries of
lamentation and in the recitals of elegies held for the Infallible Imams. </p>

<p><b>In
this age of oppression of Muslim nations is the work of the USA and the U.S.S.R and their local lackeys such
as the Alay Saud (Family of Saud and rulers
of Hijaz), these traitors to the House of God, the
Great Divine Sanctuary, who deserve the most potent damnation by Allah, His
Angels (Mala-eka) and Prophets (SAW). We must all
know that it is these political ceremonies (Friday Mass, the Hajj Pilgrimage,
the Salaat ul Jama'at,etc) that give Muslims,

<h2>DEFINITIONS OF THE TERMS AND CONCEPTS EMBODIED IN THE WILL<p></p></h2>

 

<p></p>

<p>The Thaqalain Tradition is one of the best known
traditions quoted by many, including an amazing number of authoritative Sunni
sources, as coming directly from the person of the Prophet (SAW). Several
important points can be deduced from this and similar traditions: <p></p></p>

<p>a) As the holy Quran shall remain with the people
until the Last Day, in like manner, the Prophet's Household will remain to the
Last Day, <b>This means that the world will
never be without an Imam and true leader. <br>
</b>b) By means of these two great trusts the Prophet (SAW) has secured all the
scientific and religious needs of the Muslims and has designated his household
as reference sources of knowledge and insight. <br>
c) No muslin has the right to disown their (the Household's) guidance and
leadership. <br>
d) The entire body of knowledge and religious requirements and needs of the
people are vested in the Prophet's Household. <br>
e<b>) If people obey the Prophet's
Household and adhere to their words they shall not go astray.</b> <p></p></p>

 

<p></p>

<p>The term 'Thaqalain" means
two 'Thegls'. In the explanatory accounts of
the traditions and narratives as well as in the interpretations of the holy Quran, the term 'Theql' is used
indicating various meanings and concepts such as 'weighty heritage", a
'great thing", "weighty object', 'precious thing",
"invaluable trust', etc. However, in the Thaqalain
Hadith, by the two trusts <b>is meant the Quran and the holy Prophet's
Household. <p></p></b></p>

<p><a name="ank3)"><b>3)
</b></a><b>Molk</b><b>:<p></p></b></p>

<p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The understanding and recognition of the worlds of being is
an important argument in philosophy. Philosophy proves the existence of a
number of worlds of which the one that is observable to the eyes and is felt by
other senses is the world of nature or 'Molk". <p></p></p>

 

<p></p>

<p>Philosophers and thinkers have reasoned the necessity of the existence of a
world standing as a dividing fine between the world of nature (Molk) and the world of divinity (God). This world which is
separate from matter and conditions of time and place is absolutely called the
world of divinity (Alam-e-Malakoot). The philosophers
and the 'Orefa" or Gnostic, whose arguments are
confirmed explicitly by specific Islamic texts, maintain
two stages for the world of divinity (Malakoot):
'High' and 'Low". The higher stage is termed (Malakoot-e
Aala) or the superior Malakoot
and is a world regarded as the birthplace of human intellect. The lower stage
is named the "lesser Malakoot" and is known
to be the world of illusion and fancy (Alam-e-Methal
or kheyal). <p></p></p>

 

<p></p>

<p>Lahoot implies the sacred essence of God which can
not be understood through the senses but can be proved through logical
reasoning and intellectual argument. As the Divine Essence comprises the entire
attributes and qualities of perfection, it is therefore considered the most
perfect world. <p></p></p>

 

<p>It can be deduced from the wording of the Thaqalain
Tradition and from the accounts given by the ex-pounders
of ahadith and interpreters of traditions that the
Greater Theql (Theql-e-Akbar)
is the Holy Quran. <p></p></p>

 

<p></p>

<p>According to the sources concerned with the concepts of the Thaqalain, the Great Theql (Theql-e-Kabir) denotes the progeny or household of God's
messenger (SAW), that is, the <b>Infallible
Imams. <p></p></b></p>

 

<p></p>

<p>The term "Taghootian" means followers of
Taghoot. It has been used in the Quran
on eight occasions. Taghoot was also the name of an
idol of the Quraish Tribe in pre-Islamic days. <b>This name has been used to mean Satan</b>.
Most exegetes consider the word Taghoot applicable to
any idol, object or individual, that may prevent one
from doing good, and drag him into perversion and perdition. "Taghoot" has also been described as a rebel against
all goodness and the sublime values. <p></p></p>

 

<p></p>

<p>'Howz' means a pool, pond, water basin or ditch
dug in the ground to store water in. In Islamic literature the term 'Howz' usually precedes the word 'Kothar'
thus meaning the Kowthar Pond, a stream located,
according to narratives, in Paradise or in
here after (Mahshar). In this context, however, Imam
Khomeini (P.U.H) has interpreted the 'Howz' as an
eternal reality implying a point at which unity is arrived at by the merger of
pluralities. Just as several creeks or streams emptying into the same pool
merge together and become one, at the Resurrection time the Holy Quran and the Household of the Prophet (SAW) converge on
one other and form one entity. <p></p></p>

 

<p></p>

<p>In philosophy "plurality" connotes the hierarchy of beings and the
variance of the phenomena of being, whether material or non-material And, 'unity" conforms to the penultimate essence of
Divine Being which is the source and fountainhead of all beings in the
universe. In view of this definition, the station of convergence or union of
plurality with unity or oneness, a stage or station which is eternal and is
above plurality and below unity and is the medium by which, at the beginning of
creation, plurality has emerged from unity and, at the end of the world all
join up to form the ultimate oneness. <p></p></p>

 

<p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The word "Hadith"
literally means new, recently occurred, fresh. It also
means news, speech, etc. In Islamic religious teachings it means words and
sayings as definitely coming from the persons of the Prophet (SAW) and or the
Infallible Imams (A.S). <p></p></p>

 

<p></p>

<p>The issue of the rightful succession of the prophet and the leadership of
the Islamic Ummat (nation) after his death caused
Muslims to branch off in two groups: The followers of Ali (A.S) and the
Infallible Imams who considered the caliphate the exclusive right of Imam Ali
(A.S) and his progeny and the group that did not believe so. The first group are named the Shia and the
other group is termed the Sunni. The Sunni group is divided into four creeds:
The Hanafi; the Shafeii;
the Maleki and the Hanbali.
<p></p></p>

 

<p></p>

<p>Sahah-e, plural for sahih,
means right and correct and by Sahah-e-Sitta is meant
the six correct volumes which the Sunni Ulema
(religious learned men) selected from among the many volumes of ahadith (traditions, narratives) and designated them as the
base and source from which to deduce religious laws, tenets, commands,
interpretations and a part of the history of the earlier days of Islam. These
volumes are: <p></p></p>

<p>a) The Sahih-e Bukhari, compiled by
Muhammad ibn Ismail Bukhari, born 196, a.h (812 ad.);
died: 256, a.h (864 ad.). <br>
b) The Sahih-e-Muslim, compiled by Muslim ibn Hajjaj Neishaburi,
better known as Qushiri, 206-262 ah - (821-876 ad) <br>
c) The Sunan-e lbn Majja compiled by Muhammad ibn Yazid ibn Majja,
273 <a name="ank_8"></a>a.h 886 ad. (date of death).</p>

<p>d) The Sunan-e Abi Davude compiled by Abi Davude Sajistani Sulaiman ibn Davude,
dead 273 ah (888 ad.) <br>
e) The Jama-a Tarmadhi,
compiled by Tarmadhi Muharnmad
ibn Esa ibn
Sura, date of death 276 ah (892 ad.) <br>
f) The Sunan-e Nissai
compiled by Ahmad ibn Sho-aib
Nissai (died 303 a.h=915
ad.) <p></p></p>

<h3><a name="ank14">14) </a><p class="SpellE"><p>Hazrat</p></p><span><p>Ali (A.S):</p><p></p></span></h3>

<p></p>

<p>Ali (A.S), <b>the first Imam</b> of
Shiite Muslims, was born 600 ad. to
Fatemeh and Abutaleb
(latter is the paternal uncle of the Prophet (S-A.W). Ali (A.S) grew up in the
house of the Prophet since the age of 6. He was the first male person to accept
Islam and pledge himself to assist the Prophet (S.A.W). Early in his prophetic
mission when, by command of Allah, the Prophet (S.A.W) called his own kin to
Islam, he announced at a gathering of them: "<b>The</b><b> first among you to believe and accept my faith shall succeed me!'</b>
He repeated this sentence three times and each time Ali was the only person who
professed his faith. On the <b>night of
migration</b> or Hijrat (of the Prophet from Mecca to Medina),
Ali betook himself into the Prophet's bed and slept there (the Quraish had plotted to terrorise
the Prophet that night) and thus demonstrated his fidelity to him. The Prophet
(S.A.W) adopted Ali as his own brother and, on return from his last Hajj
pilgrimage, at a place called Ghadir, the Prophet
(S-A.W) publicly declared Ali (A.S) as the guardian of the Muslims and
Administrator of their affairs. Ali (A.S) was a companion of the Prophet in his
lonely days and his aide in hardships and dangers. For a period of 25 years
immediately after the Prophet's demise, Ali (A.S) remained aside, for some
reasons, of government administration and leadership. During this entire period
Ali (A.S) had assumed the status of an observer whose presence averted
deviation and perversion. After the third Caliph was killed, the Sehaba or companions and a number of other people swore
allegiance to Ali (A.S) and selected him as their Caliph. Imam Ali (A.S)
administered the affairs of the Islamic world for nearly four years and nine
months. He restored the changes that had occurred after the Prophet (S-A.W) to
their pristine state. Opposition agents, whose interests were threatened, rose
on every side and, pretending to avenge the blood of the 3rd Caliph, set off
internal bloody wars that lasted during the entire period of Ali (A.S)'s rule,
until, finally, they martyred this unique man of history after the Prophet, by
the altar where he was saying prayers. It is extremely difficult to talk of Ali
(A.S)'s personality in a worthy manner. He had dedicated his entire life to
God's religion and was not remiss in this for the slightest moment. In his
modest home children such as Hassan and Hossein (A.S) and Zainab (A.S)
were reared, persons who left deep imprints on the course of history and who,
as leader and mentor of seekers of truth carried, on their backs, the shining
torch of humanism through the darkness of times. <p></p></p>

<p><a name="ank15"><b>15)
</b></a><b>Kashf</b><b>-e Tomm-e Muhammadi:<p></p></b></p>

<p></p>

<p>Kashf-e tomm-e muhammadi means revelation, of the entire Quranic truths to Hazrat Muhammad
(S.A.W). Thus, the kashf-e tomm-e
is a descending stage of the holy Book during which the Quran
has been revealed to the heart of the Prophet. This station of revelation of Quranic truths is not by rational or intellectual
reasoning, it is by insight and intuition; it is oracular not visual
observation. <b>For this reason the truths
of the Quran are comprehensible only to the Prophet
and perfect revelation and absolute perception belong to him exclusively.</b> <p></p></p>

<p><a name="ank16"><b>16)
</b></a><b>Validah</b><b>-e Eimul-Asmae:<p></p></b></p>

<p></p>

<p>Validah means offspring or issue and Eimul Asmae is a kind of
knowledge and gnosis that is only within man's ability to learn. With this
definition, the Validah Elmul-asmae
is a child of Elmul-asmae, by which is meant human.
Almighty God has conferred the Elmul-asmae on man so
that this creature may acquire worthiness for being Caliph on earth. Man would
not have achieved this worth had not God taught him such knowledge. <p></p></p>

<p><a name="ank17"><b>17)
The </b></a><b>Ma`soomin</b><b>:<p></p></b></p>

<p></p>

<p>Ma`soomin is the plural of Maasoom
which means <b>one of whom sin has been
withheld and, has not committed a sin all his life. Ismat
or infallibility is regarded as an exclusive characteristic of the prophets in
the religious teachings. It means immunity to error and sin and this imparts
the utmost reliability to Those who are infallible</b>.
By Ma`soomin mentioned (in the Imam's win) is meant
the Prophet (S.A.W) and his Household. <p></p></p>

<p><a name="ank18"><b>18)
Muhammad Reza Khan </b></a><b>Pahlavi</b><b>:<p></p></b></p>

<p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Muhammad Reza Pahlavi, the last
monarch of the Pahlavi Dynasty, was born in October
1919. His father, Reza Khan, declared him his crown prince on his becoming king
after the coup d'etat. After completion of elementary
schooling Muhammad Reza was sent for further education to Switzerland and
upon return from that country he was enrolled in a military high school. In
1941, the Allies dethroned his father and sent him into exile and conceded to
Muhammad Reza's succeeding his father. The reign of Muhammad Reza as Shah can
be divided into two general parts. The first part lasted from 1941 to 1955. He
could not muster the power of his father in this period. The second period
(1955-78) or 23 years ended in his fall. It accounts for Muhammad Reza's
absolute rule as a despotic autocrat in Iran. The text of Imam Khomeini's
last will includes references to the manner of Muhammad Reza's 37 years rule. <p></p></p>

<p><a name="ank19"><b>19)
King </b></a><b>Fahad</b><b>:<p></p></b></p>

<p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">King Fahad is <b>the king of Saudi
  Arabia</b>. To get an idea of the extent of
AI-e-Saud's dependence on major powers especially on
the world-mongering America; the role of this family in the spread of the false
and pervert creed of Wahhabism; their ancient,
historic animosity towards the Shia of Ali (A.S);
their hypocritical approach towards the struggle of the fighting people of
Palestine; their massacre of the pilgrims of Iran and other countries in the
House of God; their intrusion on the Divine sanctuaries; suppression of the
Arab fighters and Mujahedeen (strugglers), within and
out of Saudi Arabian peninsula; squandering the wealth of the Muslims..... and other atrocities of this family, please refer to the
literature's available on the subject. <p></p></p>

<p><a name="ank20"><b>20)
</b></a><b>Wahhabism</b><b>:<p></p></b></p>

<p></p>

<p>The doctrine and creed of Wahhabism was formulated
by Muhammad ibn Abdul-Wahhab
Najdi (toward the end of 12th and early days of 13th
century, ah.1 and is ascribed to British colonialism. The adherents to Wahhabism are of the opinion that all Islamic
denominations, including the Sunnis and Shia groups,
are idle worshipers. They regard the showing of respect and reverence toward to
shrine of the Prophet (S.A.W) and Infallible Imams a kind of heresy and
paganism. Supported by Muslim wealth, the Wahhabis
are active in cultural propaganda and they are instruments for implementation
of the destructive plans of the super powers. <p></p></p>

<p><a name="ank21"><b>21)
The </b></a><b>Nahjul-Balagha</b><b>:<p></p></b></p>

<p></p>

<p>'Nahjul-Balagha" means the clear path to
eloquence. It is a compendium of selected words and maxims of Hazrat Amirul-Mo`menin (Master of
the believers) Ali (A.S) compiled by Sharif Razi Muhammad ibn AI-Hossein (died 406 ah=1016 ad.). Grand authorities of the
Religion have named the 'Nahjul-Balagha" the
"brother' of the Quran. The contents of this
book revolve around the three essential subjects of God, the universe and man,
and comprise scientific, literary, religious, social, ethical and political
topics. Next to the words of the holy Quran and
statements by the Prophet (S.A.W) no words, regardless of the source and
author, can equate those of the Nahjul-Balagha in
significance and eloquence. So far more than 101 exegeses and commentaries have
been written about the Nahjul-Balagha, indicating the
importance of this book to the authorities in science, research and study. <p></p></p>

<p><a name="ank22"><b>22)

<p><a name="ank23"><b>23)
</b></a><b>Hazrat</b><b> Mahdi (A.S):<p></p></b></p>

<p></p>

<p>The term of Imamate of the 12th Shiite imam, Hazrat
Hojjat ibn Hasan Askari (A.S) began when he
was only 6 years old. Because of the conditions prevailing at the time and by
God's will, <b>His Holiness went into
occultation.</b> The period of the Mahdi (A.S)'s occultation is divided in two
parts: the lesser or minor occultation (ghaybat-e-sughra)
which lasted 69 years. <b>During this
period his holiness was indirectly in communion with the people through the
medium of four representatives. Then began the grand or major occultation (ghaybat-e-cobra) which has continued to this date and will
be effective until his advent and the triumph of Truth over falsehood</b>.
Islamic thought holds to the view that the extensive challenges of Hazrat Mahdi (A.S) and his impending advent will be the
last link in the chain of the challenges and fights of the ahl-e-haq
or supporters of Truth against the ahl-e-batel or
adherents to falsehood. This means that the struggles of the followers of Truth
will continue throughout history and grounds for the victory of Truth becomes
better prepared with each passing day and <b>culminate
in the advent and rise of the promised Mahdi </b>(A.S) with the eventual dawn
of the light of Truth and Justice in man's horizons, marking his intellectual,
moral and social maturity. <p></p></p>

<p><a name="ank24"><b>24)
The Ascending </b></a><b>Quran</b><b> (Quran-e-sa-ed):<p></p></b></p>

<p></p>

<p>The word 'sa-ed' means rising,
ascending, climbing, etc. As an expression the term is in contrast with
words 'Quran-c-nazil' which means descending or
coming down. It is used to define the prayers and supplications of the Imams
and the Inflammables (A.S). <p></p></p>

<p><a name="ank25"><b>25)
The </b></a><b>Shabaniah</b><b> prayer:<p></p></b></p>

<p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">This invocative litany, because of richness of contents and
import, has been frequently performed during the month of Shaban
by Hazrat Ali (A.S), his children and by all other
Infallible Imams. Of the importance of this prayer, the saying of which was
often emphasised by Imam Khomeini (PUH) in the course
of his blessed life, it will suffice to say that no other prayer of invocation
is said to have been recited by all of the Infallible Imams (A.S). <p></p></p>

<p><a name="ank26"><b>26)
The Arafat prayer:<p></p></b></a></p>

<p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Arafat is a station for the Hajj pilgrims in the vicinity of
Mecca. The
Prayer of Arafat is ascribed to Hossein ibn Ali (A.S) and was often recited by him and by Imam Sajjad on the 9th day of the month of Zillhejjah
in the desert of Arafat. This prayer is expressive of the
lovely supplications made by the Master of Martyrs (Imam Hossein
(A.S) invoking the mercy of his beloved Lord, the one and only creator of
universe. The Arafat Prayer, as other prayers said by the Infallible Imams
(A.S), contains deep and lofty concepts. <p></p></p>

<p><a name="ank27"><b>27)
</b></a><b>lmam</b><b> Hossein (A.S):<p></p></b></p>

<p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Hossein (A.S) was the hero of Ashura (the 10th day of Muharran
when Imam Hossein (A.S) was martyred), the greatest
epic event in man's history. He was born to Ali (A.S), the man of Justice and
chastity and Her Holiness <b>Fatima</b><b> </b>(A.S),
the symbol of a Muslim woman, in the 4th year ah. and
was raised and reared under the care and supervision of a father such as Ali
(A.S), a grandfather such as Muhammad (S.A.W) and a mother like Fatima (A.S).
After the martyrdom of Imam Hasan (A.S) in 50 ah.,
caliph Mua`viah increased his pressure and ordered
all his governors to delete the names of the Shiite Muslims (followers of Ali
(A.S) from the rosters of the Muslim treasury and to apprehend and put to death
any one accused of sympathy for Ali (A.S). Yazid
succeeded his father Mua`viah as caliph and followed
the path of his sire. He ordered that lmam Hossein swear allegiance to him and be slain should he
refuse. <p></p></p>

<p>Imam Hossein did not yield to Yazid,
this prototype of meanness and villainy. He resorted to the sword and undertook
the fundamental Ashura move that he might thus kindle
a light (of hope) amid the darkness (of oppression) and to initiate history's
eternal epic event. By sacrificing his ale including the
lives of himself, his kin and supporters in the path of God; Imam Hossein (A.S).became a model and example for all those who
tread in the path of Truth. Many books have been written about the
personality of Imam Hossein (A.S) and a great deal
has been talked about him. Friend and foe testify to Imam Hossein's
matchless courage, bravery, patience, forbearance, his challenge of cruelty and
injustice, his courtesy and humility, his kindness and his compassion. <p></p></p>

<p><b>28)
The Sahifah Sajjadiah: <p></p></b></p>

<p>In view of the dominance of the rule of tyranny in the time of Imam Sajjad (A.S), the fourth leader of the Shiite Muslims of
the world, a collection of his advises, exhortations and counselling
manifests in the form of prayers this collection which contains 54 such entries
is available. It is known as the Sahifah Sajjadiah and is a veritable encyclopaedia
that in the course of history of Shiism has constantly
been a source of inspiration to the learned men and seekers of the Path of God.
This book has had great educational influence. <p></p></p>

<p><a name="ank29"><b>29)
</b></a><b>Zabur</b><b>-e-Al-e Muhammad (The Psalms of the
Household of Muhammad (S.A.W)):<p></p></b></p>

<p></p>

<p>Zabur is the name of a Divine Book that was sent
down to His Holiness Davood (David), one of the great
prophets of God, it contains plenty of tersely cogent and pithy phrases and
sayings of knowledge and wisdom. Because of the importance of subject matter,
richness of contents and the depth of its lofty concepts, the Sahifah Sajjadiah is known to the
initiates by several appellations such as "The Zabur-e
AI-e-Muhammad", 'the Bible of the Ahl-e
Bait"; 'the Sister of Quran', etc. <p></p></p>

<p><a name="ank30"><b>30)
The </b></a><b>Sahifah</b><b> Fatimiyah:<p></p></b></p>

<p></p>

<p>The word 'Sahifah' means letter or book. The term Fatimiyah implies that the realities and topics ascribed to
her Holiness Fatimah (A.S). Thus the Sahifah Fatimiyah is a book
attributed to the noble daughter of the Prophet (S.A.W) and the faithful wife
of Ali (A.S), the first leader of the world Shiites. The book has embodied news
and intimations of future world events. It has been kept in custody by the
Infallible Imams (A.S) and, according to narratives,
it has had a volume three times that of the Holy Quran.

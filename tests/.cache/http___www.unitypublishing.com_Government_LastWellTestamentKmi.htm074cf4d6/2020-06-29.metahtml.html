<p align="center"><span>Last Will and Testament of </span><span lang="EN">Ayatollah Khomeini</span></p>

<p align="center"><span>By
Richard Salbato</span></p>

<p align="center"><span>August
21, 2006</span></p>

<p><span>Know your
enemy!</span><span> This is the
reason I am publishing the last will and testament of the 20th Century
leader of Islam. In Islamic schools
children from the age of 4 or 5 are being taught to give their lives for Allah,
not just like Christian martyrs defending themselves, but to kill anyone who
does not believe like them. Kill even those who would like to live in peace with them.</span></p>

<p><span>Khomeini, the religious leader (Pope) of the Islamic world, insists
that everyone take the bible of <span class="SpellE">Muhammed</span> literally
and the Tradition, the <span class="SpellE">Theqalain</span>, as law. In the <span class="SpellE">Theqalain</span>
you will learn that you are the </span><span class="SpellE"><span>Taghoot</span></span><span>,
and as such should be killed. His dream
and goal was to unite Shiite and Sunni but without compromising his views. In
his last will and testament he tries to convince all to this unity.</span></p>

<p><span>He claims that now is the time for the 12th
Imam, Mahdi, and with Mahdi's rule a just war will destroy all heretics and nations
that do not follow Allah. In order to
bring out the 12th Imam,
 Iran and all
those nations with them must start a
world war against all enemies of Allah.<p>&#160; They must start or cause 
World War III.</p></span></p>

<p><span>He makes it clear that the enemies of Allah
are the nations and leaders of The United States of America, Israel, Russia,
Iraqi, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt and international
Zionism. Know for sure&#160; by his own words that
if there is a war, Iran
will attempt to kill the kings of Saudi Arabia
and Jordan and the leaders
of Egypt
and Iraqi. </span></p>

<p><span>I am convinced that there is already a World
War III and Iran
is the enemy. We, in America, will
have more 9-11s, maybe even atomic, and America-Israel will go to war on
Iranian soil.</span></p>
<p><span>On a personal level I do
not worry about this because America
will easily win this war and can take a few terrorist strikes without even
harming the economy. However --------------------????</span></p>

<p><span>There is one thing that will happen and it
will not only affect me and my family directly but it will affect everyone on
the face of the earth and there is nothing we can do about it. Iran will (they have even said that
they will) bomb and stop the oil flow through the Straights of Hormuz. </span></p>

<p><span>The oil from Iran,
Saudi Arabia, Iraqi, Kuwait, and even pipe lines from Russia pass
through the Straights of Hormuz. The Straights
are surrounded by Iranian land, Iranian ships, submarines, mines and
missals. There is no way we can stop Iran from
closing the Straights. And if they do,
you and I will be directly affected within a few weeks or days. Half
the imported oil of the world goes through the Straights of Hormuz. Iran will not fire missals at Israel but they will fire missals at the oil
fields of Saudi Arabia,
Iraqi and Kuwait.</span></p>

<p><span>Because Iran wants a world war they will sacrifice
even their own profits from the oil to bring about victory. It will be a suicide of a nation, but it will
work because it will bankrupt the entire world.</span></p>

<p><span>Although America
gets no oil from Iran, the
world wide oil is on the open market, and since America uses 35% of the world
supply, the oil will stop within a week. When supplies of gas stop everything stops. Everything happens because of the energy of
gas. We get food because of gas, we get
water because of gas, and we get medical treatment because of gas. Almost all this gas comes from Moslem or
Anti-American countries. But because we
never attempted to get off this addiction it is now too late to stop what will
happen.</span></p>

<p><span>I am so convinced of this that my family, four
different houses, is preparing for a food, water, gas and medical
shortage. We are building a hot house
for vegetables, a food storage building, a water tank and a fuel storage tank.</span></p>

<p><span>Although the American military will prevail
over any and all Islamic attacks, it will take at least a year to overcome the gas
shortage that will be caused by Iran. I predict that this will cause civil unrest
in Europe, South America and Asia. If coordinated with Islamic riots like in Paris and more 9-11s it
could get worse. </span></p>

<p><span>Since I know that closing of the Straights of
Hormuz, along with bombing of the oil fields of the major oil producing
countries, and at the same time riots and 9-11s is the only way to harm the
west, do you think they do not know this also?</span></p>

Salbato </span><span>August 22, 2006&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
</span></p>



<p><span>The
following is the will and testament of our enemy. At
least read the bold highlights:</span></p>

 



<p align="center"><span>In
The Name of God <span class="GramE">The</span> Compassionate, the Merciful</span></p>

<p><span>The Messenger of God has said, "Verily I
am leaving with you the two most valuable and weighty objects: the Book of God
and my household (the <span class="SpellE">Thaqalain</span>). Indeed these two
shall not part with each other until they join up with me by the pond" (of
<span class="SpellE">Kowthar</span> in Paradise
on the Day of Judgment). </span></p>

<p><span>(The Prophetic Tradition of <a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs0.htm#ank1"><span class="SpellE">Thaqalain</span></a>) </span></p>

<p><span>To Allah belongs all praise. Glorified is Thy
Name, O God, bless <span class="SpellE">Muhammed</span> and his household who are
manifestations of Your Beauty and Magnanimity and the secret treasures of Your
Book, the Book that <span class="SpellE">crystallises</span> Your Oneness in all
Your Names and Divine Attributes, including the one that none but Yourself
knows. And let there be curse on those who oppressed the Prophet (SAW) and his
household, those that belonged to the wretched pedigree. </span></p>

<p><span>At the outset to this prologue, it appears
proper to briefly comment on the two most exalted and momentous objects of
trust (<a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs0.htm#ank2">The <span class="SpellE">Thaqalain</span></a>) , not on their transcendental, spiritual, or
mystical aspects, an area into which pens such as mine are unable to venture as
it is a domain of <a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs0.htm#ank3"><span class="SpellE">molk</span></a>, the cognition of which covers all circles of
beings, from earth to heaven (<a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs0.htm#ank4"><span class="SpellE">Malakoot-e-Aala</span></a>) ... (4) and beyond to His Divine
presence (<a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs0.htm#ank5"><span class="SpellE">Lahoot</span></a>) ...(5) including circles that lie beyond the
comprehension of our intellects. Nor do I mean to comment on that which has
befallen humanity due to its negligence of the true nature and status of the
greater trust (<a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs0.htm#ank6"><span class="SpellE">theql-e-akbar</span></a> ...(6) = The Holy <span class="SpellE">Quran</span>)
and that of the great trust (<a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs0.htm#ank7"><span class="SpellE">theql-e-kabir</span></a> = The Household of the Prophet (SAW)),
which is greater than anything except the great trust which is great in the
absolute (<span class="SpellE">akbar-e-mutlaq</span>). Also I do not intend to
recount here all that has befallen these two most valuable divine trusts (The <span class="SpellE">Thaqalain</span>) by the enemies of God and the treacherous
followers of the tyrants = (<a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs0.htm#ank8"><span class="SpellE">Taghootian</span></a>) as these are too many for me to enumerate,
given my limited knowledge and time. </span></p>

<p><span>I thought that I might make a passing remark
about what has happened to these two most valuable treasures. Perhaps the
phrase, "... which will never part with each other until they join me by
the pond (<a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs0.htm#ank9"><span class="SpellE">Howz</span></a>) ...(9) ...implies that after the death of the
Prophet (SAW), the Book of God and the household of the Prophet (SAW) shall
receive similar treatment. Whatever is made of one, the other suffers the same
until both descend on the Prophet (SAW) and unite with him by the Pond. Does
this union, this pond, indicate <a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs0.htm#ank10">the
merging of plurality with unity </a><span class="GramE">...(</span>10) as the
disappearance of drops in the sea? Or, does it mean something beyond the gamut
of human intellect and cognition? Moreover the cruelty to which these two
divine trusts, nay the entire humanity including the Islamic <span class="SpellE">ummah</span> (nation), were subjected by the followers of the
tyrants and their stooges defy description by pen. </span></p>

<p><span>It should be mentioned that the <span class="SpellE">Thaqalain</span> <a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs1.htm#ank11"><span class="SpellE">Hadith</span></a> ...(11) which is a <span class="SpellE">mutawatir</span>
(an unbroken chain of recorded traditions) Tradition has been quoted, cited and
adduced successively by Muslim <span class="SpellE">ulema</span> (<span class="SpellE">foqaha</span>, learned religious authorities or jurists), in both <span class="SpellE">Shia</span> and <a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs1.htm#ank12">Sunni </a>...(12)
denominations as proof positive for all mankind, especially for Muslims in all sects
and branches. References to this Prophetic tradition are frequently made in
such highly reliable Sunni sources like the famous 'Six Authentic Texts" (<a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs1.htm#ank13">The <span class="SpellE">Sahah-e-Sitta</span></a>) <span class="GramE">...(</span>13) as well
as in countless Shiite cogent texts. This <span class="SpellE">hujjat</span> or
proof is binding on all Muslims who are accountable for it especially the <span class="SpellE">foqaha</span> (Muslim religious jurists) as they cannot claim
ignorance of it. Let us now see what befell this book of God, this Divine Trust
and the bequest of the prophet of Islam. The sad events for which tears may
well be shed, began to take place following the martyrdom of <a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs1.htm#ank14"><span class="SpellE">Hazrat</span> Ali (AS)</a> <span class="GramE">...(</span>14).
Selfish people, followers of <span class="SpellE">taghoots</span> (despotic,
pagan rulers) abused the Holy <span class="SpellE">Quran</span> as a mean by
which to establish anti-<span class="SpellE">Quranic</span> rules. </span></p>

<p><span>To achieve this they forced off the scenes
the true interpreters of the <span class="SpellE">Quran</span> and others who had
received all of the Holy Book directly from the Prophet (SAW) and whose ears
still echoed with the voice of His Holiness Muhammad (SAW) as he had said,
"... I am leaving with you the two most valuable objects...' Thus, the <span class="SpellE">Quran</span>, which was to be man's guide to moral and material
life to the Last Day, was shelved and the rule of divine justice that was, and
still is, one of the ideals of the holy Book, was all forgotten. </span></p>

<p><span>Perversion of the Book, of Divine Traditions
and of God's religion reached a shameful stage, it became the rule. The more
this warped and distorted condition advanced, the more the Holy <span class="SpellE">Quran</span> that had been sent down for the betterment of <span class="GramE">man,</span> was forced into oblivion. The <span class="SpellE">Quran</span>
was sent down by the Omniscient God to <span class="SpellE">Hazrat</span>
Muhammad (SAW) to complete and seal such divine revelations (<a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs1.htm#ank15"><span class="SpellE">Kashf</span> -e <span class="SpellE">Tomm</span>-e <span class="SpellE">Muhammadi</span></a>) ...(15), to unite humanity and advance him to his rightful station; to
rescue this issue of the divine attributes (<a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs1.htm#ank16"><span class="SpellE">Validah</span>-e <span class="SpellE">Eimul-Asmae</span></a>)
...(16) from tyranny and evil; to institute the rule of justice and equity and
to confer sovereignty to the Infallible and divine authorities (<a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs1.htm#ank17">The <span class="SpellE">Masoomeen</span></a>) ...(17) that they in turn hand over such
divine sovereignty to qualified worthy persons, was removed from all areas as
though it had had no mission to guide mankind. </span></p>

<p><span>In the hands of oppressive rulers and wicked <span class="SpellE">akhunds</span> (<span class="SpellE">muslim</span> clergymen,
sometimes used in a derogatory manner), who were more decadent than the <span class="SpellE">taghooti</span> (despotic) rulers the Holy <span class="SpellE">Quran</span>
was abused as an instrument of oppression, cruelty and corruption and was
distorted to justify acts of tyranny by the enemies of God. </span></p>

<p><span>Unfortunately, in the hands of conniving
enemies and ignorant friends, the Holy <span class="SpellE">Quran</span>, this
divine book that is empowered to decide man's destiny, has found no place anywhere
except in graveyards and at the gatherings for the dead. The instrument, that was to unite Muslims and all mankind and serve as
scripture for their lives and salvation, was turned into an instrument of
division and dispute among men or left the arena entirely. We all witnessed
that whoever spoke of Islamic rule or of politics, which is the major role of
Islam and its Prophet (SAW), or of the <span class="SpellE">Quran</span> and
Islamic traditions, was regarded as one who had committed grave sins. The term <span class="SpellE">akhund-a-siasi</span>, which means a political clergyman, came to
denote a profane canonist. These circumstances are still extant. </span></p>

<p><span>In recent years major satanic powers have, through their puppet regimes <span class="GramE">who</span> sham Islam, undertaken to reprint and publish the Holy <span class="SpellE">Quran</span>, distorting sacred
verses to serve their devilish ends. Such <span class="SpellE">Qurans</span>
are published with attractive calligraphy and binding and are distributed
everywhere with the aim of eventually removing the Holy Book from all scenes.
We all saw the <span class="SpellE">Quran</span> that <a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs1.htm#ank18">Muhammad
Reza Khan <span class="SpellE">Pahlavi</span></a> <span class="GramE">...(</span>18)
had printed. He succeeded in deceiving some people including a few Muslim <span class="SpellE">akhunds</span> or preachers who, unaware of the aims of Islam,
praised him for it. </span></p>

<p><span>We
note that each year <a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs1.htm#ank19">King <span class="SpellE">Fahd</span></a> ...(19) of Saudi Arabia spends a good deal of the
wealth of the people in printing the Holy <span class="SpellE">Quran</span> and
considerable publicity and propaganda material in support of anti-<span class="SpellE">Quranic</span> ideas propagating the baseless and superstitious
cult of <a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs1.htm#ank20"><span class="SpellE">Wahhabism</span></a> ...(20). <span class="SpellE">Fahd</span>
abuses the <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Quran</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span> urges negligent people and nations to side with the
superpowers. He uses the noble Islam and the Holy Book to destroy both. </span></p>

<p><span>We are proud, and our dedicated nation is
proud, that we adhere to a faith in which the Holy <span class="SpellE">Quran</span>
speaks of the unity of all Muslims and the oneness of mankind. We are proud
that our faith has retrieved the <span class="SpellE">Quran</span> from the
cemeteries and has saved this Holy Book as man's prescription for freedom from
all physical, mental and intellectual bonds that push him deeper into slavery
and nothingness. We are proud to be followers of a religion whose founder has
been designated by divine commandment and in which Ali <span class="SpellE">ibn</span>
<span class="SpellE">Abi</span> <span class="SpellE">Taleb</span> (AS), this
servant of God, free of all bonds and shackles of servitude and serfdom, has
been appointed to deliver mankind from all the chains of slavery and <span class="SpellE">thraldom</span>. We are honored that the book <a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs2.htm#ank21"><span class="SpellE">Nahjul-Balagha</span></a> ...(21), which is next to the <span class="SpellE">Quran</span>, is man's great manuscript for salvation, moral and
material existence and the greatest instrument for just rule and government,
has our Infallible Imam, Ali (AS) as its author. </span></p>

<p><span>We are proud to have had as our leaders <a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs2.htm#ank22">the
Infallible Imams</a> <span class="GramE">...(</span>22), from Ali (AS) down to <a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs2.htm#ank23"><span class="SpellE">Hazrat</span> Mahdi (AS)</a> ...(23) who, by the grace of God,
lives in occultation, and watches our doings. </span></p>

<p><span>We are <span class="SpellE">honoured</span> to have
our Infallible Imams as authors of such exalted, superb and life-giving prayers
of supplication (referred to as <a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs2.htm#ank24">The
Ascending <span class="SpellE">Quran</span> (<span class="SpellE">Quran</span>-e-Sa-ed))
</a>...(24), as<a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs2.htm#ank25"> the <span class="SpellE">Shabaniah</span> prayer</a> ...(25), <a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs2.htm#ank26">the
Arafat Prayer</a> ...(26) of<a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs2.htm#ank27"> Imam
Hussein (AS) </a>...(27), <a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs2.htm#ank28">the <span class="SpellE">Sahifah</span> <span class="SpellE">Sajjadiah</span></a> ...(28),
these psalms of <a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs2.htm#ank29">the
Household of Muhammad (SAW) </a>...(29), and <a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs2.htm#ank30">the <span class="SpellE">Sahifah</span> <span class="SpellE">Fatimiah</span></a> ...(30)
revealed by the Lord to <a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs3.htm#ank31">Her
Holiness Fatima Zahra (AS) ..</a>.(31). We are <span class="SpellE">honoured</span>
to have had as<a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs3.htm#ank32"> our
fifth Infallible Imam, <span class="SpellE">Baqer-ul-uloom</span> (AS)</a> <span class="GramE">...(</span>32) (profound knowledge, a title given to the fifth
Imam), this superlative world personality whose true station can be appreciated
by none save Allah, His Prophet (<span class="SpellE">pbuh</span>) and the
Infallible Imams (<span class="SpellE">pbut</span>). </span></p>

<p><span>We are proud to be followers of<a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs3.htm#ank33"> the <span class="SpellE">Jaaferi</span> Faith</a> <span class="GramE">...(</span>33)
(Religion) whose <a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs3.htm#ank34"><span class="SpellE">fiqh</span> </a>...(34) (religious legislation and jurisprudence)
is a boundless ocean. We are proud of all our Infallible Imams (the 12 innocent
ones) and we are committed to follow them. </span></p>

<p><span>We are
<span class="SpellE">honoured</span> that our Infallible Imams (AS) suffered
imprisonment, banishment and finally attained martyrdom in their efforts to
advance Islam; to implement the teachings and commandments of the Holy <span class="SpellE">Quran</span>-of which the establishment of the sovereignty of
justice is but one dimension - and; to overthrow the rule of the oppressors and
of the arrogant. </span></p>

<p><span>Today,
we feel proud that we seek to re-institute the objectives of the Holy <span class="SpellE">Quran</span> and Tradition and that the various layers of our
nation sacrifice their lives, properties and loved ones for this holy cause. </span></p>

<p><span>We are
proud that our women, young and old, regardless of their status, are present
and active, side by side with the men, often more active than men, in all
scenes including cultural, economic and military areas. They strive, sometimes
more effectively than the men, for the propagation of Islamic teachings. </span></p>

<p><span>Women
who are capable of fighting take military training, which is a major
prerequisite for the <span class="SpellE">defence</span> of Islam and the Islamic
state. Our women have extricated themselves from the deprivations imposed on
them by the enemies of Islam and by the inadequate knowledge of friends of
Islamic tenets. They have bravely discarded the superstitions created by
enemies through some ignorant preachers. </span></p>

<p><span>Those
women who are unable to fight in the war fronts serve behind the front-lines
with such <span class="SpellE">ardour</span> and courage that makes the hearts of
their men tremble with delight and it throws fear in the heart of enemies and
makes ignorant individuals who are worse than foes shake with anger and fear.
Often we hear our women, in a manner like that of <a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs3.htm#ank35"><span class="SpellE">Hazrat</span> <span class="SpellE">Zainab</span></a> <span class="GramE">...(</span>35), cry out loud saying that they have given children
in the path of God and Islam and are proud of it. They <span class="SpellE">realise</span>
that what they get in return is far above the blessings of Heaven, let alone
the material things of this world. </span></p>

<p><span>Our nation, indeed all Islamic nations as
well as the meek and oppressed are pleased to see that their enemies, who are
the enemies of Almighty God, of Islam and of the Holy <span class="SpellE">Quran</span>,
are indeed savages who do not desist from committing any criminal acts to
promote their mean purposes and who are unable to tell a friend from a foe in
achieving treacherous goals. </span></p>

<p><span>The USA is the
foremost enemy of Islam.</span><span> It is a terrorist state by nature that has
set fire to everything everywhere and its ally, the international Zionism does
not stop short of any crime to achieve its base and greedy desires, crimes that
the tongue and pen are ashamed to utter or write. The stupid idea of a <a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs3.htm#ank36">Greater
Israel </a><span class="GramE">...(</span>36) urges them to commit any shameful
crime. </span></p>

<p><span>The
Islamic nations and the <span class="SpellE">mustazafeen</span> (the meek, the
oppressed) peoples of the world are pleased to have <a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs3.htm#ank37">Hussein
of Jordan</a> (37) a professional, itinerant criminal, <a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs3.htm#ank38"><span class="SpellE">Hasan</span> of Morocco</a> ...(38) and <a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs3.htm#ank39"><span class="SpellE">Hosni</span> <span class="SpellE">Mubarak</span></a> ...(39) of
Egypt, fellow-mangers of Israel, as enemies. These are fellow-criminals with Israel and commit any act of treason against
their own nations to serve the USA.
We cheer to have <a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs3.htm#ank40">Saddam,
the <span class="SpellE">Aflaqi</span> </a><span class="GramE">...(</span>40) as an
enemy whom friend and foe know to be a criminal, a violator of human rights and
international laws and whose betrayal of the peoples of Iraq and of the Persian
 Gulf Emirates, has been no less than his betrayal of our country
and people. We and the oppressed peoples of the world are delighted to be
objects of criminal accusations by the superpowers through the international
mass media under their control. </span></p>

<p><span>What
can be a better source of pride than the fact that the USA with all its
military might, its boastfulness, its claims, its mass media and its allies
among puppet regimes, has been so dumbfounded and disgraced in its dealings
with the dauntless Iranian nation and the land of His Holiness <span class="SpellE">Baqiyatullah</span> (a title of the 12th infallible imam, <span class="SpellE">Hazrat</span> Mahdi (AS) who is now in occultation) that it does
not know which way to turn and who to turn to?!! </span></p>

<p><span>This
is not the work of anyone or anything except divine assistance that has
awakened nations, particularly the Iranian Muslim nation and has guided it from
darkness into light: The Light of Islam. </span></p>

<p><span>I now
take this opportunity to advise the oppressed and noble nations, including our
own, to stay firmly on this divine straight path that leads neither to the
atheistic (<span class="SpellE">Mulhid</span>) <span class="GramE">East</span> nor
to the oppressive, pagan West, but to the path which the Almighty God has
decreed for us. </span></p>

<p><span>I
further advise not to be negligent even for a single moment in being grateful
for this blessing. Let no polluted hand of a superpower, or its agents, whether
domestic or foreign, affect your determination and will. </span></p>

<p><span>Know
that the rowdier the Eastern or Western satanic power gets, the more proof it
is for your divine support and God shall reward and punish the deserving ones
in the best fashion in this and in the other worlds. "Truly, He is the
Lord of all blessing and in His hand lies the dominion over all things"<span class="GramE">.(</span>The <span class="SpellE">Quran</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sura</span>
23, AI-<span class="SpellE">Muminun</span>, the Believers, verse 88). </span></p>

<p><span>I earnestly ask all Muslim nations to follow
the practices and traditions of the Infallible Imams (AS) in respect of political, social, economic and
military affairs and to sacrifice for their sake whatever may be required. </span></p>

<p><span>Also, I would like to enjoin on all of you to
safeguard and observe the <span class="SpellE">Fiqh</span> <span class="SpellE">sunnati</span>
(<a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs4.htm#ank41">Traditional
<span class="SpellE">fiqh</span></a>) ...(41) or religious canons for these set
forth the schools of prophetic mission and Imamate and guarantee the growth and
development of the nations through their <a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs4.htm#ank42">primary
and secondary decrees</a> ...(42)' both of which are schools of Islamic
jurisprudence. </span></p>

<p><span>My advice is that you do not <span class="GramE">deviate</span> an iota from the teachings of both schools of
Islamic <span class="SpellE">fiqh</span> and not listen to the whisperings of the
slinking (Satan) who are the enemies of religion and truth. Be sure that even a
minor step toward deviation may be a prelude to the fall of the religion, of
the tenets of Islam and of the divine rule of justice. Do not ever miss <a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs4.htm#ank43">the
Friday mass prayers</a> <span class="GramE">...(</span>43) and <a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs4.htm#ank44">the
daily congregational</a> ...(44) prayers (<span class="SpellE">Salaat-al-Jumah</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Salaat-al-Jamaat</span>.). The Friday Congregational
Prayer is one of the greatest divine blessings for the Islamic Republic of <span class="GramE">Iran,</span> it reflects the political dimension of prayers. Also,
never neglect<a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs4.htm#ank45"> the
mourning ceremonies</a> ...(45) commemorating the martyrdom of the Innocent
Imams particularly that of the Master of
All Martyrs his Holiness <span class="SpellE">Abi</span> Abdullah Hussein
(AS), may God, His Angels, the prophets and saints bless his great, valiant
soul! </span></p>

<p><span>Let all know that the decrees of the Imams
(AS) regarding the observance of this
great epic event of Islam and all the curses levied against the enemies of<a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs4.htm#ank46"> <span class="SpellE">Ahl</span>-e <span class="SpellE">Bayt</span> (the Household of the
Prophet</a> ...(46) are, in fact, the heroic cries of nations against agents of
tyranny throughout history. You should know that the damnation and curses
against the then injustices of<a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs4.htm#ank47"> the <span class="SpellE">Bani</span> <span class="SpellE">Omayyads</span></a> ...(47), who
were annihilated and cast into the Hell, reflect the cries of protest by the
people against the oppressors of the world and it is the perpetuation of such
cries of protest that shatters oppression. It is necessary that the crimes of
the tyrants in each age and era be regularly condemned in the cries of
lamentation and in the recitals of elegies held for the Infallible Imams. </span></p>

<p><span>In
this age of oppression of Muslim nations is the work of the USA and the U.S.S.R and their local lackeys such
as the <span class="SpellE">Alay</span> <span class="SpellE">Saud</span> (Family of <span class="SpellE">Saud</span> and rulers
of <span class="SpellE">Hijaz</span>), these traitors to the House of God, the
Great Divine Sanctuary, who deserve the most potent damnation by Allah, His
Angels (<span class="SpellE">Mala-eka</span>) and Prophets (SAW). We must all
know that it is these political ceremonies (Friday Mass, the Hajj Pilgrimage,
the <span class="SpellE">Salaat</span> <span class="SpellE">ul</span> <span class="SpellE">Jama'at<span class="GramE">,etc</span></span>) that give Muslims,
particularly the '<span class="SpellE">ithnai</span> <span class="SpellE">Ashar</span>
(<a href="http://www.irna.com/occasion/ertehal/english/will/defs4.htm#ank48">the
Shiite</a> ...(48) Muslims who accept and follow the 12 Infallible Imams (AS)),
the unity they should enjoy; these also preserve the nationality of all
Muslims. </span></p>

<p><span>Let me
say at this point that this politico-religious testament of mine is not made to
the noble people of Iran
only. Rather, it is recommended for all Islamic nations and the oppressed
peoples of the world regardless of religion or nationality.</span><span> I humbly pray that Almighty God does not leave us and
our nations to <span class="GramE">ourselves</span> even for a moment. May He not
withhold His blessings from the children of Islam and the cherished Muslim <span class="GramE">combatants.</span> </span></p>

<h2>DEFINITIONS OF THE TERMS AND CONCEPTS EMBODIED IN THE WILL</h2>

<h3><a name="ank1">1) The prophetic tradition of </a><span class="SpellE"><span>Thaqalain</span></span><span>:</span></h3>

 

<p>The <span class="SpellE">Thaqalain</span> Tradition is one of the best known
traditions quoted by many, including an amazing number of authoritative Sunni
sources, as coming directly from the person of the Prophet (SAW). Several
important points can be deduced from this and similar traditions: </p>

<p>a) As the holy <span class="SpellE">Quran</span> shall remain with the people
until the Last Day, in like manner, the Prophet's Household will remain to the
Last Day, This means that the world will
never be without an Imam and true leader.  
b) By means of these two great trusts the Prophet (SAW) has secured all the
scientific and religious needs of the Muslims and has designated his household
as reference sources of knowledge and insight.  
c) No muslin has the right to disown their (the Household's) guidance and
leadership.  
d) The entire body of knowledge and religious requirements and needs of the
people are vested in the Prophet's Household.  
e) If people obey the Prophet's
Household and adhere to their words they shall not go astray. </p>

<h3><a name="ank2">2) The </a><span class="SpellE"><span>Thaqalain</span></span><span>:</span></h3>

 

<p><span class="GramE">The term '<span class="SpellE">Thaqalain</span>" means
two '<span class="SpellE">Thegls</span>'.</span> In the explanatory accounts of
the traditions and narratives as well as in the interpretations of the holy <span class="SpellE">Quran</span>, the term '<span class="SpellE">Theql</span>' is used
indicating various meanings and concepts such as 'weighty heritage", a
'great thing", "weighty object', 'precious thing",
"invaluable trust', etc. However, in the <span class="SpellE">Thaqalain</span>
<span class="SpellE">Hadith</span>, by the two trusts is meant the <span class="SpellE">Quran</span> and the holy Prophet's
Household. </p>

<p><a name="ank3)"><span>3)
</span></a><span class="SpellE"><span><span>Molk</span></span></span><span><span>:</span></span></p>

 

<p class="MsoNormal">The understanding and recognition of the worlds of being is
an important argument in philosophy. Philosophy proves the existence of a
number of worlds of which the one that is observable to the eyes and is felt by
other senses is the world of nature or '<span class="SpellE">Molk</span>". </p>

<h3><a name="ank4">4) </a><span class="SpellE"><span>Malakoot-e-Aala</span></span><span>:</span></h3>

 

<p>Philosophers and thinkers have reasoned the necessity of the existence of a
world standing as a dividing fine between the world of nature (<span class="SpellE">Molk</span>) and the world of divinity (God). This world which is
separate from matter and conditions of time and place is absolutely called the
world of divinity (<span class="SpellE">Alam-e-Malakoot</span>). The philosophers
and the '<span class="SpellE">Orefa</span>" or Gnostic, whose arguments are
confirmed explicitly by specific Islamic texts, <span class="GramE">maintain</span>
two stages for the world of divinity (<span class="SpellE">Malakoot</span>):
'High' and 'Low". The higher stage is termed (<span class="SpellE">Malakoot</span>-e
<span class="SpellE">Aala</span>) or the superior <span class="SpellE">Malakoot</span>
and is a world regarded as the birthplace of human intellect. The lower stage
is named the "lesser <span class="SpellE">Malakoot</span>" and is known
to be the world of illusion and fancy (<span class="SpellE">Alam-e-Methal</span>
or <span class="SpellE">kheyal</span>). </p>

<h3><a name="ank5">5) </a><span class="SpellE"><span>Lahoot</span></span><span>:</span></h3>

 

<p><span class="SpellE">Lahoot</span> implies the sacred essence of God which can
not be understood through the senses but can be proved through logical
reasoning and intellectual argument. As the Divine Essence comprises the entire
attributes and qualities of perfection, it is therefore considered the most
perfect world. </p>

<h3><a name="ank6">6) </a><span class="SpellE"><span>Theql-e-Akbar</span></span><span>: </span></h3>

<p>It can be deduced from the wording of the <span class="SpellE">Thaqalain</span>
Tradition and from the accounts given by the ex-<span class="SpellE">pounders</span>
of <span class="SpellE">ahadith</span> and interpreters of traditions that the
Greater <span class="SpellE">Theql</span> (<span class="SpellE">Theql-e-Akbar</span>)
is the Holy <span class="SpellE">Quran</span>. </p>

<h3><a name="ank7">7) </a><span class="SpellE"><span>Theql-e-Kabir</span></span><span>:</span></h3>

 

<p>According to the sources concerned with the concepts of the <span class="SpellE">Thaqalain</span>, the Great <span class="SpellE">Theql</span> (<span class="SpellE">Theql-e-Kabir</span>) denotes the progeny or household of God's
messenger (SAW), that is, the Infallible
Imams. </p>

<h3><a name="ank8">8) The </a><span class="SpellE"><span>Taghootian</span></span><span>: </span></h3>

 

<p>The term "<span class="SpellE">Taghootian</span>" means followers of
<span class="SpellE">Taghoot</span>. It has been used in the <span class="SpellE">Quran</span>
on eight occasions. <span class="SpellE">Taghoot</span> was also the name of an
idol of the <span class="SpellE">Quraish</span> Tribe in pre-Islamic days. This name has been used to mean Satan.
Most exegetes consider the word <span class="SpellE">Taghoot</span> applicable to
any idol, object or <span class="GramE">individual, that</span> may prevent one
from doing good, and drag him into perversion and perdition. "<span class="SpellE">Taghoot</span>" has also been described as a rebel against
all goodness and the sublime values. </p>

<h3><a name="ank9">9) The </a><span class="SpellE"><span>Howz</span></span><span>:</span></h3>

 

<p>'<span class="SpellE">Howz</span>' means a pool, pond, water basin or ditch
dug in the ground to store water in. In Islamic literature the term '<span class="SpellE">Howz</span>' usually precedes the word '<span class="SpellE">Kothar</span>'
thus meaning the <span class="SpellE">Kowthar</span> Pond, a stream located,
according to narratives, in Paradise or in
here after (<span class="SpellE">Mahshar</span>). In this context, however, Imam
Khomeini (P.U.H) has interpreted the '<span class="SpellE">Howz</span>' as an
eternal reality implying a point at which unity is arrived at by the merger of
pluralities. Just as several creeks or streams emptying into the same pool
merge together and become one, at the Resurrection time the Holy <span class="SpellE">Quran</span> and the Household of the Prophet (SAW) converge on
one other and form one entity. </p>

<h3><a name="ank10">10) The merging of plurality with unity:</a></h3>

 

<p>In philosophy "plurality" connotes the hierarchy of beings and the
variance of the phenomena of being, whether material or non-material <span class="GramE">And</span>, 'unity" conforms to the penultimate essence of
Divine Being which is the source and fountainhead of all beings in the
universe. In view of this definition, the station of convergence or union of
plurality with unity or oneness, a stage or station which is eternal and is
above plurality and below unity and is the medium by which, at the beginning of
creation, plurality has emerged from unity and, at the end of the world all
join up to form the ultimate oneness. </p>

<h3><a name="ank11">11) </a><span class="SpellE"><span>Hadith</span></span><span> (Tradition):</span></h3>

 

<p class="MsoNormal">The word "<span class="SpellE">Hadith</span>"
literally means <span class="GramE">new,</span> recently occurred, fresh. It also
means news, speech, etc. In Islamic religious teachings it means words and
sayings as definitely coming from the persons of the Prophet (SAW) and or the
Infallible Imams (A.S). </p>

<h3><a name="ank12">12) The Sunni Muslims:</a></h3>

 

<p>The issue of the rightful succession of the prophet and the leadership of
the Islamic <span class="SpellE">Ummat</span> (nation) after his death caused
Muslims to branch off in two groups: The followers of Ali (A.S) and the
Infallible Imams who considered the caliphate the exclusive right of Imam Ali
(A.S) and his progeny and the group that did not believe so. The first <span class="GramE">group are</span> named the <span class="SpellE">Shia</span> and the
other group is termed the Sunni. The Sunni group is divided into four creeds:
The <span class="SpellE">Hanafi</span>; the <span class="SpellE">Shafeii</span>;
the <span class="SpellE">Maleki</span> and the <span class="SpellE">Hanbali</span>.
</p>

<h3><a name="ank13">13) The </a><span class="SpellE"><span>Sahah-e-Sitta</span></span><span> (The Six
collections):</span></h3>

 

<p><span class="SpellE">Sahah</span>-e, plural for <span class="SpellE">sahih</span>,
means right and correct and by <span class="SpellE">Sahah-e-Sitta</span> is meant
the six correct volumes which the Sunni <span class="SpellE">Ulema</span>
(religious learned men) selected from among the many volumes of <span class="SpellE">ahadith</span> (traditions, narratives) and designated them as the
base and source from which to deduce religious laws, tenets, commands,
interpretations and a part of the history of the earlier days of Islam. These
volumes are: </p>

<p>a) The <span class="SpellE">Sahih</span>-e <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Bukhari</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span> compiled by
Muhammad <span class="SpellE">ibn</span> <span class="SpellE">Ismail</span> <span class="SpellE">Bukhari</span>, born 196, <span class="SpellE">a.h</span> (812 ad.);
died: 256, <span class="SpellE">a.h</span> (864 ad.).  
b) The <span class="SpellE">Sahih</span>-e-Muslim, compiled by Muslim <span class="SpellE">ibn</span> <span class="SpellE">Hajjaj</span> <span class="SpellE">Neishaburi</span>,
better known as <span class="SpellE">Qushiri</span>, 206-262 ah - (821-876 ad)  
c) The <span class="SpellE">Sunan</span>-e <span class="SpellE">lbn</span> <span class="SpellE">Majja</span> compiled by Muhammad <span class="SpellE">ibn</span> <span class="SpellE">Yazid</span> <span class="SpellE">ibn</span> <span class="SpellE">Majja</span>,
273 <span class="SpellE"><span>a.h</span></span><span> 886 ad. (<span class="GramE">date</span> of death).</span></p>

<p>d) The <span class="SpellE">Sunan</span>-e <span class="SpellE">Abi</span> <span class="SpellE">Davude</span> compiled by <span class="SpellE">Abi</span> <span class="SpellE">Davude</span> <span class="SpellE">Sajistani</span> <span class="SpellE">Sulaiman</span> <span class="SpellE">ibn</span> <span class="SpellE">Davude</span>,
dead 273 ah (888 ad.)  
e) The <span class="SpellE">Jama</span>-a <span class="SpellE">Tarmadhi</span>,
compiled by <span class="SpellE">Tarmadhi</span> <span class="SpellE">Muharnmad</span>
<span class="SpellE">ibn</span> <span class="SpellE">Esa</span> <span class="SpellE">ibn</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sura</span>, date of death 276 ah (892 ad.)  
f) The <span class="SpellE">Sunan</span>-e <span class="SpellE">Nissai</span>
compiled by Ahmad <span class="SpellE">ibn</span> <span class="SpellE">Sho-aib</span>
<span class="SpellE">Nissai</span> (died 303 <span class="SpellE">a.h</span>=915
ad.) </p>

<h3><a name="ank14">14) </a><span class="SpellE"><span>Hazrat</span></span><span> Ali (A.S):</span></h3>

 

<p>Ali (A.S), the first Imam of
Shiite Muslims, was born 600 <span class="GramE">ad</span>. <span class="GramE">to</span>
<span class="SpellE">Fatemeh</span> and <span class="SpellE">Abutaleb</span>
(latter is the paternal uncle of the Prophet (S-A.W). Ali (A.S) grew up in the
house of the Prophet since the age of 6. He was the first male person to accept
Islam and pledge himself to assist the Prophet (S.A.W). Early in his prophetic
mission when, by command of Allah, the Prophet (S.A.W) called his own kin to
Islam, he announced at a gathering of them: "<span class="GramE">The</span> first among you to believe and accept my faith shall succeed me!'
He repeated this sentence three times and each time Ali was the only person who
professed his faith. On the night of
migration or <span class="SpellE">Hijrat</span> (of the Prophet from Mecca to Medina),
Ali betook himself into the Prophet's bed and slept there (the <span class="SpellE">Quraish</span> had plotted to <span class="SpellE">terrorise</span>
the Prophet that night) and thus demonstrated his fidelity to him. The Prophet
(S.A.W) adopted Ali as his own brother and, on return from his last Hajj
pilgrimage, at a place called <span class="SpellE">Ghadir</span>, the Prophet
(S-A.W) publicly declared Ali (A.S) as the guardian of the Muslims and
Administrator of their affairs. Ali (A.S) was a companion of the Prophet in his
lonely days and his aide in hardships and dangers. For a period of 25 years
immediately after the Prophet's demise, Ali (A.S) remained aside, for some
reasons, of government administration and leadership. During this entire period
Ali (A.S) had assumed the status of an observer whose presence averted
deviation and perversion. After the third Caliph was killed, the <span class="SpellE">Sehaba</span> or companions and a number of other people swore
allegiance to Ali (A.S) and selected him as their Caliph. Imam Ali (A.S)
administered the affairs of the Islamic world for nearly four years and nine
months. He restored the changes that had occurred after the Prophet (S-A.W) to
their pristine state. Opposition agents, whose interests were threatened, rose
on every side and, pretending to avenge the blood of the 3rd Caliph, set off
internal bloody wars that lasted during the entire period of Ali (A.S)'s rule,
until, finally, they martyred this unique man of history after the Prophet, by
the altar where he was saying prayers. It is extremely difficult to talk of Ali
(A.S)'s personality in a worthy manner. He had dedicated his entire life to
God's religion and was not remiss in this for the slightest moment. In his
modest home children such as <span class="SpellE">Hassan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Hossein</span> (A.S) and <span class="SpellE">Zainab</span> (A.S)
were reared, persons who left deep imprints on the course of history and who,
as leader and mentor of seekers of truth carried, on their backs, the shining
torch of humanism through the darkness of times. </p>

<p><a name="ank15"><span>15)
</span></a><span class="SpellE"><span><span>Kashf</span></span></span><span><span>-e <span class="SpellE">Tomm</span>-e <span class="SpellE">Muhammadi</span>:</span></span></p>

 

<p><span class="SpellE">Kashf</span>-e <span class="SpellE">tomm</span>-e <span class="SpellE">muhammadi</span> means revelation, of the entire <span class="SpellE">Quranic</span> truths to <span class="SpellE">Hazrat</span> Muhammad
(S.A.W). Thus, the <span class="SpellE">kashf</span>-e <span class="SpellE">tomm</span>-e
is a descending stage of the holy Book during which the <span class="SpellE">Quran</span>
has been revealed to the heart of the Prophet. This station of revelation of <span class="SpellE">Quranic</span> truths is not by rational or intellectual
reasoning, it is by insight and intuition; it is oracular not visual
observation. For this reason the truths
of the <span class="SpellE">Quran</span> are comprehensible only to the Prophet
and perfect revelation and absolute perception belong to him exclusively. </p>

<p><a name="ank16"><span>16)
</span></a><span class="SpellE"><span><span>Validah</span></span></span><span><span>-e <span class="SpellE">Eimul-Asmae</span>:</span></span></p>

 

<p><span class="SpellE">Validah</span> means offspring or issue and <span class="SpellE">Eimul</span> <span class="SpellE">Asmae</span> is a kind of
knowledge and gnosis that is only within man's ability to learn. With this
definition, the <span class="SpellE">Validah</span> <span class="SpellE">Elmul-asmae</span>
is a child of <span class="SpellE">Elmul-asmae</span>, by which is meant human.
Almighty God has conferred the <span class="SpellE">Elmul-asmae</span> on man so
that this creature may acquire worthiness for being Caliph on earth. Man would
not have achieved this worth had not God taught him such knowledge. </p>

<p><a name="ank17"><span>17)
The </span></a><span class="SpellE"><span><span>Ma`soomin</span></span></span><span><span>:</span></span></p>

 

<p><span class="SpellE">Ma`soomin</span> is the plural of <span class="SpellE">Maasoom</span>
which means one of whom sin has been
withheld and, has not committed a sin all his life. <span class="SpellE">Ismat</span>
or infallibility is regarded as an exclusive characteristic of the prophets in
the religious teachings. It means immunity to error and sin and this imparts
the utmost reliability to <span class="GramE">Those</span> who are infallible.
By <span class="SpellE">Ma`soomin</span> mentioned (in the Imam's win) is meant
the Prophet (S.A.W) and his Household. </p>

<p><a name="ank18"><span>18)
Muhammad Reza Khan </span></a><span class="SpellE"><span><span>Pahlavi</span></span></span><span><span>:</span></span></p>

 

<p class="MsoNormal">Muhammad Reza <span class="SpellE">Pahlavi</span>, the last
monarch of the <span class="SpellE">Pahlavi</span> Dynasty, was born in October
1919. His father, Reza Khan, declared him his crown prince on his becoming king
after the coup <span class="SpellE">d'etat</span>. After completion of elementary
schooling Muhammad Reza was sent for further education to Switzerland and
upon return from that country he was enrolled in a military high school. In
1941, the Allies dethroned his father and sent him into exile and conceded to
Muhammad Reza's succeeding his father. The reign of Muhammad Reza as Shah can
be divided into two general parts. The first part lasted from 1941 to 1955. He
could not muster the power of his father in this period. The second period
(1955-78) or 23 years ended in his fall. It accounts for Muhammad Reza's
absolute rule as a despotic autocrat in Iran. The text of Imam Khomeini's
last will includes references to the manner of Muhammad Reza's 37 years rule. </p>

<p><a name="ank19"><span>19)
King </span></a><span class="SpellE"><span><span>Fahad</span></span></span><span><span>:</span></span></p>

 

<p class="MsoNormal">King <span class="SpellE">Fahad</span> is the king of Saudi
  Arabia. To get an idea of the extent of
AI-e-<span class="SpellE">Saud's</span> dependence on major powers especially on
the world-mongering America; the role of this family in the spread of the false
and pervert creed of <span class="SpellE">Wahhabism</span>; their ancient,
historic animosity towards the <span class="SpellE">Shia</span> of Ali (A.S);
their hypocritical approach towards the struggle of the fighting people of
Palestine; their massacre of the pilgrims of Iran and other countries in the
House of God; their intrusion on the Divine sanctuaries; suppression of the
Arab fighters and <span class="SpellE">Mujahedeen</span> (strugglers), within and
out of Saudi Arabian peninsula; squandering the wealth of the Muslims..... <span class="GramE">and</span> other atrocities of this family, please refer to the
literature's available on the subject. </p>

<p><a name="ank20"><span>20)
</span></a><span class="SpellE"><span><span>Wahhabism</span></span></span><span><span>:</span></span></p>

 

<p>The doctrine and creed of <span class="SpellE">Wahhabism</span> was formulated
by Muhammad <span class="SpellE">ibn</span> Abdul-<span class="SpellE">Wahhab</span>
<span class="SpellE">Najdi</span> (toward the end of 12th and early days of 13th
century, ah.1 and is ascribed to British colonialism. The adherents to <span class="SpellE">Wahhabism</span> are of the opinion that all Islamic
denominations, including the Sunnis and <span class="SpellE">Shia</span> groups,
are idle worshipers. They regard the showing of respect and reverence toward to
shrine of the Prophet (S.A.W) and Infallible Imams a kind of heresy and
paganism. Supported by Muslim wealth, the <span class="SpellE">Wahhabis</span>
are active in cultural propaganda and they are instruments for implementation
of the destructive plans of the super powers. </p>

<p><a name="ank21"><span>21)
The </span></a><span class="SpellE"><span><span>Nahjul-Balagha</span></span></span><span><span>:</span></span></p>

 

<p>'<span class="SpellE">Nahjul-Balagha</span>" means the clear path to
eloquence. It is a compendium of selected words and maxims of <span class="SpellE">Hazrat</span> <span class="SpellE">Amirul-Mo`menin</span> (Master of
the believers) Ali (A.S) compiled by <span class="SpellE">Sharif</span> <span class="SpellE">Razi</span> Muhammad <span class="SpellE">ibn</span> AI-<span class="SpellE">Hossein</span> (died 406 ah=1016 ad.). Grand authorities of the
Religion have named the '<span class="SpellE">Nahjul-Balagha</span>" the
"brother' of the <span class="SpellE">Quran</span>. The contents of this
book revolve around the three essential subjects of God, the universe and man,
and comprise scientific, literary, religious, social, ethical and political
topics. Next to the words of the holy <span class="SpellE">Quran</span> and
statements by the Prophet (S.A.W) no words, regardless of the source and
author, can equate those of the <span class="SpellE">Nahjul-Balagha</span> in
significance and eloquence. So far more than 101 exegeses and commentaries have
been written about the <span class="SpellE">Nahjul-Balagha</span>, indicating the
importance of this book to the authorities in science, research and study. </p>

<p>The term of Imamate of the 12th Shiite imam, <span class="SpellE">Hazrat</span>
<span class="SpellE">Hojjat</span> <span class="SpellE">ibn</span> <span class="SpellE">Hasan</span> <span class="SpellE">Askari</span> (A.S) began when he
was only 6 years old. Because of the conditions prevailing at the time and by
God's will, His Holiness went into
occultation. The period of the Mahdi (A.S)'s occultation is divided in two
parts: the lesser or minor occultation (<span class="SpellE">ghaybat-e-sughra</span>)
which lasted 69 years. During this
period his holiness was indirectly in communion with the people through the
medium of four representatives. Then began the grand or major occultation (<span class="SpellE">ghaybat</span>-e-cobra) which has continued to this date and will
be effective until his advent and the triumph of Truth over falsehood.
Islamic thought holds to the view that the extensive challenges of <span class="SpellE">Hazrat</span> Mahdi (A.S) and his impending advent will be the
last link in the chain of the challenges and fights of the <span class="SpellE">ahl-e-haq</span>
or supporters of Truth against the <span class="SpellE">ahl-e-batel</span> or
adherents to falsehood. This means that the struggles of the followers of Truth
will continue throughout history and grounds for the victory of Truth becomes
better prepared with each passing day and culminate
in the advent and rise of the promised Mahdi (A.S) with the eventual dawn
of the light of Truth and Justice in man's horizons, marking his intellectual,
moral and social maturity. </p>

The Ascending </span></a><span class="SpellE"><span><span>Quran</span></span></span><span><span> (<span class="SpellE">Quran-e-sa-ed</span>):</span></span></p>

 

<p><span class="GramE">The word '<span class="SpellE">sa</span>-ed' means rising,
ascending, climbing, etc.</span> As an expression the term is in contrast with
words '<span class="SpellE">Quran-c-nazil</span>' which means descending or
coming down. It is used to define the prayers and supplications of the Imams
and the Inflammables (A.S). </p>

The </span></a><span class="SpellE"><span><span>Shabaniah</span></span></span><span><span> prayer:</span></span></p>

 

<p class="MsoNormal">This invocative litany, because of richness of contents and
import, has been frequently performed during the month of <span class="SpellE">Shaban</span>
by <span class="SpellE">Hazrat</span> Ali (A.S), his children and by all other
Infallible Imams. Of the importance of this prayer, the saying of which was
often <span class="SpellE">emphasised</span> by Imam Khomeini (PUH) in the course
of his blessed life, it will suffice to say that no other prayer of invocation
is said to have been recited by all of the Infallible Imams (A.S). </p>

<p><a name="ank26"><span>26)
The Arafat prayer:</span></a></p>

 

<p class="MsoNormal">Arafat is a station for the Hajj pilgrims in the vicinity of
Mecca. The
Prayer of Arafat is ascribed to <span class="SpellE">Hossein</span> <span class="SpellE">ibn</span> Ali (A.S) and was often recited by him and by Imam <span class="SpellE">Sajjad</span> on the 9th day of the month of <span class="SpellE">Zillhejjah</span>
in the desert of Arafat. This prayer is expressive of the
lovely supplications made by the Master of Martyrs (Imam <span class="SpellE">Hossein</span>
(A.S) invoking the mercy of his beloved Lord, the one and only creator of
universe. The Arafat Prayer, as other prayers said by the Infallible Imams
(A.S), contains deep and lofty concepts. </p>

</span></a><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE"><span><span>lmam</span></span></span></span><span><span> <span class="SpellE">Hossein</span> (A.S):</span></span></p>

 

<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="SpellE">Hossein</span> (A.S) was the hero of <span class="SpellE">Ashura</span> (the 10th day of <span class="SpellE">Muharran</span>
when Imam <span class="SpellE">Hossein</span> (A.S) was martyred), the greatest
epic event in man's history. He was born to Ali (A.S), the man of Justice and
chastity and Her Holiness Fatima (A.S),
the symbol of a Muslim woman, in the 4th year ah. <span class="GramE">and</span>
was raised and reared under the care and supervision of a father such as Ali
(A.S), a grandfather such as Muhammad (S.A.W) and a mother like Fatima (A.S).
After the martyrdom of Imam <span class="SpellE">Hasan</span> (A.S) in 50 ah.,
caliph <span class="SpellE">Mua`viah</span> increased his pressure and ordered
all his governors to delete the names of the Shiite Muslims (followers of Ali
(A.S) from the rosters of the Muslim treasury and to apprehend and put to death
any one accused of sympathy for Ali (A.S). <span class="SpellE">Yazid</span>
succeeded his father <span class="SpellE">Mua`viah</span> as caliph and followed
the path of his sire. He ordered that <span class="SpellE">lmam</span> <span class="SpellE">Hossein</span> swear allegiance to him and be slain should he
refuse. </p>

<p>Imam <span class="SpellE">Hossein</span> did not yield to <span class="SpellE">Yazid</span>,
this prototype of meanness and villainy. He resorted to the sword and undertook
the fundamental <span class="SpellE">Ashura</span> move that he might thus kindle
a light (of hope) amid the darkness (of oppression) and to initiate history's
eternal epic event. <span class="GramE">By sacrificing his ale including the
lives of himself, his kin and supporters in the path of God; Imam <span class="SpellE">Hossein</span> (A.S).became a model and example for all those who
tread in the path of Truth.</span> Many books have been written about the
personality of Imam <span class="SpellE">Hossein</span> (A.S) and a great deal
has been talked about him. Friend and foe testify to Imam <span class="SpellE">Hossein's</span>
matchless courage, bravery, patience, forbearance, his challenge of cruelty and
injustice, his courtesy and humility, his kindness and his compassion. </p>

The <span class="SpellE">Sahifah</span> <span class="SpellE">Sajjadiah</span>: </span></p>

<p>In view of the dominance of the rule of tyranny in the time of Imam <span class="SpellE">Sajjad</span> (A.S), the fourth leader of the Shiite Muslims of
the world, a collection of his advises, exhortations and <span class="SpellE">counselling</span>
manifests in the form of prayers this collection which contains 54 such entries
is available. It is known as the <span class="SpellE">Sahifah</span> <span class="SpellE">Sajjadiah</span> and is a veritable <span class="SpellE">encyclopaedia</span>
that in the course of history of <span class="SpellE">Shiism</span> has constantly
been a source of inspiration to the learned men and seekers of the Path of God.
This book has had great educational influence. </p>

</span></a><span class="SpellE"><span><span>Zabur</span></span></span><span><span>-e-Al-e Muhammad (The Psalms of the
Household of Muhammad (S.A.W)):</span></span></p>

 

<p><span class="SpellE">Zabur</span> is the name of a Divine Book that was sent
down to His Holiness <span class="SpellE">Davood</span> (David), one of the great
prophets of God, it contains plenty of tersely cogent and pithy phrases and
sayings of knowledge and wisdom. Because of the importance of subject matter,
richness of contents and the depth of its lofty concepts, the <span class="SpellE">Sahifah</span> <span class="SpellE">Sajjadiah</span> is known to the
initiates by several appellations such as "The <span class="SpellE">Zabur</span>-e
AI-e-Muhammad", 'the Bible of the <span class="SpellE">Ahl</span>-e
Bait"; 'the Sister of <span class="SpellE">Quran</span>', etc. </p>

The </span></a><span class="SpellE"><span><span>Sahifah</span></span></span><span><span> <span class="SpellE">Fatimiyah</span>:</span></span></p>

 

<p>The word '<span class="SpellE">Sahifah</span>' means letter or book. The term <span class="SpellE">Fatimiyah</span> implies that the realities and topics ascribed to
her Holiness <span class="SpellE">Fatimah</span> (A.S). Thus the <span class="SpellE">Sahifah</span> <span class="SpellE">Fatimiyah</span> is a book
attributed to the noble daughter of the Prophet (S.A.W) and the faithful wife
of Ali (A.S), the first leader of the world Shiites. The book has embodied news
and intimations of future world events. It has been kept in custody by the
Infallible Imams (A.S) and, according to <span class="GramE">narratives,</span>
it has had a volume three times that of the Holy <span class="SpellE">Quran</span>.

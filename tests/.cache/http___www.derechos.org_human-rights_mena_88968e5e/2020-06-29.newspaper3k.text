The Middle East and North Africa are fertile grounds for human rights violations. Real democracies exist in a minority of countries, while some still subsist under brutal dictatorships.

The rights of religious and ethnic minorities are often compromised, and the struggle between religious fanatics and government repressors have often lead to the suffering of many innocent victims. Freedom of speech is greatly curtailed, and human rights NGOs and journalists operate under danger of arrests and lawsuits.

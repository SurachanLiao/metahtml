Experts say the decision will likely raise the already strained relationship between the two countries to a much higher level.</p> <del><a href="https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/styles/sourced/s3/2019-06/4EECA207-F8C4-4333-9722-95C5843B8A9A.jpg?itok=JztU68W4"><img alt="FILE PHOTO: An Iranian Officer of Revolutionary Guards,is is shown during graduation ceremony, held for the military cadets in a military academy, in Tehran, Iran June 30, 2018." height="285" src="https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/styles/sourced_410px_wide/s3/2019-06/4EECA207-F8C4-4333-9722-95C5843B8A9A.jpg?itok=OzfMDSai" title="FILE PHOTO: An Iranian Officer of Revolutionary Guards,is is shown during graduation ceremony, held for the military cadets in a military academy, in Tehran, Iran June 30, 2018." width="410"> Link: https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/styles/sourced/s3/2019-06/4EECA207-F8C4-4333-9722-95C5843B8A9A.jpg?itok=JztU68W4 </a> FILE PHOTO: An Iranian Officer of Revolutionary Gu

"In practice, the IRGC exists to ensure that never happens. The population of Iran may wish what it will, but they are meant to live in terror of the IRGC." </p> <del><a href="https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/styles/sourced/s3/2019-04/D76ECFC5-CC69-4C03-AFB3-EA126ABB0EE4.jpg?itok=ouKEdoLz"><img alt="In this photo released on Oct. 1, 2018, by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, a missile is fired from city of Kermanshah in western Iran targeting the Islamic State group in Syria." height="293" src="https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/styles/sourced_410px_wide/s3/2019-04/D76ECFC5-CC69-4C03-AFB3-EA126ABB0EE4.jpg?itok=PfPMUwRW" title="In this photo released on Oct. 1, 2018, by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, a missile is fired from city of Kermanshah in western Iran targeting the Islamic State group in Syria." width="410"> Link: https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/styles/sourced/s3/2019-04/D76ECFC5-CC69-4C03-AFB3-EA126ABB0EE4.jpg?itok=ouKEdoLz </a> In this photo released on Oct. 1, 2018, by the Ira

It is also in charge of the country's ballistic missiles and nuclear programs.</p><p>Organizationally, the IRGC falls under the Joint Armed Forces General Staff as a part of the Ministry of Defense. But the military remains subordinate to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, with elected civilian authorities exercising no real control, according to international policy organization Counter Extremism Project. </p><p>Internally, the IRGC also commands the Basij Resistance Force, a religious volunteer group that channels popular support to the regime and suppresses domestic dissent. The paramilitary force monitors compliance with the country's strict customs, such as arresting women who violate the regime's public dress codes and raiding Western-style parties where alcohol may be served.</p><p>Externally, the IRGC's uses its shadowy Quds Force led by Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani and proxy Shiite militias such as the Lebanese Hezbollah to extend its influence across the Middle East and beyond.</p> <del><a href="https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/styles/sourced/s3/2019-06/D5E78882-0F84-472C-9AC7-03DE68270A06.jpg?itok=cWX_Jpmx"><img alt="In this June 30, 2018 photo, released by an official website of the office of the Iranian supreme leader, Gen.

The IRGC is a multibillion dollar conglomerate economic cartel which controls organizations, companies and entities across the country and overseas. With this sanction, the fate of individuals and other companies who have business ties with it will be affected."</p><p>Analysts charge the sanctions will likely cross Iranian borders into other countries in the region where the IRGC has established influence and footprints. </p><p>Mike Pregent, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, told VOA the U.S. move would most likely be influential in draining the stream of support to militant groups such as the Houthis in Yemen and could push governments away from being Iranian proxies.</p><p>"This is a chance for Iraq to distant itself from Iran," Pregent said, adding that the Iranian IRGC has used Iraq's Popular Mobilization Forces to directly shape governance in Iraq.</p><p>At the same time, the designation would likely put countries that wish to establish balanced relations with the U.S. and Iran in a difficult position, according to some experts.</p><p>Barbara Slavin, director of the Future of Iran Initiative at the Atlantic Council, said the U.S. sanctions would likely put immense pressure on Iraq and Lebanon, where pro-Iranian militants enjoy a lot of influence outside the military apparatus. </p><p>"It will certainly strengthen pro-Iran groups in Iraq calling for the expulsion of U.S. troops and, I believe, it will decrease U.S. influence, as Iran is not going anywhere, while Trump is cutting both troops and aid," she said. </p> <h2 class="section-title"><ins>Related Stories</ins></h2><p class="eyebrow"><ins><a href="/middle-east" hreflang="en">Middle East Link: /middle-east </a> </ins></p><p class="teaser__title"><ins><a class="teaser__title-link" href="/middle-east/ap-explains-long-reach-irans-revolutionary-guard" title="AP Explains: Long Reach of Iran's Revolutionary Guard"><span>AP Explains: Long Reach of Iran's Revolutionary Guard</span>  Link: /middle-east/ap-explains-long-reach-irans-revolutionary-guard </a> </ins></p><p class="teaser__text"><ins>Iran's Revolutionary Guard, designated a "foreign terrorist organization" by the Trump administration on Monday, evolved from a paramilitary, domestic security force with origins in the 1979 Islamic Revolution to a transnational force that has come to the aid of Tehran's allies in the Mideast, from Syria and Lebanon to Iraq.The force answers only to Iran's supreme leader, operates independently of the regular military and has vast economic interests across the country.

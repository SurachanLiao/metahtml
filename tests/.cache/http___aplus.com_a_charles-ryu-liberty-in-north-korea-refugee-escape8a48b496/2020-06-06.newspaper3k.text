In the last year, though, those rescues have been happening less often. McKay says just 1,200 North Korean refugees safely resettled in South Korea in 2017, a significant drop from years prior. Human Rights Watch has also documented an increase in the number of North Korean refugees that China is detaining and sending back home. Chinese officials have cracked down on routes used by LiNK and similar organizations to help North Koreans escape, and the North Korean regime has increased security on border areas like the one Ryu crossed to safety. In part, the regime is responding to the growing amount of outside information that is spreading throughout the country and leading people to try and make an escape.

"When they [refugees] leave or when their parents leave, then North Korean refugees are calling their friends and family still inside the country and telling them, 'I made it out, I'm safe, and guess what? The world outside North Korea is so much better,'" McKay said. "Every time we help the North Korean refugees and resettle them, they are sending money and information back into the country, which is just accelerating more change and putting pressure on the regime to adapt."

Now McKay, Ryu and the LiNK team are focused on changing the narrative about North Korea as they help refugees escape. For a long time, LiNK tried to change policy in Washington D.C. â€” but they realized their effort would be better spent educating Americans about North Korea and helping liberate the North Korean people directly. Both Ryu and McKay said the best thing Americans can do to help is to donate to organizations like LiNK. A group of "Vision Donors" supports LiNK's operations budget, but 100 percent of any outside donations goes directly to the refugee rescue program, its "Changing the Narrative" work, and a refugee empowerment program for North Koreans who have been resettled.

McKay compared what's happening in North Korea to the crisis in Syria, pointing out that Americans often recognize the Syrian people as being separate from the Syrian government, but struggle to show the same empathy for North Korean citizens living under the North Korean regime. Ryu agreed.

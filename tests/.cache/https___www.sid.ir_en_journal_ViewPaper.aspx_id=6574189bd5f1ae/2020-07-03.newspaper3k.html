									<p id="ContentPlaceHolder1_lblAbstract">Stucco mihrabs are among valuable elements of Iranian architecture both in view of technique and of composition of patterns and inscriptions. They were crafted over a long period and are considered a valuable collection of designs and motifs either invented or inherited from past eras. The climax of the craft is considered to be during the Seljuq and early Timurid period&#1548; but dating remaining [undated] examples has been a difficult task because of the slow pace of development and continuing traditions. For example&#1548; there are two [undated] mihrabs of the historic Masjid-i Kucheh-Mir located in Natanz. Since the inscriptions containing the date for the two mihrabs are flawed and indiscernible&#1548; numerous opinions are expressed about their probable date of construction. After reintroducing the mosque and its mihrabs&#1548; this paper intends to provide a realistic date for the mihrabs through a comparative study and examination of details. For the reason of Kirmani&#8217; s signature &#8220; amal-i Haidar Kirmani&#8221; on the first floor mihrab&#1548; the comparative study was based on stucco mihrabs having his signature. Analysis and comparison of the structure&#1548; patterns&#1548; and inscriptions of the two mihrabs with those of dated or undated mihrabs holding Kirmani&#8217; s signature&#1548; added to the fact that the signature of the craft of Kirmani exists also on several wooden works belonging to the second half of eighth century AH in villages near Natanz&#1548; the mihrabs are datable to the mid-eighth century AH. Data collection methods include library and field studies and the research approach is historical-comparative.</p>

Here, based on the publicly available epidemiological data for Hubei, China from January 11 to February 10, 2020, we provide estimates of the main epidemiological parameters. In particular, we provide an estimation of the case fatality and case recovery ratios, along with their 90% confidence intervals as the outbreak evolves. On the basis of a Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered-Dead (SIDR) model, we provide estimations of the basic reproduction number (R0), and the per day infection mortality and recovery rates. By calibrating the parameters of the SIRD model to the reported data, we also attempt to forecast the evolution of the outbreak at the epicenter three weeks ahead, i.e. until February 29. As the number of infected individuals, especially of those with asymptomatic or mild courses, is suspected to be much higher than the official numbers, which can be considered only as a subset of the actual numbers of infected and recovered cases in the total population, we have repeated the calculations under a second scenario that considers twenty times the number of confirmed infected cases and forty times the number of recovered, leaving the number of deaths unchanged. Based on the reported data, the expected value of R0 as computed considering the period from the 11th of January until the 18th of January, using the official counts of confirmed cases was found to be ∼4.6, while the one computed under the second scenario was found to be ∼3.2. Thus, based on the SIRD simulations, the estimated average value of R0 was found to be ∼2.6 based on confirmed cases and ∼2 based on the second scenario. Our forecasting flashes a note of caution for the presently unfolding outbreak in China. Based on the official counts for confirmed cases, the simulations suggest that the cumulative number of infected could reach 180,000 (with a lower bound of 45,000) by February 29. Regarding the number of deaths, simulations forecast that on the basis of the up to the 10th of February reported data, the death toll might exceed 2,700 (as a lower bound) by February 29. Our analysis further reveals a significant decline of the case fatality ratio from January 26 to which various factors may have contributed, such as the severe control measures taken in Hubei, China (e.g. quarantine and hospitalization of infected individuals), but mainly because of the fact that the actual cumulative numbers of infected and recovered cases in the population most likely are much higher than the reported ones. Thus, in a scenario where we have taken twenty times the confirmed number of infected and forty times the confirmed number of recovered cases, the case fatality ratio is around ∼0.15% in the total population. Importantly, based on this scenario, simulations suggest a slow down of the outbreak in Hubei at the end of February.</p><p>___</p><p> <ins>Citation:</ins> <del><strong>Citation</strong>:</del> Anastassopoulou C, Russo L, Tsakris A, Siettos C (2020) Data-based analysis, modelling and forecasting of the COVID-19 outbreak.

Answering this question requires accurate forecasting the spread of confirmed cases as well as analysis of the number of deaths and recoveries. Forecasting, however, requires ample historical data. At the same time, no prediction is certain as the future rarely repeats itself in the same way as the past. Moreover, forecasts are influenced by the reliability of the data, vested interests, and what variables are being predicted. Also, psychological factors play a significant role in how people perceive and react to the danger from the disease and the fear that it may affect them personally. This paper introduces an objective approach to predicting the continuation of the COVID-19 using a simple, but powerful method to do so. Assuming that the data used is reliable and that the future will continue to follow the past pattern of the disease, our forecasts suggest a continuing increase in the confirmed COVID-19 cases with sizable associated uncertainty. The risks are far from symmetric as underestimating its spread like a pandemic and not doing enough to contain it is much more severe than overspending and being over careful when it will not be needed. This paper describes the timeline of a live forecasting exercise with massive potential implications for planning and decision making and provides objective forecasts for the confirmed cases of COVID-19.</ins></p><p><ins>___</ins></p><p><ins>Citation: Petropoulos F, Makridakis S (2020) Forecasting the novel coronavirus COVID-19.

But this relationship is not particularly stable. Like all living substances, viruses mutate, sometimes in ways that cause explosive, severe disease. Viral outbreaks have killed off virtually entire populations, as happened when measles was first introduced into the previously naive population of the Faroe Islands, or when Europeans brought smallpox to North America. Humankind, as a whole, has survived evolving viral threats by evolving with them; prior exposure to related viruses produces varying degrees of resistance (immunity) to new strains. Humans with less resistance die, often despite modern medical intervention, while others remain entirely asymptomatic. Medical interventions (principally vaccines) and stringent public health measures have often altered the outcome, but not necessarily in predictable ways.</ins></p><p><ins>(…)</ins></p><p><ins>–</ins></p><p><ins>Keywords: SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19; Ophthalmology.</ins></p><p><ins>—–</ins></p><h3 class="sd-title"><ins>Share this:</ins></h3><ul><li class="share-twitter"><ins><a href="https://twitter.com/share" class="twitter-share-button">Tweet Link: https://twitter.com/share </a></ins></li><li class="share-tumblr"><ins><a class="tumblr-share-button" target="_blank" href="https://www.tumblr.com/share" title="Share on Tumblr">Share on Tumblr Link: https://www.tumblr.com/share </a></ins></li><li><ins><a href="#" class="sharing-anchor sd-button share-more"><span>More</span> Link: # </a></ins></li></ul><ul><li class="share-telegram"><ins><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" class="share-telegram sd-button" href="https://etidioh.wordpress.com/2020/03/31/humans-viruses-and-the-eye-an-early-report-from-the-covid19-front-line-jama-ophthalmol-summary/?share=telegram" target="_blank" title="Click to share on Telegram"><span>Telegram</span> Link: https://etidioh.wordpress.com/2020/03/31/humans-viruses-and-the-eye-an-early-report-from-the-covid19-front-line-jama-ophthalmol-summary/?share=telegram </a></ins></li><li class="share-jetpack-whatsapp"><ins><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" class="share-jetpack-whatsapp sd-button" href="https://etidioh.wordpress.com/2020/03/31/humans-viruses-and-the-eye-an-early-report-from-the-covid19-front-line-jama-ophthalmol-summary/?share=jetpack-whatsapp" target="_blank" title="Click to share on WhatsApp"><span>WhatsApp</span> Link: https://etidioh.wordpress.com/2020/03/31/humans-viruses-and-the-eye-an-early-report-from-the-covid19-front-line-jama-ophthalmol-summary/?share=jetpack-whatsapp </a></ins></li><li class="share-email"><ins><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" class="share-email sd-button" href="https://etidioh.wordpress.com/2020/03/31/humans-viruses-and-the-eye-an-early-report-from-the-covid19-front-line-jama-ophthalmol-summary/?share=email" target="_blank" title="Click to email this to a friend"><span>Email</span> Link: https://etidioh.wordpress.com/2020/03/31/humans-viruses-and-the-eye-an-early-report-from-the-covid19-front-line-jama-ophthalmol-summary/?share=email </a></ins></li></ul><h3 class="sd-title"><ins>Like this:</ins></h3><p class="likes-widget-placeholder post-likes-widget-placeholder"><ins><span class="button"><span>Like</span></span> <span class="loading">Loading...</span></ins></p></article><article id="post-47953" class="post-47953 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-uncategorized tag-abstract tag-china-2 tag-covid-19 tag-hubei tag-ophthalmology tag-research-2 tag-sars-cov-2"><p><ins>[Source: JAMA Ophthalmology, full page: (<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/2764083" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LINK Link: https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/2764083 </a>).

During the period of treatment, the ocular signs and symptoms as well as results of blood tests and reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from nasopharyngeal and conjunctival swabs for SARS-CoV-2 were noted and analyzed.</ins></p><p><ins>Main Outcomes and Measures  </ins></p><p><ins>Ocular signs and symptoms as well as results of blood tests and RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2.</ins></p><p><ins>Results  </ins></p><p><ins>Of the 38 included patients with clinically confirmed COVID-19, 25 (65.8%) were male, and the mean (SD) age was 65.8 (16.6) years. Among them, 28 patients (73.7%) had positive findings for COVID-19 on RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs, and of these, 2 patients (5.2%) yielded positive findings for SARS-CoV-2 in their conjunctival as well as nasopharyngeal specimens. A total of 12 of 38 patients (31.6%; 95% CI, 17.5-48.7) had ocular manifestations consistent with conjunctivitis, including conjunctival hyperemia, chemosis, epiphora, or increased secretions. By univariate analysis, patients with ocular symptoms were more likely to have higher white blood cell and neutrophil counts and higher levels of procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, and lactate dehydrogenase than patients without ocular symptoms. In addition, 11 of 12 patients with ocular abnormalities (91.7%; 95% CI, 61.5-99.8) had positive results for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs.

As of March 28, 2020, a total of 571,678 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 26,494 deaths have been reported worldwide (2). Reports from China and Italy suggest that risk factors for severe disease include older age and the presence of at least one of several underlying health conditions (3,4). U.S. older adults, including those aged ≥65 years and particularly those aged ≥85 years, also appear to be at higher risk for severe COVID-19–associated outcomes; however, data describing underlying health conditions among U.S. COVID-19 patients have not yet been reported (5). As of March 28, 2020, U.S. states and territories have reported 122,653 U.S. COVID-19 cases to CDC, including 7,162 (5.8%) for whom data on underlying health conditions and other known risk factors for severe outcomes from respiratory infections were reported. Among these 7,162 cases, 2,692 (37.6%) patients had one or more underlying health condition or risk factor, and 4,470 (62.4%) had none of these conditions reported. The percentage of COVID-19 patients with at least one underlying health condition or risk factor was higher among those requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission (358 of 457, 78%) and those requiring hospitalization without ICU admission (732 of 1,037, 71%) than that among those who were not hospitalized (1,388 of 5,143, 27%). The most commonly reported conditions were diabetes mellitus, chronic lung disease, and cardiovascular disease. These preliminary findings suggest that in the United States, persons with underlying health conditions or other recognized risk factors for severe outcomes from respiratory infections appear to be at a higher risk for severe disease from COVID-19 than are persons without these conditions.</ins></p><p><ins>–</ins></p><p><ins>Keywords: SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19; USA; Intensive Care.</ins></p><p><ins>—–</ins></p><h3 class="sd-title"><ins>Share this:</ins></h3><ul><li class="share-twitter"><ins><a href="https://twitter.com/share" class="twitter-share-button">Tweet Link: https://twitter.com/share </a></ins></li><li class="share-tumblr"><ins><a class="tumblr-share-button" target="_blank" href="https://www.tumblr.com/share" title="Share on Tumblr">Share on Tumblr Link: https://www.tumblr.com/share </a></ins></li><li><ins><a href="#" class="sharing-anchor sd-button share-more"><span>More</span> Link: # </a></ins></li></ul><ul><li class="share-telegram"><ins><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" class="share-telegram sd-button" href="https://etidioh.wordpress.com/2020/03/31/preliminary-estimates-of-prevalence-of-selected-underlying-health-conditions-among-patients-with-covid19-usa-feb-12-mar-28-20-mmwr-morb-mortal-wkly-rep-abstract/?share=telegram" target="_blank" title="Click to share on Telegram"><span>Telegram</span> Link: https://etidioh.wordpress.com/2020/03/31/preliminary-estimates-of-prevalence-of-selected-underlying-health-conditions-among-patients-with-covid19-usa-feb-12-mar-28-20-mmwr-morb-mortal-wkly-rep-abstract/?share=telegram </a></ins></li><li class="share-jetpack-whatsapp"><ins><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" class="share-jetpack-whatsapp sd-button" href="https://etidioh.wordpress.com/2020/03/31/preliminary-estimates-of-prevalence-of-selected-underlying-health-conditions-among-patients-with-covid19-usa-feb-12-mar-28-20-mmwr-morb-mortal-wkly-rep-abstract/?share=jetpack-whatsapp" target="_blank" title="Click to share on WhatsApp"><span>WhatsApp</span> Link: https://etidioh.wordpress.com/2020/03/31/preliminary-estimates-of-prevalence-of-selected-underlying-health-conditions-among-patients-with-covid19-usa-feb-12-mar-28-20-mmwr-morb-mortal-wkly-rep-abstract/?share=jetpack-whatsapp </a></ins></li><li class="share-email"><ins><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" class="share-email sd-button" href="https://etidioh.wordpress.com/2020/03/31/preliminary-estimates-of-prevalence-of-selected-underlying-health-conditions-among-patients-with-covid19-usa-feb-12-mar-28-20-mmwr-morb-mortal-wkly-rep-abstract/?share=email" target="_blank" title="Click to email this to a friend"><span>Email</span> Link: https://etidioh.wordpress.com/2020/03/31/preliminary-estimates-of-prevalence-of-selected-underlying-health-conditions-among-patients-with-covid19-usa-feb-12-mar-28-20-mmwr-morb-mortal-wkly-rep-abstract/?share=email </a></ins></li></ul><h3 class="sd-title"><ins>Like this:</ins></h3><p class="likes-widget-placeholder post-likes-widget-placeholder"><ins><span class="button"><span>Like</span></span> <span class="loading">Loading...</span></ins></p></article><article id="post-47941" class="post-47941 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-uncategorized"><p><ins>___</ins></p><p><ins>Angel, I will follow you

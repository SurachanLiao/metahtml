Retailing isn’t what it used to be…as we emerge from the recent disruptions, it has never been more critical for independent retailers to embrace digital strategies and multi-platform strategies. You do not have to be a digital native or spend heavily to put some of these strategies into action. Join us for this interactive webinar on creating digital content that will help you convert your audience into paying customers, no matter the platform. We will go over practical tips and tricks, case studies, and simple action items you can take right away to help your business thrive.

Making safety planning a priority to protect your employees and customers is essential to reopening retail businesses during a pandemic. The Retail COVID Safety Operational Plan and In-store Posters will help you prepare for each phase of your reopening.

When the entire retail sector is prepared to meet this challenge by giving consumers the assurance that reopening our economy is gradual and well-thought out, customers will come back with confidence.

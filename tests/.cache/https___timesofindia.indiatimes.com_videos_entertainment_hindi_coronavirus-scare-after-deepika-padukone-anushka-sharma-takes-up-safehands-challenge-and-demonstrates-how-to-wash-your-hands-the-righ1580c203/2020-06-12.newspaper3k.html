WHO came up with a #SafeHands challenge on social media, among others, wherein they have enlisted precautionary measures, something as simple as washing your hands the right way. Now, after Deepika Padukone took on the challenge, another A-list Bollywood actress, Anushka Sharma is showing fans and followers how to wash your hands the right way on Instagram via a video tutorial. Like Deepika, Anushka too is demonstrating it, asking people to stay safe and healthy amid the coronavirus outbreak. Though Anushka didn&#8217;t tag anyone in her challenge, Deepika tagged footballer Christiano Ronaldo, captain of the Indian cricket team Virat Kohli and Roger Federer to take the challenge. Priyanka Chopra, who was tagged by WHO Director-General is yet to post hers.</p><a class="readmore readmorecont1" href="">Read More</a><a class="readmore readlesscont1" href="">Read Less</a></div>

<p>MANILA - A total of 156 Chinese tourists were flown back to Wuhan, China from Kalibo, Aklan on Saturday evening, Philippine authorities said, as the new coronavirus continued to claim lives and infect thousands across the world.</p>

<p>The tourists returned to the epicenter of the new strain of virus on a flight that left around 10 p.m., Kalibo airport area manager Efren Nagrama said.</p>

<p>Some 150 others are also set to fly out back to Wuhan on Monday evening, according to the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines.</p>

<p>The Chinese tourists arrived from Wuhan before the Philippines halted its flights to and from Wuhan on Thursday as precautionary measure against the spread of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCov).</p>

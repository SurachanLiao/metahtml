The decision, backed by national security adviser John Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, could reportedly be announced as soon as Monday and could help the administration crack down on other global businesses controlled by the IRGC. The U.S. Central Command will reportedly alert U.S. troops in the Middle East about the move in case it “spurs Iran or the Shiite militias it supports within the region to retaliate.” Sources told the newspaper that some Defense Department officials warned against the terrorist designation, believing it may lead to “backlash against U.S. forces in the region without inflicting the intended damage to the Iranian economy.” The CIA also reportedly had concerns about the move. </ins></p><ins><a class="ReadItAtLink" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-to-designate-iranian-guard-corps-a-foreign-terrorist-organization-11554499401" target="_blank"><span>Read it at </span><span class="ReadItAtLink__name">Wall Street Journal</span> Link: https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-to-designate-iranian-guard-corps-a-foreign-terrorist-organization-11554499401 </a></ins></article> <a class="TrackingLink CheatSheetListItem__link" href="/george-floyd-protests-likely-to-be-largest-movement-in-us-history"><p class="CheatSheetListItem__number-title"><del></del></p><h3 class="CheatSheetListItem__number"><del>8 .</del></h3><h3 class="CheatSheetListItem__title"><del>Floyd Protests Likely to Be Largest Movement in U.S. History</del></h3><p class="Rubric__divider__bottom"><del></del></p><p class="Rubric__content"><del>THE PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN</del></p><h4 class="CheatSheetListItem__description"><del>Scholars and crowd-counting experts say that four recent polls show the protests constitute the largest civil movement ever.</del></h4><p class="CheatSheetListItem__time"><del>1 hr ago</del></p><del> Link: /george-floyd-protests-likely-to-be-largest-movement-in-us-history </del></a>

</del></p> <p>S. Rob Sobhani  
</p><p>"Let the American president know that he is the most repulsive member 
of the human race today, because of the injustice he has imposed on 
the Muslim nation. Today the Koran has become his enemy." These are 
not the words of Osama bin Laden, but those of the late Ayatollah 
Khomeini, arguably the godfather of hate towards America. Indeed, the 
phenomenon called Osama bin Laden did not happen in a vacuum. The 
roots of Islamic terrorism against America were nurtured by the 
founding father of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Since his arrival on 
the international scene in 1979, the Ayatollah Khomeini was at the 
vanguard of hate-filled anti-American statements. And, at every 
Friday prayer sermon since then for the last 22 years ,the Islamic 
Republic of Iran has perpetuated the atmosphere of violence against 
the United States in the Middle East by chanting the refrain: "Death 
to America."
</p><p>His hatred of America was not based on any religious precepts, but 
was purely a political power play. The man whom he replaced, the Shah 
of Iran, was modernizing his country with American assistance. The 
only way to do so was to limit the power of the members of the clergy 
who were rigidly opposed to modernization. Any move forward was 
viewed as an assault on the traditional power base of the clergy in 
Iran. Therefore, secular education, full participation of women in 
nation-building and family planning were viewed as a direct threat.
</p><p>The first victims of Khomeini's "Death to America" campaign were the 
American diplomats held hostage for 444 days. But it was not just 
Americans whom he held hostage, the Ayatollah Khomeini, hijacked 
Islam in the process, and held Islam hostage until his death in 1989. 
His successor, the Ayatollah Khamenei, continues to follow in the 
footsteps of his mentor. In the name of Islam, the government of Iran 
has waged a non-stop "jihad" against America , and its ally, Israel.
</p><p>The word "Hezbollah" was never part of the Middle East lexicon until 
1982. That year, Ali Akbar Mohtashemi-Pur, who currently serves as a 
member of parliament and a foreign policy adviser to the "moderate" 
President Khatami, founded this terrorist group while he was Iran's 
ambassador to Syria. He was instrumental in the 1983 suicide bombing 
in Beirut that resulted in 241 dead Marines. Last June, the United 
States indicted Iranian officials and Iran-backed Saudi Hezbollah for 
their involvement in the 1996 attack against U.S. Air Force housing 
in Saudi Arabia that killed 19 American servicemen. All of this 
murder and hate took place under the banner: "Party of God." But in 
fact, the name "Hezbollah, Party of God," is blasphemous, because in 
Islam there is only one God and he cannot have a party.
</p><p>Herein lies the fundamental problem facing America and its war 
against terrorism: Muslims have allowed their beautiful religion to 
be hijacked and held hostage by fanatics intent on advancing their 
personal agendas. Not surprisingly, the handwritten words left behind 
by Mohammad Atta, one of the terrorists who carried out the Sept. 11 
attacks, resemble instructions Khomeini imparted in 1984 to the 
thousands of children who were given the "keys to paradise" before 
blowing themselves up on land mines during the Iran-Iraq war. Osama 
bin Laden is merely a continuation in the timeline of hatred toward 
America begun by Ayatollah Khomeini in 1979.
</p><p>Muslims living in America must speak out loudly and with one voice: 
"Osama, stop manipulating our religion to feed your own megalomania." 
The leadership of the Muslim community in America must embark on a 
tour called "Free Islam." Fifty clerics representing the 50 states of 
the union must immediately begin this tour, starting in Egypt, which 
is home to a majority of the terrorists who attacked the World Trade 
Center and the Pentagon. They should say unequivocally: Those 
Egyptians who carried out this act are not going to end up in heaven 
as suggested by Osama bin Laden. They were criminals, not good 
Muslims. From Egypt, they should go to Lebanon, home to Hezbollah. 
They should condemn the members of Hezbollah for the blasphemous use 
of God's name. God, they should remind their fellow Muslims, is above 
politics and not a tool of the politicians.
</p><p>The tour should then travel to Qatar, home of the Al-Jazeera 
television network, which is a major voice in the Arab world. Through 
Al-Jazeera, these American Muslims must denounce -- in the strongest 
terms -- attacks against America and demand that their fellow 
religious leaders in the region join them in this condemnation. The 
tour should end in Pakistan, home to 147 million Muslims who have 
become increasingly politicized by Osama bin Laden. In Pakistan, they 
should directly accuse Osama bin Laden of murder, and sacrilege and 
condemn all of his followers.
</p><p>U.S. Special Forces are now in Afghanistan, on the front line of our 
war against terrorism. This is a war to safeguard the freedoms that 
we Americans -- including American Muslims -- enjoy. Therefore, it is 
the moral obligation and patriotic duty of the Muslim leadership of 
this country to start the campaign of wresting back control of Islam 
from the violent extremists.
</p><p>The tragedy of Sept. 11 was the result of a vitriolic anti-American 
hatred started by one fanatic, Ayatollah Khomeini, and put into 
action by Osama bin Laden. The onus now rests on the Muslims in 
America to begin the campaign of reversing this atmosphere of hate by 
actively joining in the war against terrorism with all the means at 
their disposal. In the process, they will have freed millions of 
peace-loving Muslims around the world who are enslaved by the 
perversion of their religion.

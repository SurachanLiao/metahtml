<div><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">These parallels have led Dr. Timms to argue that koalas could serve as a &#8220;missing link&#8221; in the search for a human vaccine. &#8220;The koala is more than just a fancy animal model,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It actually is really useful for human studies.&#8221;</p><h2 class="css-1aoo5yy eoo0vm40" id="link-2bb9dc48">An ancient curse</h2><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">No one knows how or when koalas first got chlamydia.

They compared it to the wombat, the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://books.google.com/books?id=ab4dAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA320&amp;lpg=PA320&amp;dq=John+Price+koala+1798&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KxocJBuPln&amp;sig=ACfU3U2_eIrTp_XsyTrU-4R0JUyL8gHohA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjx6sX7ndnpAhWRlXIEHeDuA84Q6AEwD3oECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=John%20Price%20koala%201798&amp;f=false" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sloth</a> and the monkey. They settled on &#8220;native bear&#8221; and gave it the genus name Phascolarctos (from the Greek for &#8220;leather pouch&#8221; and &#8220;bear&#8221;), spawning the misconception that the koala bear is, in fact, a bear.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">&#8220;The graveness of the visage,&#8221; The Sydney Gazette wrote in 1803, &#8220;would seem to indicate a more than ordinary portion of animal sagacity.&#8221;</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">In the late 19th century, the Australian naturalist Ellis Troughton noted that the &#8220;quaint and lovable koala&#8221; was also particularly susceptible to disease.

At the same time, the anatomist J.P.

Many modern scientists now believe those koalas were probably afflicted with the same scourge: chlamydia.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Koalas today have even more to worry about.

<p>The Asian Development Bank today projected a near 7 per cent growth for the Asia Pacific region during 2012.
</p><p>ADB President Haruhiko Kuroda said the Asian Development Outlook (ADO) forecasts a "healthy GDP of 6.9 per cent for developing Asia and the Pacific in the 2012" and an accelerated 7.3 percent growth in 2013.
</p><p>He said Asia and Pacific region would maintain its growth momentum despite issues elsewhere in the world and emphasised the need to make growth in the region more inclusive.
</p><p>Kuroda was addressing the media at the 45th Annual Meeting of the ADB here.
</p><p>However, "the very drivers of Asia's economic success -- new technology, globalisation and market-oriented reforms -- have also served to create and increase disparities within and among Asian economies,"  he cautioned.
</p><p>He suggested remedies through investment in  education to reduce inequality in human capital, infrastructure investments to makes services and opportunities accessible to all and measures to make growth more employment friendly.
</p><p>Kuroda said inclusive growth will be another key focus of this year's annual meeting.</p>

</p><p>ADB President Haruhiko Kuroda said the Asian Development Outlook (ADO) forecasts a "healthy GDP of 6.9 per cent for developing Asia and the Pacific in the 2012" and an accelerated 7.3 percent growth in 2013.
</p><p>He said Asia and Pacific region would maintain its growth momentum despite issues elsewhere in the world and emphasised the need to make growth in the region more inclusive.
</p><p>Kuroda was addressing the media at the 45th Annual Meeting of the ADB here.
</p><p>However, "the very drivers of Asia's economic success -- new technology, globalisation and market-oriented reforms -- have also served to create and increase disparities within and among Asian economies,"  he cautioned.
</p><p>He suggested remedies through investment in  education to reduce inequality in human capital, infrastructure investments to makes services and opportunities accessible to all and measures to make growth more employment friendly.
</p><p>Kuroda said inclusive growth will be another key focus of this year's annual meeting.</p> <ul><li><ins>Tags: </ins></li><li><ins><a href="http://archive.indianexpress.com/gsearch.php?q=Asian%20Development%20Bank">Asian Development Bank Link: http://archive.indianexpress.com/gsearch.php?q=Asian%20Development%20Bank </a></ins></li><ins> </ins><li><ins><a href="http://archive.indianexpress.com/gsearch.php?q=%20Asia%20Pacific%20region">Asia Pacific region Link: http://archive.indianexpress.com/gsearch.php?q=%20Asia%20Pacific%20region </a></ins></li><ins> </ins><li><ins><a href="http://archive.indianexpress.com/gsearch.php?q=%20ADB%20forecasts">ADB forecasts Link: http://archive.indianexpress.com/gsearch.php?q=%20ADB%20forecasts </a></ins></li></ul><ins> </ins><h3><ins>ALSO READ</ins></h3> <p class="fb-like"><del></del></p><del> </del><p><del></del></p><del> </del><h3><del>ALSO READ</del></h3><del><img src="http://static.indianexpress.com/t-images/T_Id_456345_Edelweiss.jpg" alt="Edelweiss executives during a press conference in New Delhi." width="150" height="100"></del> <p class="moreindiabox"><a href="http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/edelweiss-to-raise-up-to-rs-500-cr-via-debentures/1217321/">Edelweiss to raise up to Rs 500 cr via debentures</a></p> <span class="tnc">Please read our <span href="">terms of use</span> before posting comments</span> <p id="Message" class="termstoolbox">TERMS OF USE: The views expressed in comments published on <a href="http://indianexpress.com">indianexpress.com</a> are those of the comment writer's alone.

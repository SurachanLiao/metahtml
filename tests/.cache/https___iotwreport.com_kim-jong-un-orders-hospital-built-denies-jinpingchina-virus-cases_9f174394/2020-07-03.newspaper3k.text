Breitbart: North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un called for the construction of “modern general hospital” this week to “better protect the precious health and safety of our people,” despite the fact his country denies having any cases of Chinese coronavirus.

According to state propaganda outlet Rodung Sinmun, Kim visited the hospital construction site in Pyongyang on Tuesday, where he delivered a speech entitled “Let Us Build the Pyongyang General Hospital in an Excellent Way, Greeting the 75th Founding Anniversary of the Workers’ Party of Korea.” Kim’s presence in the capital was notable as reports surfaced that he had taken to hiding in Wonsan, a coastal resort town, out of fear of contracting the coronavirus himself. more

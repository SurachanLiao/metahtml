Last evening, publisher Nexon and developer NAT Games held a &#8220;Premium Showcase&#8221; media event to announce more game details and its launch schedule. We have talked about most of the features prior, and some of them have been re-emphasized during the event. We will be brief with this, so read on! &#8230; <a href="https://www.make-money-online-resources.com/2019/09/key-highlights-from-premier-showcase-media-event/" class="more-link">[Read more...] <span class="screen-reader-text">about &#8211; Key highlights from Premier Showcase media event</span></a></p></article><article class="post-31412859 post type-post status-publish format-standard entry"><p>4Story was once a much-hyped fantasy PC MMORPG which had quite a sizable community, but like most Free-to-Play titles its popularity waned over the years. The English server is still running though, now under Gameforge. But that is not the game we are talking about here, as its developer Zemi Interactive recently announced&#8230; well, you guessed it, a mobile version of the MMORPG! Titled 4Story: Age of Heroes, it is an action RPG where players hunt solo until unlocking multiplayer modes such as real-time PVP and real-time boss raids. &#8230; <a href="https://www.make-money-online-resources.com/2019/09/classic-pc-mmorpg-prepares-for-mobile-platform-launch/" class="more-link">[Read more...] <span class="screen-reader-text">about &#8211; Classic PC MMORPG prepares for mobile platform launch</span></a></p></article><article class="post-31412889 post type-post status-publish format-standard entry"><p>answered them in a video. What was of great interest was further details about the &#8220;Mordor Besieged&#8221; realm, which Snook said will take players on a time travel trip to the Second Age and the last time Mordor got trounced by the Free Peoples. Here&#8217;s a fun twist: You&#8217;ll be able to store all of the loot you get in the Second Age part and then dig it up to keep on your main character! &#8230; <a href="https://www.make-money-online-resources.com/2019/09/lotro-minas-morgul-will-take-you-back-in-time-to-the-second-age/" class="more-link">[Read more...] <span class="screen-reader-text">about LOTRO: Minas Morgul will take you back in time to the Second Age</span></a></p></article><article class="post-31412883 post type-post status-publish format-standard entry"><p>The third Pizza Connection game also got the worst reviews. I don&#8217;t know why yet, because I haven&#8217;t encountered any bugs and have found the game reasonably difficult to play. But since I am completely new to the franchise, maybe that&#8217;s why I don&#8217;t see what&#8217;s wrong with it. A lot of reviews seem to compare the game to its predecessors. &#8230; <a href="https://www.make-money-online-resources.com/2019/09/screenshot-saturday-pizza-connection-3/" class="more-link">[Read more...] <span class="screen-reader-text">about Screenshot Saturday: Pizza Connection 3</span></a></p></article><article class="post-31412880 post type-post status-publish format-standard entry"><p>Be in it to win it every Sunday with WSOP&#8217;s incredible Standout Schedule.

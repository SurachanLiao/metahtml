<div><p>On 11 May 2018, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the Supreme leader of Iran, posted a picture of himself reading a Persian translation of Michael Wolff&#8217;s <i>Fire and Fury</i> &#8212; a famously damaging account of the first year of the Trump presidency:</p>

<p>Foreign leaders reading copies of the book have, in the past, been <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/kim-jong-un-reading-fire-fury/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fabricated</a>. This photograph, however, is apparently authentic. The pictures, according to both the Ayatollah&#8217;s <a href="http://archive.is/w88aM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">web site</a> and the <a href="http://www.tehrantimes.com/news/423440/Leader-visits-Tehran-Intl-Book-Fair" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tehran Times</a>, come from the leader&#8217;s visit to the 31st International Book Fair of Tehran on 11 May 2018:</p>
<blockquote><p>Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance Abbas Salehi and a number of his colleagues accompanied the Leader during the visit, which lasted for an hour and a half.</p>
<p>He had brief chats with representatives of publishers, who also talked about their concerns for the business. They also briefed the Leader about their latest offerings.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Instagram account is the official one used by Khamenei, and the image shared on Instagram also appears on the official government <a href="http://archive.is/LSR77" target="_blank" rel="noopener">web site</a>&#160;of the Ayatollah.</p>

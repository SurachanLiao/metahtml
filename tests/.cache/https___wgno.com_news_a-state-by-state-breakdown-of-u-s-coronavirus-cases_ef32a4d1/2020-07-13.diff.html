Three other cases of the virus are people who were repatriated from China.</p> <p>Still, officials insist that even if the number of cases continues to climb, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/01/health/coronavirus-symptoms-treatment/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">there is no need to panic</a>.</p> <p>“The risk to the American people of the coronavirus remains low, according to all of the experts that we are working with across the government,” Vice President Mike Pence said in a Tuesday news conference.</p> <p>Here are the cases in each state:</p> <h3>Washington state: 27</h3> <p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/02/health/us-coronavirus-cases-monday/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nine people have died in Washington state</a>— at least five of whom were in a long-term nursing facility in a suburb of Seattle.</p> <p>At least 50 residents and staff members of the center were experiencing symptoms and were tested for the virus, King County health officer Jeffrey Duchin said Monday.</p> <h3>California: 27</h3> <p>California’s number of cases rose to 27 Tuesday, according to health officials, with Placer County and Contra Costa County each reporting a case.</p> <p>The Contra Costa County patient was in critical condition Tuesday and under medical isolation, county health officials said in a news conference.</p> <p>The patient, they said, had underlying health conditions and is completely separated from the public at a hospital within the county. The source of transmission is under investigation, but the patient had no known travel history nor contact with any confirmed cases, officials said.</p> <p>About half of the state’s cases are travel-related and at least four are from an unknown origin, the <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/ncov2019.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">California Department of Public Health said</a>earlier this week.</p> <p>The country’s first case of unknown origin was a patient admitted to UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento in February who was tested days later as they didn’t fit existing CDC testing guidelines.</p> <p>The case prompted testing guidelines from the CDC, broadening who should be tested for the virus.</p> <h3>North Carolina: 1</h3> <p>A North Carolina person tested presumptive positive for the virus after visiting a Washington state facility with a coronavirus outbreak, officials said Tuesday.</p> <p>The Wake County resident is in isolation at home, a news release from the North Carolina Governor’s Office said.</p> <p>“Our task force and state agencies are working closely with local health departments, health care providers and others to quickly identify and respond to cases that might occur,” North Carolina Gov.

Health officials do not consider the separate school building to pose any risk of exposure.”</p> <h3>Illinois: 4</h3> <p>A woman in her 70s was identified as the fourth coronavirus case in Illinois. The patient is also the spouse of the state’s third case, a man in his 70s, a statement from the Illinois Department of Public Health and Cook County Department of Public Health says.</p> <p>Both are reported to be in good condition. The woman is quarantined at home and complying with guidance, the statement says.</p> <p>The state’s <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/07/us/illinois-coronavirus-patients-discharge/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previous two cases have both fully recovered</a>.</p> <h3>Massachusetts: 2</h3> <p>Officials have announced the second case in Massachusetts, a woman in her 20s who recently traveled to Italy on a school trip.</p> <p>The woman did not show any symptoms, a news release from the state’s <a href="https://www.mass.gov/news/first-presumptive-positive-case-of-covid-19-identified-by-massachusetts-state-public-health" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Department of Public Health said</a>.</p> <p>The patient is the state’s first presumptive positive case — yet to be confirmed by the CDC. In January, Massachusetts confirmed a man in his 20s living in Boston was carrying the virus.</p> <p>The man had recently traveled to Wuhan, China, and sought medical help after his return, the department said. He remained in isolation while he was recovering.</p> <h3>Florida: 3</h3> <p>Two people <a href="https://www.cnn.com/asia/live-news/coronavirus-outbreak-03-02-20-intl-hnk/h_a9552a4d65d739a3b0cc7129b933cb52" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tested positive in Florida</a>, the state’s governor said, citing the CDC, and the state’s department of health announced a third case was presumptive positive.</p> <p>The first is a man in his 60s who has pneumonia and is hospitalized in stable condition. It’s unknown how the man contracted the virus but he has been in isolation and will remain there until he is cleared by health officials, state Surgeon General Dr. Scott Rivkees said in<a href="http://www.floridahealth.gov/newsroom/2020/03/030120-two-presumptive-positive-covid19-cases.pr.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a statement.</a></p> <p>The second patient, a woman in her 20s, recently returned from northern Italy.

Brian Kemp announced Monday night <a href="https://www.cnn.com/asia/live-news/coronavirus-outbreak-03-03-20-intl-hnk/h_c1c65875642e464684b075e94673fdc0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the state’s first two confirmed cases of the virus</a>, saying both patients are residents of the same household in Fulton County, the state’s most populous county.</p> <p>One of the two returned from Milan, Italy, through Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, state officials said.</p> <p>The patients were in isolation “with minimal symptoms” and were never hospitalized, Georgia Department of Public Health Commissioner Kathleen Toomey said in the news conference.</p> <p>Kemp told residents to be cautious if they start experiencing potential symptoms.</p> <p>“If you start feeling bad, don’t go out,” he said. “Call your doctor.”</p> <p>Officials did not give the patients’ ages.</p> <h3>Rhode Island: 2</h3> <p>Rhode Island reported its first two presumptive positive cases from a group of patients who had recently traveled to Europe together. A third person is being tested, the State of Rhode Island Department of Public Health said.</p> <p>The first two presumptive positive cases are a man in his 40s and a teenager, the department said. The person being tested is in her 30s.</p> <p>The three were on a school trip, the department said, adding it was monitoring all 38 people who went on that same trip.</p> <p>“They have been instructed to not go to school or work and to remain at home for these 14 days,” the department said in a news release.</p> <h3>New York: 2</h3> <p>New York has two cases: a 39-year-old health care worker who recently returned from Iran and a man in New Rochelle who works in Manhattan, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said. The woman is in home isolation with her husband, and the New Rochelle man is ill in the hospital, the governor said.</p> <p>Disease detectives have identified the woman’s close contacts, while they are still investigating the man’s travel, which included no trips to China or any other country on the watch list, he said.</p> <p>“We’re tracing that back now, but he did test positive and there’s no apparent connection so it would be what we call a community spread case,” Cuomo said.</p> <p>Cuomo said the goal was to “test as many as you can” and isolate anyone who tests positive to reduce the spread.</p> <p>“We will have more cases, we will have community spread. That is inevitable,” Cuomo said.</p> <h3>Arizona: 2</h3> <p>One patient identified to have coronavirus “has recovered and is no longer infected with the disease,” state Department of Health Services Director Dr. Cara Christ said Monday.</p> <p>In Maricopa County, authorities said a man in his 20s has presumptively tested positive.

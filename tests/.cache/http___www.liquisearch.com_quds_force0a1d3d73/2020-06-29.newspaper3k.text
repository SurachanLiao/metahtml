The Quds Force (alternatively spelled Ghods or Qods) (Persian: نیروی قدس‎, translit. Niru-ye Qods, "Jerusalem Force") is a special unit of Iran's Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution (Revolutionary Guard). It has been tasked with "exporting" Iran's Islamic revolution, and is responsible for "extraterritorial operations" of the Revolutionary Guard.

The Quds Force reports directly to the Supreme Leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Its commander is Major General Qassem Suleimani. While "little is reliably known" about the force, as of 2007, its size was estimated at 15,000 troops.

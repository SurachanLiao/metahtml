											<p>Last week,&#160; Kim Jong Nam, better known as Kim Jong-un&#8217;s estranged half -brother, was attacked and poisoned with a mysterious substance at an airport in Malaysia. Earlier today, video of the incident obtained via security cameras was released to the public.</p>

<p>Per the video below, posted this afternoon on&#160;NBC News, we see Kim&#160;walking leisurely through the airport before a woman &#8212; believed to be a North Korean agent &#8212; accosts him from behind and wipes a cloth across his face before fleeing the scene. From start to finish, the entire attack was over in just five seconds.</p>
<p>Shortly thereafter, Kim approached&#160;airport security to discuss what happened and to ask for assistance. Unfortunately, Kim ultimately passed away before he could even reach the hospital.</p>
 
					
				

	 
		
			
				

<p>The video capturing the chain of events is rather harrowing.</p>
 
							
							
							
							
							
							
							
							
							
							
							
							
							
							
							
							
					
		
				
		
		 
		
<p>Predictably, Kim&#8217;s murder has become an extremely volatile political and diplomatic incident.</p>
<p>&#8220;Malaysia has recalled its ambassador from Pyongyang for consultations,&#8221; <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/kim-jong-nam-murder-video-shows-moment-kim-jong-un-n723236" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">NBC News notes</a>, &#8220;and summoned the North Korean ambassador in the country to explain the allegations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, North Korea is accusing Malaysia of working with South Korea in an effort to paint North Korea in a bad light.</p>
<p>&#8220;The investigation by the Malaysian police is not for the clarification of the cause of the death and search for the suspect,&#8221; a North Korean official said, &#8220;but it is out of the political aim.&#8221;</p>
<p>The motive behind the attack remains unclear, but reports indicate that Kimg Jong-un became aware of his half-brother&#8217;s intent to defect from North&#160;Korea and decided to take lethal action.</p>
<p>Since the video became public, four individuals believed to be involved in the attack have been apprehended. It&#8217;s also been suggested that the female attacker may have actually been a man in disguise.</p>
<p>As for the substance of the poison used in the attack, it&#8217;s believed that the cloth rubbed across Kim&#8217;s face may have been laced with&#160;&#8220;either ricin or deadly puffer fish toxins.&#8221;</p>																						<p class="entry-tags">

Treatment outcomes for severe mental illnesses, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or major depression, are equal to or better than those achieved in physical health. Treatment approaches that are tailored to a patientâ€™s substance abuse patterns and any co-occurring medical, psychiatric and social problems can lead to sustained recovery. The bottom line is that treatment works and people can recover to live fulfilling lives despite the experience of addiction or mental illness.

OhioMHAS supports access to treatment options that we know are effective, while also balancing efforts toward prevention and recovery supports so we can help people in recovery remain healthy and productive. Integration of behavioral and physical health care is essential for better individual outcomes and to achieve lower health care costs.

        Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton told Breitbart News Tonight that he will continue to battle the progressive attempts to force mail-in voting, stressing that vote-by-mail is the “most likely place for fraud” and noting that Democrats hope to loosen voting rules in the Lone Star State to turn it blue.Paxton discussed the Democrats’ increased calls for vote-by-mail, describing the situation in Texas as “really simple.”“The law doesn’t allow for mail-in ballots in the cases that this judge ruled that they should be allowed,”

        Al Gore’s eyebrows say it all. 77-year-old Joe Biden once again forgot what he was saying as he attacked President Trump from his Delaware basement. Biden was talking to Climate Change charlatan Al Gore during a virtual town hall when he stumbled over his words and had to regroup.You can see the confusion on Al Gore’s face as Biden babbled about non-existent “climate change.”WATCH: (Tweet/Video)

        Joe Biden’s presidential campaign spent nearly $11,000 on gourmet ice cream that is also a favorite of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's.The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee’s campaign spent $10,600 on Jeni’s Splendid Ice Creams between May 2019 and March 2020. The ice cream was listed as donor gifts, according to Federal Election Committee data.Pelosi has taken a lot of heat since last week when she joined James Corden on his late-night comedy show and showcased her freezer packed with ice cream. Among the selection were pints of Jeni’s Splendid."I don't know what I would've done if ice cream were not invented,"

        The long goodbye.Like with many people around the country, the nationwide lockdown threatened to prevent a Texas woman from visiting her dying father before he succumbed to the coronavirus. Fortunately, Abby Adair Reinhard was able to bid her elderly dad farewell in a touching way: by talking to him on the phone for more than 30 hours until his death, which she chronicled in a heartbreaking Facebook post in early April. “It feels so good to laugh and cry,” wrote Reinhard of speaking with her 76-year-old father, Don Adair, for the last time.

        Get behind me, Satan! (Photo) Last Thursday the PPP Loan program ran out of money. The $349 billion allotted to the program to save small businesses had already been distributed. At least 20,000 business applications went unprocessed on Thursday and Friday. Last Tuesday, eight days ago on April 14th, Speaker Pelosi went on late night television and congratulated Senate Democrats for blocking the crucial funding to small business owners in America.Pelosi made the comments on MSNBC.  Nancy Pelosi: “They [Republicans] asked for a quarter of a trillion dollars in 48 hours. I said, ‘I don’t think so.’… This all happened on the senate side and I congratulated Senate Democrats.”

        Gov. Andrew Cuomo said he pressed President Trump on testing during a “productive” Oval Office meeting on Tuesday afternoon, just days after they had an enormous row on Twitter and national television.Cuomo also told the president during the White House visit that New York no longer needed the USNS Comfort to treat COVID-19 infected patients, offering to deploy it to another hard-hit state.Trump confirmed later Tuesday that the ship would be headed back to its base in Virginia in preparation to be sent to another state — just weeks after it arrived in New York.

But I can answer his question.Mr. Lemon reportedly directed his question to armed protesters who, despite the nation’s lockdown and stay-at-home orders, had gone public to demand their constitutional rights to assemble, to lodge their grievances with their government and to arm themselves. That would be the First and Second Amendments, respectively.

        Not since Lazarus has the world heard of such an unbelievable rise.On Monday, CNN posted video of pseudo-newsman Chris Cuomo “finally” emerging from self-quarantine in his Southampton basement — despite Cuomo having been out and about in East Hampton just last week, getting into a fight with a “jackass loser fat-tire biker” who dared to ask why an infected Cuomo was breaking quarantine. Without a face mask.“Who the hell are you?” Cuomo replied. “I can do what I want.”Yes: If we’ve learned anything about Chris Cuomo these past three weeks, it’s that he’s an insecure, self-important, entitled blowhard

        It’s a question worth pondering, and one that entered my mind after seeing two recent examples of “journalism” that we’ll get to shortly.The preponderance of the legacy media, and many in right-wing media as well, insist on the importance of outlets like The New York Times, CNN, and NPR. We are constantly told that they play a vital role in our society, one whose absence would cause our entire system to collapse into tyranny. But is that assumption reality? I’m growing more and more skeptical every day.I’ve previously been one to shy away from President Trump’s “enemy of the people” language, but perhaps I’ve been too kind?

        Republicans seem mostly supportive of President Donald Trump’s announcement that he would temporarily suspend legal immigration into the United States to protect Americans from the coronavirus and a flooded job market when more than 22 million workers are unemployed. Details about the expected executive order are not clear, but despite Democrats slamming Trump for dismissing the contributions of some foreign workers, Bloomberg News reported it obtained a draft of the order, which includes exceptions for people working directly in the supply chain and also those working in health care or as medical research professionals.In the same Bloomberg article,

        Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democrat presidential nominee, said he would undoubtedly select former first lady Michelle Obama to be his running mate, though he admitted she likely does not want to jump back into politics anytime soon. “I’d take her in a heartbeat,” Biden said in a Monday interview with CBS Pittsburgh when asked if he would add Obama to the ticket. “She’s brilliant. She knows the way around. She is a really fine woman. The Obamas are great friends.”

        Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer compared the COVID-19 battle to World War II and asked:
“In World War II, there weren’t people lining up at the capitol to protest the fact that they had to drop everything they were doing and build planes or tanks, or to ration food.”

Does anyone want to tell Whitmer the difference is during the war effort people were working and getting paid; but under her unilateral decrees people are forbidden from working and no-one is earning a living…. Which is the entire reason for the protests, DUH.

        A malaria drug widely touted by President Donald Trump for treating the new coronavirus showed no benefit in a large analysis of its use in U.S. veterans hospitals. There were more deaths among those given hydroxychloroquine versus standard care, researchers reported.

        Wednesday, former Secretary of State John Kerry called into question President Donald Trump’s leadership during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

Instead of leading, Kerry suggested on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” that Trump is “playing out an election strategy” and “attacking governors” and members of the media in a way he said he has never seen by a president.

“Look, the truth is, and everybody in America, I think, is beginning to come to understand that this president is not leading now, he’s playing out an election strategy,” Kerry stated. “He’s more focused on getting the economy moving before all the experts say you ought to be putting people back together in close quarters again

        Former President Bill Clinton signed an order preventing the CIA from organizing a kill operation against al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, according to a new documentary.

The revelation is discussed by former CIA station chief Bob Grenier in the new Showtime documentary The Longest War, which was released Tuesday. Grenier, who was based in Islamabad, Pakistan, explained that the agency was permitted to engage in “lethal activity” against the terrorist leader but could not perform a strike with the explicit purpose of killing him.

“We were being asked to remove this threat to the United States essentially with one hand tied behind our backs,”

        A meat-processing company which shut down a South Dakota plant after more than 700 employees became infected with COVID-19 said the outbreak was due to the factory’s ‘large immigrant population’. Smithfield Foods blamed the migrant workers' ‘living circumstances’ that are ‘different than they are with your traditional American family.’ The company said the indefinite closure of the pork plant in Sioux Falls disrupted its supply chain, forcing the closure of a facility in Martin City, Missouri. Smithfield also shuttered a plant in Cudahy, Wisconsin, after employees tested positive for the virus. South Dakota's governor said the temporary closure of the plant

        CNN political commentator Van Jones said Tuesday that the decision by some states to ease stay-at-home restrictions and open businesses is effectively "a death sentence for communities of color," which have been disproportionately affected by the novel coronavirus. His comments follow Republican Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp's announcement that some businesses in the state would be able to reopen as early as Friday, as other state leaders signaled similar plans. "I think it's incredibly reckless. And, you know, signing these orders is signing a death certificate for many, many, many people who do not need to die and who will," Jones

        The United Nations warned the coronavirus pandemic could trigger famine as the worldwide freeze on commerce sent shock waves through financial markets.
The bleak warning came on Tuesday as deaths from the virus surpassed 174,000 worldwide, with governments anxiously trying to chart a path out of the unprecedented global health and economic emergency. One World Food Programme director warned 'widespread famines of biblical proportions' could force millions in already vulnerable countries into starvation due to the global crisis. The economic impact of the pandemic could lead to a 'humanitarian catastrophe,' with the number of people suffering from acute hunger projected to nearly double

        Michael Moore is worried about Earth, although he’s not focused on fossil fuel and cow farts. Instead, he’s worried because he just discovered that green energy is a scam. That’s the point in his new documentary, “Planet of the Humans,” which was released Tuesday for free on YouTube. In a long and poorly written introduction on the YouTube page, the people who made the video explain that the green revolution could have worked out if only the whole movement hadn't sold itself out to the rich and powerful, resulting in a sham and a scam.

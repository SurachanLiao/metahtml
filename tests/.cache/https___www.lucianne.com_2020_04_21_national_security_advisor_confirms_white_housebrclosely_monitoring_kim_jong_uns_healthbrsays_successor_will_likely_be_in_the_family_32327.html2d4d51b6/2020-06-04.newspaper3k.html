        A Democratic Georgia state lawmaker has many wondering if he is going to #WalkAway from his party after his abrupt decision to step down.Georgia state Rep. Vernon Jones announced Wednesday that he has &#8220;left the plantation&#8221; and would not be completing his term, making the surprising statement just more than a week after declaring that he was endorsing President Donald Trump.(Video) &#8220;I&#8217;m sick and tired of me and my family being attacked and harassed by the Democrat Party for putting my country before my party,&#8221; Jones said in a statement to CBS 46 in Atlanta.&#8220;I take pride in being an independent thinker.

        Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton told Breitbart News Tonight that he will continue to battle the progressive attempts to force mail-in voting, stressing that vote-by-mail is the &#8220;most likely place for fraud&#8221; and noting that Democrats hope to loosen voting rules in the Lone Star State to turn it blue.Paxton discussed the Democrats&#8217; increased calls for vote-by-mail, describing the situation in Texas as &#8220;really simple.&#8221;&#8220;The law doesn&#8217;t allow for mail-in ballots in the cases that this judge ruled that they should be allowed,&#8221;

        Al Gore&#8217;s eyebrows say it all. 77-year-old Joe Biden once again forgot what he was saying as he attacked President Trump from his Delaware basement. Biden was talking to Climate Change charlatan Al Gore during a virtual town hall when he stumbled over his words and had to regroup.You can see the confusion on Al Gore&#8217;s face as Biden babbled about non-existent &#8220;climate change.&#8221;WATCH: (Tweet/Video)

        Joe Biden&#8217;s presidential campaign spent nearly $11,000 on gourmet ice cream that is also a favorite of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's.The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee&#8217;s campaign spent $10,600 on Jeni&#8217;s Splendid Ice Creams between May 2019 and March 2020. The ice cream was listed as donor gifts, according to Federal Election Committee data.Pelosi has taken a lot of heat since last week when she joined James Corden on his late-night comedy show and showcased her freezer packed with ice cream. Among the selection were pints of Jeni&#8217;s Splendid."I don't know what I would've done if ice cream were not invented,"

        The long goodbye.Like with many people around the country, the nationwide lockdown threatened to prevent a Texas woman from visiting her dying father before he succumbed to the coronavirus. Fortunately, Abby Adair Reinhard was able to bid her elderly dad farewell in a touching way: by talking to him on the phone for more than 30 hours until his death, which she chronicled in a heartbreaking Facebook post in early April. &#8220;It feels so good to laugh and cry,&#8221; wrote Reinhard of speaking with her 76-year-old father, Don Adair, for the last time.

        Get behind me, Satan! (Photo) Last Thursday the PPP Loan program ran out of money. The $349 billion allotted to the program to save small businesses had already been distributed. At least 20,000 business applications went unprocessed on Thursday and Friday. Last Tuesday, eight days ago on April 14th, Speaker Pelosi went on late night television and congratulated Senate Democrats for blocking the crucial funding to small business owners in America.Pelosi made the comments on MSNBC.  Nancy Pelosi: &#8220;They [Republicans] asked for a quarter of a trillion dollars in 48 hours.

        Gov. Andrew Cuomo said he pressed President Trump on testing during a &#8220;productive&#8221; Oval Office meeting on Tuesday afternoon, just days after they had an enormous row on Twitter and national television.Cuomo also told the president during the White House visit that New York no longer needed the USNS Comfort to treat COVID-19 infected patients, offering to deploy it to another hard-hit state.Trump confirmed later Tuesday that the ship would be headed back to its base in Virginia in preparation to be sent to another state &#8212; just weeks after it arrived in New York.

        God bless the media. Without it, I wouldn&#8217;t have known that CNN&#8217;s Don Lemon indignantly demands to know, &#8220;Who the hell do you think you are?!&#8221; Yours truly has only a vague sense of who Don Lemon is and has never in my memory seen his program on TV or him in the supermarket or anywhere else. But I can answer his question.Mr. Lemon reportedly directed his question to armed protesters who, despite the nation&#8217;s lockdown and stay-at-home orders, had gone public to demand their constitutional rights to assemble, to lodge their grievances with their government and to arm themselves. That would be the First and Second Amendments, respectively.

        It&#8217;s a question worth pondering, and one that entered my mind after seeing two recent examples of &#8220;journalism&#8221; that we&#8217;ll get to shortly.The preponderance of the legacy media, and many in right-wing media as well, insist on the importance of outlets like The New York Times, CNN, and NPR. We are constantly told that they play a vital role in our society, one whose absence would cause our entire system to collapse into tyranny. But is that assumption reality? I&#8217;m growing more and more skeptical every day.I&#8217;ve previously been one to shy away from President Trump&#8217;s &#8220;enemy of the people&#8221; language, but perhaps I&#8217;ve been too kind?

        Republicans seem mostly supportive of President Donald Trump&#8217;s announcement that he would temporarily suspend legal immigration into the United States to protect Americans from the coronavirus and a flooded job market when more than 22 million workers are unemployed. Details about the expected executive order are not clear, but despite Democrats slamming Trump for dismissing the contributions of some foreign workers, Bloomberg News reported it obtained a draft of the order, which includes exceptions for people working directly in the supply chain and also those working in health care or as medical research professionals.In the same Bloomberg article,

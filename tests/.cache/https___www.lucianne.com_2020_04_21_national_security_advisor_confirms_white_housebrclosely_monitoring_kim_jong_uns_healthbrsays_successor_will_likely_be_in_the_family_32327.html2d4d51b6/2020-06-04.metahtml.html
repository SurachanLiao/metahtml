        A Democratic Georgia state lawmaker has many wondering if he is going to #WalkAway from his party after his abrupt decision to step down.Georgia state Rep. Vernon Jones announced Wednesday that he has &#8220;left the plantation&#8221; and would not be completing his term, making the surprising statement just more than a week after declaring that he was endorsing President Donald Trump.(Video) &#8220;I&#8217;m sick and tired of me and my family being attacked and harassed by the Democrat Party for putting my country before my party,&#8221; Jones said in a statement to CBS 46 in Atlanta.&#8220;I take pride in being an independent thinker.

        The long goodbye.Like with many people around the country, the nationwide lockdown threatened to prevent a Texas woman from visiting her dying father before he succumbed to the coronavirus. Fortunately, Abby Adair Reinhard was able to bid her elderly dad farewell in a touching way: by talking to him on the phone for more than 30 hours until his death, which she chronicled in a heartbreaking Facebook post in early April. &#8220;It feels so good to laugh and cry,&#8221; wrote Reinhard of speaking with her 76-year-old father, Don Adair, for the last time.

        Get behind me, Satan! (Photo) Last Thursday the PPP Loan program ran out of money. The $349 billion allotted to the program to save small businesses had already been distributed. At least 20,000 business applications went unprocessed on Thursday and Friday. Last Tuesday, eight days ago on April 14th, Speaker Pelosi went on late night television and congratulated Senate Democrats for blocking the crucial funding to small business owners in America.Pelosi made the comments on MSNBC.  Nancy Pelosi: &#8220;They [Republicans] asked for a quarter of a trillion dollars in 48 hours.

        God bless the media. Without it, I wouldn&#8217;t have known that CNN&#8217;s Don Lemon indignantly demands to know, &#8220;Who the hell do you think you are?!&#8221; Yours truly has only a vague sense of who Don Lemon is and has never in my memory seen his program on TV or him in the supermarket or anywhere else. But I can answer his question.Mr. Lemon reportedly directed his question to armed protesters who, despite the nation&#8217;s lockdown and stay-at-home orders, had gone public to demand their constitutional rights to assemble, to lodge their grievances with their government and to arm themselves. That would be the First and Second Amendments, respectively.

        Not since Lazarus has the world heard of such an unbelievable rise.On Monday, CNN posted video of pseudo-newsman Chris Cuomo &#8220;finally&#8221; emerging from self-quarantine in his Southampton basement &#8212; despite Cuomo having been out and about in East Hampton just last week, getting into a fight with a &#8220;jackass loser fat-tire biker&#8221; who dared to ask why an infected Cuomo was breaking quarantine.

        It&#8217;s a question worth pondering, and one that entered my mind after seeing two recent examples of &#8220;journalism&#8221; that we&#8217;ll get to shortly.The preponderance of the legacy media, and many in right-wing media as well, insist on the importance of outlets like The New York Times, CNN, and NPR. We are constantly told that they play a vital role in our society, one whose absence would cause our entire system to collapse into tyranny. But is that assumption reality? I&#8217;m growing more and more skeptical every day.I&#8217;ve previously been one to shy away from President Trump&#8217;s &#8220;enemy of the people&#8221; language, but perhaps I&#8217;ve been too kind?

        Republicans seem mostly supportive of President Donald Trump&#8217;s announcement that he would temporarily suspend legal immigration into the United States to protect Americans from the coronavirus and a flooded job market when more than 22 million workers are unemployed. Details about the expected executive order are not clear, but despite Democrats slamming Trump for dismissing the contributions of some foreign workers, Bloomberg News reported it obtained a draft of the order, which includes exceptions for people working directly in the supply chain and also those working in health care or as medical research professionals.In the same Bloomberg article,

        Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer compared the COVID-19 battle to World War II and asked:
&#8220;In World War II, there weren&#8217;t people lining up at the capitol to protest the fact that they had to drop everything they were doing and build planes or tanks, or to ration food.&#8221;

Does anyone want to tell Whitmer the difference is during the war effort people were working and getting paid; but under her unilateral decrees people are forbidden from working and no-one is earning a living&#8230;. Which is the entire reason for the protests, DUH.

        Wednesday, former Secretary of State John Kerry called into question President Donald Trump&#8217;s leadership during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

Instead of leading, Kerry suggested on MSNBC&#8217;s &#8220;Morning Joe&#8221; that Trump is &#8220;playing out an election strategy&#8221; and &#8220;attacking governors&#8221; and members of the media in a way he said he has never seen by a president.

&#8220;Look, the truth is, and everybody in America, I think, is beginning to come to understand that this president is not leading now, he&#8217;s playing out an election strategy,&#8221; Kerry stated. &#8220;He&#8217;s more focused on getting the economy moving before all the experts say you ought to be putting people back together in close quarters again

        Former President Bill Clinton signed an order preventing the CIA from organizing a kill operation against al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, according to a new documentary.

The revelation is discussed by former CIA station chief Bob Grenier in the new Showtime documentary The Longest War, which was released Tuesday. Grenier, who was based in Islamabad, Pakistan, explained that the agency was permitted to engage in &#8220;lethal activity&#8221; against the terrorist leader but could not perform a strike with the explicit purpose of killing him.

&#8220;We were being asked to remove this threat to the United States essentially with one hand tied behind our backs,&#8221;

Smithfield Foods blamed the migrant workers' &#8216;living circumstances&#8217; that are &#8216;different than they are with your traditional American family.&#8217; The company said the indefinite closure of the pork plant in Sioux Falls disrupted its supply chain, forcing the closure of a facility in Martin City, Missouri.

        CNN political commentator Van Jones said Tuesday that the decision by some states to ease stay-at-home restrictions and open businesses is effectively "a death sentence for communities of color," which have been disproportionately affected by the novel coronavirus. His comments follow Republican Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp's announcement that some businesses in the state would be able to reopen as early as Friday, as other state leaders signaled similar plans. "I think it's incredibly reckless. And, you know, signing these orders is signing a death certificate for many, many, many people who do not need to die and who will," Jones

        The United Nations warned the coronavirus pandemic could trigger famine as the worldwide freeze on commerce sent shock waves through financial markets.
The bleak warning came on Tuesday as deaths from the virus surpassed 174,000 worldwide, with governments anxiously trying to chart a path out of the unprecedented global health and economic emergency. One World Food Programme director warned 'widespread famines of biblical proportions' could force millions in already vulnerable countries into starvation due to the global crisis. The economic impact of the pandemic could lead to a 'humanitarian catastrophe,' with the number of people suffering from acute hunger projected to nearly double

        Michael Moore is worried about Earth, although he&#8217;s not focused on fossil fuel and cow farts. Instead, he&#8217;s worried because he just discovered that green energy is a scam. That&#8217;s the point in his new documentary, &#8220;Planet of the Humans,&#8221; which was released Tuesday for free on YouTube. In a long and poorly written introduction on the YouTube page, the people who made the video explain that the green revolution could have worked out if only the whole movement hadn't sold itself out to the rich and powerful, resulting in a sham and a scam.

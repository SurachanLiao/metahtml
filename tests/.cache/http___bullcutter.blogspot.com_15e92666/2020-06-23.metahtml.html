about a rich country that had a strong army to defend itself with,
that dissolves that army and disarms it. What do you think will
happen when another country that wants what they have discover they

Trash it, and kill its people with no opposition. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>We&#8217;re
looking at a similar situation with the cops. They are the only real

our property and money, and lord it over us. To defund or disband the
cops is folly because it is an engraved invitation to the bad guys to
come after us because there will be nobody to oppose them, since the
government has taken away a lot of our guns and made us wonder what
would happen if we used then guns we have to defend ourselves. Would
they charge us with a crime for defending ourselves? </span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>The

</h3>

 


<p class="western">
<span><span>It really amazes me how many stupid people there are out
there, and how many of them have the money to push lawmakers (who
don&#8217;t require much pushing) into making laws that are USELESS for
reducing gun violence, but actually cost many people their lives
through not being able to defend themselves against ILLEGALLY armed
criminals and crazies. They&#8217;re aware of this, but they keep pushing
these INSANE gun laws that keep getting passed by ignorant
legislators. You don&#8217;t defend yourself by DISARMING yourself. And
keeping honest people (who obey laws) disarmed in the face of the
ease with which criminals (who don&#8217;t obey laws) get their guns is
criminal in itself, and CONTRIBUTES to gun violence. This is REALITY.
But these fools ignore it. Gun control, the way it is now known,
KILLS more people than do ILLEGAL guns in the hands of criminals, by
itself. I can&#8217;t believe there are so many STUPID people out there
who ignore this REALITY. (<a href="http://www.leaderandtimes.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=14704:gun-control-crowd-ignores-reality&amp;catid=29:opinion&amp;Itemid=58">High Plains Leader and Times</a>)</span></span></p>

<p class="western">
<span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>California, with its very tight anti-gun laws, is the state which has
had the MOST mass killings in the country in 2019. That should tell
the anti-gun fools something, but it won&#8217;t. They look at studies
like that which came out from Johns Hopkins that show NO EFFECT on
gun crime for their highly touted background check laws and ignore
the truth, making excuses for the stats that don&#8217;t include the
reality that background checks, like all their other anti-gun laws,
just don&#8217;t work. The biggest reason gun crime is so rampant IS
their anti-gun laws, which only serve to give law-breakers an easier
life because it keeps their intended targets defenseless against
their ILLEGAL guns. Previously, I have been confounded by their
complete ignorance of the fact than NONE of their laws work as
intended. Then I look at the real result of their laws&#8212;defenseless
law-abiding people who do obey them, and I see that&#8217;s what they
really want. A defenseless population they can push around at will.
If that is the intended result, they&#8217;re working perfectly. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>(<a href="https://flagandcross.com/report-california-had-most-mass-slayings-in-2019-state-also-has-strictest-gun-control/">Flag and Cross</a>)</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="western">
<span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Apparently, the latest drug of choice is the &#8220;stupid pill.&#8221; Many
people seem to be taking them, and often they are politicians who can
enact some stupid things and make them stick. Like de-funding or
disbanding the cops. That&#8217;s &#8220;cutting of your nose to spite your
face.&#8221; The cops are there to protect them, and form a barrier to
the criminals and other law breakers who want to victimize the law
abiding. They SAY they&#8217;re doing that to &#8220;make us safe.&#8221; But you
don&#8217;t make yourself defenseless to make yourself safer. Now they&#8217;re
talking about getting rid of school resource officers so there will
then be NOBODY left to </span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>defend</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>
your children when a fool comes in with his illegal gun and kills a
few. All over the country there are measures taken to REMOVE all
means of self defense, for everybody. People are doing it to
themselves. Taking guns away from the law abiding is just part of the
move to make us all defenseless against the bad guys. And the bad
guys are loving it, because it just makes </span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>it</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>
easier for them to victimize us without worrying about anybody having
the means for defense against them. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>One
important question: Who do you call when crooks come when there are
no cops? Getting rid of all cops because of one or two bad apples is
insanity. (Just common sense)</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

</h3>

 


<p class="western">
<span><span>Chicago, New Orleans, Detroit, and Washington, DC, the
four cities with the toughest gun laws in the nation, put us THIRD in
the WORLD in murders. Without those cities added, we&#8217;re 4th
from the bottom of the list. That&#8217;s not conjecture or opinion,
that&#8217;s FACT. But a fact IGNORED by those incompetent politicians
who make laws that do nothing but present ILLEGALLY armed criminals
with more unarmed citizens than they can rob or murder. These are
hard facts. You&#8217;d think the people why SAY they want to &#8220;curb gun
violence&#8221; would &#8220;tumble&#8221; to that and aim their efforts
elsewhere than on the guns themselves. Guns, without evil hands
holding them, can do NOTHING. They need to make laws to &#8220;Curb&#8221;
the PEOPLE who USE those guns for evil purposes by giving them longer
sentences for using guns to commit crimes. Don&#8217;t ban the use of
guns for honest people who OBEY laws by MAKING laws to disarm them.
But these incompetent politicians ignore reality and continue to make
more and more USELESS laws that kill innocent people by disarming
them. What will it take to make these incompetent politicians see
reason? Nothing, I suppose, because reason is not part of their
lexicon. (Just common sense)</span></span></p>

</h3>

 


<p class="western">
<span><span><span><span><span><span><span>That&#8217;s the only way I can describe those who think thy can
eliminate guns entirely from the world, and that to do so will
eliminate violent crime. The real evidence shows absolutely that
anti-gun laws have never worked to prevent &#8220;gun crime&#8221; and,
instead, INCREASE it by disarming the law-abiding, making them
defenseless against those who use ILLEGAL guns to victimize them. But
they ignore that and continue to insist on making even more of the
useless, unenforceable anti-gun laws, while people die because of
them. And it&#8217;s not just those I call &#8220;anti-gun fools.&#8221; It
includes politicians who buy their silly notions and make those laws.
It is the news media that promotes &#8220;gun control&#8221; that controls
nothing. And nothing ever dents their &#8220;stone brains&#8221; with logic.
They have bought this silliness as if it were real, and they just
can&#8217;t see anything that denies it. They blame the guns, period.
Never mind finding out why so many people want to victimize people,
with, or without guns. It just does not get through to their little
brains. We keep showing them the evidence and they keep ignoring it,
while continuing to make their stupid laws that just get more people
killed. Everything I&#8217;ve written above, I&#8217;ve written before, but
it&#8217;s as if I&#8217;ve never written a word, to them. (Just common
sense)</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p>
<span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Gun control is NOT the answer to defending yourself against the fools
who riot and declare they are &#8220;coming to the burbs to take what&#8217;s
ours.&#8221; You can&#8217;t depend upon the cops. They are overwhelmed as it
is, and even so, they can&#8217;t be everywhere at once with their guns.
So the only real answer is a gun in the hand of the intended victim.
The people know that, and that&#8217;s the reason they are flocking to
the gu</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>n</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>
stores to build up their arsenal so they can properly resist those
fools when they come for what THINK is theirs, but which is NOT. The
anti-gun fools think a gun in a man&#8217;s hand will automatically make
him a crazy shooter, which it will not. Their entire goal is to get
rid of guns, period. And that&#8217;s never going to happen. They will
never get rid of the millions of ILLEGAL guns already out there in

breakers</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>.
That way, they can reduce &#8220;gun crime,&#8221; one criminal at a time, by
killing the criminal when he comes for their property. If ANY of the
laws the anti-gun fools have caused to be passed did ANYTHING to
limit gun crime, I&#8217;d be right there with them, But they don&#8217;t,
and instead INCREASE it by disarming the intended victi</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>m</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>s.

</h3>

 


<p class="western">
<span><span>2013 was a year of fool actions, to be sure. But will
2020 be any better? Not with the anti-gun fools being still in
office. The problem is not the very EXISTENCE of guns; it is that
people with bad intentions GET guns. Lawmakers THINK making laws
against criminals having guns (which, unfortunately, includes good
people having guns for self-defense) will stop the crooks from
seeking out illicit gun dealers who sell their guns out of the trunk
of their cars in back alleys. They will NOT. But that never deters
these fools from making their useless laws that do nothing but give
ILLEGALLY-armed criminals a steady stream of unarmed VICTIMS; which
makes crime rates rise, and, more importantly, makes the number of
gun deaths also rise. Nobody seems to be able to get through to these
ignoramuses. They&#8217;re &#8220;tone deaf&#8221; to logic. Some even deny the
very EXISTENCE of logic. Maybe some day these fools will &#8220;wise up.&#8221;
I hope it happens before some criminal shoots them with an ILLEGAL
gun. (Just common sense).</span></span></p>

<p class="western">
<span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Are we going to second-guess them every time a cop is forced to use
his gun in self defense for himself or for others? We&#8217;re going to
make cops afraid to use their guns, even when their lives are
threatened, and that&#8217;s going to cost cop lives, and incidentally,
the lives of those they are supposed to be protecting. There&#8217;s a
move afoot to disarm the cops, and what we&#8217;re doing today
accomplishes that, by making them afraid to use their guns for fear
of being fired, and worse, imprisoned themselves, together with the
very people they have put there. The killing of George Floyd was NOT
&#8220;righteous.&#8221; He was NOT fighting. He was already &#8220;under
control,&#8221; but then had THREE cops put him down and kneel upon him,
one with his knee on his neck, killing him. In Atlanta it is not
quite so clear. This subject was actively fighting, and getting the
better of several cops. He had stolen one of their stun guns and was
using it on one of the cops. That stun gun could be a deadly weapon
in the right circumstances. And then there&#8217;s the fact that he could

<p class="western">
<span><span>It&#8217;s easy to do. Just try and argue
LOGICALLY against their pet ideas like putting locks on guns in
locked gun safes in the house so when an ILLEGALLY-armed criminal
comes calling you&#8217;ll never be able to get your gun into action
quickly enough to keep him from shooting you with his ILLEGAL gun. Of
course, his gun is not subject to such STUPID laws because he doesn&#8217;t
OBEY laws. Of course, that makes your gun USELESS, which is their
goal, anyway. Or their propensity for &#8220;registering&#8221; all guns so
the government will know where they are, and who owns them when they
get ready to come calling and confiscate (steal) them. They get angry
because they know they can&#8217;t ANSWER your logic. So they just walk
away in a huff after calling you nasty, vile names. Names that would
have gotten them shot 100 years ago (which was a GOOD thing). Fools
like that ALWAYS get angry when people attempt to confront them with
logic. (Just common sense)</span></span></p>

<p class="western">
<span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Every time you see a criminal on TV in one of the &#8220;cop shows,&#8221;
he&#8217;s shooting at the cops with a full-auto Machine gun. Which
paints a very different picture of what happens in reality. The
instance of crooks using machine guns is only in the imaginations of
the writers and &#8220;prop masters&#8221; of those shows. Most criminals
can&#8217;t even afford a machine gun, much less use it properly. The
only way they even get one is to steal it&#8212;which is not inhibited in
the least by anti-gun laws. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>T</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>hey&#8217;re
shown spraying bullets in all directions while those &#8220;intrepid
cops&#8221; patiently wait until they have to change clips, then kill him
with one shot. Yeah, right. Fanciful thinking. The fact is, most
criminals are lucky to have a &#8220;Saturday Night Special&#8221; which
today is a 9mm Glock, or something like it. It&#8217;s very rare when
they have a gun anything like a machine gun. The idea of a cri</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>m</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>inal
walking around with a machine gun under his coat is ludicrous, but
the TV writers don&#8217;t care. Gunmen spraying bullets everywhere is
very exciting, and it builds viewership. So they continue to write
their scripts that way, and nobody can stop </span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>them</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>.
It IS &#8220;fiction,&#8221; after all. But it does present a very twisted
picture of what real cops are up against. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>And
politicians like &#8220;Horse-Face&#8221; John Kerry talking about &#8220;knowing
all about AR-</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>16s</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>
because I hunt&#8221; after sponsoring useless anti-gun legislation
doesn&#8217;t help any. (<a href="https://crimeresearch.org/2020/02/television-shows-misrepresenting-facts-the-rookie-the-continued-obsession-w-criminals-using-machine-guns/">Crime Prevention Research Center</a>)</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="western">
<span><span><span><span><span><span><span>What
an abysmally stupid idea this is! Only total stupid politicians would
go along with this stupid idea. You don&#8217;t protect yourself by
getting rid of the very people and things that defend you. The same
is true of one of the best defensive tools, a gun. Getting rid of the
cops on one bad idea, but getting rid of guns just compounds the
error. Guns are like fire. They can help you or hurt you, depending
on how they are used. But if you eliminate them, they can neither
help NOR hurt you. Getting rid of the cops and getting rid of the
guns are both getting rid of your ability to defend yourself, and
that is the main goal of those who want to get rid of both. To leave
you completely defenseless against those who do not get rid of their
guns so they can more easily victimize you at will, without worrying
about your ability to defend yourself. Those who push such ideas are
those who will be the ones coming at you to victimize you, one way or
another, later. And I include politicians in that. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>In
any case, getting rid of then cops is one of the stupidest ideas to
come down the pike. The cops are the first and last line of defense
for you. Fear of the cops is the only thing that limits the criminals
in what they think they can do to you. It&#8217;s what keeps them &#8220;at
bay.&#8221; And punishes them when they come to victimize you. (Just
common sense)</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Recently a deranged individual went into a US military base featuring
UNARMED military personnel and killed a few, before some ARMED men
from OUTSIDE the base came in and dealt with him. The MINUTES between
the time that fool started killing innocent military personnel and
the arrival of the armed men who dealt with him meant DEATH for a
number of them. So what happens? They reinforce the UNARMED situation
on other military bases, making them DEFENSELESS against such fools.
They immediately told other military personnel they didn&#8217;t care if
they got murdered. These are people who are RESPONSIBLE users of
guns. They are TRAINED to be. So what earthly reason do you BAN the
carrying of firearms by base personnel when you KNOW that makes them
prime targets for those deranged people who want to kill a few of
them for whatever deranged reason they have in mind? The action by
the &#8220;powers that be&#8221; at Offut Air Base is just the OPPOSITE of

<span><span><span><span><span><span><span>That&#8217;s how people promote ideas that are stupid. Just lie about
them. That&#8217;s what Bloomberg </span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>wa</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>s

that 2,900 CHILDREN die by gun violence every year. Of course, his
&#8220;definition&#8221; of child includes young adults up to 19 years of
age. Most of which are gang members and are shooting back, adding to
the total. His figures also include suicides as well as homicides.
What he is doing shows plainly that he KNOWS he is lying about &#8220;gun
control,&#8221; and doesn&#8217;t care. He paints himself as a &#8220;brave
advocate of public safety who is not afraid of the gun lobby.&#8221; As
if the gun lobby is going to actually physically attack him. As with
most anti-gun fools, he wants us to think that, just because they
have guns, they will use them on people like him, so his opposition
to the &#8220;gun lobby&#8221; is a &#8220;dangerous position.&#8221; </span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>This
is a typical scam used by anti-gun fools to prop up their numbers:
quote a fanciful number inflated by misleading the figures, and tout
it to the skies. Even the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) uses
figures that include &#8220;children&#8221; up to 17, many of which are
shooting each other. Even so, that brings the number of &#8220;children&#8217;s
deaths by gunfire&#8221; down 73%. With only 2 years&#8217; difference in the
inflated numbers. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>(<a href="https://reason.com/2020/02/02/michael-bloombergs-claim-about-children-killed-by-gun-violence-is-off-by-73/">Reason</a>)</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="western">
<span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Many editorial cartoonists are genius in the way they portray the
news. Others disgust me. This one, by Gary Markstein, is one of the
worst I&#8217;ve ever seen. In it, he shows a guy listing the names of
every thug and criminal ever accosted by the cops on a wall, in 3&#8221;
letters to fill up the wall faster. The list includes everybody ever
accosted by the police for any reason, claiming police abuse of
power. In those, he includes black men shot and killed by the cops
for any reason. Good shoots, bad shoots, self defense shoots, where
the cops are dodging bullets sent their way by the bad guys. Also
included are instances of &#8220;suicide by cop.&#8221; The obvious intent of
this carton is to &#8220;fan the flames&#8221; and make things look worse
than they really are. And it does a good job of it. The latest
shooting in Atlanta, GA, is billed as &#8220;being because he was
sleeping in a Wendy&#8217;s drive-up line, asking if that should get him
a death sentence, which is a serious twist of the facts. He got
killed because he was fighting the cops, taking their weapons and
using them on them. He could have &#8220;Tased&#8221; one of the cops with
his own stun gun, taken his gun, and shot a cop with it. He was in
the act of shooting a cop with that stun gun when shot. They&#8217;re
saying he only resisted because he was afraid of being handcuffed,
remembering that George Floyd was handcuffed when murdered by a cop,
which is only a guess. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I&#8217;d
like to see a similar cartoon listing the names of all the cops
killed by thugs, both from hiding, and while resisting arrest. The
names probably wouldn&#8217;t fit on just one wall. (<a href="https://www.arcamax.com/politics/editorialcartoons/garymarkstein/s-2371881">Gary Markstein</a>)</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Again and again I point out to anti-gun fools the complete idiocy of
their position, and they routinely ignore me and make their useless,
unenforceable laws limiting the law-abiding people&#8217;s ability to own
and use guns in self defense, getting them KILLED by law-breakers,
who routinely ignore their laws.

those law-abiding people were to be armed, they&#8217;d &#8220;go nuts&#8221; and
&#8220;shoot up the countryside.&#8221; Which completely ignores the fact
that the law-breakers DO. I tell them and tell them that law-abiding
people with guns can stop crimes. Well, it happened again in Chicago,
fergawdsakes! Several carjackers tried to jack the car driven by a
woman when her husband, who was one of the few legal &#8220;concealed
carriers&#8221; in Chicago, began firing on them, causing all but one of
them to run. He held him for the cops, who found and arrested others
later. This AGAIN proves my contention that law-abiding armed people
can do what the cops can&#8217;t do, because they are THERE when it
happens. They do not &#8220;arrive later&#8221; like the cops, who can then
only document the crime and MAYBE later catch the criminals, AFTER
they have maybe killed their victim. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Th
sorry thing is that there are so many stupid people making and
enforcing laws and getting people killed. We need to &#8220;vote the
fools out!&#8221; Gun crime is actually going down, as more and more
people are allowed to carry guns for self defense. Now gangs only
kill one person a day in Chicago. Not a success story, but a step in
the right direction. (<a href="https://bearingarms.com/cam-e/2019/12/31/two-chicago-carjackers-stopped-by-one-armed-citizen/">Bearing Arms</a>)</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

themselves as Dumocrats and vote that way. Most of them are just not
paying attention, and vote the way they&#8217;re told. And the Dumocrats
are ready and willing to tell them how to vote. First of all, the
Dumocrats are socialists, which, in itself, is stupid. Anybody who
really LOOKS at socialism wants no part of it, unless they&#8217;re
promoting it to gain power over others. It&#8217;s a system BASED on the
theft of the fruits of production of new wealth from the producers,
for the benefit of those who, for whatever reason, do NOT produce,
but only consume. And then there are the silly ideas they promote,
such as that there are more than 2 sexes. They insist on it in the
face of biological proof that it would be impossible.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
 
<p class="western">
<span><span><span><span><span><span><span>They
say sex is &#8220;assigned&#8221; at birth, which is false. It is DISCOVERED
at birth by observing which of TWO sex organs the baby has. Nothing

transsexualism (where a man dresses like a woman and pretends to be a

man), is a different sex, but it is NOT. It is a mental aberration.

claim bigotry if men pretending to be women aren&#8217;t allowed to
compete against real women in sports, and even SUE to get their way.
Too often liberal judges agree with them and they prevail. But that
doesn&#8217;t make it so. As Ayn Rand said, &#8220;A is A.&#8221; A can never be

as it is foolish to try and say there are more than 2 sexes. They try
and convince us of other foolish things including believing they can
stop violent crime by eliminating guns&#8212;which is an impossibility.
Especially in this country, where we have the Second amendment
guaranteeing the fact that we have the inalienable RIGHT to &#8220;bear
arms.&#8221; Even so, the millions of ILLEGAL guns out there makes it an
impossibility. Even if that were possible, violent crime would
continue, just using something else as a weapon, as they did before
guns were invented. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>They
try and convince is that &#8220;there are no absolutes&#8221; so they will not
be bound by an absolute. But their very statement SAYING there are no
absolutes is a &#8220;statement of an absolute.&#8221; They refuse to believe
it and continue to insist they are right. Stupid.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>(Just

<span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Barack Obama hates this country. How he ever got to be president is a
shame, and an insult to the electorate. He is a racist and a Muslim
who hates Christians and Christianity. That is proven by his own
words. Yes, he as a right to be Muslim, but that doesn&#8217;t give him a
right to </span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>discriminate
against</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>
Christianity, even though the Koran specifically tells al</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>l</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>
Muslims to KILL non-Muslims. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>The
very fact that this man could get elected president shows a weakness
in our system. Such people should be barred from politics and I&#8217;m
sure people knew that about him BEFORE he even announced. There needs
to be a system o</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>f</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>
vetting candidates to find out for sure what they really stand for
before they&#8217;re ALLOWED to run for office and if they&#8217;re found to
be an advocate of un-American ideas that should be brought out, not
necessarily by their opponents, but by the publishing of the vetting
results. Obama had been actively working to destroy this country as
we know it as long as he has been alive, and people needed to know
that BEFORE he was elected. He says this country is racist when it is
Obama and his ilk that ARE racist.

<p class="western">
<span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Nancy Peelosi says the reason she is holding up sending her &#8220;articles
of impeachment&#8221; to the Senate after making many noises about the
&#8220;need for speed,&#8221; is that she wants assurance that it will be a
&#8220;fair trial.&#8221; I think she should have thought about that before
those boring, useless, &#8220;investigations&#8221; in the House, where they
denied President Trump any kind of means to defend himself, and
&#8220;slammed through&#8221; their &#8220;articles&#8221; without any kind of proof
of any wrongdoing on his part. She has no room to talk at all when it
comes to &#8220;fairness&#8221; after that dismal performance. I think the
real reason she is holding onto her &#8220;articles&#8221; is so she can hold
them over Trump&#8217;s head during the upcoming election, hoping to ruin
his chances for re-election. But is is NOT going to happen. The
amazing increase in his donations is ample evidence that the American
people have already made up their minds, on the basis of FACTS, not
suppositions and innuendo. They are GOING TO re-elect him, in spite
of everything this bimbo can do. They elected him to get rid of the
sort of politician that is represented by Nancy Peelosi, &#8220;Pencil
Neck&#8221; Adam </span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>S</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>hiff,
and &#8220;Fat Boy&#8221; Jerry Nadler. And they&#8217;re working hard to blunt
his efforts before he exposes them for the political hacks </span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>they
are,</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>
and their corruption. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>(Just

<span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Every word I&#8217;m about to write, I&#8217;ve written before in this, and
other spaces. I&#8217;m really getting tired of writing the same things
over and over while being routinely ignored by the anti-gun fools.
But I&#8217;m going to continue, in hopes that somebody will take my
words seriously and cause them to stop making their useless,
unen</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>f</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>orceable
anti-gun laws that nobody except the law-abiding obey. The
law-abiding, who are NOT the prob</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>l</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>em,
while the law-breakers just ignore them and get their guns illegally.
A popular anti-gun law is the &#8220;background check,&#8221; which doesn&#8217;t
do a single thing to stop people from killing people with guns, but
just allows the cops MAYBE to apprehend the shooter&#8212;IF&#8212;the
shooter got his gun legally, which most law-breakers&#8212;who ARE the
problem&#8212;do NOT. In any case, it only would do anything AFTER the
shooting happens and usually somebody is dead. &#8220;Gun-free zones&#8221;
have NEVER stopped a single shooting in their &#8220;zones.&#8221; In fact,
criminals and potential mass shooters SEEK THEM OUT because they
figure they can be pretty sure the law-abiding there will not be
armed, and thus will be defenseless. EVERY mass shooting has happened
IN a &#8220;gun-free zone&#8221; for that reason. Meanwhile criminals, who
just want to rob and kill people, do it more often than not in a
gun-free zone. I could go on and on, but I won&#8217;t. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>
don&#8217;t want to bore anybody. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>In
any case, maybe repeating myself will cement these things in the
minds of people who read this blog so they can cogently argue against
the misnamed &#8220;gun control&#8221; laws.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>
(Just common sense)</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

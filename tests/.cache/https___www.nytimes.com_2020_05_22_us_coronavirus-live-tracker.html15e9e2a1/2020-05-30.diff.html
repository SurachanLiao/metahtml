It’s not </p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0"> <ins>right.”After he spoke, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a number of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/us/politics/trump-cdc.html" title="">long-delayed guidelines Link: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/us/politics/trump-cdc.html </a> with suggestions for steps that</ins> </p> <del>right. So I’m correcting this injustice, and calling</del> houses of worship <p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0"> <ins>can take to curb the spread of the virus. Among them was a recommendation that religious officials defer to the directive of state and local governments.Still, the president threatened to “override” the governors if they did not follow his order, though it was not immediately clear what powers he was claiming. “I</ins> </p> <del>“essential.” I</del> call upon governors to allow our churches and places of worship to open right <p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0"> <ins>now,” he said. “If there’s any question, they’re going to have to call me, but they’re not going to be successful in that call.”</ins><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0"><ins>When the C.D.C. recently released a set of guidelines for reopening, its report largely mirrored an earlier <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/6935-CDC-opening-guidelines/e1a8802d0d76b3eb43a8/optimized/full.pdf#page=1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">draft version Link: https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/6935-CDC-opening-guidelines/e1a8802d0d76b3eb43a8/optimized/full.pdf#page=1 </a> that the White House had rejected because Trump administration officials worried that the suggestions infringed on religious rights.</ins></p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0"><ins>On Friday the C.D.C.’s new guidelines for religious communities suggested that they consider a number of limitations to keep congregations safe. Among them:</ins></p><ul class="css-1le37cb ez3869y0"><li class="css-o74qhc eoqvrfo0"><p class="css-nxfrgc evys1bk0"><ins>“Take steps to limit the size of gatherings in accordance with the guidance and directives of state and local authorities.”</ins></p></li><li class="css-o74qhc eoqvrfo0"><p class="css-nxfrgc evys1bk0"><ins>“Consider suspending or at least decreasing use of a choir/musical ensembles and congregant singing, chanting, or reciting during services or other programming, if appropriate within the faith tradition. The act of singing may contribute to transmission of Covid-19, possibly through emission of aerosols.”</ins></p></li><li class="css-o74qhc eoqvrfo0"><p class="css-nxfrgc evys1bk0"><ins>“Consider temporarily limiting the sharing of frequently touched objects that cannot be easily cleaned between persons, such as worship aids, prayer rugs, prayer books, hymnals, religious texts and other bulletins, books, shared cups, or other items received, passed or shared among congregants.”</ins></p></li></ul><ins>Mr. Trump said Friday at the White House that the nation needs religion. “In</ins> </p> <del>now. These are places that hold our society together, and keep our people united. The people are demanding to go to church and synagogue, go to their mosque. Many millions of Americans embrace worship as an essential part of life. The ministers, pastors, rabbis, imams and other faith leaders will make sure that their congregations are safe as they gather and pray. I know them well, they love their congregations. They love their people. They don’t want anything bad to happen to them or to anybody else. The governors need to do the right thing, and allow these very important essential places of faith to open right now, for this weekend. If they don’t do it, I will override the governors. In</del> America, we need more prayer, not <ins>less,” he said. He left without taking questions. </ins><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0"><ins>David Postman, the chief of staff for Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington, said the state didn’t know what the president’s comments meant and noted the state had not seen any formal order. “We don’t believe the president has the ability to dictate what states can and cannot open,” Mr. Postman said.</ins></p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0"><ins>Rhode Island’s governor, Gina Raimondo, was more blunt when told of the president’s comments, saying, “<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://turnto10.com/news/local/raimondo-sticks-to-may-30-reopening-of-churches-as-trump-deems-them-essential" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">No, that’s not happening in Rhode Island Link: https://turnto10.com/news/local/raimondo-sticks-to-may-30-reopening-of-churches-as-trump-deems-them-essential </a>.”</ins></p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0"><ins>“We’re not ready,” she said. “Honestly, that would be reckless.

Soon after he spoke, though, the C.D.C. issued guidelines urging faith leaders to “take steps to limit the size of gatherings in accordance with the guidance and directives of state and local authorities.”</ins></p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0"><ins>States and localities have been taking a variety of approaches to religious services since the outbreak began.</ins></p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0"><ins>Houses of worship were already allowed to operate in more than half of the states, though many remain under social distancing instructions and many individual churches, synagogues and mosques have decided to remain closed for safety.</ins></p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0"><ins>There have been tensions in places that still have restrictions in place. In California, more than 1,200 pastors signed a declaration protesting the state’s restrictions on in-person services and pledged to reopen their churches by May 31 even if the restrictions are not lifted. Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, said Friday that the state was working with faith leaders on guidelines to reopen in “a safe and responsible manner” that would be released by Monday at the latest.</ins></p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0"><ins>The state’s guidelines, which will distinguish between megachurches and smaller venues, deal with the configuration of pews and “sanitation protocols,” the governor said.</ins></p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0"><ins>In Illinois, Gov. J.B. Pritzker said on Friday that he would “continue to operate on the basis of science and data” in deciding when it was safe for houses of worship to open. </ins></p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0"><ins>“I’m as anxious as anybody to make sure that our churches, our mosques, our synagogues open back to where they were before Covid-19 came along,” Mr. Pritzker said. “We’re gradually moving in that direction. But there’s no doubt the most important thing is, we do not want parishioners to get ill because their faith leaders bring them together.”</ins></p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0"><ins>The president’s call to let in-person services resume came just before one of the biggest Muslim holidays of the year, Eid al-Fitr, which starts Saturday night.</ins></p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0"><ins>Washington State currently allows drive-in services, where congregants remain in their vehicles, and allows houses of worship to bring in personnel to broadcast and stream videos of services. Officials there have been working with an interfaith group to develop guidelines on how religious institutions can safely open up for more in-person activities. </ins></p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0"><ins>And in some states, houses of worships were never required to close. In Pennsylvania, religious institutions were exempt from a stay-at-home order, though Gov. Tom Wolf has advised religious leaders not to hold in-person services or large gatherings to protect people from the virus. </ins></p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0"><ins>Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, who on Friday <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/MIEOG/2020/05/22/file_attachments/1458387/EO%202020-100%20Emerg%20order%20-%20amendments.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">extended Link: https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/MIEOG/2020/05/22/file_attachments/1458387/EO%202020-100%20Emerg%20order%20-%20amendments.pdf </a> the state’s stay-at-home order through June 12, has banned large gatherings but also said that houses of worship would <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.michigan.gov/coronavirus/0,9753,7-406-98178_98455-522357--,00.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">not be subject to penalties Link: https://www.michigan.gov/coronavirus/0,9753,7-406-98178_98455-522357--,00.html </a>, leaving the decision in the hands of religious leaders. Many churches, synagogues and mosques there decided to remain closed anyway, and those that are reopening often remain under strict guidelines, including limiting the number of congregants who could enter.</ins></p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0"><ins>In hard-hit New York, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo moved this week to allow religious gatherings of up to 10 people to resume as long as attendees wear masks and maintain social distance. The announcement was particularly significant for Jewish congregations, where a minyan, defined as 10 people over 13, is required for a worship service.</ins></p><p class="css-53u6y8"><ins></ins></p><h2 class="css-1aoo5yy eoo0vm40" id="link-307b2d35"><ins>Birx expresses concerns about case levels in Los Angeles, Chicago and Washington.</ins></h2><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0"><ins>One testing measure shows that coronavirus cases are persisting at worrisome rates in three major metropolitan areas — Los Angeles, Chicago and Washington, D.C. — that are still under stay-at-home orders, a top White House official said on Friday.</ins></p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0"><ins>“We have concerns of where cities have remained closed and metros that have remained closed but have still persistent high number of cases,” Dr. Deborah L. Birx, the White House’s coronavirus response coordinator, told reporters at a news conference. She said officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were working with local officials in the three cities “to really understand where these new cases coming from, and what do we need to do to prevent them in the future.”</ins></p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0"><ins>Dr. Birx’s concern did not suggest that the case rates in the three regions were spiking to alarming new levels, but rather that they were not dropping at the same rate as in many other cities.</ins></p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0"><ins>Dr. Birx singled out the Washington area — which includes the district as well as parts of Maryland and Virginia — and said it led the country in the percentage of positive test results, a measure different from total coronavirus cases. Among those who have tested positive is the former N.B.A. all-star Patrick Ewing, now the men’s basketball coach at Georgetown University in Washington, who announced on Twitter on Friday that he had the virus. </ins></p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0"><ins>Unlike New York, the Washington area has seen no “dramatic decline” in positive test rates or emergency room visits, Dr. Birx said.</ins></p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0"><ins>Further complicating the picture, Mayor Muriel E. Bowser of Washington said on Thursday that the city could begin a phased reopening as early as May 29, pointing to figures that showed a downward trend in spread of the virus for almost two weeks.

Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too.

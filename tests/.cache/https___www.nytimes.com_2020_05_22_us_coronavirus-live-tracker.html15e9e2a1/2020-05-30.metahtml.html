People are dying at their houses and nursing homes without ever being tested, they say, and deaths early this year were likely misidentified as influenza or described only as pneumonia.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Dr. Deborah L. Birx, the White House&#8217;s coronavirus response coordinator, has said publicly that the American health care system incorporates a generous definition of a death caused by Covid-19.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">&#8220;There are other countries that if you had a pre-existing condition, and let&#8217;s say the virus caused you to go to the I.C.U., and then have a heart or kidney problem &#8212; some countries are recording that as a heart issue or a kidney issue and not a Covid-19 death,&#8221; she said at a White House news conference last month.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">In a brief interview on Thursday, Dr. Birx stressed that there had been no pressure to alter data. But concerns about official statistics are not limited to the death toll, or to administration officials.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Epidemiologists said they were stunned to learn that the C.D.C. is combining tests that detect active infection with those that detect recovery from Covid-19 &#8212; a system that muddies the picture of the pandemic but raises the percentage of Americans tested as President Trump boasts about testing.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Experts said that data from antibody tests and active virus tests should never be mixed.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">&#8220;It just doesn&#8217;t make any sense,&#8221; said Natalie Dean, a biostatistician at the University of Florida. &#8220;All of us are really baffled.&#8221;</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Epidemiologists, state health officials and a spokeswoman for the C.D.C. said there was no ill intent; they attributed the flawed reporting system to confusion and fatigue in overworked state and local health departments that typically track infections &#8212; not tests &#8212; during outbreaks. </p><p class="css-1sngw6j"><a class="css-1a9ghz5" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html"><p class="css-1rha1bf"><h2 class="css-zd32qr">Coronavirus in the U.S.: Latest Map and Case Count</h2><p class="css-1uuihdo">A detailed county map shows the extent of the coronavirus outbreak, with tables of the number of cases by county.</p></p></a></p><p class="css-53u6y8"><h2 class="css-1aoo5yy eoo0vm40" id="link-6e76113e">Trump demands that governors let houses of worship reopen. </h2></p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">President Trump stepped into the culture wars again on Friday, taking the side of some religious leaders against governors who have moved slowly in reopening places of worship amid the pandemic.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Without any clear authority to do so, Mr. Trump said that he was calling houses of faith, including churches, synagogues, and mosques, &#8220;essential services&#8221; and urged governors to reopen them &#8220;right now.&#8221; </p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">&#8220;Today I am identifying houses of worship &#8212; churches, synagogue and mosques &#8212; as essential places that provide essential services,&#8221; Mr. Trump said at a hastily scheduled briefing at the White House on Friday. &#8220;Some governors have deemed liquor stores and abortion clinics as essential but have left out churches and other houses of worship. It&#8217;s not right.&#8221;</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">After he spoke, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a number of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/us/politics/trump-cdc.html" title="">long-delayed guidelines</a> with suggestions for steps that houses of worship can take to curb the spread of the virus. Among them was a recommendation that religious officials defer to the directive of state and local governments.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Still, the president threatened to &#8220;override&#8221; the governors if they did not follow his order, though it was not immediately clear what powers he was claiming. &#8220;I call upon governors to allow our churches and places of worship to open right now,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If there&#8217;s any question, they&#8217;re going to have to call me, but they&#8217;re not going to be successful in that call.&#8221;</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">When the C.D.C. recently released a set of guidelines for reopening, its report largely mirrored an earlier <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/6935-CDC-opening-guidelines/e1a8802d0d76b3eb43a8/optimized/full.pdf#page=1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">draft version</a> that the White House had rejected because Trump administration officials worried that the suggestions infringed on religious rights.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">On Friday the C.D.C.&#8217;s new guidelines for religious communities suggested that they consider a number of limitations to keep congregations safe. Among them:</p><ul class="css-1le37cb ez3869y0"><li class="css-o74qhc eoqvrfo0"><p class="css-nxfrgc evys1bk0">&#8220;Take steps to limit the size of gatherings in accordance with the guidance and directives of state and local authorities.&#8221;</p></li><li class="css-o74qhc eoqvrfo0"><p class="css-nxfrgc evys1bk0">&#8220;Consider suspending or at least decreasing use of a choir/musical ensembles and congregant singing, chanting, or reciting during services or other programming, if appropriate within the faith tradition. The act of singing may contribute to transmission of Covid-19, possibly through emission of aerosols.&#8221;</p></li><li class="css-o74qhc eoqvrfo0"><p class="css-nxfrgc evys1bk0">&#8220;Consider temporarily limiting the sharing of frequently touched objects that cannot be easily cleaned between persons, such as worship aids, prayer rugs, prayer books, hymnals, religious texts and other bulletins, books, shared cups, or other items received, passed or shared among congregants.&#8221;</p></li></ul><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Mr. Trump said Friday at the White House that the nation needs religion. &#8220;In America, we need more prayer, not less,&#8221; he said. He left without taking questions. </p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">David Postman, the chief of staff for Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington, said the state didn&#8217;t know what the president&#8217;s comments meant and noted the state had not seen any formal order. &#8220;We don&#8217;t believe the president has the ability to dictate what states can and cannot open,&#8221; Mr. Postman said.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Rhode Island&#8217;s governor, Gina Raimondo, was more blunt when told of the president&#8217;s comments, saying, &#8220;<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://turnto10.com/news/local/raimondo-sticks-to-may-30-reopening-of-churches-as-trump-deems-them-essential" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">No, that&#8217;s not happening in Rhode Island</a>.&#8221;</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">&#8220;We&#8217;re not ready,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Honestly, that would be reckless. It&#8217;s Friday. They&#8217;re not ready.&#8221;</p><p class="css-53u6y8"><h2 class="css-1aoo5yy eoo0vm40" id="link-3a63197b">States differ on their approaches to religious services during the pandemic.</h2></p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">It was not clear what authority President Trump was invoking on Friday when he called for governors &#8220;to allow our churches and places of worship to open right now,&#8221; and threatened to &#8220;override&#8221; them if they did not. Soon after he spoke, though, the C.D.C. issued guidelines urging faith leaders to &#8220;take steps to limit the size of gatherings in accordance with the guidance and directives of state and local authorities.&#8221;</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">States and localities have been taking a variety of approaches to religious services since the outbreak began.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Houses of worship were already allowed to operate in more than half of the states, though many remain under social distancing instructions and many individual churches, synagogues and mosques have decided to remain closed for safety.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">There have been tensions in places that still have restrictions in place. In California, more than 1,200 pastors signed a declaration protesting the state&#8217;s restrictions on in-person services and pledged to reopen their churches by May 31 even if the restrictions are not lifted. Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, said Friday that the state was working with faith leaders on guidelines to reopen in &#8220;a safe and responsible manner&#8221; that would be released by Monday at the latest.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">The state&#8217;s guidelines, which will distinguish between megachurches and smaller venues, deal with the configuration of pews and &#8220;sanitation protocols,&#8221; the governor said.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">In Illinois, Gov. J.B. Pritzker said on Friday that he would &#8220;continue to operate on the basis of science and data&#8221; in deciding when it was safe for houses of worship to open. </p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">&#8220;I&#8217;m as anxious as anybody to make sure that our churches, our mosques, our synagogues open back to where they were before Covid-19 came along,&#8221; Mr. Pritzker said. &#8220;We&#8217;re gradually moving in that direction. But there&#8217;s no doubt the most important thing is, we do not want parishioners to get ill because their faith leaders bring them together.&#8221;</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">The president&#8217;s call to let in-person services resume came just before one of the biggest Muslim holidays of the year, Eid al-Fitr, which starts Saturday night.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Washington State currently allows drive-in services, where congregants remain in their vehicles, and allows houses of worship to bring in personnel to broadcast and stream videos of services. Officials there have been working with an interfaith group to develop guidelines on how religious institutions can safely open up for more in-person activities. </p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">And in some states, houses of worships were never required to close. In Pennsylvania, religious institutions were exempt from a stay-at-home order, though Gov. Tom Wolf has advised religious leaders not to hold in-person services or large gatherings to protect people from the virus. </p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, who on Friday <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/MIEOG/2020/05/22/file_attachments/1458387/EO%202020-100%20Emerg%20order%20-%20amendments.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">extended</a> the state&#8217;s stay-at-home order through June 12, has banned large gatherings but also said that houses of worship would <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.michigan.gov/coronavirus/0,9753,7-406-98178_98455-522357--,00.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">not be subject to penalties</a>, leaving the decision in the hands of religious leaders. Many churches, synagogues and mosques there decided to remain closed anyway, and those that are reopening often remain under strict guidelines, including limiting the number of congregants who could enter.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">In hard-hit New York, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo moved this week to allow religious gatherings of up to 10 people to resume as long as attendees wear masks and maintain social distance. The announcement was particularly significant for Jewish congregations, where a minyan, defined as 10 people over 13, is required for a worship service.</p><p class="css-53u6y8"><h2 class="css-1aoo5yy eoo0vm40" id="link-307b2d35">Birx expresses concerns about case levels in Los Angeles, Chicago and Washington.</h2></p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">One testing measure shows that coronavirus cases are persisting at worrisome rates in three major metropolitan areas &#8212; Los Angeles, Chicago and Washington, D.C. &#8212; that are still under stay-at-home orders, a top White House official said on Friday.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">&#8220;We have concerns of where cities have remained closed and metros that have remained closed but have still persistent high number of cases,&#8221; Dr. Deborah L. Birx, the White House&#8217;s coronavirus response coordinator, told reporters at a news conference. She said officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were working with local officials in the three cities &#8220;to really understand where these new cases coming from, and what do we need to do to prevent them in the future.&#8221;</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Dr. Birx&#8217;s concern did not suggest that the case rates in the three regions were spiking to alarming new levels, but rather that they were not dropping at the same rate as in many other cities.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Dr. Birx singled out the Washington area &#8212; which includes the district as well as parts of Maryland and Virginia &#8212; and said it led the country in the percentage of positive test results, a measure different from total coronavirus cases. Among those who have tested positive is the former N.B.A. all-star Patrick Ewing, now the men&#8217;s basketball coach at Georgetown University in Washington, who announced on Twitter on Friday that he had the virus. </p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Unlike New York, the Washington area has seen no &#8220;dramatic decline&#8221; in positive test rates or emergency room visits, Dr. Birx said.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Further complicating the picture, Mayor Muriel E. Bowser of Washington said on Thursday that the city could begin a phased reopening as early as May 29, pointing to figures that showed a downward trend in spread of the virus for almost two weeks. Yet on the same day, Washington, D.C., and Virginia <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/here-are-your-live-dc-updates/65-cdc624c4-179b-41b3-9f0b-01091ca49b31" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a> <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/JordanOnRecord/status/1263494043989917702" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">single-day highs</a> in cases.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">The Washington region&#8217;s high positive-test percentage comes despite reassuring news in most states: 42 have a rate under 10 percent of positive test results as part of a rolling, seven-day average, Dr. Birx said.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">The New York area, which includes Jersey City and Newark, is seeing steeper declines by that test result measure, Dr. Birx said. And cities that have been especially hard hit, such as Detroit, Boston and Miami, now have more promising daily case counts.</p><p class="css-53u6y8"><h2 class="css-1aoo5yy eoo0vm40" id="link-394fcd21">Ahead of a holiday weekend, beach towns are telling N.Y.C. residents to stay away.</h2></p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">In <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.easthamptonstar.com/villages-health/2020521/east-hampton-officials-prepare-limited-beach-openings" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Hamptons</a>, the locals have put up barricades to limit parking and deployed enforcement officers to ticket outsiders. Jersey Shore towns have banned short-term leases and Airbnb rentals. And on Long Island, the Suffolk County executive&#8217;s office taunted Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City: &#8220;Do your job. Figure out a plan to safely reopen your beaches.&#8221;</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Since the pandemic began, tensions have flared over whether too many New York City residents have <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/25/nyregion/coronavirus-leaving-nyc-vacation-homes.html" title="">decamped to outlying vacation areas</a>, potentially taking the virus with them. But now the region appears on the brink of a full-fledged (and nasty) battle over beaches, touched off by the city&#8217;s decision to keep its shoreline closed.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">In normal times, start of beach season on Memorial Day weekend incites a mass migration from New York to Long Island, the Jersey Shore and, to a lesser extent, Connecticut. But the extension of beach closings in New York City has led to a backlash from local officials in those areas, who say they fear that their shorelines will be overwhelmed by an exodus of sun-starved New Yorkers blocked from their own beaches, which can in normal times attract a million people a day.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">To maintain social distancing, beaches across the region are moving to limit access to everyone, and special rules have also been adopted to keep outsiders away. </p><p class="css-53u6y8"><h2 class="css-1aoo5yy eoo0vm40" id="link-5550eb1a">The Justice Dept. backs a lawsuit to block Illinois&#8217;s stay-at-home order.</h2><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">The Justice Department on Friday backed an Illinois Republican&#8217;s effort to invalidate the state&#8217;s stay-at-home order, the latest effort by the federal government to undermine governors&#8217; coronavirus measures.</p></p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">The U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Illinois <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ilsd.84687/gov.uscourts.ilsd.84687.15.0.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">argued in a legal brief</a> that Gov. J. B. Pritzker, a Democrat, had exceeded his authority by extending his executive order for more than 30 days.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">The brief came in response to a directive from Attorney General William P. Barr that department lawyers review stay-at-home orders around the country &#8220;to ensure that civil liberties are protected.&#8221;</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Since Mr. Barr&#8217;s request, the Justice Department has increasingly asserted itself in arguing over the legality of states&#8217; sweeping orders in response to the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">&#8220;Under our system, all public officials, including governors, must comply with the law, especially during times of crisis,&#8221; Eric Dreiband, the head of the department&#8217;s civil rights division, said in a statement. On Friday, Mr. Dreiband also <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-05-22/trump-administration-garcetti-warning-coronavirus-stay-at-home-orders" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">warned in</a> <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/62/5c/4c5878ad4ae3a77072c773ff423a/5-22-20-letter-to-la-mayor-and-health-director-ed.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a letter</a> to Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles that a &#8220;long-term lockdown&#8221; could be illegal.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">The move in Illinois came in a lawsuit that was filed by Darren Bailey, a Republican state representative whose fellow lawmakers kicked him out of the building in which they had gathered because he <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nprillinois.org/post/house-rep-ejected-face-mask-rule-breaking-state-lawmakers-greeted-protests#stream/0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">refused to wear a mask</a>. Mr. Bailey had asked an Illinois court to declare the governor&#8217;s order invalid. The governor this week sought to have the case <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ilsd.84687/gov.uscourts.ilsd.84687.1.0.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">transferred to federal court</a>, a move the Justice Department also said was wrong.</p><p class="css-53u6y8"><h2 class="css-1aoo5yy eoo0vm40" id="link-6650f83a">Airlines are permitted to stop flying to dozens of U.S. cities.</h2></p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">The Transportation Department said late Friday that it <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/22/business/coronavirus-airports-airlines.html" title="">would tentatively allow</a> 15 airlines to stop flights to about 60 mostly small and midsize cities, though none of the destinations stand to lose service entirely.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">American Airlines would be allowed to stop flying to airports in Worcester, Mass., and Aspen, Colo. Delta Air Lines would be able to stop service to Erie, Pa., and Flint, Mich. United Airlines would be able to stop flights to Fairbanks, Alaska; Kalamazoo, Mich.; and Myrtle Beach, S.C., among other locations.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">None of the cities would be left without service, the agency said, because it granted exemptions only if other airlines still flew there. Some of the affected regions are also served by other airports. </p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">The decision is rooted in the federal stimulus act passed in late March. Under that law, any airline that received federal assistance is required to maintain a minimum number of flights to locations that it had served before the pandemic. But the law also allowed the Transportation Department to grant exceptions, which it has done regularly for weeks.</p><p class="css-53u6y8"><h2 class="css-1aoo5yy eoo0vm40" id="link-b63a05d">Homeland security exempts some foreign athletes from travel restrictions. </h2><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">The Department of Homeland Security late Friday provided exemptions for certain professional athletes from its travel restrictions that Trump administration officials have said are crucial to preventing the spread of the coronavirus.</p></p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">The department said in a statement that foreign baseball, basketball, golf, hockey and tennis players, as well as their families and essential staff members, would be allowed to enter the United States. In his push to reopen the economy, President Trump has encouraged sports commissioners to resume play.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">&#8220;Professional sporting events provide much-needed economic benefits, but equally important, they provide community pride and national unity,&#8221; said Chad F. Wolf, the acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. &#8220;In today&#8217;s environment, Americans need their sports.&#8221;</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">In late January, the administration prohibited foreign travelers who had been in China within the previous 14 days from coming to the United States. The administration later put similar restrictions in place for those from Iran and many European countries, including Britain. </p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">The order on Friday said that allowing the athletes into the United States was within the &#8220;national interest.&#8221; But homeland security officials have defended using health authorities granted to the surgeon general to rapidly turn away asylum-seeking migrants at the southwestern border.</p><p class="css-53u6y8"><h2 class="css-1aoo5yy eoo0vm40" id="link-213d9627">As businesses navigate the pandemic, summer internships are sacrificed.</h2></p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">When she found out in mid-March that she had landed an internship with an education nonprofit in Washington, Lydia Burns, a senior at the University of Louisville, called her mother to celebrate.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">The euphoria lasted all of a week.

                <h4>My state is reopening. Is it safe to go out?</h4>
                <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/states-reopen-map-coronavirus.html">States are reopening bit by bit</a>. This means that more public spaces are available for use and more and more businesses are being allowed to open again. The federal government is largely leaving the decision up to states, and some state leaders are leaving the decision up to local authorities. Even if you aren&#8217;t being told to stay at home, it&#8217;s still a good idea to limit trips outside and your interaction with other people.</p>

                <h4>What&#8217;s the risk of catching coronavirus from a surface?</h4>
                <p>Touching contaminated objects and then infecting ourselves with the germs is not typically how the virus spreads. But it can happen. A number <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.905.8444&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">of studies</a> of flu, rhinovirus, coronavirus and other microbes have shown that respiratory illnesses, including the new coronavirus, can spread by touching contaminated surfaces, particularly in places like day care centers, offices and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5519164/">hospitals</a>. But a long chain of events has to happen for the disease to spread that way. The best way to protect yourself from coronavirus &#8212; whether it&#8217;s surface transmission or close human contact &#8212; is still social distancing, washing your hands, not touching your face and wearing masks.</p>

                <h4>What are the symptoms of coronavirus?</h4>
                <p>Common symptoms <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html">include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath.</a> Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html">The C.D.C. has also</a> added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.</p>

If possible, choose a window seat. A <a href="http://emoryhealthdigest.emory.edu/issues/2018/spring/from_the_well/germs-on-a-plane/index.html">study from Emory University</a> found that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. (Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.)</p>

                <h4>How many people have lost their jobs due to coronavirus in the U.S.?</h4>
                <p>More than 40 million people &#8212; the equivalent of 1 in 4 U.S. workers &#8212; have filed for unemployment benefits since the pandemic took hold. One in five who were working in February reported losing a job or being furloughed in March or the beginning of April, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/14/business/economy/coronavirus-jobless-unemployment.html">data from a Federal Reserve survey released on May 14 showed</a>, and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners. Fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning $40,000 or less lost work, compared with 13 percent in those making more than $100,000, a Fed official said.</p>

                <h4>Is &#8216;Covid toe&#8217; a symptom of the disease?</h4>
                <p>There is an uptick in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/health/coronavirus-covid-toe.html">people reporting symptoms of chilblains,</a> which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes. The lesions are emerging as yet another <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-symptoms.html">symptom</a> of infection with the new coronavirus. Chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions, but they are usually common in the coldest winter months. Federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms, but some dermatologists are pushing for a change, saying so-called Covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing.</p>

                <h4>How do I take my temperature?</h4>
                <p>Taking one&#8217;s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as &#8220;normal&#8221; temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don&#8217;t have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-temperature-fever-thermometer.html">other ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications.</a></p>

                <p>The C.D.C. has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/world/coronavirus-news-updates.html">recommended</a> that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/31/health/coronavirus-asymptomatic-transmission.html"> new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms</a>. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don&#8217;t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don&#8217;t replace hand washing and social distancing.</p>

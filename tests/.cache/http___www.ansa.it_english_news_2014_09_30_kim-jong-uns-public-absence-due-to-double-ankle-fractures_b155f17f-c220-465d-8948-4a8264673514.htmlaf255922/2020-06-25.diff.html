Jong-un's shoes have been blamed for the nearly one-month
absence of North Korea's supreme leader from public view, Chosun
Ilbo reported Tuesday.<br>The Korean news site said Kim underwent double surgery to
fix fractures in both ankles, caused by an elevation trick used
by his father Kim Jong-il. 
     The internal thickness of the shoes reportedly added
several more centimeters to the height of the shoes than what
could be seen externally.  
     The absence of the leader from any public events has been a
target of speculation since the State television KCTV announced
the leader's "indisposition" last week.<br></del></p><del> </del></div>

<p>The release opines that from a release noting support for all Batswana citizens from the Minister of International Affairs only 21 citizens have received an allowance of P1600. It is said that the city lock down has been going for 40 Days and there are possibilities of continued lock down.</p>



<p>&#8220;We plead with our government to follow the steps of other African leaders that have evacuated their people. The government through the Foreign Ministry may perhaps collaborate with South Africa which is in advanced stages of evacuated 130 of its citizens in Wuhan. Through such an agreement our health and military departments could liase with South Africa authorities to join their evacuation, &#8221; reads a part of letter released by the interim citizens committee in Wuhan.</p>



<p>The Botswana citizens in Wuhan are saying that they believe that the coalition with neighboring South Africa could help in reducing the cost of evacuation. The citizens are saying that the inability of the government to unable to offer the said provisions could lead to mental instability and that they have no social service number to reach for contact.</p>

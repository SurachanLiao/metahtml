                            <p class="yp-grid-detail-description hidden">As this print issue of STYLE (our 198th in a row!) reaches you, our world is beginning to reopen. This &#8220;happening&#8221; will be met by many with glee and others with trepidation. Our lives may never be the same again, but Americans are a resilient bunch, and we have no doubt we&#8217;ll get past this, do the right things, and move forward.

We&#8217;ve been asked why we didn&#8217;t just shut down like many other publications in the region. It&#8217;s a fair question, but within 48 hours of our governor&#8217;s &#8220;shelter-in-place&#8221; order, we knew we couldn&#8217;t&#8212;that there was still good reason to publish information and entertainment and to help maintain some level of normalcy during a time which is anything but. We&#8217;ve always taken the position that giving back to our communities is a foundational part of our company. We strive to give back in many ways&#8212;be it the arts, education, our youth, or another area that is so, so important: food. 

It&#8217;s hard to believe that in areas like ours, people go hungry every day, but they do. They are your neighbors. They are young and old; come in all shapes, sizes, and ethnicities; and many/most of them work. It&#8217;s why STYLE started a charitable endeavor six years ago, called Guitars4Food where we buy guitars, get them autographed, and give them as gifts to large donors. We are proud to tell you that G4F has now raised more than $50,000 since its launch. 

In two short months, we&#8217;ve gone from record employment to record unemployment, but you can help. Whether it&#8217;s the Placer Food Bank, Twin Lakes Food Bank, or the Food Bank of El Dorado County&#8212;even the smallest donation makes a difference. Supporting our food banks is a wonderful way to give back. Please see this month&#8217;s story, &#8220;Stepping Up to Serve,&#8221; on page 10, to learn about more ways to lend a helping hand.

And make no mistake&#8212;our ability to give back comes in large part from the support of our advertising partners. Please keep that&#8212;and them&#8212;in mind when you&#8217;re shopping (locally, we hope). Supporting these businesses is one of the best ways to say &#8220;thank you.&#8221;

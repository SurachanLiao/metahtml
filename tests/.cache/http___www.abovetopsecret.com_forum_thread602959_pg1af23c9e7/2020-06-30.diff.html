A two-volume book, which
was published originally in Arabic, was called ‘Tahrir al Wasilah’.  Translated into Farsi, the book is called “Tahrirolvasyleh.” (read entire
text here.) Khomeini also had another treatise on Islamic rules for living, called in English, “The Little Green Book.”  (see entire text
here.)  
It is useful to understand what an esteemed Islamic leader such as the Ayatollah teaches his followers.</ins></blockquote><ins> </ins><p><ins>Here are some excerpts from “Tahrirolvasyleh” which Muslims probably don’t want you to know about Islam: </ins></p><p><ins></ins></p><blockquote class="external"><ins>A man can have sexual pleasure from a child as young as a baby.  However, he should not penetrate vaginally, but sodomising the child is
acceptable.  If a man does penetrate and damage the child then, he should be responsible for her subsistence all her life.  This girl will not count
as one of his four permanent wives and the man will not be eligible to marry the girl’s sister…  It is better for a girl to marry at such a time
when she would begin menstruation at her husband’s house, rather than her father’s home.  Any father marrying his daughter so young will have a
permanent place in heaven.  ["Tahrirolvasyleh", fourth edition, Qom, Iran, 1990]</ins></blockquote><ins> </ins><p><ins>Oh but it gets better, as if that isn't bad enough! </ins></p><p><ins></ins></p><blockquote class="external"><ins>A man can have sex with animals such as sheep, cows, camels and so on.  However, he should kill the animal after he has his orgasm.  He should not
sell the meat to the people in his own village, but selling the meat to a neighbouring village is reasonable.    
  
If one commits the act of sodomy with a cow, a ewe, or a camel, their urine and their excrement become impure and even their milk may no longer be
consumed.  The animal must then be killed as quickly as possible and burned.</ins></blockquote><ins> </ins><p><ins><a href="http://www.uncoverage.net/2010/03/the-ayatollah-khomeinis-booksex-with-children-and-animals/" target="_blank" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">www.uncoverage.net...

many religions written) and if mating pleaseure (without repurcussion) is so valued, then without a doubt, the human race still has not
eveolved......We will still end up back to food, shelter, clothing, and dont forget grabbing anything available when the urge arises. </p><p>Oh, and am not picking on all men in general, but face it, many religions were created by men, and there is so much surrounding mens desires being
met. Women suffered so much for so long through all that decietful rubbish. There are some things in religion that folks are taught which truly is
wrong...... </p><p>got into a rant there, I apologize, but have to say how I feel and about what I have seen and heard for a long time. It is always power (starting or
enforcing a religion), control (the masses and even females), and deciete  (getting away with it all because "god" said so)....My opinion of god is
not good if people are told so much evil crap. </p><p>Like I said, doing waht is good in your hearts is the true way, whether you wear a religious label or not....problem is, if you dont conform to the
B.S. you are considered non-so-and-so.  Do whats right. </p><p>Also to some of those fellas out there who just gotta have "it". Learn to control yourself, not use some kid, animal, or force a woman to
comply....seek some help. There IS NO excuse.				</p> <p id="L1" class="rsinfo3"><ins>new topics</ins></p><ul class="feedContainer"><li><ins><a href="http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread1267385/pg1" class="H4">Consciousness is bigger than materialism Link: http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread1267385/pg1 </a> <span class="postedtoday nF">Philosophy and Metaphysics</span><span class="postedtoday normal nF">: 2 hours ago</span> </ins></li><ins> </ins><li><ins><a href="http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread1267384/pg1" class="H4 active">Senate Republicans squeeze Trump over Russian bounties Link: http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread1267384/pg1 </a> <span class="postedtoday nF">Breaking Political News</span><span class="postedtoday normal nF">: 2 hours ago</span> </ins></li><ins> </ins><li><ins><a href="http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread1267383/pg1" class="H4">US Revokes Hong Kong Special Status, Ends Exports of Defence Equipment, Sensitive Technologies Link: http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread1267383/pg1 </a> <span class="postedtoday nF">Other Current Events</span><span class="postedtoday normal nF">: 3 hours ago</span> </ins></li><ins> </ins><li><ins><a href="http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread1267382/pg1" class="H4 active">83 Tons Of Fake Gold Bars: Gold Market Rocked By Massive China Counterfeiting Scandal Link: http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread1267382/pg1 </a> <span class="postedtoday nF">Other Current Events</span><span class="postedtoday normal nF">: 4 hours ago</span> </ins></li><ins> </ins><li><ins><a href="http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread1267377/pg1" class="H4 active">4th shooting in the Seattle chop and Protests outside the Mayors Mansion Link: http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread1267377/pg1 </a> <span class="postedtoday nF">Social Issues and Civil Unrest</span><span class="postedtoday normal nF">: 4 hours ago</span> </ins></li><ins> </ins><li><ins><a href="http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread1267376/pg1" class="H4 active">Mayan Calendar Rainbow Study (202x) Link: http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread1267376/pg1 </a> <span class="postedtoday nF">2012</span><span class="postedtoday normal nF">: 5 hours ago</span> </ins></li><ins> </ins><li><ins><a href="http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread1267375/pg1" class="H4 active">A landlords story.

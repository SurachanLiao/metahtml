		<p class="KonaBody">				Yeah, skunk works. Because I don't know if this is true, but it appears to be. Now this is totally just WACK, if it IS true. </p><p>
<blockquote class="external"> The leader of the Iranian Revolution in 1989, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, wrote extensively on Islamic Jurisprudence.   A two-volume book, which
was published originally in Arabic, was called &#8216;Tahrir al Wasilah&#8217;.  Translated into Farsi, the book is called &#8220;Tahrirolvasyleh.&#8221; (read entire
text here.) Khomeini also had another treatise on Islamic rules for living, called in English, &#8220;The Little Green Book.&#8221;  (see entire text
here.)  
It is useful to understand what an esteemed Islamic leader such as the Ayatollah teaches his followers.</blockquote> </p><p>
Here are some excerpts from &#8220;Tahrirolvasyleh&#8221; which Muslims probably don&#8217;t want you to know about Islam: </p><p>
<blockquote class="external"> A man can have sexual pleasure from a child as young as a baby.  However, he should not penetrate vaginally, but sodomising the child is
acceptable.  If a man does penetrate and damage the child then, he should be responsible for her subsistence all her life.  This girl will not count
as one of his four permanent wives and the man will not be eligible to marry the girl&#8217;s sister&#8230;  It is better for a girl to marry at such a time
when she would begin menstruation at her husband&#8217;s house, rather than her father&#8217;s home.  Any father marrying his daughter so young will have a
permanent place in heaven.  ["Tahrirolvasyleh", fourth edition, Qom, Iran, 1990]</blockquote> </p><p>
Oh but it gets better, as if that isn't bad enough! </p><p>
<blockquote class="external"> A man can have sex with animals such as sheep, cows, camels and so on.  However, he should kill the animal after he has his orgasm.  He should not
sell the meat to the people in his own village, but selling the meat to a neighbouring village is reasonable.    
  
If one commits the act of sodomy with a cow, a ewe, or a camel, their urine and their excrement become impure and even their milk may no longer be
consumed.  The animal must then be killed as quickly as possible and burned.</blockquote> </p><p>

If you enjoy vomiting, go ahead, read some more at the link. </p><p>
I mean come on. How can any decent human being find this acceptable?   </p><p>
So is this considered radical Islam? Or is this just your everyday, run of the mill stuff here for these freaks?				</p>

Is this true, can someone corroborate it? Is this still being done today? </p><p>
About the Ayatollah's books, I want Muslims to answer these question. </p><p>
This is your religious leaders books on his interpretation of your holy laws.  This is not for extremist Muslims, but for all Muslims is it not?</p><p>
That being the case, are you obligated to follow these by your religious laws? </p><p>

		<p class="KonaBody">				I don't think this is normal for Muslims. I work with a guy who has been in the states for 7 Months and is from Iraq, even brought his whole family
over here. He's fasting right now for Ramadan. </p><p>
From what he says, the majority of Muslims aren't the fundamentalist that the mainstream media and conspiracy sites like ATS paint them to be.
(imagine that folks). </p><p>
It also seems that the government of the state which has a majority of Muslim citizens is what guides the power of the religion. He makes a huge
distinction between Iraq, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and how they generally "practice Islam"... </p><p>
I asked him one day, because I had seen some news stories about how "women were now lining up to vote" in Iraqi elections before. Everything the MSN
was reporting insinuated that woman were just given the right, when in fact they had it all along. Same with Iran. </p><p>
Basically, I get the idea from him that Saudi Arabia is one of the worst "Muslim" countries and that it gives Islam a bad name around the world
because people think of the "Middle East" as a single unit that follows the same application of a religion. </p><p>

		<p class="KonaBody">				Not meaning to pick on anyone in particular, but in my opinion, most religions (just like laws) were created to benefit the desires of men. </p><p>
I seriously say that men need to know tolerance, but I am sure that many can be weak when it comes to those urges.....Well, alot of little religious
laws accomodate that with plenty of excuse. Like hell some guy will support a very young child if he damages her----the way it goes is the victim is
killed. </p><p>
Women are forced to comply and not say a word about so much....In my opinion, a man and a woman must both agree to the acts....So many times I have
heard that women get riduculed by guys sometimes because the woman doesnt feel like sharing her personal body with someone. </p><p>
And yes, if you think that Ayatollah stuff is out there, seriously, the Talmud has some bad stuff regarding Goy---(non-Jews). And THEY call themselves
children of god? </p><p>
I will say it again, that what ever being known as "god" enjoys poverty, rape, incest, wars, blood, death, deciept (the list is near endless), then
that being is one EVIL piece of crap and people have been had..... </p><p>
Big time...  I want to try to look also for the source of the story of this thread, but then again, it does not surprise me, because it very well
could be true.  </p><p>
All I can say is whether you are christian, Muslim, etc, follow what is good, know what is true in your hearts, and feel the difference between B.S.
and true light.  </p><p>
It peeves me, though sometimes to hear abut this Virgins in heaven crap....It seems undoubtly that things do revolve around mens desires (according to
many religions written) and if mating pleaseure (without repurcussion) is so valued, then without a doubt, the human race still has not
eveolved......We will still end up back to food, shelter, clothing, and dont forget grabbing anything available when the urge arises. </p><p>
Oh, and am not picking on all men in general, but face it, many religions were created by men, and there is so much surrounding mens desires being
met. Women suffered so much for so long through all that decietful rubbish. There are some things in religion that folks are taught which truly is
wrong...... </p><p>
got into a rant there, I apologize, but have to say how I feel and about what I have seen and heard for a long time. It is always power (starting or
enforcing a religion), control (the masses and even females), and deciete  (getting away with it all because "god" said so)....My opinion of god is
not good if people are told so much evil crap. </p><p>
Like I said, doing waht is good in your hearts is the true way, whether you wear a religious label or not....problem is, if you dont conform to the
B.S. you are considered non-so-and-so.  Do whats right. </p><p>
Also to some of those fellas out there who just gotta have "it". Learn to control yourself, not use some kid, animal, or force a woman to
comply....seek some help. There IS NO excuse.				</p>

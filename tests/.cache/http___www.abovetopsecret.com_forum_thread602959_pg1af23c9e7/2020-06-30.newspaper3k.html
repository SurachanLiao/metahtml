<div><p class="KonaBody">				Not meaning to pick on anyone in particular, but in my opinion, most religions (just like laws) were created to benefit the desires of men. <br>
I seriously say that men need to know tolerance, but I am sure that many can be weak when it comes to those urges.....Well, alot of little religious
laws accomodate that with plenty of excuse. Like hell some guy will support a very young child if he damages her----the way it goes is the victim is
killed. <br>
Women are forced to comply and not say a word about so much....In my opinion, a man and a woman must both agree to the acts....So many times I have
heard that women get riduculed by guys sometimes because the woman doesnt feel like sharing her personal body with someone. <br>
 <br>
And yes, if you think that Ayatollah stuff is out there, seriously, the Talmud has some bad stuff regarding Goy---(non-Jews). And THEY call themselves
children of god? <br>
 <br>
I will say it again, that what ever being known as "god" enjoys poverty, rape, incest, wars, blood, death, deciept (the list is near endless), then
that being is one EVIL piece of crap and people have been had..... <br>
Big time...  I want to try to look also for the source of the story of this thread, but then again, it does not surprise me, because it very well
could be true.  <br>
 <br>
All I can say is whether you are christian, Muslim, etc, follow what is good, know what is true in your hearts, and feel the difference between B.S.
and true light.  <br>
 <br>
It peeves me, though sometimes to hear abut this Virgins in heaven crap....It seems undoubtly that things do revolve around mens desires (according to
many religions written) and if mating pleaseure (without repurcussion) is so valued, then without a doubt, the human race still has not
eveolved......We will still end up back to food, shelter, clothing, and dont forget grabbing anything available when the urge arises. <br>
 <br>
Oh, and am not picking on all men in general, but face it, many religions were created by men, and there is so much surrounding mens desires being
met. Women suffered so much for so long through all that decietful rubbish. There are some things in religion that folks are taught which truly is
wrong...... <br>
got into a rant there, I apologize, but have to say how I feel and about what I have seen and heard for a long time. It is always power (starting or
enforcing a religion), control (the masses and even females), and deciete  (getting away with it all because "god" said so)....My opinion of god is
not good if people are told so much evil crap. <br>
 <br>
Like I said, doing waht is good in your hearts is the true way, whether you wear a religious label or not....problem is, if you dont conform to the
B.S. you are considered non-so-and-so.  Do whats right. <br>
 <br>
Also to some of those fellas out there who just gotta have "it". Learn to control yourself, not use some kid, animal, or force a woman to
comply....seek some help. There IS NO excuse.				</p>

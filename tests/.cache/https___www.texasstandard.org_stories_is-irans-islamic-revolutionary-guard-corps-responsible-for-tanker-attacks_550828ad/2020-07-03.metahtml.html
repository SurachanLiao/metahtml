<p><span>Thursday, in the Gulf of Oman, explosions rocked a pair of oil tankers, leaving both adrift. This, only one month after four tankers were sabotaged in a port in the United Arab Emirates.</span></p>
<p><span>As CNBC reported Friday morning, Middle East analysts </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/14/middle-east-analysts-see-irans-fingerprint-on-tanker-attacks.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>see Iran&#8217;s fingerprints</span></a><span> on these attacks, which occurred in an area where a third of the world&#8217;s shipped oil passes. And that&#8217;s fueling fear in energy markets that could send prices of West Texas Crude soaring, as the risk of war with Iran rises.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.militarytimes.com/author/shawn-snow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Shawn Snow</span></a><span> is covering the story for Military Times. He says Iran&#8217;s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or IRGC, would have multiple reasons for launching an attack on the tankers. They include domestic political differences with Iran&#8217;s president, and a different stance on U.S. sanctions against Iran than the government has maintained.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Also, it would be advantageous for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps to maintain the status quo with the sanctions regime, because the sanctions, as a lot of outlets have reported previously, have actually empowered the IRGC,&#8221; Snow says.</span></p>
<p><span>The IRGC plays a large role in the Iranian economy, Snow says, and it even colludes with oil smugglers in the region.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;The sanctions have only strengthened the IRGC&#8217;s economic clout in the region,&#8221; he says.</span></p>
<p><span>In fact, Snow says, the IRGC has absorbed economic activity previously carried out by businesses that have been forced to leave the region by sanctions against Iran.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;We&#8217;ve seen in the past, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps use attacks similar to the ones we saw yesterday, and the ones in May as a way to sometimes spike oil prices in the region,&#8221; Snow says.</span></p>

    <p>Officials in California and Oregon are also worried about the novel coronavirus spreading through West Coast communities because people are being infected by unknown means.&#160;</p>                                            <p>COVID-19 is a member of the coronavirus family and is related to the SARS and MERS viruses that have caused outbreaks in the past. &#160;</p>                                            <p>President Donald Trump addressed the nation on Saturday about the coronavirus threat, saying the U.S. is &#8220;super prepared&#8221; for a wider coronavirus outbreak and &#8220;there&#8217;s no reason to panic.&#8221; He spoke after officials reported the first death from the disease in the U.S. Officials say the man had a high medical risk before contracting the virus.&#160;</p>                                            <p>Trump and other officials announced the U.S. is banning travel to Iran and urging Americans not to travel to regions of Italy and South Korea where the virus has been prevalent.

"Israel is a satanic media outlet with bombers. Every Muslim is required to arm themselves against Israel."</p><p>"I have already noted the usurper state of Israel poses a grave threat to Islam and Muslim countries. Islam and Muslim states must not lose this opportunity to remove the corruption from out midst. All of our problems are because of Israel - Israel of America."</p><p>"The first step should be the absolute destruction of Israel. To this end, Iran could make use of long-range missiles. The distance between us is only 2,600 KM. It can be done in minutes."</p><p>The crux of the piece says Iran would be justified in launching a pre-emptive strike against Israel because of the threat the Jewish state's leaders are posing against its own nuclear facilities.</p><p>However, during a lengthy discussion of the 'jurisprudence of Jihad,' the article makes it clear that an Israeli strike 'isn't required' and would ultimately serve as a pretext for genocide.</p><p>Instead, he says 'defensive Jihad' justifies annihilating Israel and targeting its civilian population because Israel has "spilled Muslim blood" and "oppresses" its Muslim neighbors.</p><p>"With regard to the fake state of Israel in Palestine, which is included in the first Qibla of Muslims, we must defend the sacred blood of Muslims in Islamic Palestine using any means necessary," it goes on to explain.</p><p>"If the enemy should invade Muslim lands and spill Muslim blood, it is obligatory upon the Muslim masses to use every means possible to defend the lives and property of their brothers. It does not require a judge's permission.</p><p>"But regardless of the Israeli aggression against Palestine and the Muslims, it is clear the heads of this fake regime seek to dominate other Islamic lands on its borders and to develop hegemony over the region," it reads.</p><p>The article makes it clear Iran sees no place in the Middle East for the Jews.</p><p>"Political subdivisions of states and political boundaries between units are not relevant and what is important is to divide the nations and territories based on beliefs and religions groups, blood and blood. Muslim blood must be separate from Infidel blood," it says, citing Khameini's writings.</p><p>The document then cites statistics saying 5.7 million of Israel's 7.5 million citizens are Jewish - as a justification for attack. It then proceeds to break down Israel by region and demographic concentrations in order that the most Jews possible would be killed.</p><p>It specifically states that Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and Haifa ,contain more than 60 per cent of the Jewish population, which could be hit by Shahab 3 ballistic missiles to "easily kill everyone."</p><p>The publication of the doctrine comes after Khamenei announced on Friday that Iran would support any nation or group that attacks the 'cancerous tumor' of Israel.</p><p>Since its publications several Iranian officials have called for a strike on Israel "within the year."</p></article>

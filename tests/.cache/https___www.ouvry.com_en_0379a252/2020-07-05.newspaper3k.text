The Congrès national des sapeurs-pompiers is both a trade show, an opportunity to examine the French model of civil security and a time for friendly exchanges for firefighters from all the departmental fire and rescue services in France.

It is also a unique opportunity for companies involved in the world of civil security and internal security to exchange ideas and present the progress and technological advances of French and European know-how.

The 127th edition of the National Congress of the French Fire Brigade will take place in Marseille, in the Bouches-du-Rhône department (13), from 14 to 17 October 2020!

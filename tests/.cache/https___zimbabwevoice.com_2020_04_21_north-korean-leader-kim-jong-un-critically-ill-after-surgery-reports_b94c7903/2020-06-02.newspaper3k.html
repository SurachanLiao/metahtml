<div><p>NORTH Korean leader Kim Jong Un is reportedly in &#8220;grave danger&#8221; following a surgical procedure, CNN and Reuters report.</p>



<p>The 37-year-old dictator underwent a cardiovascular procedure, state media indicates.</p>



<p>The South Korean Government on Tuesday was looking into the reports. Officials from South Korea&#8217;s Unification Ministry and National Intelligence Service said they couldn&#8217;t immediately confirm the report.</p><p class="code-block code-block-1">
 
 

</p>




<p>Rumours began to swirl about Jong Un&#8217;s health after he did not attend an anniversary event for the birthday of its founding father and Kim&#8217;s grandfather, Kim Il Sun.</p>



<p>&#8220;My understanding is that he had been struggling (with cardiovascular problems) since last August but it worsened after repeated visits to Mount Paektu,&#8221; Daily NK reported.</p>



<p>Daily NK is a website based in South Korea that gathers information from informants inside the secretive and isolated country north of its border.</p><p class="code-block code-block-1">
 
 

</p>




<p>Bloomberg said the health of the North Korean leader is one of the state&#8217;s most closely guarded secrets, typically only known by a handful of people in the inner circle of leadership.</p>



<p>New Zealand-born journalist Anna Fifield, author of a book on Jong Un, said on Twitter his biggest risk factor was his obvious poor health, in particular the risk of cardiac problems.</p>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Breaking: The US is monitoring intelligence that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un&#8217;s health is in grave danger following a surgery, a US official with direct knowledge tells me.</p>&#8212; Jim Sciutto (@jimsciutto) <a href="https://twitter.com/jimsciutto/status/1252411218720985094?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 21, 2020</a></blockquote> 




<p>&#8220;Kim Jong Un is five feet, seven inches tall, and weighs about three hundred pounds = BMI of 45, or &#8216;extremely obese&#8217;,&#8221; she wrote.</p><p class="code-block code-block-1">
 
 

</p>




<p>Three hundred pounds is the equivalent of about 136 kilograms.</p>



<p>&#8220;There have been a number of recent rumours about Kim&#8217;s health (smoking, heart, and brain). If Kim is hospitalised, it would explain why he wasn&#8217;t present on the important April 15th celebrations,&#8221; former CIA deputy division chief for North Korea Bruce Klingner told CNN.</p>



<p>&#8220;But, over the years, there have been a number of false health rumours about Kim Jong Un or his father. We&#8217;ll have to wait and see.&#8221;</p><p class="code-block code-block-1">
 
 

</p>




<p>Kim Jong Un is one of the world&#8217;s most mysterious men, with very little known about his private life and childhood &#8212; apart from a string of bizarre myths, such as his weather-controlling powers.</p>



<p>However, in her book, The Great Successor, Fifield managed to dig up some fascinating details of the leader&#8217;s personal life.</p>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">In my book "The Great Successor," I wrote that Kim Jong Un's biggest risk factor was his obvious poor health &#8212; and in particular the risk of cardiac problems. <br><br>Kim Jong Un is five feet, seven inches tall, and weighs about three hundred pounds = BMI of 45, or "extremely obese" <a href="https://t.co/04EsZfuues">pic.twitter.com/04EsZfuues</a></p>&#8212; Anna Fifield (@annafifield) <a href="https://twitter.com/annafifield/status/1252414533391405056?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 21, 2020</a></blockquote> 




<p>In an interview with Vox last year, she described him as a pampered child raised to believe his own greatness.</p><p class="code-block code-block-1">

<p>&#8220;He was a spoiled brat. He was brought up to believe that he was a demigod from the age of 3or 4, probably as long as he can remember. He was given a specially modified car so he could drive it himself at the age of 7,&#8221; she told the publication.</p>



<p>&#8220;Then there was the time the family&#8217;s personal sushi chef, who had basically been hired to be Kim&#8217;s friend, went fishing for sea bass with Kim and his brother.&#8221; &#8211; <strong>Agencies</strong> </p>

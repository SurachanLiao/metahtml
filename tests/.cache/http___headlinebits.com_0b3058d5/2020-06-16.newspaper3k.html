</h4>
</a>
<p class="limited">Max Rushden, Troy Townsend, Elliot Ross and Jordan Jarrett-Bryan discuss football&#8217;s reaction to the Black Lives Matter protests following the death of George Floyd and ask whether this reaction is good enough. They also look inwards and ask questions about black representation in sports media, as well as discussing some of the incidents that have marred football since our last special on racism
As a follow up to our racism special that we recorded last October, we take another look at race...</p>

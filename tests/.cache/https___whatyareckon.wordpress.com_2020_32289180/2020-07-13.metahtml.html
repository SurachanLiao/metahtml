<p>This is a follow up to yesterday&#8217;s blog on EARLY CHILD QUEER THINKING. There is a lot that is irritating here, at least to this blogger, and one major irritation is that the New South Wales government is paying for this monster. Like I said yesterday, ever since the Garden of Eden when God had to thrust our great grand parents out of the Garden the world has been in rebellion against God the Creator. The following is an example of how the Marxist, Leftist, Loony, Lovies are seeking out your children to mold them into this new society. </p>



 



<p>&#8216;As society changes, the issues we face in early childhood change. Things we may have never thought of impacting on our work, now do. Things like sexuality and gender.</p>



<p>Our services are now working with children who identify with a different gender, with same sex parents, with openly gay and lesbian educators. And, importantly how we deal with these issues are part of the National Quality Standard!</p>



<p>But how do we learn about them? We now know a lot more about gender and sexuality than we probably did when you studied at Uni or TAFE. But, till now, there has never been a course where you could learn about things such as:</p>



<p>&#8226; how to do inclusion right for children and families of all genders and sexualities &#8226; what the I in LGBTI+ actually means &#8226; unknowing discrimination of children and families &#8226; rainbow families &#8226; heterosexual, lesbian, and, gay educators</p>



<p>But now there is.</p>



<p>&#8216;My friend has 2 mums&#8217;: exploring gender and sexuality in early education and care, is the course you need to learn all the things you&#8217;ve wondered about.&#8217;</p>



<h4>&#8216;Course Content and Presenters:</h4>



<p>The content videos will consist of interviews between Dr Red Ruby Scarlet and those listed below:Module 1.&#160;&#160;Queer Thinking in Early Childhood&#160;&#8211; Professor Kerry H Robinson                                                                                       Module 2.&#160;&#160;The National Quality Framework&#160;&#8211; Nicholas Stewart               Module 3.&#160;&#160;Putting Inclusive Policies in Place&#160;&#8211; Anthony Semann               Module 4.&#160;&#160;Using Anti-Bias Approaches&#160;&#8211; Jill Huntley                                Module 5.&#160;&#160;A Transgender Early Childhood Educator&#160;&#8211; Sharon Priestley                 Module 6.&#160;&#160;Heterosexuality as an Identity&#160;&#8211; Michael McGirr                      Module 7.&#160;&#160;Transitioning&#160;as Parents &#8211; Teighan &amp; Tammie Cosier               Module 8.&#160;&#160;Queer Pedagogies&#160;&#8211; Stephen Gallen                                                       Module 9.&#160; &#160;Intersex Identities&#160;&#8211; Dr Agli Zavros-Orr                                    Module 10.&#160;Living Non-Binary&#160;&#8211; Danny Xanadu                                               Module 11.&#160;Leadership and Life&#160;&#8211; Sarah Louise &amp; Ace Dean                                   Module 12.&#160;Aboriginal Queerness and Queeness&#160;&#8211; Nana Miss Koori/Graham Simms                                                                                                                   Module 13.&#160;Rainbow Families&#160;&#8211; Ashley Scott and Cathy Brown&#8217; <a href="https://multiverse.com.au/my-friend-has-two-mums/">https://multiverse.com.au/my-friend-has-two-mums/</a></p>



<p>Here is something that should cause some REAL concern for those who still have a moral compass. The following are testimonials from past participants of this sexually deviant rebellious anti-God NSW government sponsored course.</p>



<p>&#8216;&#8220;My Friend has Two Mums&#8221; is the course on gender and sexuality that I didn&#8217;t realise I was needing. I signed up on a whim, and it turns out this has been the most significant professional development of my career. The&#160;long term&#160;structure of this course allowed me to absorb the information, process how I could put this new knowledge into action at my service, and bounce ideas off the supportive Facebook group &#8211; all before moving onto the next content piece.&#160;</p>



<p>Through this learning our service has been able to build on our sexuality and diversity resources and policy, develop LGBTQIA+ support networks, and look at our paperwork through a queer lens to build on our inclusive practice. I strongly endorse this course for all early childhood professionals, as you will gain so much from the content both individually and for your service.&#8221;&#160;Tash Croft</p>



<p>Director,&#160;Cooks Hill Preschool&#8217;  The Cook Hills Preschool&#8217;s web site <a href="https://cookshillpreschool.com/">https://cookshillpreschool.com/</a> was in maintenance mode when I went to it.</p>



<p>This is from a kindergarten teacher!  </p>



<p>&#8216;&#8220;My friend has two mums&#8221; is an absolutely brilliant course for all early childhood educators. For me as an early childhood teacher, I used to struggle with how to tackle gender and sexuality bias among children. For some people, it can be challenging and even hard to bring it up. After taking this course, I started to look into my practice and put my queer lens on, especially in children&#8217;s play and how the room is set up. I enjoyed the theoretical part of this course which lays the foundation of the anti-bias practice. I particularly enjoyed the interviews with different guest speakers and listening to their stories, which left me with heaps questions to think about. I am a practitioner of the anti-bias approach and I am just grateful about the existence of this course which gave me some really good perspectives on how to practice the anti-bias approach in a genuine and meaningful way&#160;&#8211;&#160;so much love for this course and everyone who was involved.&#8221;&#160;                                                                                                          Sylvana Li                                                                                                    Kindergarten Teacher&#8217;</p>



<p>&#8220;In signing up for My Friend Has Two Mums,&#160;I&#160;envisioned getting a range of resources and connections that would expand my knowledge and passion for an area of human development&#160;i&#160;found intriguing. What&#160;I&#160;didn&#8217;t expect was the multiple other doors, concepts and ways of thinking that&#160;I&#160;would engage with. I found myself challenging my practice, my thought processes and the learning community around me. I went on a journey into the depths of my personal soul that allowed me to reconnect with who&#160;I&#160;am and how&#160;I&#160;connect with others. This is a course that&#160;educators must sign up for to expand their knowledge and ways of thinking around inclusion. Those that do join should ultimately be prepared for the life this will take on and the ripples that will form around you in the most magical way.&#8221;&#160;                             Alistair Gibbs                                                                                                     Director,&#160;Lady Gowrie Victoria&#8217;                                                                          Now, a little web search reveals some interesting background about Mr. Gibbs. </p>



<p>&#8216;Alistair jumped into the Master of Teaching for early childhood which quickly reaffirmed the affinity he felt with the early years.&#160;</p>



<p>Alistair said that he could see how the work done in early childhood had the power to set children up for their future: &#8220;really getting to the core of their development, their emotions, their abilities, their thirst and drive to better themselves and get to their next stage of development.&#8221;</p>



<p>It was in the kindergarten classroom that Alistair started to notice little things that piqued his curiosity.</p>



<p>One day, a corner was turned into the hairdressers with makeup and that type of thing. It was imaginative play, role play, pretend play- all wonderful for a child&#8217;s skill development. It was the children&#8217;s response that surprised Alistair, when he stepped in to relieve the female educator:</p>



<p>&#8220;I mimicked the exact same actions and language she was using within the space- which was, &#8216;can you make me look pretty&#8217; and the response the children gave me was, &#8216;No. You&#8217;re not allowed to be pretty, you&#8217;re handsome. Girls are pretty, boys are handsome.&#8217; I started to really question, where does this from?&#8221;</p>



<p>What stemmed from this was a learning course for Alistair himself and for the children he worked with. Both prompted one another with their curiosity and imagination. Alistair said that he aimed to tackle gender stereotypes through his own actions, his language and through the experiences the educators were providing for the kids.</p>



<p>&#8220;I then extended that further into different people&#8217;s abilities and how we could support and help each other in different ways.&#8221;</p>



<p>Alistair said he had the desire to share his findings and the experiences he was going through with others.</p>



<p>&#8220;I started to seek out conferences that I could speak at and different ways that I could engage in different learnings and different ways to support other people&#8217;s thinking and other people&#8217;s practice.&#8221;</p>



<p>He was keenly interested in bias in the early years in the most practical sense. He was drawing upon his own experiences and much like the BBC documentary, No More Boys and Girls: Can Our Kids Go Gender Free?, research was backing up his own observations that stereotypes were established at quite an early age.</p>



<p>&#8220;When I took on a role that allowed us to engage in these practices through a whole centre approach, it wasn&#8217;t necessarily to announce that we were doing gender or anti-bias or anything like that, we simply started asking families- what bias do you face. What do you come up against and people started to put up responses.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;People started talking about their age or their gender or their sexuality or their parenting skills.&#8221;&#8217;</p>



<p>&#8216;Alistair is now an Early Learning Manager at Gowrie Victoria, a not-for-profit organisation that specialises in championing good early childhood education through their early learning services as well as professional development and accredited training courses to the early childhood and education sector.&#8217; <a href="https://www.playgroupblog.org/alistair-gibbs">https://www.playgroupblog.org/alistair-gibbs</a></p>



<p>I&#8217;ll finish these testimonials with this one. &#8216;Do you want access to some brilliant minds who understand (and live) advocacy around gender and sexuality and their beautiful&#160;venn-diagramminess&#160;with&#160;early&#160;childhood practice? Are you looking for a new lens with which to view humanity and our ethical responsibilities to the wonderfully diverse children, families and colleagues within our profession and community?&#160;</p>



<p>This course is the full package -&#8239;&#160;</p>



<ul><li>get clear explanations and demystifications of sex, gender, orientation, and the ways we identify ourselves on the spectrum of human sexuality</li><li>consider what this beautiful rainbow spectrum means in our practice and what thinking we may need to shift or expand to see from new (child and adult) perspectives&#8239;</li><li>critique the messages that mainstream binaryheterornormativestandards send to children from birth and the exclusion that is all around us (once you see it clearly, you see it everywhere&#8230;&#160;you know? &#8216;I see heteronormatively-biased people. All the time. Walking around.&#8239; They don&#8217;t know they&#8217;re biased&#8230;&#8217;)&#160;</li><li>learn a squillion affirming strategies &#8211; from tweaking forms to reflect family reality, to resourcing and supporting play, to advocating with your peers (you won&#8216;t be a lone voice in this&#8230;you&#8217;ll have Red and a great group of interactive kindred colleagues along with you on your journey).&#160;</li><li>hear from academics, practitioners, families, lawyers (well, one), artists &#8211;pioneers in our diverse landscape whose lived experiences add priceless richness to this important learning.</li></ul>



<p>I didn&#8217;t quite expect the impact this course would have on my personal and professional selves! (Intrinsically &#8216;entwingled&#8216; as they are&#160;&#128521;).&#160;</p>



<p>I have learnt so&#160;much, (aka blown my mind) and as well as working away at changing aspects of practice in my current workspace, I am now looking at moving into this area of work in the&#160;early&#160;childhood and&#160;community sector. I have growing engagement with the Queer community, have challenged&#160;lil&#160;ol&#8216; me to live my own authentic self, have been on a beautiful advocacy journey with one of my offspring, have met amazing new people and learned first-hand how demystifying and celebrating diverse gender and sexuality is the only route that makes sense.&#8239;&#160;</p>



<p>This course is a springboard for diving into wonderful new waters! Truly transformative!&#8239;&#160;</p>



<p>(Red, thankyou from the bottom, sides and top of my heart for all the you&#160;you&#160;have put into this&#160;ground-breaking&#160;course!)&#8239;                                    Peta Fitzpartick                                                                                                     Family Day Care Coordinator&#160;,&#160;Wesley Mission Queensland&#8221; <a href="https://multiverse.com.au/my-friend-has-two-mums/">https://multiverse.com.au/my-friend-has-two-mums/</a></p>



<p>A government that uses tax dollars to pay for this sexual deviant teaching should be charged with child abuse. Society and governments are so rebellious to the things of God that what we have just been reading is the so-called norm for them. However, the above teaching is not for the true born again Bible believing parents that desire the best for their children to be able to go out and live as a good citizen in this world. </p>



<p>Matthew 19:14 &#8230;Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.</p>

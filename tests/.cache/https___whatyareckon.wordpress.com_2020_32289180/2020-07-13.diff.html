There is a lot that is irritating here, at least to this blogger, and one major irritation is that the New South Wales government is paying for this monster. Like I said yesterday, ever since the Garden of Eden when God had to thrust our great grand parents out of the Garden the world has been in rebellion against God the Creator. The following is an example of how the Marxist, Leftist, Loony, Lovies are seeking out your children to mold them into this new society. </ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>‘As society changes, the issues we face in early childhood change. Things we may have never thought of impacting on our work, now do. Things like sexuality and gender.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Our services are now working with children who identify with a different gender, with same sex parents, with openly gay and lesbian educators. And, importantly how we deal with these issues are part of the National Quality Standard!</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>But how do we learn about them? We now know a lot more about gender and sexuality than we probably did when you studied at Uni or TAFE. But, till now, there has never been a course where you could learn about things such as:</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>• how to do inclusion right for children and families of all genders and sexualities • what the I in LGBTI+ actually means • unknowing discrimination of children and families • rainbow families • heterosexual, lesbian, and, gay educators</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>But now there is.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>‘My friend has 2 mums’: exploring gender and sexuality in early education and care, is the course you need to learn all the things you’ve wondered about.’</ins></p><ins> </ins><h4><ins>‘Course Content and Presenters:</ins></h4><ins> </ins><p><ins>The content videos will consist of interviews between Dr Red Ruby Scarlet and those listed below:Module 1.  Queer Thinking in Early Childhood – Professor Kerry H Robinson                                                                                       Module 2.  The National Quality Framework – Nicholas Stewart               Module 3.  Putting Inclusive Policies in Place – Anthony Semann               Module 4.  Using Anti-Bias Approaches – Jill Huntley                                Module 5.  A Transgender Early Childhood Educator – Sharon Priestley                 Module 6.  Heterosexuality as an Identity – Michael McGirr                      Module 7.  Transitioning as Parents – Teighan &amp; Tammie Cosier               Module 8.  Queer Pedagogies – Stephen Gallen                                                       Module 9.   Intersex Identities – Dr Agli Zavros-Orr                                    Module 10. Living Non-Binary – Danny Xanadu                                               Module 11. Leadership and Life – Sarah Louise &amp; Ace Dean                                   Module 12. Aboriginal Queerness and Queeness – Nana Miss Koori/Graham Simms                                                                                                                   Module 13. Rainbow Families – Ashley Scott and Cathy Brown’ <a href="https://multiverse.com.au/my-friend-has-two-mums/">https://multiverse.com.au/my-friend-has-two-mums/ Link: https://multiverse.com.au/my-friend-has-two-mums/ </a></ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Here is something that should cause some REAL concern for those who still have a moral compass. The following are testimonials from past participants of this sexually deviant rebellious anti-God NSW government sponsored course.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>‘“My Friend has Two Mums” is the course on gender and sexuality that I didn’t realise I was needing. I signed up on a whim, and it turns out this has been the most significant professional development of my career. The long term structure of this course allowed me to absorb the information, process how I could put this new knowledge into action at my service, and bounce ideas off the supportive Facebook group – all before moving onto the next content piece. </ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Through this learning our service has been able to build on our sexuality and diversity resources and policy, develop LGBTQIA+ support networks, and look at our paperwork through a queer lens to build on our inclusive practice. I strongly endorse this course for all early childhood professionals, as you will gain so much from the content both individually and for your service.” Tash Croft</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Director, Cooks Hill Preschool’  The Cook Hills Preschool’s web site <a href="https://cookshillpreschool.com/">https://cookshillpreschool.com/ Link: https://cookshillpreschool.com/ </a> was in maintenance mode when I went to it.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>This is from a kindergarten teacher!  </ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>‘“My friend has two mums” is an absolutely brilliant course for all early childhood educators. For me as an early childhood teacher, I used to struggle with how to tackle gender and sexuality bias among children. For some people, it can be challenging and even hard to bring it up. After taking this course, I started to look into my practice and put my queer lens on, especially in children’s play and how the room is set up. I enjoyed the theoretical part of this course which lays the foundation of the anti-bias practice. I particularly enjoyed the interviews with different guest speakers and listening to their stories, which left me with heaps questions to think about. I am a practitioner of the anti-bias approach and I am just grateful about the existence of this course which gave me some really good perspectives on how to practice the anti-bias approach in a genuine and meaningful way – so much love for this course and everyone who was involved.”                                                                                                           Sylvana Li                                                                                                    Kindergarten Teacher’</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>“In signing up for My Friend Has Two Mums, I envisioned getting a range of resources and connections that would expand my knowledge and passion for an area of human development i found intriguing. What I didn’t expect was the multiple other doors, concepts and ways of thinking that I would engage with. I found myself challenging my practice, my thought processes and the learning community around me. I went on a journey into the depths of my personal soul that allowed me to reconnect with who I am and how I connect with others. This is a course that educators must sign up for to expand their knowledge and ways of thinking around inclusion. Those that do join should ultimately be prepared for the life this will take on and the ripples that will form around you in the most magical way.”                              Alistair Gibbs                                                                                                     Director, Lady Gowrie Victoria’                                                                          Now, a little web search reveals some interesting background about Mr. Gibbs. </ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>‘Alistair jumped into the Master of Teaching for early childhood which quickly reaffirmed the affinity he felt with the early years. </ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Alistair said that he could see how the work done in early childhood had the power to set children up for their future: “really getting to the core of their development, their emotions, their abilities, their thirst and drive to better themselves and get to their next stage of development.”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>It was in the kindergarten classroom that Alistair started to notice little things that piqued his curiosity.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>One day, a corner was turned into the hairdressers with makeup and that type of thing. It was imaginative play, role play, pretend play- all wonderful for a child’s skill development. It was the children’s response that surprised Alistair, when he stepped in to relieve the female educator:</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>“I mimicked the exact same actions and language she was using within the space- which was, ‘can you make me look pretty’ and the response the children gave me was, ‘No. You’re not allowed to be pretty, you’re handsome. Girls are pretty, boys are handsome.’ I started to really question, where does this from?”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>What stemmed from this was a learning course for Alistair himself and for the children he worked with. Both prompted one another with their curiosity and imagination. Alistair said that he aimed to tackle gender stereotypes through his own actions, his language and through the experiences the educators were providing for the kids.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>“I then extended that further into different people’s abilities and how we could support and help each other in different ways.”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Alistair said he had the desire to share his findings and the experiences he was going through with others.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>“I started to seek out conferences that I could speak at and different ways that I could engage in different learnings and different ways to support other people’s thinking and other people’s practice.”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>He was keenly interested in bias in the early years in the most practical sense. He was drawing upon his own experiences and much like the BBC documentary, No More Boys and Girls: Can Our Kids Go Gender Free?, research was backing up his own observations that stereotypes were established at quite an early age.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>“When I took on a role that allowed us to engage in these practices through a whole centre approach, it wasn’t necessarily to announce that we were doing gender or anti-bias or anything like that, we simply started asking families- what bias do you face. What do you come up against and people started to put up responses.”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>“People started talking about their age or their gender or their sexuality or their parenting skills.”’</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>‘Alistair is now an Early Learning Manager at Gowrie Victoria, a not-for-profit organisation that specialises in championing good early childhood education through their early learning services as well as professional development and accredited training courses to the early childhood and education sector.’ <a href="https://www.playgroupblog.org/alistair-gibbs">https://www.playgroupblog.org/alistair-gibbs Link: https://www.playgroupblog.org/alistair-gibbs </a></ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>I’ll finish these testimonials with this one. ‘Do you want access to some brilliant minds who understand (and live) advocacy around gender and sexuality and their beautiful venn-diagramminess with early childhood practice? Are you looking for a new lens with which to view humanity and our ethical responsibilities to the wonderfully diverse children, families and colleagues within our profession and community? </ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>This course is the full package -  </ins></p><ins> </ins><ul><li><ins>get clear explanations and demystifications of sex, gender, orientation, and the ways we identify ourselves on the spectrum of human sexuality</ins></li><li><ins>consider what this beautiful rainbow spectrum means in our practice and what thinking we may need to shift or expand to see from new (child and adult) perspectives </ins></li><li><ins>critique the messages that mainstream binaryheterornormativestandards send to children from birth and the exclusion that is all around us (once you see it clearly, you see it everywhere… you know? ‘I see heteronormatively-biased people. All the time. Walking around.  They don’t know they’re biased…’) </ins></li><li><ins>learn a squillion affirming strategies – from tweaking forms to reflect family reality, to resourcing and supporting play, to advocating with your peers (you won‘t be a lone voice in this…you’ll have Red and a great group of interactive kindred colleagues along with you on your journey). </ins></li><li><ins>hear from academics, practitioners, families, lawyers (well, one), artists –pioneers in our diverse landscape whose lived experiences add priceless richness to this important learning.</ins></li></ul><ins> </ins><p><ins>I didn’t quite expect the impact this course would have on my personal and professional selves! (Intrinsically ‘entwingled‘ as they are 😉). </ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>I have learnt so much, (aka blown my mind) and as well as working away at changing aspects of practice in my current workspace, I am now looking at moving into this area of work in the early childhood and community sector. I have growing engagement with the Queer community, have challenged lil ol‘ me to live my own authentic self, have been on a beautiful advocacy journey with one of my offspring, have met amazing new people and learned first-hand how demystifying and celebrating diverse gender and sexuality is the only route that makes sense.  </ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>This course is a springboard for diving into wonderful new waters!

Society and governments are so rebellious to the things of God that what we have just been reading is the so-called norm for them. However, the above teaching is not for the true born again Bible believing parents that desire the best for their children to be able to go out and live as a good citizen in this world. </ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Matthew 19:14 …Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.</ins></p><ins> </ins></article> <div><p><del>It’s always sad to come to the ending of a good story. But, as with life, there must be an end. So, here we have the last chapter of  the God called negro preacher, John Jasper, 1812-1901. It can safely be said ‘There will never be another John Jasper”! To God be the Glory! Great things He hath done!  </del></p><del> </del><p><del>‘<strong>I NEVER heard Jasper preach a sermon on heaven</strong>, nor did I ever hear of his doing so. So far as my observation goes, sermons on heaven have failed to edify the thoughtful–sometimes proving distinctly disappointing. It was not to Jasper’s taste to argue on heaven as a doctrine. With him it was as if he were camping outside of a beautiful city, knowing much of its history and inhabitants, and in joyous expectation of soon moving into it. The immediate things of the kingdom chiefly occupied his attention; but when his sermons took him into the neighbourhood of heaven, he took fire at once and the glory of the celestial city lit his face and cheered his soul. This chapter deals only with one of his sermons which, while not on heaven, reveals his heart-belief in it, and its vital effect upon his character.</del></p><del> </del><del><img src="https://whatyareckon.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/former-slave-not-preacher-john-jasper.jpg?w=172" alt="" class="wp-image-11828"></del><p><del>Imagine a Sunday afternoon at his church–a fair, inspiring day. His house was thronged to overflowing. It was the funeral of two persons– William Ellyson and Mary Barnes. The text is forgotten, but the sermon is vividly recalled.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>From the start Jasper showed a burden and a boldness that promised rich things for his people. At the beginning he betrayed some hesitation–unusual for him. “Lemme say,” he said, “a word about dis William Ellersin. I say it de fust an’ git it orf mer min’. William Ellersin was no good man–he didn’t say he wus; he didn’t try to be good, an’ de tell me he die as he live, ‘out Gord an’ ‘out hope in de worl’. It’s a bad tale to tell on ‘im, but he fix de story hissef. As de tree falls dar mus it lay. Ef you wants folks who live wrong to be preached and sung to glory, don’ bring ’em to Jasper. Gord comfut de monur and warn de onruly.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>“But, my bruthrin,” he brightened as he spoke, “Mary Barnes wus difrunt. She wer wash’d in de blood of de Lam’ and walk’d in white; her r’ligion was of Gord. Yer could trust Mary anywhar; nuvr cotch ‘er in dem playhouses ner friskin’ in dem dances; she wan’ no street-walk’r trapsin’ roun’ at night. She love de house of de Lord; her feet clung to de straight and narrer path; I know’d her. I seen her at de prarmeetin’–seed her at de supper–seed her at de preachin’, an’ seed her tendin’ de sick an’ helpin’ de mounin’ sinn’rs. Our Sister Mary, good-bye. Yer race is run, but yer crown is shure.”</del></p><del> </del><p><del>From this Jasper shot quite apart. He was full of fire, humour gleamed in his eye, and freedom was the bread of his soul. By degrees he approached the realm of death, and he went as an invader. A note of defiant challenge rang in his voice and almost blazed on his lips. He escorted the Christian to the court of death, and demanded of the monster king to exhibit his power to hurt. It was wonderful to see how he pictured the high courage of the child of God, marching up to the very face of the king of terrors and demanding that he come forth and do his worst. Death, on the other hand, was subdued, slow of speech, admitted his defeat, and proclaimed his readiness to serve the children of Immanuel. Then he affected to put his mouth to the grave and cried aloud: “Grave! Grave! Er Grave!” he cried as if addressing a real person, “Whar’s yer vict’ry? I hur you got a mighty banner down dar, an’ you turrurizes ev’rybody wat comes long dis way. Bring out your armies an’ furl fo’th your bann’rs of vict’ry. Show your han’ an’ let ’em see wat you kin do.” Then he made the grave reply: “Ain’t got no vict’ry now; had vict’ry, but King Jesus pars’d through dis country an’ tord my banners down. He says His peopl’ shan’t be troubled no mo’ forev’r; an’ He tell me ter op’n de gates an’ let ‘um pass on dar way to glory.”</del></p><del> </del><p><del>“Oh, my Gord,” Jasper exclaimed in thrilling voice, “did yer hur dat? My Master Jesus done jerk’d de sting of death, done broke de scept’r of de king of tur’rs, an’ He dun gone inter de grave an’ rob it uv its victorous banners, an’ fix’d nice an’ smooth for His people ter pass through. Mo’ en dat, He has writ a song, a shoutin’ anthim for us to sing when we go thur, passin’ suns an’ stars, an’ singin’ dat song, ‘Thanks be onter Gord–be onter Gord who give us de vict’ry thru de Lord Jesus Christ.'” Too well I know that I do scant justice to the greatness of Jasper by this outline of his transcendent eloquence. The whole scene, distinct in every detail, was before the audience, and his responsive hearers were stirred into uncontrollable excitement.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>“My bruthrin,” Jasper resumed very soberly, “I oft’n ax myself how I’d behave merself ef I was ter git to heav’n. I tell you I would tremble fo’ de consequinces. Eben now when I gits er glimpse–jist a peep into de palis of de King, it farly runs me ravin’ ‘stracted. What will I do ef I gits thar? I ‘spec I’ll make er fool of myself, ’cause I ain’t got de pritty ways an’ nice manners my ole Mars’ Sam Hargrove used to have, but ef I git thar they ain’t goin’ to put me out. Mars’ Sam’ll speak fur me an’ tell ’em to teach me how to do. I sometimes thinks if I’s ‘lowed to go free–I ‘specs to be free dar, I tell you, b’leve I’ll jest do de town–walkin’ an’ runnin’ all roun’ to see de home which Jesus dun built for His people.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>“Fust of all, I’d go down an’ see de river of life. I lov’s to go down to de ole muddy Jemes–mighty red an’ muddy, but it goes ‘long so gran’ an’ quiet like ’twas ‘tendin’ to ‘ business–but dat ain’t nothin’ to the river which flows by de throne. I longs fer its chrystal waves, an’ de trees on de banks, an’ de all mann’rs of fruits. Dis old head of mine oft’n gits hot with fever, aches all night an’ rolls on de piller, an’ I has many times desired to cool it in that blessed stream as it kisses de banks of dat upper Canaan. Bl’ssed be de Lord! De thought of seein’ dat river, drinkin’ its water an’ restin’ un’r dose trees–” Then suddenly Jasper began to intone a chorus in a most affecting way, no part of which I can recall except the last line: “Oh, what mus’ it be to be thar?” “Aft’r dat,” Jasper continued with quickened note, I’d turn out an’ view de beauties of de city–de home of my Father. I’d stroll up dem abenuse whar de children of Gord dwell an’ view dar mansions. Father Abraham, I’m sure he got a grate pallis, an’ Moses, what ‘scorted de children of Israel out of bondige thru’ de wilderness an’ to de aidge of de promised lan’, he must be pow’rful set up being sich er man as he is; an’ David, de king dat made pritty songs, I’d like to see ‘is home, an’ Paul, de mighty scholar who got struck down out in de ‘Mascus road, I want to see his mansion, an’ all of ’em. Den I would cut roun’ to de back streets an’ look for de little home whar my Saviour set my mother up to housekeepin’ when she got thar. I ‘spec to know de house by de roses in de yard an’ de vine on de poch.” As Jasper was moving at feeling pace along the path of his thoughts, he stopped and cried: “Look dar; mighty sweet house, ain’t it lovely?” Suddenly he sprang back and began to shout with joyous clapping of hands. “Look dar; see dat on de do; hallelujah, it’s John Jasper. Said He was gwine to prepar a place for me; dar it is. Too good for a po’ sinner like me, but He built it for me, a turn-key job, an’ mine forev’r.” Instantly he was singing his mellow chorus ending as before with: “Oh, what mus’ it be to be thar!”</del></p><del> </del><p><del>From that scene, he moved off to see the angelic host. There were the white plains of the heavenly Canaan–a vast army of angels with their bands of music, their different ranks and grades, their worship before the throne and their pealing shouts as they broke around the throne of God. The charm of the scene was irresistible; it lifted everybody to a sight of heaven, and it was all real to Jasper. He seemed entranced. As the picture began to fade up rose his inimitable chorus, closing as always: “Oh, what mus’ it be to be thar!”</del></p><del> </del><p><del>Then there was a long wait. But for the subdued and unworldly air of the old preacher–full seventy years old then–the delay would have dissolved the spell. “An’ now, frenz,” he said, still panting and seeking to be calm, “ef yer’ll ‘scuse me, I’ll take er trip to de throne an’ see de King in ‘is roy’l garmints.” It was an event to study him at this point. His earnestness and reverence passed all speech, and grew as he went. The light from the throne dazzled him from afar. There was the great white throne–there, the elders bowing in adoring wonder–there, the archangels waiting in silence for the commands of the King–there the King in His resplendent glory–there in hosts innumerable were the ransomed. In point of vivid description it surpassed all I had heard or read. By this time the old negro orator seemed glorified. Earth could hardly hold him. He sprang about the platform with a boy’s alertness; he was unconsciously waving his handkerchief as if greeting a conqueror; his face was streaming with tears; he was bowing before the Redeemer; he was clapping his hands, laughing, shouting and wiping the blinding tears out of his eyes. It was a moment of transport and unmatched wonder to every one, and I felt as if it could never cease, when suddenly in a new note he broke into his chorus, ending with the soul-melting words: “Oh, what mus’ it be to be thar!”</del></p><del> </del><p><del>It was a climax of climaxes. I supposed nothing else could follow. We had been up so often and so high we could not be carried up again. But there stood Jasper, fully seeing the situation.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>He had seen it in advance and was ready. “My bruthrin,” said he as if in apology, “I dun fergot somethin’. I got ter tek anuth’r trip. I ain’t visit’d de ransum of de Lord. I can’t slight dem. I knows heap ov ’em, an’ I’m boun’ to see ’em.” In a moment he had us out on the celestial plains with the saints in line. There they were–countless and glorious! We walked the whole line and had a sort of universal handshake in which no note of time was taken. “Here’s Brer Abul, de fust man whar got here; here’s Brer Enoch whar took er stroll and straggled inter glory; here’s ole Ligie, whar had er carriage sent fur ‘im an’ comed a nigher way to de city.” Thus he went on greeting patriarchs, prophets, apostles, martyrs, his brethren and loved ones gone before until suddenly he sprang back and raised a shout that fairly shook the roof. “Here she is; I know’d sh’d git here; why, Mary Barnes, you got home, did yer?” A great handshake he gave her and for a moment it looked as if the newly-glorified Mary Barnes was the centre of Jasper’s thoughts; but, as if by magic, things again changed and he was singing at the top of his voice the chorus which died away amid the shrieks and shouts of his crowd with his plaintive note: “Oh, what mus’ it be to be thar!”</del></p><del> </del><p><del>Jasper dropped exhausted into a chair and some chief singer of the old-time sort, in noble scorn of all choirs, struck that wondrous old song, “When Death Shall Shake My Frame,” and in a moment the great building throbbed and trembled with the mighty old melody. It was sung only as Jasper’s race can sing, and especially as only Jasper’s emotional and impassioned church could sing it. This was Jasper’s greatest sermon. In length it was not short of an hour and a half–maybe it was longer than that. He lifted things far above all thought of time, and not one sign of impatience was seen. The above sketch is all unworthy of the man or the sermon. As for the venerable old orator himself he was in his loftiest mood–free in soul, alert as a boy, his imagination rioting, his action far outwent his words, and his pictures of celestial scenes glowed with unworldly lustre. He was in heaven that day, and took us around in his excursion wagon, and turning on the lights showed us the City of the Glorified.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>What is reported here very dimly hints at what he made us see. Not a few of Richmond’s most thoughtful people, though some of them laid no claim to piety, were present and not one of them escaped the profound spiritual eloquence of this simple-hearted old soldier of the cross.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>Valiant, heroic old man! He stood in his place and was not afraid. He gave his message in no uncertain words–scourged error wherever it exposed its front stood sentinel over the word of God and was never caught sleeping at his post.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>When his work ended, he was ready to go up and see his Master face to face.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>The stern old orator, brave as a lion, rich in humour, grim, and a dreamer whose dreams were full of heaven, has uttered his last message and gone within the veil to see the wonders of the unseen. If the grapes of Eschol were so luscious to him here, “Oh, what must it be for him to be there.”‘ <a href="https://docsouth.unc.edu/church/hatcher/hatcher.html">https://docsouth.unc.edu/church/hatcher/hatcher.html Link: https://docsouth.unc.edu/church/hatcher/hatcher.html </a></del></p><del> </del></div>

</p><h2 class="title">Past Programmes</h2><p><a href="http://wrrc.wluml.org">The&#160;Women Reclaiming and Redefining Cultures: Asserting Rights Over Body, Self and Public Spaces</a>&#160;Programme (WRRC), jointly hosted by&#160;Women Living Under Muslim Laws (WLUML) and the Institute for Women&#8217;s Empowerment (IWE), ran for two and half years starting October 2008 and ending June 2011. The aim of the programme was to enable women to repossess and reconstruct cultural resources (including &#8216;religion&#8217; and &#8216;tradition&#8217;) to claim rights, empowering them vis-&#224;-vis those who use disempowering cultural/religious discourses to dis-empower women and deny women&#8217;s rights.</p><p class="content">

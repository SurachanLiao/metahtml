It has also reinforced border checks.</p>
<p>North Korea is sandwiched between <a href="/news?tag=China">China</a>, where the virus emerged late last year and has infected more than 80,000 people, and <a href="/news?tag=South+Korea">South Korea</a>, where the virus has spread readily over the past few weeks to infect nearly 7,500 people. The <a href="/news?tag=Russian">Russian</a> embassy said a plane belonging to North Korea's Air Koryo airline carrying 80 foreign diplomats, businessmen, and relief workers left <a href="/news?tag=Pyongyang">Pyongyang</a> for the southeastern <a href="/news?tag=Russian">Russian</a> city of Vladivostok.</p>
<p>Among them were the "full composition" of officials from <a href="/news?tag=Germany">Germany</a>, <a href="/news?tag=France">France</a>, and <a href="/news?tag=Switzerland">Switzerland</a>, all of which temporarily suspended work in <a href="/news?tag=Pyongyang">Pyongyang</a>, the embassy said. Thirteen of its own employees and their family members, 35 relief workers and an unspecified number of businessmen also left. The group includes "Polish, <a href="/news?tag=Romanian">Romanian</a>, Mongolian, <a href="/news?tag=Egyptian">Egyptian</a> diplomats and their families who decided to wait out the quarantine in their homeland", the embassy said on Facebook.</p>
<p>Britain's ambassador to <a href="/news?tag=North+Korea">North Korea</a>, Colin Crooks, said earlier in the day that his <a href="/news?tag=German">German</a> and <a href="/news?tag=French">French</a> colleagues were leaving, though he did not specify why. "Sad to say farewell this morning to colleagues from <a href="/news?tag=German">German</a> Embassy and <a href="/news?tag=French">French</a> Office in <a href="/news?tag=North+Korea">North Korea</a> which are closing temporarily," Crooks said on Twitter.</p>
<p>"British Embassy remains open." Crooks shared photos showing white vans, apparently taking his <a href="/news?tag=French">French</a> and <a href="/news?tag=German">German</a> colleagues to the airport.</p>
<p>Germany has an embassy in North Korea. <a href="/news?tag=France">France</a> does not have formal diplomatic relations with <a href="/news?tag=North+Korea">North Korea</a> but runs an office there to foster exchanges. Spokesmen for the <a href="/news?tag=French">French</a> and <a href="/news?tag=German">German</a> embassies in <a href="/news?tag=South+Korea">South Korea</a> were not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>Sweden's ambassador to <a href="/news?tag=North+Korea">North Korea</a>, Joachim Bergstrom, last week posted a picture on Twitter of himself in <a href="/news?tag=Pyongyang">Pyongyang</a> and said he was happy to be out of the compound where he was quarantined for a month. <a href="/news?tag=North+Korea">North Korea</a>, slapped with U.N. Security Council sanctions because of its nuclear and missile programs, launched multiple short-range projectiles into the sea on Monday, a week after it resumed missile tests following a three-month break, South Korea's military said.</p>  </section><section class="m-b-20 visible-xs"></section><section></section></p><section class="left-section m-b-20"></section><section class="left-section m-b-20"></section></article>

Friends,

As COVID-19 has exploded, so has the amount of information about COVID-19. There are currently over 700 publications regarding coronavirus listed in PubMed within the past few months. More are being released daily. Many havenâ€™t been catalogued on PubMed yet.

This chapter will attempt to synthesize the latest and most important information on COVID-19. I will need your help to provide post-publication peer review and point me towards new developments.

I will be revising this on a daily basis until things settle down. It's currently a bit rough, but I wanted to get it out without further delay. Regular programming on PulmCrit and the IBCC will be suspended for now (but rest assured, they will eventually resume).

COVID-19 is outstripping the ability of most traditional information sources to keep up. In this context, FOAMed may be an ideal medium to discuss and share late-breaking information. The hashtag #COVID19foam can be used to tag and track useful information on twitter.

An IBCC podcast on this will be coming out in several days, following an initial period of peer review and shaped by ongoing online discussions.

Thank you for all your help.

Sincerely,

Josh

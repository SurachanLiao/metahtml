<article class="post-471848 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail category-pulmcrit entry"><p>As COVID-19 has exploded, so has the amount of information about COVID-19.&#160; There are currently over 700 publications regarding coronavirus listed in PubMed within the past few months.&#160; More are being released daily.&#160; Many haven&#8217;t been catalogued on PubMed yet.</p><p>This chapter will attempt to synthesize the latest and most important information on COVID-19.&#160; I will need your help to provide post-publication peer review and point me towards new developments.</p><p>I will be revising this on a daily basis until things settle down.&#160; It's currently a bit rough, but I wanted to get it out without further delay.&#160; Regular programming on PulmCrit and the IBCC will be suspended for now (but rest assured, they will eventually resume).</p><p>COVID-19 is outstripping the ability of most traditional information sources to keep up.&#160; In this context, FOAMed may be an ideal medium to discuss and share late-breaking information.&#160; The hashtag #COVID19foam can be used to tag and track useful information on twitter.</p><p>An IBCC podcast on this will be coming out in several days, following an initial period of peer review and shaped by ongoing online discussions.</p><p>Thank you for all your help.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Josh</p><ul>

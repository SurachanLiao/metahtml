He was elected in 2017, defeating Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno by a 56%-42% margin. Murphy grew up in Needham, Massachusetts and said during his campaign that he was &#8220;middle class on a good day.&#8221;&#160; He is a 1979 graduate of Harvard&#8230;" class="encyclopedia">Phil Murphy</a>&#8217;s attorney general, Gurbir Grewal, last year issued a directive limiting how much local law enforcement agencies could cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.</p><p>Republicans in Somerset and elsewhere in the state have latched onto the issue in a bid to tie their Democratic opponents to Murphy, a progressive who may prove politically hazardous for Democratic candidates in tight races.</p><p>But, Somerset County Democratic Chairwoman Peg Schaffer isn&#8217;t buying the link.</p><p>&#8220;This is so stupid it&#8217;s making my head hurt,&#8221; Schaffer said. &#8220;Let&#8217;s set aside the flagrant race-baiting and lame attempt to tie existing policies to people who aren&#8217;t currently in office. Since they seem to think it&#8217;s perfectly appropriate to ask about standing up to a governor, how many times did they call on Chris Christie to alter course on behalf of Somerset County taxpayers?</p><p>Christie&#8217;s approval ratings were at their nadir towards the end of his term, and some Democrats believe the former governor may still harm Republicans at the ballot box.</p><p>Though, President Donald Trump is more likely to do that in 2019.</p><p>&#8220;How about if, instead of ducking the question like they did at the debate, Walsh and Parenti answer whether they are endorsing Trump for president in 2020?&#8221; Schaffer said. &#8220;The President is a major property owner in Somerset County, the leader of Walsh and Parenti&#8217;s Republican Party, and they&#8217;ve held multiple fundraisers at Trump golf courses instead of local businesses. But just like they never stood up to Christie, they&#8217;re playing from Trump&#8217;s playbook of race-baiting and distractions.</p><p>While Trump&#8217;s approvals remain strong among his Republican base in rural parts of the country, New Jersey voters have have long held a net-negative view of the president.</p><p>A Monmouth University poll released last week found just 34% said Trump didn&#8217;t deserve a second term, though those numbers were slightly better in Somerset.</p><p>Still, it&#8217;s 2019 and nether Murphy, Christie nor Trump are on the ballot this year, but public safety and taxes could still prove to be effective campaign issues.</p><p>&#8220;As law enforcement officers, it is our job to uphold the Constitution and protect our citizens,&#8221; Parenti said. &#8220;I call on my opponent to denounce the Governor&#8217;s sanctuary state directive and let our families sleep at ease knowing we won&#8217;t be releasing serious criminal offenders onto our streets.&#8221;</p><p>To that end, Walsh attacked Marano over her since-expired tenure as Green Brook&#8217;s mayor.</p><p>&#8220;Listen, the voters in Green Brook were not fooled by Melonie&#8217;s tax and spend policies. She was ousted as Mayor in nine months in a historic landslide,&#8221; said Walsh. &#8220;Of course she thinks a rain tax is a good idea &#8211; she&#8217;s never met a tax increase she didn&#8217;t agree with. Somerset County can&#8217;t afford a tax hiking politician like Melonie Marano.&#8221;</p><p>On that, Schaffer repeated a line Democrats have used before in this election, asking why Republicans were just now pointing an eye towards the county&#8217;s problems.</p><p>&#8220;And how about if they focus on their jobs? As a candidate Parenti is throwing out opioid plans for the future, but doesn&#8217;t even have a narcotics division in the Somerset town with the highest crime rate,&#8221; Schaffer said. &#8220;Walsh has been talking about economic growth for 25 years, but Green Brook has so many vacancies on Route 22 you can&#8217;t go 50 feet without running into a sign.&#8221;</p><p class="heateor_sss_sharing_title">Spread the news:</p><p class="rpp_buttons rpp_hidden">

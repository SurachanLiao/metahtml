</a></p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">In a statement translated on the state news agency, Ri Thae Song, a first vice minister at the North Korean Foreign Ministry working on US affairs, accused US policy makers of leveraging talks with Kim Jong Un for domestic political gain.</p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">"The dialogue touted by the US is, in essence, nothing but a foolish trick hatched to keep the DPRK bound to dialogue and use it in favor of the political situation and election in the US," Ri said, using the acronym for North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. </p> <p class="read-more-link" id="js-body-read-more"><ins>Read More</ins></p> <p class="zn-body__paragraph">"It is entirely up to the US what Christmas gift it will select to get," added Ri. </p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">In 2017, North Korea referred to its first test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) as<a href="https://cnn.com/2017/07/05/asia/north-korea-missile-nuclear-gift/index.html" target="_blank">a "gift"</a> for the US on the Fourth of July holiday. That launch sparked what became a tense, months-long standoff between the two sides.</p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">What happens in the coming weeks will likely determine if Washington's next so-called "Christmas gift" turns out to be similarly volatile. </p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">"It's hard to predict because it could go either way," said Duyeon Kim, senior adviser on Northeast Asia and nuclear policy to the International Crisis Group. "It really depends on the circumstance and the situation, which will better inform how North Korea reacts. </p><p class="zn-body__paragraph"></p><h3>An important meeting</h3><p class="zn-body__paragraph">On Wednesday, North Korea's state-run Korean Central News Agency announced that the country's most powerful political body, the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, will meet at the end of December "in order to discuss and decide on crucial issues in line with the needs of the development of the Korean revolution and the changed situation at home and abroad."</p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">Whatever North Korean leader Kim Jong Un plans to do with respect to nuclear negotiations will likely be finalized at that meeting, according to Duyeon Kim. </p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">"The outcome of this meeting and Pyongyang's policy line will depend on how happy they are with Washington and will be revealed in (Kim Jong Un's) New Year's Day address," said Duyeon Kim. </p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">Diplomats from Pyongyang and Washington have been attempting to negotiate a trade that would see Kim give up the country's nuclear weapons and the ballistic missiles used to deliver them in exchange for relief from punishing US and United Nations sanctions that have crippled the North Korean economy. </p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">Though North Korea first detonated a nuclear device in 2006, Pyongyang successfully test-fired missiles that could potentially hit the US mainland with a nuclear warhead  for the first time in 2017 -- upping the stakes significantly and increasing the urgency to reach a peaceful solution to a decades-long struggle.</p> <p class="zn-body__paragraph">Washington, for its part, has not voiced increased alarm over the status of talks with North Korea.</p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">Speaking in London on the sidelines of a NATO summit Tuesday, US President Donald Trump said "we'll see what happens" when it comes to North Korea.</p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">"My relationship with Kim Jong Un is really good, but that doesn't mean he won't abide by the agreement we signed," Trump said. "I hope he lives up to the agreement, but we're going to find out," added Trump. </p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">"(Kim Jong Un) definitely likes sending rockets up, doesn't he?

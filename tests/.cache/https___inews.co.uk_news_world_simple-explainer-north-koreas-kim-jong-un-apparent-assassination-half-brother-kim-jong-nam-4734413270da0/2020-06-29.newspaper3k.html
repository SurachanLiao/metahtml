He died on his way to hospital.</p><p>It is believed that he was poisoned.</p><p>Two women wiped the&#160;deadly nerve agent VX on his face. The toxin had been placed on their hands by North Koreans, according to authorities.</p><p>CCTV footage, obtained by Japanese television, purports to show two women approach Kim Jong-nam at the airport.</p><p><b>Do we know who did it?</b></p><p class="inews__advert" id="mpu_l2"></p><p class="inews__advert" id="mpu_tablet_l2"></p><p class="inews__advert" id="mpu_mobile_l2"></p><blockquote><p>The women believed they were part of a prank show, according to authorities.</p></blockquote><p>Following the attack, Malaysian police arrested a number of people including&#160;a woman called Doan Thi Huong &#8211; &#160;she was carrying Vietnamese travel documents and was spotted on CCTV in a top with&#160;the letters &#8220;LOL&#8221; &#8211; &#160;and&#160;Siti Aisyah, who had&#160;an Indonesian passport.</p><p>These two women have now been accused of&#160;murder and could face the death sentence if they are convicted.</p><p>Two other suspects, one of whom is North Korean, remain in custody. Authorities are still looking for seven other North Korean suspects.</p><p>Four of the North Koreans suspected are spies from the country&#8217;s Ministry of State Security, according to&#160;South Korea.</p><img class="size-full wp-image-47583" src="https://i.inews.co.uk/content/uploads/2017/02/north-korea3.png" alt="The CCTV image of the first woman arrested after the death of Kim Jong-nam" width="624" height="624"><p>&#160;</p><p class="inews__advert" id="mpu_l3"></p><p class="inews__advert" id="mpu_tablet_l3"></p><p class="inews__advert" id="mpu_mobile_l3"></p><p><strong>Why is it considered to be an assassination?</strong></p><p>Officials from South Korea and the US have said the killing was probably carried out by North Korean agents.</p><p>North Korea&#8217;s leader&#160;Kim Jong-un, 33, has form. He ordered the execution of his uncle Jang Sung-taek &#8211; considered by the leader to be a traitor &#8211; in 2013. &#8220;If he did his uncle, he could surely do his brother,&#8221; says self-confessed Korea-watcher and honorary fellow at the University of Leeds Aidan Foster-Carter.</p><p>He has also ordered the execution of government officials.</p><p>The spy service in South Korea has alleged that North Korea had been trying to kill Kim Jong-nam for five years, leading the latter to reportedly plead for his life in a letter to his brother.</p><p class="inews__advert" id="mpu_l4"></p><p class="inews__advert" id="mpu_tablet_l4"></p><p class="inews__advert" id="mpu_mobile_l4"></p><p><strong>So the order came&#160;from the top?</strong></p><p>If indeed Kim Jong-nam was&#160;assassinated, then it most likely came from the top of the North Korean government &#8211; although this has not been proven.</p><p>&#8220;This high-tech, lurid, James Bondish [killing], that suggests to me to be the power of the state,&#8221; says Mr Foster-Carter.</p><p>The apparent assassination &#8220;is the latest in a series of purges from within the North Korean elite&#8221;, says Dr Markus Bell, a lecturer at Sheffield University&#8217;s School of East Asian Studies.</p><p>&#8220;Kim Jong-nam hadn&#8217;t expressed a desire to lead the DPRK, but nevertheless was likely viewed as a loose thread by his younger brother.&#8221;</p><p class="inews__advert" id="mpu_l5"></p><p class="inews__advert" id="mpu_tablet_l5"></p><p class="inews__advert" id="mpu_mobile_l5"></p><p><strong>What was the relationship like between the two brothers?</strong></p><p>Kim Jong-nam was estranged and living in Macau, an autonomous region on the south coast of China. He has claimed to have never met Kim Jong-un.</p><p>He was by-passed to become leader of North Korea when his father Kim Jong-il died, with the line of succession moving to his younger half brother.</p><img class="size-large wp-image-47370" src="https://i.inews.co.uk/content/uploads/2017/02/north-korea2-760x527.png" alt="Former North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il with his son, Kim Jong-Nam" width="760" height="527"><p>This was possibly because of the&#160;embarrassment he had caused&#160;the family, such as in 2001, when he tried to&#160;enter Japan, to visit Tokyo Disneyland, with a false passport.</p><p>He had also criticised his family&#8217;s control in North Korea and Kim Jong-un&#8217;s leadership.</p><p class="inews__advert" id="mpu_l6"></p><p class="inews__advert" id="mpu_tablet_l6"></p><p class="inews__advert" id="mpu_mobile_l6"></p><p><strong>What&#160;could the motive be?</strong></p><p>This remains unknown.</p><blockquote><p>There is also a dividing view of whether the apparent assassination can &#8220;be understood as a display of Kim Jong-un&#8217;s tightening grip on power or conversely, as symbolic of the young leader&#8217;s struggle for stability,&#8221; says Dr Bell.</p></blockquote><p>But it could be that Kim Jong-un was paranoid, according to Mr Foster-Carter.</p><p>&#8220;It was quite often suggested that if China wanted someone more pliant and pliable in charge of North Korea &#8211; because&#160;of course China&#160;doesn&#8217;t want North Korea&#160;to collapse, they want it as a buffer state, but they would like it to be less annoying with all the missile tests &#8211; Kim Jong-nam is on the record for&#160;favouring reform&#8230; That would be great for China.</p><p>&#8220;It is all speculative, this slightly shambling, slightly low-life figure, whether he could ever have been a plausible substitute for his brother. Who knows, but maybe the brother was afraid of that,&#8221; he says.&#160;</p><p class="inews__advert" id="mpu_l7"></p><p class="inews__advert" id="mpu_tablet_l7"></p><p class="inews__advert" id="mpu_mobile_l7"></p><p>The apparent assassination could have been an attempt to ensure &#8220;rival factions inside the North Korean elite wouldn&#8217;t have another Kim to rally around, and heading off possible China-backed leadership challenges,&#8221; adds Dr Bell.</p><p><strong>Any other theories floating about?</strong></p><p>Kim Jong-nam was most well-known around&#160;2012, when a book &#8211; written by Japanese journalist Yoji Gomi &#8211; containing quotes of him criticising his brother was released.</p><p>Since then he has &#8220;gone to ground&#8221; so there is a theory that some agents orchestrated the assassination to get Kim Jong-un&#8217;s approval, says Mr Foster-Carter, emphasising that this is highly speculative though.</p><blockquote class="qa"><p><strong>Kim Jong-nam, quoted in the 2012 book:</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m concerned how Jong Un, who merely resembles my grandfather, will be able to satisfy the needs of North Koreans. Kim Jong Un is still just a nominal figure and the members of the power elite will be the ones in actual power. The dynastic succession is a joke to the outside world.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Other motives, again highly speculative, could be linked to the life led by Kim Jong-nam.</p><p>He had a &#8220;complicated love life&#8221; so the arrested woman could have been a jilted lover, offers Mr Foster-Carter.</p><p>The gambler could have been involved in a shady business deal, he adds. He had presumably been cut off financially from North Korea so the state of his finances is unknown.</p><img class="size-large wp-image-47372" src="https://i.inews.co.uk/content/uploads/2017/02/GettyImages-635241102-760x495.jpg" alt="If Kim Jong-nam was assassinated, it shows the brutality of the North Korean regime (AFP/Getty Images)" width="760" height="495"><p><strong>What does the apparent assassination&#160;tell us about North Korea?</strong></p><p>&#8220;It tells us that North Korea is a very brutal regime,&#8221; says Mr Foster-Carter. &#8220;It may tell us the leader of North Korea is rather paranoid and is afraid for his life.&#8221;</p><p>The assassination is being viewed as a&#160;warning to other would-be defectors from North Korea&#8217;s political elite, according to Dr Bell. &#8220;It sends a clear message: wherever you are, whoever you are, we can get to you.&#8221;</p><p><strong>Assume there&#8217;s an investigation going on?</strong></p><p>Malaysian authorities have been conducting an investigation, much to the irritation of North Korea.</p><p>&#8220;The investigation by the Malaysian police is not for the clarification of the cause of the death and search for the suspect, but it is out of the political aim,&#8221; Kang Cho, North Korea&#8217;s ambassador to Kuala Lumpur, has said previously.</p><p>The suspicion had been &#8220;pinned&#8221; on North Korea, he added, calling for a joint investigation.&#160;But Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said authorities had been objective in their work.</p><p>A delegation from North Korean have arrived in Kuala Lumpur seeking the body of Kim Jong-nam but Malaysian authorities have so far refused to release the body.</p></div>

Did the Imams (pbuh) gave their ruling about it or not ?</ins></p><p><ins>Is there contradictory rulings about chess or all hadiths state it as haram ?</ins></p><p><ins>Is there is a reasoning from the Imams (pbuh) for chess being haram or only a clear direct straight tahreem with the most repulsive descriptions ?</ins></p><p><ins>Some grand sins had reasonings from the Imams (pbh) , but does this means that the sin in the question becomes halal when the reasons of tahreem given by the Imams are overcamed ?</ins></p><blockquote class="ipsQuote"><p><ins>You must support your claim that "all" mujtahids have said that it's haram with sources and clear fatwa's of all those mujtahids, otherwise it is not accepted from you.</ins></p></blockquote><p><ins>Tahreem of chess is among the rare things in branches that all the twelvers agreed on .</ins></p><p><ins>You can refer to the books of fatwas , the old and the new ones and you will see that thing .</ins></p><p><ins>This is a fatwa from Grand Ayatullah Al Khoie :</ins></p><blockquote class="ipsQuote"><p><ins>ÇáÓÄÇá:  	ÞÈá æÝÇÉ ÇáÃãÇã ÇáÎãíäí ÇáÑÇÍá ( ÑÖ ) äÞá Úäå ÝÊæì ÈÊÍáíá ¡ Ãæ ÌæÇÒ áÚÈ ÇáÔØÑäÌ ¡ ÝäÑÌæ ÅíÖÇÍÇ áãÓÃáÉ ãåãÉ ¡ æåí Ãäßã ÊÚÊÈÑæäåÇ ãä ÇáßÈÇÆÑ ÈíäãÇ ÇáÃãÇã (ÑÖ) ÌæÇÒåÇ ¿</ins></p><p><ins>ÇáÝÊæì: 	 áã íÞá ÃÍÏ ÈÍáíÉ áÚÈ ÇáÔØÑäÌ ÈÞæá ãØáÞ ¡ æÅäãÇ ÇáßáÇã ÝíãÇ ÅÐÇ áÚÈ Èå áÇ ãÚ ÇáãÑÇåäÉ ¡ Èá áÊÑæíÍ ÇáäÝÓ ãËáÇ ¡ æÇáÇÞæì ÚäÏäÇ ÇáÍÑãÉ ãØáÞÇ ¡ æáæ ãä Ïæä ÑåÇä.</ins></p></blockquote><p><ins>Translation :</ins></p><blockquote class="ipsQuote"><p><ins>Q) Before Imam Khomeini (ra) died , it was narrated about him that he maked halal or allowed playing with chess . We hope that you clarifiy this for an important matter , that is you see it from grand sins , while the imam (ra) consider it allowed ?</ins></p><p><ins>A) Nobody have said that chess is absolutely halal . The talk in it is wether it can be played without gambling , like entertaining for example . It is strongest for me that it is absolutely haram , even without gambling .</ins></p></blockquote><p><ins>The fatwa indicates these points :</ins></p><p><ins>- Nobody have said that chess is absolutely halal , (including Imam Khomeini) </ins></p><p><ins>- The discussion about it is about its allowence to be played it without gambling or not . </ins></p><p><ins>As for the ruling of Imam Khomeini that it is allowed , you can refer to post #16 .</ins></p><blockquote class="ipsQuote"><p><ins>I agree with the first parts of your statement, as for the last, no one claimed that the mujtahids give fatwas in opposition of hadiths, rather they explain them in a manner that agrees with the hadith, even if it gives a different conclusion.  Some hadiths may be of taqiya, some may be of weak sanad, and some may be said due to certain circumstances at that time.. So it is not for us to judge on what our fuqaha' say.</ins></p></blockquote><blockquote class="ipsQuote"><p><ins>Again, it is for the mujtahid to decide why such a fatwa or law was given by the Imam(as), depending on the circumstances of that time, the reason behind its tahreem, etc etc.</ins></p></blockquote><p><ins>I you have noticed that I build the objection on Imam Khumayni's chess ruling , on two facts , which one of them is the opinion of all previous shia marja's .</ins></p><p><ins>Where do you see weak sanads , and taqiyya in the hadiths that declare chess as haram ?</ins></p><p><ins>Those hadiths are obvious and doesn't behold interpretations , go ask any scholar .</ins></p><p><ins>It is up to Imam Khomeini to bring solid proof to declare chess as halal , and I have right to inquire about a marja''s ruling because there isn't blind following in islam .</ins></p><p><ins>For anybody that opens hadiths or fatwa books , he will see chess being haram as obvious as alcohol being haram , do you accept a fatwa that declares alcohol halal if it is consumed without getting drunk intention ? or for an enhanced focus  like the russians who drink vodka for succeeding in exams ? So how do you accept that (chess=magianism) becomes halal if it isn't with intention of gambling ?</ins></p><blockquote class="ipsQuote"><p><ins>Secondly, let's say that all those 1200 years till now said it's haram, haven't you looked into other issue's that were haram for 1400 years and suddenly became halal? and example of that is the taharat (purity) of Ahlul Kitab, it was fully regarded that they are najis and you cannot eat from them, until the last few years where the hukm and fatawa suddenly changed.  Another example is salat al jum'a, where it was always considered to be impermissible at the time of ghayba, but now it suddenly became mustahab.  And there are many other examples, so look into them.</ins></p></blockquote><p><ins>The following fatwas you provided are all based on controversial evidences from shari'a .</ins></p><p><ins>In the case of chess , there isn't any controversion , just clear hadiths : Chess is Haram .</ins></p><ins> </ins><ins><span class="ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light">Edited July 9, 2006 by .

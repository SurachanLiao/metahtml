An arms embargo on Iran set to expire in October must remain in place to prevent it from "becoming the arms dealer of choice for rogue regimes and terrorist organizations around the world," U.S. special representative for Iran  Brian Hook said Sunday in Abu Dhabi. "If we let it expire, you can be certain that what Iran has been doing in the dark, it will do in broad daylight and then some," Hook said.

 On Saturday, Lebanese Judge Mohammed Mazeh ordered local media  to stop interviewing  U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon Dorothy Shea after she criticized Hizbullah in an interview Friday with Saudi state-owned broadcaster al-Hadath. The Iranian-backed militant group, designated a terrorist organization by the U.S., holds political office in Lebanon. 
     Shea accused Hizbullah of obstructing economic reforms and siphoning billions of dollars from government coffers. She also voiced concern about "threatening language" against the U.S. in a recent speech by Hizbullah leader Hassan Nasrallah.

Lebanon's currency hit new lows Friday as the country's financial and economic collapse accelerated. The Lebanese pound traded on the black market at 7,000 to the dollar, a slide of 40%  in the past week. The currency has now lost 78% of its value since October. Businesses are closing by the day, unemployment is rising and prices are soaring. The cost of food has nearly doubled so far this year.

But only 200 people turned up for the June 8 demonstration, in a sign of the struggles the Palestinian Authority (PA) has faced generating outrage on the street. 
    
There was a  larger rally in Jericho last week, brought to the protest site on buses chartered by  the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Fatah party, but many left even before the speeches began.

The arrival in Israel of special adviser  to the President Avi Berkowitz and Scott Leith of the U.S. National Security Council conveys the message that the U.S. is ready for Israel to apply Israeli law in parts of the West Bank in line with the U.S. "Vision for Peace." The administration has no interest in walking away from the plan that it spent years preparing, and any moves Israel makes in accordance with that plan will have U.S. support.

Autocratic Middle Eastern regimes, organizations, foundations, and affiliated private corporations have funneled billions of dollars of unreported funding to American universities in order to encourage the demonization of Israel and the Jewish people within the curriculum and on campus, ISGAP's seven-year "Follow the Money" research project has found.  Federal reporting requirements and procedures have been inadequate in keeping track of academic funding coming in from abroad. This includes more than $3 billion gifted by Qatar and the Gulf States that were not reported by universities to the IRS or the Department of Education. 
     These funds have a significant impact on attitudes, anti-Semitic culture, and BDS activities. Our research found a direct correlation between the funding of universities by Qatar and the Gulf States and the active presence at those universities of groups such as Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), which foster an anti-Semitic and aggressive atmosphere on campus.

After World War I and the breakup of the Ottoman Empire, "the powers decided to give Palestine to the Jews, whereas Arabs would receive the rest of the Middle East."  He noted that at the time, the Arabs "considered themselves as Syrians rather than Palestinians." 
    "It is wrong to say that Israel occupied this land [when it conquered it from Jordan in 1967]. We only claimed back what originally belonged to the Jewish people," explained Sion.
"Some people...know the facts but choose to ignore them."   (Sputnik-Russia)</ins></li><ins> </ins><li class="default"><ins><a href="https://jcpa.org/book/the-battle-over-bds-trends-lessons-and-future-trajectories/">The Battle over BDS: Trends, Lessons and Future Trajectories Link: https://jcpa.org/book/the-battle-over-bds-trends-lessons-and-future-trajectories/ </a> -  Asher Fredman 
While the anti-Israel BDS movement continues to be highly active, the counter-BDS network is succeeding in disrupting BDS momentum. Increasingly, the BDS movement finds itself on the defensive as it faces exposure of its terror links, credible accusations of anti-Semitism, and national and municipal legislation and resolutions that attack its legitimacy. 
    Nevertheless, it would be a grave mistake to assume that the battle is over. The BDS movement has shown itself to be highly adept at pivoting to new strategies, building influential alliances, and identifying emerging opportunities. There continue to be numerous arenas in which it faces little effective resistance. The writer served as Chief of Staff and International Affairs Advisor to Israel's Minister of Strategic Affairs.

He added that the plan "confronts a great lie head on - the lie that the Jewish people are foreign colonialists in our own ancestral homeland.

In a region where Christians are on the run and live in fear, Christians in Israel are on the rise and they live in freedom."

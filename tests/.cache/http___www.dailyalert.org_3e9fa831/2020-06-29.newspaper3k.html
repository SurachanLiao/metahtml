&#160; &#160;  An Israeli military source told <i>North Press</i> on Sunday that "attacks against Iranian targets in Syria are aimed to thwart a new Iranian attempt to develop precision missiles."<br>
&#160; &#160; The source said the intensity of attacks against Iranian targets in Syria stems from reliable information about an Iranian approach to developing a precision missile project in Syria and Lebanon, in conjunction with Iran's withdrawal of its elements from areas near the border with Israel.<br>
&#160; &#160; "It is clear from the reports coming from Syria that those who defend these missile... storage sites...are Shiite militias that are operated and funded by Iran," said the source.

&#160; &#160; A British Labour MP, Rebecca Long-Bailey, tweeted a link to an interview with actress Maxine Peake, who somehow managed to link the death of George Floyd to Israel.<br>
&#160; &#160;  Later, Ms. Peake conceded that her "assumptions" had been "inaccurate."<br>
&#160; &#160;  Odd how common such misconceptions are among certain circles - the  sheer number of them who appear to find Israel to blame for every injustice under the sun.<br>
&#160; &#160;  It doesn't matter how far from Israel an injustice occurs, or how scant the evidence. They somehow manage to detect the Zionist hand at work.

&#160; &#160; A free virtual concert featuring the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra (IPO) was disrupted on Sunday by a  cyberattack, preventing tens of thousands of viewers worldwide from watching.<br>

&#160; &#160; "The forces against Israel extend to a music program which is really trying to make friends around the world," said Irwin Field,  co-president of  American Friends of the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra.<br>
&#160; &#160; Although the live stream was sabotaged, the concert was recorded and will be available for viewing on YouTube for 30 days.<br>

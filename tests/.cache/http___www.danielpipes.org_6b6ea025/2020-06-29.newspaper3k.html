<p>We who argue for Israel Victory watched with dismay as Qatar's government <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/qatar-said-threatening-to-end-aid-to-gaza-in-bid-to-press-israel-on-annexation/?utm_source=The+Daily+Edition&amp;utm_campaign=daily-edition-2020-06-24&amp;utm_medium=email">threatens</a> Israel with ending its <a href="https://www.jpost.com/arab-israeli-conflict/qatar-israel-hasnt-stopped-cash-grants-to-gaza-631549">financial donations</a> to Gaza, insinuating that Hamas will <a href="https://www.jns.org/incendiary-balloons-plague-israeli-land-near-gaza-border-sparking-new-fires/">resume</a> its incendiary balloon attacks. Where, we wonder, are those extraordinary armed forces that defeated three states in six days, pulled off the Entebbe raid, and heisted Iran's nuclear archive?</p><p></p><p>Israel's security establishment, it turns out, has a Doppelg&#195;&#164;nger, an uncelebrated, defensive, reticent counterpart that emerged after the 1993 Oslo accords to deal with West Bank and Gaza Palestinians, the one that needed 50 days to end a minor military operation in 2014 and cannot stop burning balloons coming out of Gaza. The classic IDF seeks to win but the Palestinian one just wants calm.</p><p>What accounts for its timidity? Here are six factors:</p>

<p>The Palestinian Authority and Hamas famously deny any historic or religious <a href="http://www.danielpipes.org/blog/2002/05/counterfeit-history-jerusalem">connection of Jews to Jerusalem</a>. To cite one example, <a href="http://www.nysun.com/article/5953">Ikrima Sabri</a>, the city's mufti, announced in 2001 that "There is not the smallest indication of the existence of a Jewish temple on this place in the past. In the whole city, there is not even a single stone indicating Jewish history." This bizarre fraud, <a href="http://www.takeapen.org/Takeapen/Templates/showpage.asp?DBID=1&amp;LNGID=1&amp;TMID=84&amp;FID=620">Itamar Marcus</a> has explained, is based on a simple switch: Take authentic Jewish history, "documented by thousands of years of continuous literature": cross out the word <i>Jewish</i> and replace it with <i>Arab</i>.</p><p>So much for the rejectionist Palestinians. What about the moderate and sober Jordanian government, Israel's long-time, discreet partner; what says it? Amman does not go so far as to deny any Jewish connection, but it too makes a hash of history.</p>

<p>There is a brand-new game: decipher the rhetoric of Joe Biden, former vice president and presumptive Democratic nominee for president.</p><p>American politics has never had a top politician who (apparently suffering from dementia) makes such wandering, incoherent, garbled comments. The game he has inspired has two simple rules: (1) prune the gibberish and (2) add what is needed to make sense.</p><p></p><p>Here is an example on an important topic, taken from a long <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/01/17/opinion/joe-biden-nytimes-interview.html">interview</a> with <i>New York Times</i> editors on December 16, 2019. Speaking about Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdo&#196;&#159;an, Biden said:</p><blockquote><p>He has to pay a price for whether or not we're going to continue to sell certain weapons to him. In fact, if he has the air defense system that they're flying F-15s through to see how they can try to figure out how to do it.</p></blockquote><p>Come again? Sure, read a second and even a third time. I'll wait. A bit murky, no? But with the magic of the above two rules, it does make sense. I dropped the fluff and added the implicit bits (in square brackets), resulting in an intelligible new version:</p>

<p>Street riots, eminent liberals fired, the Democratic party veering sharply Left: these trace directly back to events of fifty years ago.</p><p>"The 1960s" (which in fact ran from 1965 to 1975) was a decade of massive change, a rebellion against the stability, growth, and (yes) smugness of the immediate post-World War II era, 1945-65. The 60s are now remembered primarily as a time of youthful rebellion, of sex, drugs, and rock 'n roll. University hippies in Volkswagen microbuses decorated with peace signs represented the vanguard; mellow students followed. Woodstock represented the heights and Altamont Free Concert the depths. British poet <a href="https://www.wussu.com/poems/plam.htm">Philip Larkin</a> memorialized this spirit in a famous poem with its first line, "Sexual intercourse began/In nineteen sixty-three/(which was rather late for me)."</p><p></p><p>But it was not all fun, the leftists of yore adopted classic themes of Marxism-Leninism, focusing on imperialism and insisting that the Western wealth came from plundering the rest of the world. The imperialist system, with its perpetual drive for new markets on which to dump its industrial surplus, stood as humanity's central evil; the war in Vietnam supremely represented its rapaciousness.</p>

<p>Khaled Abou El Fadl, who revels in the title of Omar and Azmeralda Alfi Distinguished Professor in Islamic Law at the UCLA School of Law, has a big theory. As explained in a talk on April 21, 2018, titled "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF6duXfydvc&amp;feature=youtu.be">What It Takes for Islamic Intellectuals Today</a>" (at 37:34-42:05; transcript <a href="http://www.danielpipes.org/rr/2018-04-21-kaef115.pdf">here</a>), his breakthrough idea goes like this:</p><p>As the number of Muslims in the West grew in the late twentieth century, the Christian Right sought a way to counter this "dangerous" new population and devised the idea of promoting supposed Judeo-Christian values to which it connected all things modern &#226;&#128;&#147; "from cars to planes to electricity to computers, everything." The beauty of this myth lay in helping the Christian Right create an alliance with its "natural allies" in what Abou El Fadl calls the Zionist Right.</p><p>And who were the key figures in this alliance? Why, none other than Robert Spencer of JihadWatch.org and myself.</p>

<p>My Middle East Forum colleague Nave Dromi disagrees with the negative view I expressed of Israel's annexing some parts of the West Bank.</p><p>My six-part argument, as spelled out <a href="http://www.danielpipes.org/19457/annexing-the-west-bank-would-hurt-israel">here</a>, boils down to dismissing annexation as too-expensive symbolism. It brings no rewards but creates problems everywhere one looks. Therefore, I conclude, annexation obstructs her and my goal of an Israel Victory and Palestinian defeat.</p><p>Nave's six-part argument, as presented <a href="https://www.jns.org/opinion/sovereignty-is-an-important-step-towards-palestinian-defeat/">here</a>, holds that annexation advances that same goal: It puts territorial pressure on Palestinians. It guarantees security to all. It gives Israel the initiative. It seizes the moment. It has President Trump's reliable backing. It enjoys wide support within Israel.</p><p>I accept most of these points, other than two: those about guaranteeing security (nothing on the ground changes) and about Trump (his volatile views cannot be predicted). But, for the sake of argument, I'll even grant the one about Trump.</p>

<p>Ironically, the same Islamists who disdain and attack infidels also seek their approbation, as shown by the lists they compile of illustrious non-Muslims &#226;&#128;&#147; mostly Westerners &#226;&#128;&#147; who praise Muhammad, Islam, or Muslims. The <a href="http://consultquran.com/page/34/famous-sayings-about-islam-quran-prophet-muhammad-pbuh">admiring views</a> of such prominent figures as Gandhi, Gibbon, Goethe, Napoleon, George Bernard Shaw, Toynbee, and H.G. Wells are a special source of pride.</p><p>Well, imagine my surprise to be added to this list by Siraj Wahhaj, the founder and imam of Brooklyn's Al-Taqwa mosque. He's a leading figure of American Islam. In June 1991, for example, he enjoyed the distinction of delivering the first-ever Islamic prayer in the U.S. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yye8wWunDBo">House of Representatives</a>. Less salubriously, he was <a href="http://www.danielpipes.org/rr/1995-02-02-usgusa049115235.pdf">listed in 1995</a> as one of the "unindicted persons who may be alleged as co-conspirators" in the attempt to blow up New York City monuments.</p>

<p>As Aristotle long ago recognized, virtue is the midpoint between extremes. And I found myself smack at that midpoint in recent days.</p><p>I published a modest article suggesting six reasons why the Jewish state should not extend its sovereignty to a Palestinian-majority territory. (Confusingly, the <i>New York Times</i> titled the May 7 online version "<a href="http://www.danielpipes.org/19457/annexing-the-west-bank-would-hurt-israel">Annexing the West Bank Would Hurt Israel</a>" and the slightly different May 8 print version as "<a href="http://www.danielpipes.org/rr/2020-05-07-no-to-wb-annexation-papernyt.pdf">Annexation Would Hurt Israel</a>.")</p><p>I hardly expected the article to arouse high emotions. It deals with a tactical issue distant from philosophical foundations, principles, or ideology. I did not condemn annexation in principle but only argued that now, given today's circumstances, the tradeoff looks unfavorable compared to the status quo. I evaluated the topic from a mainstream friend-of-Israel vantage point. I did not instruct Israelis what to do but addressed fellow Americans.</p>

<p>Thanks to the Trump administration's "<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/peacetoprosperity/" target="_blank">Peace to Prosperity</a>" plan, the topic of Israel annexing parts of the West Bank has moved from the fringe to the center of Israeli politics. The apparent noninvolvement of the United States <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-politics-pompeo/pompeo-says-annexation-of-west-bank-is-israeli-decision-to-make-idUSKCN2242HW" target="_blank">State Department</a> in the issue has prompted Prime Minister <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/netanyahu-confident-hell-annex-parts-of-west-bank-a-few-months-from-now/" target="_blank">Benjamin Netanyahu</a> to state his confidence that annexation will happen within "a few months," or before the American presidential election in November.</p><p>I am not someone who frets over the Israeli "occupation" of the West Bank: in my view, the Palestinians long ago would have enjoyed self-rule had they stopped murdering Israelis. I ignore the Clinton Parameters, the former American president's compromise formula to resolve the Palestinian-Israeli conflict two decades ago. Contrarily, I do encourage Israeli steps that signal the Palestinians that the conflict is over, and they lost.</p><p>Despite these views, I strongly oppose Israel annexing any of the West Bank, and I do so for six main reasons.</p>

<p>Does Europe have any conservatives? That is, believers in individual responsibility, national independence, free markets, a single law for all, the traditional family, and maximum freedom of speech and religion.</p><p>Seemingly not. Politicians called conservative &#226;&#128;&#147; such as Angela Merkel of Germany Jacques Chirac of France, and Fredrik Reinfeldt of Sweden &#226;&#128;&#147; are often in reality mild leftists, as are their parties. One might conclude that conservatism is defunct in its homeland.</p><p></p><p>One would be wrong. A substantial conservative movement exists and is growing in Europe. It is hiding in plain sight, obscured by being tarred as populists, nationalists, extreme-right, or even Neo&#226;&#128;&#145;Nazis. I call this group by another name: <a href="http://www.danielpipes.org/18301/the-rise-of-western-civilizationism">civilizationists</a>, acknowledging that (1) they focus on preserving Western civilization and (2) they forward some distinctly un-conservative policies (such as increased welfare and pension payments).</p>

<p>From 2002, when Recep Tayyip Erdo&#196;&#159;an and the AK Party reached power, until about 2016, a debate raged among Turkey-watchers in the United States: Is Ankara still an ally?</p><p>Actually, due to nostalgia, that debate dragged on long after it was obvious that Turkey no longer was an ally. That issue, happily, is now closed; NATO membership notwithstanding, nobody seriously makes this claim anymore.</p><p>But a new debate has opened up: Is Turkey's hostility a temporary aberration or the long term new normal? Is it more like Necmettin Erbakan's coming to power in 1996-97 and Mohammed Mursi's in Egypt in 2012-13, or more like the Iranian Revolution, now in its fifth decade?</p><p>Opinion in Washington is divided. Broadly speaking, the president, Defense, State, and business interests argue for it being an aberration; they expect this unfortunate interlude to end with a cheery return to the good old days. Congress and most analysts argue for long-term change; that's my argument here.</p><p>To understand the American debate, one needs to go back to those good old days. The period from Turkey's accession to NATO in 1952 to the key election of 2002 lasted a round 50 years; U.S.-Turkish relations, though not without hitches (most notably mutual fury over Cyprus in 1964), were simple and good: Washington led, Ankara followed.</p>

<p>Is there a silver lining to the disruption caused by the COVID-19 virus? Observers note a variety of possible gains, from long-term lower <a href="https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2020/03/covid19-fear-oil-market-mideast-coronavirus.html">oil prices</a> to improved <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/coronavirus-major-impact-environment-co2-air-quality-animals-1493812">air quality</a>, from weakened <a href="https://ahvalnews.com/turkey-coronavirus/coronavirus-pandemic-strengthens-secular-outlook-islamic-world">extremist movements</a> to a loosening of <a href="http://view.email.bostonglobe.com/?qs=0ce3364798e9514aab7c4e500a40a4e844c6a1d048cb8f03b89436af1c2bb9590934d74452626228f0b339c4a8075d4211534af1bc83d6554d7d53c950cb8e578229fca1517d68dee90b80eb058c01d0880f2f9287e290f6">unneeded regulations</a>. But these possible benefits pale next to the truly big one: shaking Americans out of their complacency and opening their minds to the potential of catastrophe.</p><p>A worldwide virus that has changed nearly everyone's routine and disrupted the economy provides a shocking reminder about the fragility of supply chains, the vulnerability of public health, and the precariousness of democracy. This unsettling experience will have positive consequences if it opens smug minds to the possibility of upheaval. Two existing threats stand out as most likely: electromagnetic pulse (EMP) and the demise of Western civilization.</p>

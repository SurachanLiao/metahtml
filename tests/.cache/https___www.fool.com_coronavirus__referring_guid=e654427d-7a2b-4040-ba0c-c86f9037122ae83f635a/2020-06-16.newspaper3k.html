<div><p>Bear markets are a fact of our investing lives, but they&#8217;re still shocking each time they occur. We&#8217;ve created this page for all investors seeking advice on what they should be doing in this turbulent period. Our most important content can be found in the Editors' Picks section, answering questions about what to buy right now, how much cash to keep on the sidelines, and what stocks could be the biggest winners once this is all behind us.</p><p>And we do believe this will all end up behind us, because we view investing as a long-term endeavor. Borrowing from Warren Buffett: "We have no idea -- and never have had -- whether the market is going to go up, down, or sideways in the near- or intermediate-term future." However, we firmly believe investors will be rewarded over the long term.</p><p>We suggest bookmarking this page as we will update our Editors' Picks periodically -- the Recent Articles section is a live feed of our latest thinking. Finally, we understand that many people are seeking epidemiological information on COVID-19. For that we strictly suggest visiting the information pages set up by the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html">CDC</a> and <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019">WHO</a>.</p><p>For members of The Motley Fool's investing services, you can access all our Coronavirus market coverage at <a href="https://www.fool.com/premium/">fool.com/premium</a> after logging in.</p></div>

However, the first-party "Raspbian" OS image that users have been downloading from the Raspberry Pi Foundation is just one image of several that are built on the Raspbian core. Raspbian.org lists several other Raspbian-powered OS images compiled by other organizations, though most haven't been updated in years.  … <a href="https://www.xbuy.info/2020/05/raspberry-pi-os-why-it-s-no-longer-called-raspbian/" class="more-link">[Read more...] <span class="screen-reader-text">about Raspberry Pi OS: Why It’s No Longer Called ‘Raspbian’</span> Link: https://www.xbuy.info/2020/05/raspberry-pi-os-why-it-s-no-longer-called-raspbian/ </a></ins></p></article><article class="post-74099424 post type-post status-publish format-standard entry"><p><ins>As for Intel's reasoning behind the change, the odd-shaped box presented packaging challenges that Intel covered in a previous PCN (seen above), but the elaborate shipping required to protect the semi-delicate boxes limited the number of chips the company could ship in bulk. It also required numerous foam inserts for stability. The excessive bulk packaging and increased shipping costs, not to mention the fact that the Core i9-9900K is no longer the flagship chip, probably contributed to the change. The Comet Lake flagship comes to market in its own revamped packaging, as seen below. … <a href="https://www.xbuy.info/2020/05/intel-kills-off-core-i9-9900k-speciality-dodecahedron-packaging/" class="more-link">[Read more...] <span class="screen-reader-text">about Intel Kills Off Core i9-9900K Speciality Dodecahedron Packaging</span> Link: https://www.xbuy.info/2020/05/intel-kills-off-core-i9-9900k-speciality-dodecahedron-packaging/ </a></ins></p></article><article class="post-74105928 post type-post status-publish format-standard entry"><p><ins>Most importantly, a four-drive RAID array powered by WD Red NAS HDDs with SMR took anywhere from 13 to 16 times longer to complete a rebuild of a failed array, highlighting that SMR drives can leave data at risk for much longer than standard CMR drives.

But because HBO is a storied service with a multiyear streaming history and a preexisting viewer base that has already delivered content viewers are addicted to, they can get away with what would otherwise sink a new platform. Can you imagine if Netflix asked an additional $5 for access to siloed content? There would be mass outrage. But because HBO was already asking a premium price that did not change with the addition of more content, it feels like a great deal. … <a href="https://www.xbuy.info/2020/05/im-not-mad-hbo-max-im-just-disappointed/" class="more-link">[Read more...] <span class="screen-reader-text">about I’m not mad, HBO Max, I’m just disappointed</span></a></p></article></main>

I think Saudi and allied commandos are doing the killing. The National Council of Resistance of Iran (MEK) reported that Quds Force leader <a title="Elusive but only human." href="http://freebeacon.com/national-security/whatever-happened-to-qassem-soleimani/" target="_blank">Qassem Suleimani was severely wounded in the head</a> when his car was hit by a missile. I think he’s dead.</p> <p>The Quds Force was originally the unit of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) that was responsible for extraterritorial activities. However, so many Quds Force operatives have been killed in Syria that the IRGC began fighting outside the borders of Iran, which it hadn’t done before. It’s not clear how many IRGC troops were sent to Syria, but <a title="Not the Arab League." href="http://www.thomaswictor.com/paper-tiger-revealed-in-syria-say-israelis-guess-who/" target="_blank">Israel says that they’ve been withdrawn due to heavy losses.</a> I think that’s true. The IRGC isn’t trained for unconventional warfare.</p> <p>On December 24, 2015, Iran released what it claims are photos of Qassem Suleimani hale and hearty in the village of Bashkwi (or Bashkoy), Syria, north of Aleppo.</p> <p><del><a href="http://www.thomaswictor.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Bashkwi.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-39226"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-39226" src="http://www.thomaswictor.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Bashkwi-300x189.jpg" alt="Bashkwi" width="300" height="189"> Link: http://www.thomaswictor.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Bashkwi.jpg </a></del></p> <p>Here are some of the images.

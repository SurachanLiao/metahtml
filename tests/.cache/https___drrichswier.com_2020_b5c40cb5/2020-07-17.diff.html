Martin Luther King, Jr., who dreamed of a future where Americans would judge one another “not by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.”</ins><p><ins>The myth that black people are being hunted by the police is doubly tragic because it deflects attention away from the real issue of deadly violence facing black citizens. For people who believe black lives really matter, two questions should be asked:</ins></p><p><ins>First, who is really killing most black people? Second, who are the people really saving black lives?</ins></p><p><ins>It is a fact that black Americans, particularly young black men, are being killed in American cities at an alarming rate—but not because of the police. In 2018, police <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/police-shootings-database/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shot and killed 990 people, 228 of whom were black Link: https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/police-shootings-database/ </a>. The same year, there were 14,123 homicides in the United States. The number of black victims was 7,407, of which <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/251877/murder-victims-in-the-us-by-race-ethnicity-and-gender/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">93% were killed by other black people Link: https://www.statista.com/statistics/251877/murder-victims-in-the-us-by-race-ethnicity-and-gender/ </a>.</ins></p><p><ins>This is the real epidemic confronting the black community, but there is no outrage from the mob or the media. For police-hating professional activists, “black lives matter” only when they are killed by the police. This hypocrisy was on full display during the recent murder of a black teenager in Seattle’s “Autonomous Zone” and the continued carnage in Chicago’s black community. There was no outrage or protest in response to the <a href="https://q13fox.com/2020/06/22/godmother-of-shooting-victim-demands-accountability-from-chop-protesters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cold-blooded shooting Link: https://q13fox.com/2020/06/22/godmother-of-shooting-victim-demands-accountability-from-chop-protesters/ </a>of Lorenzo Anderson in Seattle and zero concern that a violent mob of CHOP comrades prevented police and medics from reaching and saving Lorenzo as he bled to death.</ins></p><ins>The mob and media silence was equally deafening after the </ins><ins><a href="https://abc7chicago.com/chicago-shootings-shooting-weekend-this/6259526/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Father’s Day weekend bloodbath Link: https://abc7chicago.com/chicago-shootings-shooting-weekend-this/6259526/ </a>in Chicago’s black community.

GianCarlo, thanks so much for being here.</strong></del></p><del> </del><p><del><strong>GianCarlo Canaparo: </strong>Thanks for having me, Virginia.</del></p><del> </del><p><del><strong>Allen: Well, I wish that we were here to talk about happier news today, but we are discussing, really, the frighteningly high spike in violent crime in New York City. Last weekend was a really tragic weekend in New York City. Could you begin by just telling us a little bit about what happened last weekend?</strong></del></p><del> </del><p><del><strong>Canaparo:</strong>Sure. I’ll start by telling you the story of Davell Gardner. Davell was 1 year old. He was with family and friends at a neighborhood barbecue when unknown assailants drove up, hopped out of their car, and opened fire on the barbecue. They hit three men, wounding them. Thankfully, all of them seem to be fine, but Davell died of his wounds.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>The same day, two other children, ages 12 and 15, were shot in Brooklyn and Harlem, and they were among a total of 64 people shot in New York, just this last weekend.</del></p><del> </del><p><del><strong>Allen: Wow. And sadly, GianCarlo, this is a trend that we’re seeing right now in New York City. So far this year, New York has seen a 53.5% increase in shootings and a 27% increase in murders. You just wrote a sobering, but really fantastic, piece for The Daily Signal about this crime surge. Could you just give us the big picture of what is going on in New York City right now, as it relates to this rise in violent crime?</strong></del></p><del> </del><p><del><strong>Canaparo:</strong>Yeah, sure. So far, as of the last time that the NYPD put out stats, which was on the fifth of this month, we’ve seen 528 shootings in New York. Like you said, these numbers are up big time; 50% shooting, 63% shooting victims, almost 30% increase in murders just this year.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>This comes following a lot of anti-police protests and riots, as well as New York City’s decision to disband the police force’s anti-crime unit. And New York is not alone in this. We are seeing this trend in a lot of big cities. Chicago is on track to have its most violent year since the mid-’90s. We’ve seen, in that city, 336 murders as of July 2, so this is a really distressing trend of violence throughout America’s big cities.</del></p><del> </del><p><del><strong>Allen: You mentioned that the NYPD, they dismantled their anti-crime unit. What did this unit actually do, and what is not happening in New York City right now because of it being disbanded?</strong></del></p><del> </del><p><del><strong>Canaparo:</strong>Sure. The anti-crime unit was undercover, plainclothes cops assigned to each precinct and city housing. They went after illegal guns, local crime sprees, and focused on burglaries. Incidentally, we’ve seen that burglaries are up 45% in New York this year so far.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>The reason that they were disbanded, I think, is because they were involved in more police shootings than other departments, by the nature of what they did, focusing on violent crimes and guns. But what you’ve seen, then, is that the New York Police Department is now deprived of, basically, its first responders to the most violent types of crimes.</del></p><del> </del><p><del><strong>Allen: Yeah, I mean, it makes sense that if these are the police officers, like you say, that are in plain clothes and living in the community, probably 99% of the time they’re the first ones that are able to be on those crime scenes and respond.</strong></del></p><del> </del><p><del><strong>Canaparo:</strong>Right, exactly right. They’re the officers who are going to be there before people know that the police are there or coming, and so they’re going to be in a lot hotter situations than the average officer who comes in sirens blazing after an incident has commenced or finished.</del></p><del> </del><p><del><strong>Allen: OK, wow. Right now, there’s a lot of finger pointing going on in the Big Apple, with Mayor Bill de Blasio saying it’s the courts and the courts saying no, it’s de Blasio and the NYPD, and everyone is blaming someone else. Who should actually be held accountable and responsible for this massive crime spike?</strong></del></p><del> </del><p><del><strong>Canaparo:</strong>Boy, there’s really no shortage of people to blame. We saw earlier this year that New York undertook some criminal justice reforms, including, I think, the consensus in now is that its bail reform was somewhat disastrous. It released a lot of felons for COVID-19 to get them out of prisons because those were vulnerable populations.</del></p><del> We see that there are elements to these</del> </p>Black Lives Matter <ins>hasn’t protested either.</ins><p><ins>Why are so many black people being killed in American cities? It is an unfortunate, but seldom acknowledged fact that black Americans as a group, particularly young black men, <a href="https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/htus8008.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statistically commit violent crime Link: https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/htus8008.pdf </a>at a rate much higher than their representation in the population. This is especially true in large urban areas. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, despite the black population of the United States being less than 13%, black offenders <a href="https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/htus8008.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">committed 52% of all homicides Link: https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/htus8008.pdf </a>between 1980 and 2008. This higher crime rate also results in more contact with the police. In his book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Taboo-Facts-Cant-Talk-About/dp/162157928X" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Taboo: 10 Facts You Can’t Talk About Link: https://www.amazon.com/Taboo-Facts-Cant-Talk-About/dp/162157928X </a>, Kentucky State University professor Wilfred Reilly observes that “a Black crime rate which is 2.5 times the white crime rate and rises to 10 times the white crime rate in many major cities obviously explains most or all Black-white disparities in terms of unpleasant encounters with the police.”</ins></p><p><ins>So, the answer to the first question is that most black people killed in the United States are being killed by other black people — particularly by young black men. But as to our second question, who is saving the lives of Black people and preventing these outrageous numbers from being even higher? That answer is simple—it is the police.</ins></p><p><ins>Violent crime offender rates in Chicago are similar to most big cities, showing significant overrepresentation of both black victims and perpetrators of violent crime relative to total population. The <a href="https://home.chicagopolice.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/2011-Murder-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chicago Police Department’s Murder Analysis Report of 2011 Link: https://home.chicagopolice.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/2011-Murder-Report.pdf </a>showed that black Americans accounted for 75% of homicide victims and 71% of homicide offenders while comprising only 29% of the city’s population. Most of the city’s violent crime and homicides of black Chicagoans occur in predominately black neighborhoods.</ins></p><p><ins>However, during the period from 1991 to 2011, <a href="https://home.chicagopolice.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/2011-Murder-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">murders were reduced Link: https://home.chicagopolice.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/2011-Murder-Report.pdf </a>by 54% from a high of 943 in 1992 to 433 in 2011. Chicago Police Department manpower and resources were targeted at areas of gun violence; officers arrested shooters who were prosecuted, convicted and sent to prison; thousands of illegal firearms were taken off the streets each year; and police were strategic and proactive, maintaining high visibility to further deter violent crime. These tactics and results were applied and replicated in other big cities.</ins></p><p><ins>In New York City, the reduction in murder and other violent crime was even more dramatic. This unprecedented violent crime reduction in Chicago, New York, and other big cities across the country likely resulted in tens of thousands of black lives saved by the police.</ins></p><p><ins>My 24-year career in the Chicago Police Department spanned this period. I served as a patrolman, gang team officer, sergeant and tactical unit lieutenant in high-crime neighborhoods. How did ordinary, law-abiding black residents view the police? Two examples are instructive.</ins></p><p><ins>In the South Chicago District, I organized and led CPD’s first districtwide bike patrol unit. On our first day of operations, we wanted to make an impression, so I led our eight-member team to ride as a group through the most violent, gang-infested beat in the district. Honestly, we didn’t know what to expect. But as soon as we turned the corner at 80th and Marquette and pedaled down that street, an amazing thing happened. About six or seven black women — mothers and grandmothers — came out on their porches and front steps to cheer, applaud and bless us!</ins></p><p><ins>As a community policing sergeant and lieutenant, I chaired almost 100 community and problem-solving beat meetings in mostly all-black communities. I worked closely with residents—regular people who had to live every day with the intimidation, gang violence, disorder, and fear that neighborhood crime generates. Contrary to the elites and professional anti-police activists who advocate distrust and hatred of the police, the black residents who actually live in these neighborhoods — wanting nothing more than safety and a decent quality of life for their families — had only two complaints about the police: first, that there weren’t enough of us (they wanted more), and second, they wanted to know why couldn’t CPD just knock the thugs and hoodlums off the corners.</ins></p><p><ins>Tragically, violence, shootings and homicides are now back on the rise. The media’s anti-police propaganda war, combined with a lack of support from some department administrations and city governments, have resulted in what Heather MacDonald identified as the “<a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2016/07/ferguson-effect-real-heather-mac-donald-crime-stats-prove-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ferguson Effect Link: https://www.nationalreview.com/2016/07/ferguson-effect-real-heather-mac-donald-crime-stats-prove-it/ </a>.” Because of the hatred that has been deliberately engineered, police officers across the country are understandably backing away from the type of proactive policing that is required to effectively deter violent crime. The result is that violent crime is back up, and so are the numbers of black homicide victims.</ins></p><p><ins>If anyone in America was wondering what a country without the police would look like, they don’t need to imagine it anymore. Riots, looting, arson, mob violence and murder—this is what America looks like when the police are not allowed to enforce the law and maintain order. Without the police, the inevitable result is anarchy and the rule of thugs, gangs and the mob. We saw it happen before our eyes in Seattle, where another mayor and police chief not only surrendered one of their police precinct stations to the mob, but also <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/news/seattle-police-chief-were-not-able-to-get-to-911-calls-for-rape-robbery-in-autonomous-zone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ceded an entire portion of the city Link: https://www.nationalreview.com/news/seattle-police-chief-were-not-able-to-get-to-911-calls-for-rape-robbery-in-autonomous-zone/ </a>where the police were prohibited from patrolling.</ins></p><p><ins>In many cities, lawless mobs have defaced churches, have trashed Christian icons and have torn down historic statues and monuments with no fear of police action and arrest — just as the mob in Portland, Oregon, <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/06/19/george-washington-statue-in-portland-toppled-set-on-fire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pulled down and set fire Link: https://nypost.com/2020/06/19/george-washington-statue-in-portland-toppled-set-on-fire/ </a>to a statue of George Washington with no police in sight.</ins></p><p><ins>This is just commonsense, policing 101. Crime and disorder doesn’t stop itself—the police have to step in and enforce the law, and this isn’t happening in our cities. One of the few enforcement actions taken to put a stop to this anarchist free-for-all was President Donald Trump’s <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/trump-says-he-signed-very-strong-executive-order-to-protect-monuments-and-statues" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">executive order Link: https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/trump-says-he-signed-very-strong-executive-order-to-protect-monuments-and-statues </a> to protect our nation’s monuments.</ins></p><p><ins>The campaign to defund the police is gathering momentum and moving quickly in various forms, but all with the same end goal to sabotage, cripple or eliminate the police. Defunding is already underway in New York, Los Angeles, Seattle and Portland, and the total dismantling of a police department is progressing in Minneapolis.</ins></p><p><ins>But while these are serious threats, nothing can kill an organization quicker than the destruction of its members’ morale. This is proceeding even more rapidly, with little or no push back from police or political leaders. In fact, just the opposite has been happening.</ins></p><p><ins>While every cop in America is being called a racist murderer, rioters who were arrested for attacking the police, looting and other crimes <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/jun/4/prosecutors-dismiss-looting-rioting-charges-agains/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">have been let off scott-free Link: https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/jun/4/prosecutors-dismiss-looting-rioting-charges-agains/ </a>. In New York City, district attorneys <a href="https://townhall.com/tipsheet/elliebufkin/2020/07/07/new-york-city-prosecutor-ignores-widespread-shootings-charges-central-park-karen-instead-n2571969" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">refused to prosecute Link: https://townhall.com/tipsheet/elliebufkin/2020/07/07/new-york-city-prosecutor-ignores-widespread-shootings-charges-central-park-karen-instead-n2571969 </a>hundreds of lawbreakers; in St. Louis <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/missouri-ag-st-louis-looting-rioting-arrests-released" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">36 rioters and looters Link: https://www.foxnews.com/us/missouri-ag-st-louis-looting-rioting-arrests-released </a>were set free without facing charges; and in Fort Worth, the police chief <a href="https://www.fox4news.com/news/fort-worth-police-chief-drops-all-rioting-charges-from-city-protests" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dropped criminal charges Link: https://www.fox4news.com/news/fort-worth-police-chief-drops-all-rioting-charges-from-city-protests </a>against 50 rioters as a gesture of “reconciliation.” Criminal destruction without punishment, attacking police without consequences and advocating physical resistance to lawful arrest all claim moral justification through the lie that the police are systemically racist. This has already resulted in new violence and will lead to more.</ins></p><p><ins>This is a fight for survival, not only for the police, but for our country and civilization, as well. We are rapidly approaching a tipping point. Unless police leaders and decent Americans stand up, speak out and fight back against this all-out assault upon the values and foundations of American society, the far-Left won’t need to defund the police to accomplish its destruction, because policing as an institution will simply implode and slowly die. Good cops will quit or retire early; remaining officers will go through the motions, perform minimal job functions while completely backing off from any proactive police action; and men and women of good character who wanted to serve and make a difference in their communities will not even apply for the job.</ins></p><p><ins>America’s tradition and principles, the rule of law, legitimacy of the police and the foundations of our democracy are being attacked from all sides. We are in a cultural civil war. America can be saved, but it will take police leaders and all Americans who believe in our country to stand up together to speak out—now. This must start with exposing the big lie that that police in the United States are systemically racist.</ins></p><p><ins>COLUMN BY</ins></p><h4 class="uppercase"><ins></ins></h4><p><ins>Maurice Richards is the former Chief of the Martinsburg Police Department in West Virginia. He served as Chief from 2015 to 2020 after 24 years as an officer and lieutenant in the Chicago Police Department.

There is a movement, a Marxist, anti-police, anti-establishment movement behind this motto, which has been encouraging violence and a culture of lawlessness.</del><p><del>We’ve seen that the New York Police Department has, in some cases, not engaged, not put its foot down, which means that people slowly, or rather quickly, actually, learn that there are not consequences to criminal action. So you’ve got this culture of lawlessness and violence that is spinning out of control in New York.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>To see this firsthand, you can go online, and, I mean, there are hundreds, if not thousands, of videos, really disturbing videos of just violent lawlessness going on. The sort of thing that a healthy society does not glorify.</del></p><del> </del><p><del><strong>Allen: To what extent do you think COVID-19 should be factored into this, to where you have a lot of people out of work, or maybe have less work, and they’re bored or they’re restless? Are they maybe now more prone to get involved in criminal activity?</strong></del></p><del> </del><p><del><strong>Canaparo:</strong>Yeah, it’s hard for me to say to what extent COVID-19 is affecting this. But … it makes sense intuitively, to me at least, that with the release of criminals from jails for COVID-19 purposes and the fact that people are not otherwise engaged productively with jobs or what have you, it makes sense to me, these are factors that come together and seem to be causing this problem.</del></p><del> </del><p><del><strong>Allen: Yeah. Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, whose district includes parts of the Bronx and Queens, she made a very interesting comment that the spike in crime was due to poverty and people not being able to feed their families, so they’re stealing bread.</strong></del></p><del> </del><p><del><strong>What does this comment reveal about just how out of touch Rep. Ocasio-Cortez and others, radical leaders on the left, are … with reality?</strong></del></p><del> </del><p><del><strong>Canaparo:</strong>Sure. Well, first, let me walk through how this conversation started, because there’s a timeline here that affects how people are talking about this.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>She gets on a video and she says, “Well, maybe the rising crime has to do with,” like you said, “people feeling the need to shoplift some bread or go hungry,” was her quote.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>That statement taken at face value is belied by the evidence. Right? This is not shoplifting. We’ve seen a 53% rise in shootings. We’ve seen murders on the rise. Burglary is on the rise, and to be clear, an increase in people shoplifting for bread would not lead to a rise in burglary stats because New York charges shoplifting as larceny.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>Now, larceny stats are actually down in New York. Petite larceny, meaning anything less than $1,000, is down 7.5%. Grand larceny for bigger thefts [is] down 20%. So shoplifting is not what’s leading to this rise in violent crimes.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>When she was presented with these facts and got a lot of pushback, she did what she and a lot of politicians often do, which is to retreat from the specific claim into a generality.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>She said, “Republicans are just all upset that I’m connecting the dots between crime and poverty,” is what she said. Well, that’s gaslighting, pure and simple. Right? Because, if this was just about poverty, we would expect to see that month over month, recently, these crime stats would be going down because as economies have slowly reopened, we’ve seen the unemployment levels drop quite dramatically, in fact.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>By the end of July, unemployment dropped about 5%. It’s still very high. It’s still too high, hovering around 11%, but down significantly.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>If her explanation [was correct], crime, poverty are related was the explanation here, we’d expect to see month over month a drop. But, in fact, what we’ve seen is month over month, 165% more shootings, 204% more shooting victims, and 21% more murders, month over month. That causality is backwards.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>Even if she’s allowed to retreat away from her specific claim that this is shoplifting, her general claim that this is just the relationship between crime and poverty doesn’t explain what’s going on.</del></p><del> </del><p><del><strong>Allen: Wow. Well, New York has showed us that defunding parts of your police department, it doesn’t work. It only leads to more chaos, more crime. But it’s obvious, after the death of George Floyd at the hand of police officer Derek Chauvin that reforms do need to take place and … need to happen.</strong></del></p><del> </del><p><del><strong>How should cities and communities across America respond to the death of George Floyd so that another man or woman is not wrongfully killed at the hands of a police officer?</strong></del></p><del> </del><p><del><strong>Canaparo:</strong>What we need to see from reformists is a commitment to reform based on what we actually know, and not just what we think or feel we know about how police behave.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>We need targeted reforms that prevent or punish or eliminate bad actors from within the police forces. But to paint with a broad brush and to simply disband, defund, or eliminate police forces will only encourage bad actors in the community to do what they’re going to do with impunity.</del></p><del> </del><p><del><strong>Allen: GianCarlo, to what extent is this a state and local level issue versus something that Congress should take action on?</strong></del></p><del> </del><p><del><strong>Canaparo:</strong>Oh, it’s almost exclusively a state and local issue because the vast, vast majority of police-citizen interactions are at the state and local level. Federal police forces are not out there on the street dealing with people on a day-to-day basis.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>Every community is going to have different needs. Communities that are quieter, communities that have a lot more police presence, they’re going to have different needs and considerations, and how each community interacts with its police force is a deeply local decision.</del></p><del> </del><p><del><strong>Allen: Yeah, interesting. New York had terrible crime in the 1970s and Mayor Rudy Giuliani is largely credited with cleaning up crime in the ’90s. Although, his methods have been attacked by some. What is New York City’s history of crime?</strong></del></p><del> </del><p><del><strong>Canaparo:</strong>In a city like New York, it’s really easy for somebody to get lost in the crowd. That dynamic, that mentality can lend itself well to, in some people, the conception that, “Well, I can commit crime because I won’t get caught.”</del></p><del> </del><p><del>What big cities like New York and Chicago need is a police presence that is there, that’s visible, that’s engaged and involved with the community. To cultivate not only a sense that police are there for our protection for the vast majority of people who are good and law-abiding citizens, but also to cultivate amongst people who are not that they are not going to get away with criminal behavior.</del></p><del> </del><p><del><strong>Allen: If you could sit down with some of New York City’s leaders today and say, “Hey guys, this is really what we need to implement first. Today, right now, this is what needs to change in order to strengthen that police force and bring this crime surge down,” what would you say to them?</strong></del></p><del> </del><p><del><strong>Canaparo:</strong>A couple of things. No. 1, again, I would just reiterate that to tackle these issues, we need to be going at it from a data-driven approach—what do we actually know—and not listen to social activists who are espousing of a philosophy that is not necessarily tied to the facts. …</del></p><del> </del><p><del>No. 2, there are going to be bad actors within the police forces, like there are bad actors everywhere. We need a system where they can be found out and punished.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>Now, one of the problems that police forces face is, as with teachers and other unions, a union can create a lot of stickiness for bad actors in the police force, that they can’t be fired or they can’t be removed from the beat. Those sort of concerns need to be whittled down.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>On the other side of the extreme, though, you can’t just get rid of your police forces in an overcorrection because there are always going to be bad actors in the community as well.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>You’ve got to find that balance. You need the police engaged with the community, building trust with the community, present in the community. But you can’t divorce from that relationship the fact that police are necessary, most police are good, hardworking people who are just trying to do their jobs.</del></p><del> </del><p><del><strong>Allen: We encourage all of our listeners to follow GianCarlo’s work and follow him on Twitter, @gcanaparo.

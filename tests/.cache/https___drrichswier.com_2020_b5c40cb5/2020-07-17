<p>Each week brings more bad news on “cancel culture”&#8212;primarily individuals losing their jobs for one alleged offensive statement. Cancel culture is about shutting people down based on passing, momentary ideological fads.</p>
<ul>
<li>The communications director of Boeing was forced to abruptly resign because someone complained about an article he wrote in 1988 arguing against women serving in combat.</li>
<li>J.K. Rowling, the creator of Harry Potter, is being attacked by cancel culture for her pointing out the obvious&#8212;men do not menstruate. Even if a man becomes a transgenderized “female,” he still will not menstruate. “Off with her head!” declare the snowflakes.</li>
<li>Professor Dr. Mike Adams was drummed out of the University of North Carolina because of a few politically incorrect tweets.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cancel culture, which is political correctness on steroids, demands rigid conformity to a stifling, ever-changing set of rules, so that things that were uncontroversial a decade ago are now fireable offenses. It requires yesterday’s heroes to live up to today’s momentary standards&#8211;and if they don’t, we need to tear them down.</p>
<p>Have we now become a nation of what one judge called “eggshell plaintiffs”?</p>
<p>The phrase goes back to a case in the early 1990s, in Bloomingdale, Michigan, when a painting in a public school was removed. The painting was that of Christ, and it had been hanging in that high school since 1962, when the doors first opened.</p>
<p>An agnostic student claimed he suffered &#8220;psychological damage&#8221; by seeing the portrait. The ACLU sued on his behalf. The court agreed, even though one concurring judge in the case said it regrettably creates &#8220;a class of &#8216;eggshell&#8217; plaintiffs&#8221;&#8212;-plaintiffs who get offended too easily. The painting came down.</p>
<p>Recently, a group of liberal writers and academics posted a now famous open letter on Harpers calling effectively for an end to cancel culture because it is stifling free speech and robust debate.</p>
<p>This letter signed by J. K. Rowling, Noam Chomsky, Salmon Rushdie, and nearly 200 other liberals, asseverates: &#8220;Editors are fired for running controversial pieces; books are withdrawn for alleged inauthenticity; journalists are barred from writing on certain topics; professors are investigated for quoting works of literature in class; a researcher is fired for circulating a peer-reviewed academic study; and the heads of organizations are ousted for what are sometimes just clumsy mistakes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Incredibly, this basic affirmation of free speech was viciously attacked by the cancel mob—thus proving the point of the authors.</p>
<p>The ultimate antidote to cancel culture gets back to one of the core messages of Jesus Christ: The Golden Rule.</p>
<p>In His Sermon on the Mount, Christ gave one of the greatest prescriptions for healthy living in one sentence. Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. He said this “sums up the Law and the Prophets.” In other words, the whole Old Testament or the Hebrew Bible can be summed up in the Golden Rule.</p>
<p>The cancel culture does the opposite. They tear down statues. They troll people on the internet, looking for ways to destroy reputations&#8212;and maybe even get people fired.</p>
<p>We live in God’s world, and He has designed things in such a way that we reap what we sow. If you engage in cancel culture, don’t be surprised if bad things you have done unto others will end up coming unto you.</p>
<p>The Bible also says: You may be sure that your sins will find you out. Even when people take to Twitter in a pseudonym, it will one day be found out. Again to quote Jesus: What you whisper today will one day be shouted from the housetops.</p>
<p>Secular people don’t like the idea of a God who will judge us, but there is a God who will one day judge us. And yet, even secular people speak of Karma. What is Karma, but the idea that we reap what we sow?</p>
<p>Dr. Walter Williams, a columnist and a professor at George Mason University, once told me in an interview that liberty is predicated on courage&#8212;even being courageous enough to be possibly offended.</p>
<p>Williams told me, “In order to be for liberty, you have to be a very, very brave person, that is, you have to trust that people will say and do voluntary things with which you disagree….The true test of one’s commitment to free speech doesn’t come when he allows people to be free to say the things that he agrees with; it comes when he allows people to be free to say those things that he finds offensive.”</p>
<p>The problem with snowflakes is that eventually they melt. So here’s a message to any part of the cancel culture: If you don’t want people to cancel you or your work, then stop cancelling the work of others.</p>

<p>TOM TRENTO, Director of The United West introduces <a href="https://youtu.be/egJXGlsrDg8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Damon Rosen&#8217;s powerful expose of the Marxist organization &#8220;Black Live Matter.&#8221;</a> Not only is this terrorist group intent on destroying America but it also has its sights on Israel, working with Islamic terrorists, in a Red-Green axis, to destroy any and everything that has a Judeo-Christian foundation. How can any Jew or Israel-supporting Christian support this organization or movement?! Its leaders and spokespeople are openly hostile to the Jewish state and people.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s ironic that the people preaching against hate and intolerance, are among the most hateful, intolerant groups on Earth.</p>
<p>Damon Rosen is an investigative activist with The United West and currently lives and works in Israel.</p>

<hr />
<p>Recent looting, arson and targeted violence against police wasn’t about police reform, and the assassination of police officers wasn’t about mourning or respecting George Floyd—so what’s really going on?</p>
<p>A quick look at two radical movements behind George Floyd protests — Antifa and Black Lives Matter — provides some insight. It is difficult to pin down an official “party line” with these amorphous groups, but there are similarities: The Black Lives Matter organization has called for <a href="https://blacklivesmatter.com/defundthepolice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">national defunding of police</a> and <a href="https://blacklivesmatter.com/what-we-believe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dismantling the nuclear family</a>. The Movement for Black Lives calls for a <a href="https://m4bl.org/policy-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marxist-inspired agenda</a>, which includes <a href="https://m4bl.org/defund-the-police/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">defunding police</a>, <a href="https://m4bl.org/policy-platforms/end-jails-prisons-detention/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eliminating prisons</a>, ending all <a href="https://m4bl.org/policy-platforms/end-the-war-on-migrants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">immigration enforcement</a>, and paying <a href="https://m4bl.org/policy-platforms/reparations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">slavery reparations</a>. Antifa is even less centralized, but its adherents’ penchant for <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/gabriel-nadales-jerrold-nadler-claims-antifa-imaginary" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">destruction</a>, <a href="https://reason.com/2019/06/29/antifa-andy-ngo-mob-milkshake-violence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">violence</a>, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-or/pr/seven-arrested-facing-federal-charges-after-weekend-riots-hatfield-federal-courthouse" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">riots</a> and <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2020/06/04/richmond-federal-courthouse-antifa-arson-riots/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vandalism</a> inspired by the supposed “<a href="https://www.city-journal.org/antifa-seattle-capitol-hill-autonomous-zone" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">racialized capitalism</a>” of the United States is well documented.</p>
<p>The common thread uniting these movements is the belief that the United States as a country is illegitimate, inherently racist, and irredeemable. They view the police as racist defenders of this evil order.</p>
<p>This destructive pathology is a theme being <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/may/24/editorial-1619-project-bad-history-fueled-bad-moti/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">echoed</a> by many media and left-wing elites. In doing so, they fan the dangerous flames of racial hatred and violence while they <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/media-ignores-chop-seattle-violence-gainor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">downplay</a> theft, <a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/watch-mn-protests-mostly-peaceful-msnbc-reporter-says-while-standing-in-front-of-burning-buildings" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">arson</a>, mob violence, the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/jun/4/riot-deaths-ignored-by-major-networks-watchdog-fin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">killing of innocent citizens</a>, and the <a href="https://thefederalist.com/2020/06/05/while-defending-rioters-the-media-ignores-slain-black-police-officers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">assassinations of police officers</a>. The damage and vandalism that rioters have inflicted reveal their true motives and hatred for America. In Boston, a monument was <a href="https://www.wbur.org/artery/2020/06/03/16-statues-memorials-damaged" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">desecrated</a> honoring the 54th Massachusetts, the first black volunteer regiment in the Union Army that fought in the Civil War, which, of course, ended slavery. In Washington, D.C., the Lincoln Memorial and the World War II Monument — dedicated to Americans who died fighting the real fascists of Germany, Italy, and Japan — were <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/jun/1/lincoln-memorial-wwii-memorial-defaced-vandals-rio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">defaced</a>.</p>
<p>During the recent anarchy, a disturbing trend became clear — much mainstream media supported the <a href="https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/nicholas-fondacaro/2020/06/08/war-peace-nets-use-orwellian-doublespeak-defund-police" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">defund-the-police agenda</a> while <a href="https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/bill-dagostino/2020/06/02/video-tv-journalists-defend-excuse-five-nights-riots" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rationalizing mob violence</a>. They appear to be in total collusion with the far-Left. As historian and columnist Victor Davis Hanson <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/podcasts/the-victor-davis-hanson-podcast/episode-20-general-elect-tricks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">observed</a>, “There’s a narrative where the Media has joined Antifa and Black Lives Matter in forging the agenda that the United States was at the beginning, in continuation, in its present, and in the future a racist country that can only be remedied by violence that draws attention to the need for radical redistribution and reparations.”</p>
<p>This is exactly what we are seeing. The media is pivoting from the fake charge that the police are systemically racist to the position that <a href="https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/kyle-drennen/2020/06/01/cbs-lines-experts-say-white-americans-have-contempt-black-life" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">all white people are racist</a>. Making an assertion designed to turn black and white Americans against each other, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/don-lemon-racist-born-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CNN anchor Don Lemon asked</a> “if you grew up in America, you came out of American soil. Considering the history of this country, how can you not be racist? How can you not have racial blindspots, how can you not see that the factory reset in America is whiteness?” This is pure projection, because making a value judgment on people based upon their skin color is part of the very essence of racism. It is the antithesis of the <a href="https://www.archives.gov/files/press/exhibits/dream-speech.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">example, beliefs and teachings</a> of Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., who dreamed of a future where Americans would judge one another “not by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.”</p>
<p>The myth that black people are being hunted by the police is doubly tragic because it deflects attention away from the real issue of deadly violence facing black citizens. For people who believe black lives really matter, two questions should be asked:</p>
<p>First, who is really killing most black people? Second, who are the people really saving black lives?</p>
<p>It is a fact that black Americans, particularly young black men, are being killed in American cities at an alarming rate—but not because of the police. In 2018, police <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/police-shootings-database/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shot and killed 990 people, 228 of whom were black</a>. The same year, there were 14,123 homicides in the United States. The number of black victims was 7,407, of which <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/251877/murder-victims-in-the-us-by-race-ethnicity-and-gender/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">93% were killed by other black people</a>.</p>
<p>This is the real epidemic confronting the black community, but there is no outrage from the mob or the media. For police-hating professional activists, “black lives matter” only when they are killed by the police. This hypocrisy was on full display during the recent murder of a black teenager in Seattle’s “Autonomous Zone” and the continued carnage in Chicago’s black community. There was no outrage or protest in response to the <a href="https://q13fox.com/2020/06/22/godmother-of-shooting-victim-demands-accountability-from-chop-protesters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cold-blooded shooting</a> of Lorenzo Anderson in Seattle and zero concern that a violent mob of CHOP comrades prevented police and medics from reaching and saving Lorenzo as he bled to death.</p>
<p>The mob and media silence was equally deafening after the <a href="https://abc7chicago.com/chicago-shootings-shooting-weekend-this/6259526/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Father’s Day weekend bloodbath</a> in Chicago’s black community. More than 100 were shot with 15 dead, including four black children—one of them three-year-old Mekhi James. The deadly Chicago weekend was not an outlier. The slaughter has continued over the last two weeks, with more than 150 people shot and 40 dead, almost all in the black community. Among those killed since late June <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/crime/2020/7/5/21313920/children-killed-gun-violence-independence-day-fourth-july-weekend-natalia-wallace" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">have been 10 children under the age of 18</a> including seven-year-old Natalia Wallace and one-year-old Sincere Gaston. The leftwing media hasn’t dwelt on their murders and Black Lives Matter hasn’t protested either.</p>
<p>Why are so many black people being killed in American cities? It is an unfortunate, but seldom acknowledged fact that black Americans as a group, particularly young black men, <a href="https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/htus8008.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statistically commit violent crime</a> at a rate much higher than their representation in the population. This is especially true in large urban areas. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, despite the black population of the United States being less than 13%, black offenders <a href="https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/htus8008.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">committed 52% of all homicides</a> between 1980 and 2008. This higher crime rate also results in more contact with the police. In his book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Taboo-Facts-Cant-Talk-About/dp/162157928X" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Taboo: 10 Facts You Can’t Talk About</a>, Kentucky State University professor Wilfred Reilly observes that “a Black crime rate which is 2.5 times the white crime rate and rises to 10 times the white crime rate in many major cities obviously explains most or all Black-white disparities in terms of unpleasant encounters with the police.”</p>
<p>So, the answer to the first question is that most black people killed in the United States are being killed by other black people — particularly by young black men. But as to our second question, who is saving the lives of Black people and preventing these outrageous numbers from being even higher? That answer is simple—it is the police.</p>
<p>Violent crime offender rates in Chicago are similar to most big cities, showing significant overrepresentation of both black victims and perpetrators of violent crime relative to total population. The <a href="https://home.chicagopolice.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/2011-Murder-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chicago Police Department’s Murder Analysis Report of 2011</a> showed that black Americans accounted for 75% of homicide victims and 71% of homicide offenders while comprising only 29% of the city’s population. Most of the city’s violent crime and homicides of black Chicagoans occur in predominately black neighborhoods.</p>
<p>However, during the period from 1991 to 2011, <a href="https://home.chicagopolice.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/2011-Murder-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">murders were reduced</a> by 54% from a high of 943 in 1992 to 433 in 2011. Chicago Police Department manpower and resources were targeted at areas of gun violence; officers arrested shooters who were prosecuted, convicted and sent to prison; thousands of illegal firearms were taken off the streets each year; and police were strategic and proactive, maintaining high visibility to further deter violent crime. These tactics and results were applied and replicated in other big cities.</p>
<p>In New York City, the reduction in murder and other violent crime was even more dramatic. This unprecedented violent crime reduction in Chicago, New York, and other big cities across the country likely resulted in tens of thousands of black lives saved by the police.</p>
<p>My 24-year career in the Chicago Police Department spanned this period. I served as a patrolman, gang team officer, sergeant and tactical unit lieutenant in high-crime neighborhoods. How did ordinary, law-abiding black residents view the police? Two examples are instructive.</p>
<p>In the South Chicago District, I organized and led CPD’s first districtwide bike patrol unit. On our first day of operations, we wanted to make an impression, so I led our eight-member team to ride as a group through the most violent, gang-infested beat in the district. Honestly, we didn’t know what to expect. But as soon as we turned the corner at 80th and Marquette and pedaled down that street, an amazing thing happened. About six or seven black women — mothers and grandmothers — came out on their porches and front steps to cheer, applaud and bless us!</p>
<p>As a community policing sergeant and lieutenant, I chaired almost 100 community and problem-solving beat meetings in mostly all-black communities. I worked closely with residents—regular people who had to live every day with the intimidation, gang violence, disorder, and fear that neighborhood crime generates. Contrary to the elites and professional anti-police activists who advocate distrust and hatred of the police, the black residents who actually live in these neighborhoods — wanting nothing more than safety and a decent quality of life for their families — had only two complaints about the police: first, that there weren’t enough of us (they wanted more), and second, they wanted to know why couldn’t CPD just knock the thugs and hoodlums off the corners.</p>
<p>Tragically, violence, shootings and homicides are now back on the rise. The media’s anti-police propaganda war, combined with a lack of support from some department administrations and city governments, have resulted in what Heather MacDonald identified as the “<a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2016/07/ferguson-effect-real-heather-mac-donald-crime-stats-prove-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ferguson Effect</a>.” Because of the hatred that has been deliberately engineered, police officers across the country are understandably backing away from the type of proactive policing that is required to effectively deter violent crime. The result is that violent crime is back up, and so are the numbers of black homicide victims.</p>
<p>If anyone in America was wondering what a country without the police would look like, they don’t need to imagine it anymore. Riots, looting, arson, mob violence and murder—this is what America looks like when the police are not allowed to enforce the law and maintain order. Without the police, the inevitable result is anarchy and the rule of thugs, gangs and the mob. We saw it happen before our eyes in Seattle, where another mayor and police chief not only surrendered one of their police precinct stations to the mob, but also <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/news/seattle-police-chief-were-not-able-to-get-to-911-calls-for-rape-robbery-in-autonomous-zone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ceded an entire portion of the city</a> where the police were prohibited from patrolling.</p>
<p>In many cities, lawless mobs have defaced churches, have trashed Christian icons and have torn down historic statues and monuments with no fear of police action and arrest — just as the mob in Portland, Oregon, <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/06/19/george-washington-statue-in-portland-toppled-set-on-fire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pulled down and set fire</a> to a statue of George Washington with no police in sight.</p>
<p>This is just commonsense, policing 101. Crime and disorder doesn’t stop itself—the police have to step in and enforce the law, and this isn’t happening in our cities. One of the few enforcement actions taken to put a stop to this anarchist free-for-all was President Donald Trump’s <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/trump-says-he-signed-very-strong-executive-order-to-protect-monuments-and-statues" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">executive order</a> to protect our nation’s monuments.</p>
<p>The campaign to defund the police is gathering momentum and moving quickly in various forms, but all with the same end goal to sabotage, cripple or eliminate the police. Defunding is already underway in New York, Los Angeles, Seattle and Portland, and the total dismantling of a police department is progressing in Minneapolis.</p>
<p>But while these are serious threats, nothing can kill an organization quicker than the destruction of its members’ morale. This is proceeding even more rapidly, with little or no push back from police or political leaders. In fact, just the opposite has been happening.</p>
<p>While every cop in America is being called a racist murderer, rioters who were arrested for attacking the police, looting and other crimes <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/jun/4/prosecutors-dismiss-looting-rioting-charges-agains/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">have been let off scott-free</a>. In New York City, district attorneys <a href="https://townhall.com/tipsheet/elliebufkin/2020/07/07/new-york-city-prosecutor-ignores-widespread-shootings-charges-central-park-karen-instead-n2571969" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">refused to prosecute</a> hundreds of lawbreakers; in St. Louis <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/missouri-ag-st-louis-looting-rioting-arrests-released" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">36 rioters and looters</a> were set free without facing charges; and in Fort Worth, the police chief <a href="https://www.fox4news.com/news/fort-worth-police-chief-drops-all-rioting-charges-from-city-protests" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dropped criminal charges</a> against 50 rioters as a gesture of “reconciliation.” Criminal destruction without punishment, attacking police without consequences and advocating physical resistance to lawful arrest all claim moral justification through the lie that the police are systemically racist. This has already resulted in new violence and will lead to more.</p>
<p>This is a fight for survival, not only for the police, but for our country and civilization, as well. We are rapidly approaching a tipping point. Unless police leaders and decent Americans stand up, speak out and fight back against this all-out assault upon the values and foundations of American society, the far-Left won’t need to defund the police to accomplish its destruction, because policing as an institution will simply implode and slowly die. Good cops will quit or retire early; remaining officers will go through the motions, perform minimal job functions while completely backing off from any proactive police action; and men and women of good character who wanted to serve and make a difference in their communities will not even apply for the job.</p>
<p>America’s tradition and principles, the rule of law, legitimacy of the police and the foundations of our democracy are being attacked from all sides. We are in a cultural civil war. America can be saved, but it will take police leaders and all Americans who believe in our country to stand up together to speak out—now. This must start with exposing the big lie that that police in the United States are systemically racist.</p>

<p>My latest in <a href="https://pjmedia.com/culture/robert-spencer/2020/07/13/washington-post-now-that-weve-finished-off-the-redskins-the-texas-rangers-must-go-n636947" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PJ Media</a>:</p>
<p>Baseball, like the other major sports, has become insufferably woke, and so the Texas Rangers — like the Cleveland Indians and football’s Washington Redskins — are likely not long for this world. Buoyed by the scalping of the Washington Redskins, the <em>Washington Post</em>’s Karen Attiah, who <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/jun/29/karen-attiah-washington-post-editor-white-women-ar/">wants white women to consider themselves lucky</a> that she isn’t calling for “revenge” for their voting for Trump, is now <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/07/13/texas-rangers-team-name-must-go/">calling for the Texas Rangers baseball team to change its name</a>, because, doncha know, the Rangers were supposedly “white supremacists.”</p>
<p>Now, <a href="https://pjmedia.com/news-and-politics/robert-spencer/2020/07/03/no-theyre-not-stupid-why-leftists-destroyed-a-statue-of-an-elk-in-portland-n603513">I myself have cautioned</a> against looking for consistency or rationality from the left, but Karen Attiah’s demand is irrational far beyond even the attacks on statues of <a href="https://pjmedia.com/culture/tyler-o-neil/2020/07/06/statue-honoring-frederick-douglass-in-his-home-city-toppled-on-anniversary-of-his-famous-speech-n608041">Frederick Douglass</a> and Ulysses S. Grant from people who claim they’re lashing out against racism.</p>
<p>Karen Attiah apparently doesn’t realize that she has now entangled herself in a giant contradiction. After all, we have been hearing for years now that the Redskins, Indians, and the like had to change their names because they insulted and belittled Native Americans. But if that is true, and the law enforcement Texas Rangers were really the genocidal racists Attiah claims them to be, shouldn’t the baseball Texas Rangers actually keep their name, so as to insult and belittle Texas Rangers?</p>
<p>Attiah can’t have her cake and eat it too, no matter how hard she tries. If sports nicknames are negative and insult the people the teams are named after, and what she says about the historical Rangers is true (it isn’t: an actual historian of the Rangers, Dr. Jody Edward Ginn, details in his book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/East-Texas-Troubles-Rangers-Augustine/dp/0806162910/pjmedia-20"><em>East Texas Troubles</em></a> that the Rangers helped break up a white gang in East Texas, and convicted them on the basis of testimony from black victims), then it’s altogether fitting and proper for the baseball Rangers to bear that name. But she is assuming in this case that sports nicknames actually glorify the people the teams are named after, and so it won’t do, not at all, to have a team named after the Texas Rangers, as these “white supremacists” must in no way be glorified.</p>
<p>But if the Texas Rangers baseball team constitutes praise for the Rangers, wouldn’t Indians, Redskins, Braves, and the like be favorable portrayals of Native Americans, in which case there would be no need to change the teams’ names?</p>
<p>There is much more. Read the rest <a href="https://pjmedia.com/culture/robert-spencer/2020/07/13/washington-post-now-that-weve-finished-off-the-redskins-the-texas-rangers-must-go-n636947" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

<p>New York City has seen a 53.5% increase in shootings and a 27% increase in killings this year, <a href="https://www.dailysignal.com/2020/07/15/aoc-gets-caught-gaslighting-about-new-yorks-rising-violent-crime/">according to</a> GianCarlo Canaparo, a legal fellow with The Heritage Foundation’s Edwin Meese III Center for Legal and Judicial Studies.</p>
<p>The New York City Police Department disbanded its plainclothes Anti-Crime Unit amid calls to defund the police in the wake of the killing of George Floyd. The increased violence might be a result in part of the city’s decision to disband the unit.</p>
<p>Canaparo joins the show to explain the factors contributing to New York City’s crime spike and what should be done to curb the violence.</p>

<p><strong>Virginia Allen: I am joined by GianCarlo Canaparo, Heritage Foundation legal fellow. GianCarlo, thanks so much for being here.</strong></p>
<p><strong>GianCarlo Canaparo: </strong>Thanks for having me, Virginia.</p>
<p><strong>Allen: Well, I wish that we were here to talk about happier news today, but we are discussing, really, the frighteningly high spike in violent crime in New York City. Last weekend was a really tragic weekend in New York City. Could you begin by just telling us a little bit about what happened last weekend?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Canaparo:</strong> Sure. I’ll start by telling you the story of Davell Gardner. Davell was 1 year old. He was with family and friends at a neighborhood barbecue when unknown assailants drove up, hopped out of their car, and opened fire on the barbecue. They hit three men, wounding them. Thankfully, all of them seem to be fine, but Davell died of his wounds.</p>
<p>The same day, two other children, ages 12 and 15, were shot in Brooklyn and Harlem, and they were among a total of 64 people shot in New York, just this last weekend.</p>
<p><strong>Allen: Wow. And sadly, GianCarlo, this is a trend that we’re seeing right now in New York City. So far this year, New York has seen a 53.5% increase in shootings and a 27% increase in murders. You just wrote a sobering, but really fantastic, piece for The Daily Signal about this crime surge. Could you just give us the big picture of what is going on in New York City right now, as it relates to this rise in violent crime?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Canaparo:</strong> Yeah, sure. So far, as of the last time that the NYPD put out stats, which was on the fifth of this month, we’ve seen 528 shootings in New York. Like you said, these numbers are up big time; 50% shooting, 63% shooting victims, almost 30% increase in murders just this year.</p>
<p>This comes following a lot of anti-police protests and riots, as well as New York City’s decision to disband the police force’s anti-crime unit. And New York is not alone in this. We are seeing this trend in a lot of big cities. Chicago is on track to have its most violent year since the mid-’90s. We’ve seen, in that city, 336 murders as of July 2, so this is a really distressing trend of violence throughout America’s big cities.</p>
<p><strong>Allen: You mentioned that the NYPD, they dismantled their anti-crime unit. What did this unit actually do, and what is not happening in New York City right now because of it being disbanded?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Canaparo:</strong> Sure. The anti-crime unit was undercover, plainclothes cops assigned to each precinct and city housing. They went after illegal guns, local crime sprees, and focused on burglaries. Incidentally, we’ve seen that burglaries are up 45% in New York this year so far.</p>
<p>The reason that they were disbanded, I think, is because they were involved in more police shootings than other departments, by the nature of what they did, focusing on violent crimes and guns. But what you’ve seen, then, is that the New York Police Department is now deprived of, basically, its first responders to the most violent types of crimes.</p>
<p><strong>Allen: Yeah, I mean, it makes sense that if these are the police officers, like you say, that are in plain clothes and living in the community, probably 99% of the time they’re the first ones that are able to be on those crime scenes and respond.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Canaparo:</strong> Right, exactly right. They’re the officers who are going to be there before people know that the police are there or coming, and so they’re going to be in a lot hotter situations than the average officer who comes in sirens blazing after an incident has commenced or finished.</p>
<p><strong>Allen: OK, wow. Right now, there’s a lot of finger pointing going on in the Big Apple, with Mayor Bill de Blasio saying it’s the courts and the courts saying no, it’s de Blasio and the NYPD, and everyone is blaming someone else. Who should actually be held accountable and responsible for this massive crime spike?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Canaparo:</strong> Boy, there’s really no shortage of people to blame. We saw earlier this year that New York undertook some criminal justice reforms, including, I think, the consensus in now is that its bail reform was somewhat disastrous. It released a lot of felons for COVID-19 to get them out of prisons because those were vulnerable populations.</p>
<p>We see that there are elements to these Black Lives Matter protests, which are more than just a cry for justice. There is a movement, a Marxist, anti-police, anti-establishment movement behind this motto, which has been encouraging violence and a culture of lawlessness.</p>
<p>We’ve seen that the New York Police Department has, in some cases, not engaged, not put its foot down, which means that people slowly, or rather quickly, actually, learn that there are not consequences to criminal action. So you’ve got this culture of lawlessness and violence that is spinning out of control in New York.</p>
<p>To see this firsthand, you can go online, and, I mean, there are hundreds, if not thousands, of videos, really disturbing videos of just violent lawlessness going on. The sort of thing that a healthy society does not glorify.</p>
<p><strong>Allen: To what extent do you think COVID-19 should be factored into this, to where you have a lot of people out of work, or maybe have less work, and they’re bored or they’re restless? Are they maybe now more prone to get involved in criminal activity?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Canaparo:</strong> Yeah, it’s hard for me to say to what extent COVID-19 is affecting this. But … it makes sense intuitively, to me at least, that with the release of criminals from jails for COVID-19 purposes and the fact that people are not otherwise engaged productively with jobs or what have you, it makes sense to me, these are factors that come together and seem to be causing this problem.</p>
<p><strong>Allen: Yeah. Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, whose district includes parts of the Bronx and Queens, she made a very interesting comment that the spike in crime was due to poverty and people not being able to feed their families, so they’re stealing bread.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What does this comment reveal about just how out of touch Rep. Ocasio-Cortez and others, radical leaders on the left, are … with reality?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Canaparo:</strong> Sure. Well, first, let me walk through how this conversation started, because there’s a timeline here that affects how people are talking about this.</p>
<p>She gets on a video and she says, “Well, maybe the rising crime has to do with,” like you said, “people feeling the need to shoplift some bread or go hungry,” was her quote.</p>
<p>That statement taken at face value is belied by the evidence. Right? This is not shoplifting. We’ve seen a 53% rise in shootings. We’ve seen murders on the rise. Burglary is on the rise, and to be clear, an increase in people shoplifting for bread would not lead to a rise in burglary stats because New York charges shoplifting as larceny.</p>
<p>Now, larceny stats are actually down in New York. Petite larceny, meaning anything less than $1,000, is down 7.5%. Grand larceny for bigger thefts [is] down 20%. So shoplifting is not what’s leading to this rise in violent crimes.</p>
<p>When she was presented with these facts and got a lot of pushback, she did what she and a lot of politicians often do, which is to retreat from the specific claim into a generality.</p>
<p>She said, “Republicans are just all upset that I’m connecting the dots between crime and poverty,” is what she said. Well, that’s gaslighting, pure and simple. Right? Because, if this was just about poverty, we would expect to see that month over month, recently, these crime stats would be going down because as economies have slowly reopened, we’ve seen the unemployment levels drop quite dramatically, in fact.</p>
<p>By the end of July, unemployment dropped about 5%. It’s still very high. It’s still too high, hovering around 11%, but down significantly.</p>
<p>If her explanation [was correct], crime, poverty are related was the explanation here, we’d expect to see month over month a drop. But, in fact, what we’ve seen is month over month, 165% more shootings, 204% more shooting victims, and 21% more murders, month over month. That causality is backwards.</p>
<p>Even if she’s allowed to retreat away from her specific claim that this is shoplifting, her general claim that this is just the relationship between crime and poverty doesn’t explain what’s going on.</p>
<p><strong>Allen: Wow. Well, New York has showed us that defunding parts of your police department, it doesn’t work. It only leads to more chaos, more crime. But it’s obvious, after the death of George Floyd at the hand of police officer Derek Chauvin that reforms do need to take place and … need to happen.</strong></p>
<p><strong>How should cities and communities across America respond to the death of George Floyd so that another man or woman is not wrongfully killed at the hands of a police officer?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Canaparo:</strong> What we need to see from reformists is a commitment to reform based on what we actually know, and not just what we think or feel we know about how police behave.</p>
<p>We need targeted reforms that prevent or punish or eliminate bad actors from within the police forces. But to paint with a broad brush and to simply disband, defund, or eliminate police forces will only encourage bad actors in the community to do what they’re going to do with impunity.</p>
<p><strong>Allen: GianCarlo, to what extent is this a state and local level issue versus something that Congress should take action on?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Canaparo:</strong> Oh, it’s almost exclusively a state and local issue because the vast, vast majority of police-citizen interactions are at the state and local level. Federal police forces are not out there on the street dealing with people on a day-to-day basis.</p>
<p>Every community is going to have different needs. Communities that are quieter, communities that have a lot more police presence, they’re going to have different needs and considerations, and how each community interacts with its police force is a deeply local decision.</p>
<p><strong>Allen: Yeah, interesting. New York had terrible crime in the 1970s and Mayor Rudy Giuliani is largely credited with cleaning up crime in the ’90s. Although, his methods have been attacked by some. What is New York City’s history of crime?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Canaparo:</strong> In a city like New York, it’s really easy for somebody to get lost in the crowd. That dynamic, that mentality can lend itself well to, in some people, the conception that, “Well, I can commit crime because I won’t get caught.”</p>
<p>What big cities like New York and Chicago need is a police presence that is there, that’s visible, that’s engaged and involved with the community. To cultivate not only a sense that police are there for our protection for the vast majority of people who are good and law-abiding citizens, but also to cultivate amongst people who are not that they are not going to get away with criminal behavior.</p>
<p><strong>Allen: If you could sit down with some of New York City’s leaders today and say, “Hey guys, this is really what we need to implement first. Today, right now, this is what needs to change in order to strengthen that police force and bring this crime surge down,” what would you say to them?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Canaparo:</strong> A couple of things. No. 1, again, I would just reiterate that to tackle these issues, we need to be going at it from a data-driven approach—what do we actually know—and not listen to social activists who are espousing of a philosophy that is not necessarily tied to the facts. …</p>
<p>No. 2, there are going to be bad actors within the police forces, like there are bad actors everywhere. We need a system where they can be found out and punished.</p>
<p>Now, one of the problems that police forces face is, as with teachers and other unions, a union can create a lot of stickiness for bad actors in the police force, that they can’t be fired or they can’t be removed from the beat. Those sort of concerns need to be whittled down.</p>
<p>On the other side of the extreme, though, you can’t just get rid of your police forces in an overcorrection because there are always going to be bad actors in the community as well.</p>
<p>You’ve got to find that balance. You need the police engaged with the community, building trust with the community, present in the community. But you can’t divorce from that relationship the fact that police are necessary, most police are good, hardworking people who are just trying to do their jobs.</p>
<p><strong>Allen: We encourage all of our listeners to follow GianCarlo’s work and follow him on Twitter, @gcanaparo. GianCarlo, thank you so much for your time today, just really appreciate your insight on this really important subject.</strong></p>

<p>In March, school shutdowns around the globe caused <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/07/school-openings-across-globe-suggest-ways-keep-coronavirus-bay-despite-outbreaks">1.5 billion children</a> to begin schooling from home, representing <a href="https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-schools-sweden-denmark-5ff88c81-67e3-4c33-8b74-fe57b9555827.html">over 91% of children</a>, UNESCO estimates.</p>
<p>Here in the U.S., conversations about the state of school reopenings have hit a fever pitch as August quickly approaches. Many parents—<a href="https://www.educationnext.org/what-american-families-experienced-when-covid-19-closed-schools-2020-survey/">some 71% in Education Next’s 2020 poll</a>—feel their children learned less this spring than they would have had schools remained open.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/07/school-openings-across-globe-suggest-ways-keep-coronavirus-bay-despite-outbreaks">Science magazine</a> reports, over 20 countries reopened schools in June, and some, like Taiwan, Nicaragua, and Sweden, never closed them to begin with. Day cares remained open for essential workers in many countries, and although there are exceptions, outbreaks have generally been rare.</p>

<p><strong>What’s the best way for America to reopen and return to business? The National Coronavirus Recovery Commission, a project of The Heritage Foundation, assembled America’s top thinkers to figure that out. It has made more than 260 recommendations. </strong><a href="http://coronaviruscommission.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Learn more here&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Two regimes are fighting an ideological war in America today. But what side are you on? And how can you sharpen up on how to defend your position? <a class="" href="https://www.dailysignal.com/2020/07/15/more-than-20-countries-are-reopening-schools-the-us-should-take-note/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=more-than-20-countries-are-reopening-schools-the-us-should-take-note?utm_source=TDS_Email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=MorningBell&amp;mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiWldJek9EVmtZekUwTTJVMSIsInQiOiJsb2tcL0t5bzVidHB2U3I0UlRGTkVZb3hSYjJLb1JsOFdoemwwWFBnWXRpbFlHYjRNUmd2UnhpWXBSTjVucXhndjN2TTRpdTZzYUFwYlJXS2JNTFdCaHFwN2lobncyeHlcL1hPM1VMaWs3QmlRdVhMZGk4TzRHSHpHcUQxTCsyazZVIn0%3D#dear_reader" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learn more now &gt;&gt;</a></strong></p>

<p>To be sure, there have been some cases of outbreaks at schools that have reopened. As Jennifer Couzin-Frankel, Gretchen Vogel, and Meagan Weiland report in Science<em>,</em> <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/07/school-openings-across-globe-suggest-ways-keep-coronavirus-bay-despite-outbreaks">more than 150 students and 25 staff members</a> contracted the virus at a joint middle/high school in Jerusalem, and 96 students and teachers caught the virus at a New Zealand high school before that country’s lockdown went into effect.</p>
<p>Additionally, two day care centers in Canada saw spikes among staff and reclosed.</p>
<p>Overall, however, the data suggest that it is <a href="https://www.dailysignal.com/2020/07/10/why-in-person-schooling-would-be-one-of-the-safest-activities-to-reopen/">rare for children to develop severe symptoms</a> if they contract the virus, and it is rare for them to spread the virus if they do get it.</p>
<p>That is why many countries, particularly in Europe, have at least partially reopened schools. Here is a sample of what countries around the world are doing when it comes to reopening:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Australia. </strong>In the state of New South Wales, schools reopened for in-person classes one day per week in early May, combined with virtual learning the four remaining days. Individual schools were able to decide how to best schedule those classes. On May 25, <a href="https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2020/06/11/how-schools-in-other-countries-have-reopened.html">schools reopened full time</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Austria. </strong>Schools have reopened, and masks are no longer required because “<a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/07/school-openings-across-globe-suggest-ways-keep-coronavirus-bay-despite-outbreaks">officials observed little spread within schools</a>.”</li>
<li><strong>Canada. </strong>In Quebec, schools reopened in May and children socialize in groups of six. <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/07/school-openings-across-globe-suggest-ways-keep-coronavirus-bay-despite-outbreaks">Science</a> reports that while 53 students and teachers contracted the virus, “officials believed many of those infections were contracted in the community.”</li>
<li><strong>Denmark. </strong>Denmark was the first country in Europe to reopen schools, doing so on April 15. Schools in Denmark do as much class time outside as possible, and children are divided into small groups, nicknamed <a href="https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-schools-sweden-denmark-5ff88c81-67e3-4c33-8b74-fe57b9555827.html">“pods,” of around 12 students</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Finland. </strong>Finland reopened schools in May and have retained their standard class size, but have kept classes separated from each other and staggered reopening by age. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/schools-reopening-coronavirus/2020/07/10/865fb3e6-c122-11ea-8908-68a2b9eae9e0_story.html">Finnish officials</a> “found no evidence of school spread and no change in the rate of infection” for students under 16.</li>
<li><strong>France. </strong>French schools reopened in mid-May on a voluntary basis. <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/07/school-openings-across-globe-suggest-ways-keep-coronavirus-bay-despite-outbreaks">Research out of France</a> suggests that when children do contract the disease, they are contracting it at home, rather than in school. French schools are planning to fully reopen in September.</li>
<li><strong>Germany. </strong>In German schools, which reopened in May on a part-time basis, if a student or staff member contracts the virus, “classmates and teachers of an infected student are sent home for two weeks, <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/07/school-openings-across-globe-suggest-ways-keep-coronavirus-bay-despite-outbreaks">but other classes continue</a>.”</li>
<li><strong>Israel. </strong>Schools fully reopened in May in Israel, and classes are full, but students wear masks. Individual schools close temporarily if a student or staff member contracts the virus.</li>
<li><strong>Japan. </strong>Japan began reopening schools in June. Parents must take their children’s temperature every morning and provide a report to the schools. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/japan-coronavirus-schools-reopen/2020/06/06/9047be8c-a645-11ea-8681-7d471bf20207_story.html">Children attend on alternating days</a>, and teachers and students wear masks.</li>
<li><strong>Netherlands. </strong>The Netherlands reopened in May but halved their class sizes. Schools did not require social distancing for students under 12.</li>
<li><strong>Sweden. </strong>Schools in Sweden never closed for young children, nor did they make major adjustments to their day-to-day operations or reduce class size. Although Sweden’s death rate is high compared to its European neighbors, <a href="https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-schools-sweden-denmark-5ff88c81-67e3-4c33-8b74-fe57b9555827.html">Sweden’s chief epidemiologist says</a> “there’s little evidence schools exacerbated the outbreak.”</li>
</ol>
<p>In countries with high infection rates, like India and Brazil, schools remain closed and local governments will likely determine when schools reopen on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>In the U.S., the Trump administration has called on schools to reopen this fall. President Donald Trump suggested last week that schools could lose access to federal funding (which only makes up just 8.5% of all K-12 school revenue) if they do not reopen.</p>
<p>Education Secretary Betsy DeVos suggested that rather than withholding federal funds, those dollars should simply follow students to the schools of the family’s choice that are open—a smart policy response.</p>
<p>For their part, the teachers unions and other special-interest groups are demanding hundreds of billions of dollars in new spending to reopen schools. The American Federation of Teachers has demanded Congress spend $116 billion on K-12 school reopening, “close to the amount the U.S. dedicated to the Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe after World War II,” Corey DeAngelis of Reason Foundation <a href="https://reason.com/2020/07/09/dont-force-schools-to-reopen-but-dont-force-families-to-pay-for-closed-schools-either/">points out</a>.</p>
<p>By framing the conversation as a battle between federal officials and special-interest groups, the debate shifts away from those it impacts the most—local schools and families—as my colleague <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/school-reopenings-national-consensus-strategy-jonathan-butcher">Jonathan Butcher observes</a>.</p>
<p>Decisions about reopening schools need to be driven by school leaders and parents, and based on local factors.</p>
<p>If public school districts remain closed, do a poor job of transitioning online, or do not meet the needs of families in this COVID-19 era, parents should be able to take their money elsewhere.</p>
<p>States should provide <a href="https://www.dailysignal.com/2020/05/19/with-kids-learning-at-home-families-need-schools-to-be-more-flexible/">emergency education savings accounts</a> to families to enable them to enroll their children at schools of their choice that are open or are providing quality online instruction.</p>

<h3>A Note for our Readers:</h3>
<p class="mec-callout-p">These are trying times in our nation’s history. Two regimes are fighting an ideological war in America today, with polar opposite viewpoints on public policy and the government’s role in our lives.</p>
<p>Our friends at The Heritage Foundation asked world-class speaker, educator, and researcher David Azerrad to walk you through his research and outline the differences between the “two regimes” in our society today—conservatism and progressivism—and their primary differences.</p>
<p>When you get access to this course today, you’ll learn key takeaways like what it means to be a conservative, what “modern progressivism” is, how a conservative worldview differs from a progressive one, and much, much more.</p>
<p>You will come away from this online course with a better understanding of the differing points of view, how they align with your principles, and how to defend your beliefs.</p>
<p>Don’t wait—start taking “<em>The Case for Conservatism</em>” course online now.</p>

<p>U.S.—After Goya sales skyrocketed in response to a boycott in response to the CEO announcing his support of Trump, which was probably in response to something else dumb that happened in this dumb world, thousands of CEOs announced their support for Trump in hopes of triggering a similar boycott.</p>
<p>Thousands of CEOs tripped over themselves to put on MAGA hats and get a press conference with the president, hoping for &#8220;one of them sweet Goya boycotts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yeah, I totally support Trump. Please boycott us just like you boycotted Goya!&#8221; said the CEO of a rubber band manufacturer in Iowa. His rubber band sales immediately bounced back, garnering him tons of sales, which is great for a product like rubber bands that have elastic demand.</p>
<p>The CEO of reputable news site The Babylon Bee, Seth Dillon, immediately ran out and got a MAGA neck tattoo. He already had one on his lower back, but wanted to show his support for Trump more visibly so that liberals would announce a boycott and subscriptions to the site would skyrocket. &#8220;Seriously, please. I&#8217;m begging you. Boycott us. I could use another Lambo.&#8221;</p>
<p>CNN&#8217;s CEO, Bob CNN, tried to announce his support for Trump as a last-ditch effort to get liberals to boycott it and conversatives to rally around the station and start watching it, but no one believed him, sadly.</p>

<p>I realize it is tacky to be an I-told-you-so. But, we conservative activists have been fighting on the front-lines of the culture war for many years warning the masses. WAKE UP AMERICA&#8230;leftists are turning our kids into sleeper cells. At the proper time, leftists will unleash our kids to launch a violent no-holds-barred war against their parents, God and country!</p>
<p>Black disciples of socialism disguised as civil rights activists have also been allowed to sow their seeds of anti-American hate in public education for decades. In the 1970&#8217;s, I was a student at the prestigious Maryland Institute College of Art via scholarships. The Black Panthers showed up, angrily demanding a platform on campus to protest. College management humbly complied. As a black student, I never understood what I was suppose to be angry at the college about or how the college was abusing me.</p>
<p>Dad was a civil rights pioneer. He pressured me and my four younger siblings to always vote and join the NAACP. Upon attending my first NAACP meeting, I was stunned. They actually joined in a circle, held hands and sang, “We Shall Overcome”. Their rhetoric sounded like I had stepped through a time-warp back to 1950. Leftist institutions of indoctrination are still selling students, black and white, the absurd lie that America has not progressed racially beyond the 1950s.</p>
<p>I wrote about public elementary schools teaching white kids to hate themselves and feel guilty for being born white – about pre-k students being taught to embrace homosexuality and to consider changing their sex. The children&#8217;s book, “<a href="http://bit.ly/38o7MeB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I Am Jazz</a>” about a boy whose parents insanely began changing his sex at age 3 is read to kindergartners without parental consent and even mandatory in schools&#8217; curriculum.</p>
<p><a href="https://bit.ly/2BRs0mD" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pediatricians </a>along with <a href="https://bit.ly/3fxpbWt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pope Francis</a> say teaching transgender ideology causes child abuse.</p>
<p>I wrote about a white friend who said her middle school son came home in tears after being taught how cruel his ancestors were to women, blacks and native-Americans. Today, her son is an adult member of the Communist party. She cannot display an American flag for fear of retaliation by her son. I wrote about how when I suggested that a millennial relative visit Mt Rushmore while vacationing in South Dakota, their venomous response was, “I wouldn&#8217;t go across the street to visit those guys!”</p>
<p>I wrote about the Dancing Waters at Bellagio Fountain in Vegas doing a breathtakingly beautiful presentation set to Whitney Houston&#8217;s spectacular version of our National Anthem. At the end, I expected thunderous cheers and applause. Shockingly, the mostly young audience of thousands responded with a yawn.</p>
<p>I wrote about <a href="http://bit.ly/33QUkPd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Michelle Obama telling students to report their parents</a> who make racist statements at the dinner table.</p>
<p>I wrote about the powerful documentary, “Waiting For Superman” which exposed urban black parents&#8217; desperate heartbreaking efforts to get their kids out of violent failing schools into charter/good schools. Democrats&#8217; loyalty to the teacher&#8217;s union is keeping black students stuck in bad schools.</p>
<p>I wrote about leftists&#8217; <a href="http://bit.ly/2QQpbWn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PSA telling kids to steal their parent&#8217;s guns and turn them over to their teachers</a>.</p>
<p>I caught holy-hell for writing about LGBTQ activists infiltrating the Boy Scouts of America. Once inside, LGBTQ activists insisted that “morally straight&#8217; be removed from the oath. They also changed the name. The historic heroic Christian organization has been destroyed.</p>
<p>I wrote about how Planned Parenthood which was founded by a racist, targets black babies while illegally selling the body parts for profit. I wrote about public schools recruiting students for Islam while banning Bibles and Christian clubs. I wrote about schools assisting students with sex-change surgery and abortions without parental knowledge or consent.</p>
<p>I was told, “Lloyd do not put your divisive articles on my Facbook page.” Everyone was wimpish, content with being politically correct, keeping their heads buried into the sand.</p>
<p>Then, along came the perfect political storm of covid-fear and the unfortunate death of George Floyd. Leftists commanded their sleeper cells, “GO! GO! GO!” Seek, kill and destroy all things American and Christian!”</p>
<p>As my late momma would say, “No sense crying over spilled milk. What&#8217;s done is done.” Due to passively allowing counter-culture old hippies to control public education, we have a lost generation infected with severe anti-Americanism and anti-Christianity. The question is how do we take back our kids?</p>
<p>President Trump made a major step in the right direction with this tweets:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>“</i><i>Too many Universities and School Systems are about Radical Left Indoctrination, not Education. Therefore, I am telling the Treasury Department to re-examine their Tax-Exempt Status and/or Funding, which will be taken away if this Propaganda or Act Against Public Policy continues. Our children must be Educated, not Indoctrinated!”</i></p></blockquote>
<p>I say, “Right on bro!!!” (a little 1970s lingo)</p>
<p>Leftists have aggressively <a href="https://washex.am/36vhtHI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sought to criminalize homeschooling</a>.</p>
<p>Ironically, in forcing an unnecessary covid lock-down, leftists have forced parents to home-school.</p>
<p>A refreshing exchange at Walmart. I spotted a white twenty-something year old wearing a MAGA cap. “Excuse me sir, why do you support Trump?” The young man replied, “He&#8217;s honest. He always tells the truth.” I asked, “What do you think about the Marxist war taking place in our streets?” He shrugged his shoulders and said, “Oh well, that&#8217;s their opinion.”</p>
<p>I said, “If only anarchists had the same tolerance for various opinions.”</p>
<p>The good news is the Marxist war against America unfolding in our streets has awaken millions to how public education has transformed our kids into an army of leftist walking brain-dead zombies.</p>
<p>Finally, parents are saying, “We must take back our kids.”</p>

<p><strong>Campaign has raised $3.6 million to date, with $2 million cash-on-hand headed into August 11th Democratic primary.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><span class="xn-location">MINNEAPOLIS</span>, MN /PRNewswire/ &#8212; Antone Melton-Meaux, candidate for Congress in <span class="xn-location">Minnesota&#8217;s</span> Fifth Congressional District, announced today record-setting fundraising results in his Democratic-Farmer-Labor (DFL) primary race against Rep. <span class="xn-person">Ilhan Omar</span> set for <span class="xn-chron">August 11</span>. Melton-Meaux&#8217;s campaign raised more than <span class="xn-money">$3.2 million</span> in the second quarter of 2020, bringing the total amount raised to date to <span class="xn-money">$3.6 million</span>, with end-of-quarter cash on hand at <span class="xn-money">$2 million</span>. Rep. Omar reported raising <span class="xn-money">$471,600</span> in the same period, with <span class="xn-money">$1,111,861</span> cash-on-hand, according to her filing with the Federal Election Commission.</p>
<p>Of the total, Melton-Meaux raised $323,310 in Minnesota, with $236,921 from the Fifth District versus Rep. Omar who raised <span class="xn-money">$11,849</span> in Minnesota, with $8,000 from the district.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s clear that people in <span class="xn-location">Minnesota</span> and the Fifth District are ready for new leadership. Throughout the race, our campaign has consistently raised more money locally than my opponent, one of the strongest indicators of my grassroots support,&#8221; said Melton-Meaux.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our incredible momentum and support is an affirmation that people are tired of President Trump and his toxic brand of politics rampant in <span class="xn-location">Washington</span> today. People are tired of our politicians shouting at each other and getting nothing done. People need help. They need change and they need real results,&#8221; added Melton-Meaux.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our campaign has attracted supporters who are enthusiastic about our message and feel a sense of urgency to oppose the politics of division and elect leaders who will unite us and achieve lasting change,&#8221; said Melton-Meaux.</p>
<p>Melton-Meaux&#8217;s campaign has received wide support from donors across the country and more than 1500 individual donors in the Fifth District, including former supporters of Rep. Omar, leaders of the DFL party, and Democratic luminaries such as former Vice President <span class="xn-person">Walter Mondale</span>. In addition, the campaign has received support from several nonpartisan organizations that contribute to both Democrats and Republicans, including <span class="xn-location">Minnesota</span> Sen. <span class="xn-person">Tina Smith</span>; Democratic Majority Leader <span class="xn-person">Steny Hoyer</span>; and former Vice President <span class="xn-person">Joe Biden</span>, the Democratic presumptive presidential nominee.</p>
<p>Voters in the Fifth Congressional District and across the country want to see new leadership in Congress and the White House. Not only does Melton-Meaux have strong financial support, he also has impressive endorsements. In addition to civil rights icon Dr. <span class="xn-person">Josie R. Johnson</span>, Melton-Meaux&#8217;s campaign has been endorsed by a host of appointed and elected officials and civic leaders, including former Fifth Congressional District candidate <span class="xn-person">Leila Shukri Adan</span>; <span class="xn-location">Richfield</span> city councilmember <span class="xn-person">Edwina Garcia</span>; former Medtronic CEO <span class="xn-person">Bill George</span>; former U.S. Attorney for Minnesota Andy Luger; and attorney and former Minneapolis NAACP president <span class="xn-person">Nekima Levy Armstrong</span>.</p>
<p>Melton-Meaux is pushing hard to ensure his campaign has the resources necessary to win the DFL primary election on <span class="xn-chron">August 11</span>. Then he&#8217;ll work hard to deliver the district and the state for <span class="xn-person">Joe Biden</span> in November, and keep <span class="xn-location">Minnesota</span> blue.</p>
<p>A progressive, lifelong Democrat, Melton-Meaux has dedicated his life to public service with a strong commitment to community service. He owns a small business—a mediation practice that helps people come together and find solutions when they cannot find common ground on their own.</p>
<p>&#8220;I chose to run for Congress, because we have serious inequities in our community and Congresswoman Omar has failed to address those inequities. The people of our district need and deserve a representative who wants to unite people, find common ground, and deliver results to improve the quality of life for all of us,&#8221; said Melton-Meaux.</p>
<p>Melton-Meaux launched his campaign for Congress in <span class="xn-chron">December 2019</span> after becoming disillusioned with Omar&#8217;s poor voting record; her harmful and divisive statements about the Jewish community; her failure to condemn Armenian Genocide; and voting against sanctions on Turkey.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rep. Omar has one of the worst voting records in Congress for 2019, when she missed more than 40 votes. That&#8217;s 40 times when the people of this district were disenfranchised—Black and <span class="xn-org">Brown</span> people, immigrants, union workers—the very people she claims to represent,&#8221; said Melton-Meaux. &#8220;When she&#8217;s not voting, their voices are not being heard. And when she does show up to vote, she votes out of step with the progressive values of this district. She failed to condemn the Armenian Genocide; she was the only Democrat in the House to vote against sanctions on <span class="xn-location">Turkey</span>, as they attacked and displaced tens of thousands of Kurdish people; and she didn&#8217;t support the USMCA trade bill, which passed with broad bipartisan support and helped <span class="xn-location">Minnesota&#8217;s</span> economy, environment and labor workforce.&#8221;</p>
<p>Melton-Meaux has previous experience on Capitol Hill, where he received the prestigious Congressional Black Caucus Fellowship, and worked with former Democratic National Committee Chair <span class="xn-person">Donna Brazile</span> and Rep. <span class="xn-person">Eleanor Holmes-Norton</span> (D-D.C.)</p>
<p>Melton-Meaux graduated from <span class="xn-org">Washington University</span> in <span class="xn-location">St. Louis</span>, and received his law degree from the <span class="xn-org">University of Virginia</span> Law School. He also has a Master&#8217;s of Theology from <span class="xn-org">Union Theological Seminary</span>.</p>
<p>Active in the Fifth Congressional District, Melton-Meaux works with the Children&#8217;s Law Center to help children in foster care find their forever families. He also serves as a volunteer minister at Salem English Lutheran Church, and has served on the boards of College Possible, the Page Education Foundation, Guthrie Theater, the Conflict Resolution Center, and <span class="xn-location">Northrop</span> at the <span class="xn-org">University of Minnesota</span>.</p>
<p>A proud husband and devoted father, Melton-Meaux and his wife, Dr. <span class="xn-person">Genevieve Melton-Meaux</span>, were college sweethearts and have been together for 28 years. They live with their two school-age children in the Uptown-East Isles neighborhood of <span class="xn-location">Minneapolis</span>.</p>

Phelps interview with Tom Trento about this Black Panther type militia:</strong></a></p>
<p>On America&#8217;s Independence Day this year, a family-friendly attraction in the South became the site of a heavily armed black militia, spewing profanity and threats of violence.</p>
<p>On the 4th of July, according to <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/armed-black-demonstrators-challenge-white-supremacist-militia-georgias-stone-mountain-park-1515494" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Newsweek</a>, up to 1,000 men and women descended upon Stone Mountain Park, near Atlanta, Georgia. The park – Georgia&#8217;s #1 tourist site – features a Confederate Memorial Carving, including the chiseled images of Civil War generals Stonewall Jackson and Robert E. Lee, as well as President Jefferson Davis.</p>
<p>OneNewsNow spoke to Tom Trento, the founder and director of <a href="https://www.theunitedwest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The United West</a> (TUW), about what transpired on that hot summer day. Trento considers the 4th of July weekend to be a &#8220;significant weekend&#8221; and the site of the park a potentially &#8220;significant location.&#8221; While he says it is disputable, some people believe &#8220;the [Ku Klux Klan] got their inspiration from [the site] and have their origins in the area.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to Trento, John Fitzgerald Johnson (aka &#8220;Grandmaster Jay&#8221;), the &#8220;self-proclaimed leader&#8221; of the armed militia, specifically chose the site of Stone Mountain to provoke white nationalist groups in the area. Fitzgerald, born in 1961, is a veteran, an ordained pastor, and once ran as an independent for president of the United States in 2016. And according to the United West founder, the &#8220;sexy title for his black militia&#8221; is <a href="https://hiphopwired.com/playlist/nfac-march-on-stone-mountain-in-atlanta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NFAC</a> (the &#8220;F&#8221; stands for a profanity).</p>
<p>Trento describes Fitzgerald as &#8220;intelligent, extremely dynamic, [and] extremely charismatic&#8221; – and considers his appearance at Stone Mountain to be &#8220;unique, crossing a line to take the position of wanting to be the leader of armed black people to fight white people in a racial war.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is this serious?&#8221; the TUW founder asks. &#8220;Is this for real?&#8221;</p>
<p>Trento continues, describing Fitzgerald as a &#8220;showman&#8221; and suggesting &#8220;he&#8217;s looking for press.&#8221; After a falling out with Black Lives Matter in recent years, Fitzgerald is &#8220;[wanting] to go beyond platitudes, placards and signs, and made a number of scary statements on the 4th of July weekend,&#8221; according to Trento.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is done with signs, [as] you don&#8217;t bring signs to a gunfight,&#8221; he adds – arguing that is why this particular black militia chose to carry a variety of firearms, including shotguns, AR-15s, and other high-powered rifles.</p>
<p>&#8220;The current climate [of racial tension] has gone beyond any rational explanation, [becoming] a movement that believes in systemic racism in the United States — which is completely nonsensical,&#8221; Trento concludes.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, he is saddened and considers it unfortunate that literally millions of black people still believe so strongly in systemic racism. &#8220;[Many of them] are angry, getting angrier, and [their frustrations] are fed by the Democratic Party and the media,&#8221; he describes.</p>
<p>Trento says metaphorically &#8220;they are gasoline&#8221; – and &#8220;as that crowd increases, just envision thousands of gallons of gasoline.&#8221; And John Fitzgerald Johnson, he says, is &#8220;the proverbial spark, the match that could ignite them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trento suggests Fitzgerald&#8217;s &#8220;charisma and intelligence [could possibly] lead the useful idiots to go and do a tremendous amount of damage.&#8221; He is reminded that while the Black Panthers in the 1960s began as &#8220;just a bunch of thugs, [they were] transformed into a terrorist organization, literally blowing up various building and killing cops in the U.S.&#8221;</p>
<p>Law enforcement is capable of solving the problem, Trento argues. Intelligence agencies and law enforcement are &#8220;pretty good at mapping these people out very quickly and moving internally to bust them up.&#8221; He also contends that when laws are broken, arrests should follow – &#8220;and when the book is thrown at [such criminals], they&#8217;ll start singing like a bird.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What we don&#8217;t want is a race war,&#8221; he emphasizes. &#8220;The last thing we want to have is a shooting war with white militias fighting black militias.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are communists behind this whole thing who really want that, but the greater majority of American people do not.&#8221; Instead, he argues these groups need to be &#8220;broken up internally and put out of business.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>TRANSCRIPT</strong></p>
<p>If I were the devil … I would gain control of the most powerful nation in the world;</p>
<p>I would delude their minds into thinking that they had come from man’s effort, instead of God’s blessings;</p>
<p>I would promote an attitude of loving things and using people, instead of the other way around;</p>
<p>I would dupe entire states into relying on gambling for their state revenue;</p>
<p>I would convince people that character is not an issue when it comes to leadership;</p>
<p>I would make it legal to take the life of unborn babies;</p>
<p>I would make it socially acceptable to take one’s own life, and invent machines to make it convenient;</p>
<p>I would cheapen human life as much as possible so that the life of animals are valued more than human beings;</p>
<p>I would take God out of the schools, where even the mention of His name was grounds for a lawsuit;</p>
<p>I would come up with drugs that sedate the mind and target the young, and I would get sports heroes to advertise them;</p>
<p>I would get control of the media, so that every night I could pollute the mind of every family member for my agenda;</p>
<p>I would attack the family, the backbone of any nation.</p>
<p>I would make divorce acceptable and easy, even fashionable. If the family crumbles, so does the nation;</p>
<p>I would compel people to express their most depraved fantasies on canvas and movie screens, and I would call it art;</p>
<p>I would convince the world that people are born homosexuals, and that their lifestyles should be accepted and marveled;</p>
<p>I would convince the people that right and wrong are determined by a few who call themselves authorities and refer to their agenda as politically correct;</p>
<p>I would persuade people that the church is irrelevant and out of date, and the Bible is for the naive;</p>
<p>I would dull the minds of Christians, and make them believe that prayer is not important, and that faithfulness and obedience are optional;</p>
<p>I guess I would leave things pretty much the way they are.</p>

<p>To say Independence Day was unusual this year is an understatement. There were few home town parades celebrating it, fewer firework displays, and more protesting from the far-Left. Americans were particularly appalled by the gun violence in our major cities, most notably:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>New York</strong> – 44 shootings, 63 victims, 11 fatalities<br />
<strong>Chicago</strong> – 47 shootings, 87 victims, 17 fatalities<br />
<strong>Atlanta</strong> – 11 shootings, 31 victims, 5 fatalities</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>TOTAL</strong> – 102 shootings, 181 victims, 33 fatalities (some were innocent young children).</p>
<p>All of this in just one weekend, not to mention the other metro areas experiencing similar problems. And remember, this was a weekend intended to celebrate American independence, not mayhem.</p>
<p>These numbers are higher than last year’s. To see how bad it currently is, I reviewed the statistics as produced by the police departments of the three cities. Here are the alarming numbers I found:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>New York City &#8211; Mayor Bill de Blasio (D)</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em><strong>Shooting victims through June 28th</strong></em><br />
2020 to date &#8211; 616 &#8211; Avg 24 shooting victims/week<br />
2019 (total) &#8211; 406 &#8211; Avg 8 shooting victims/week</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>Chicago – Mayor Lori Lightfoot (D) </strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em><strong>Shooting victims through July 5th</strong></em><br />
2020 to date – 1448 – Avg 54 shooting victims/week<br />
2019 (total) – 1018 – Avg 39 shooting victims/week</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>Atlanta – Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms (D)</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em><strong>Shooting victims through June 28th</strong></em><br />
2020 to date – 344 – Avg 13 shooting victims/week<br />
2019 (total) – 285 – Avg 5 shooting victims/week</p>
<p>These figures indicate the numbers will double or triple this year over the last.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, Chicago leads the way in shootings as their reputation has gained worldwide notoriety. Ironically, New York and Chicago have some of the toughest gun control laws in the country, yet the violence only escalates. New York City’s gun laws are tougher than the state’s, which are tough to begin with, and; Chicago brags about their gun laws where they have banned the possession of certain semi-automatic firearms and laser sights, among other things.</p>
<p>In addition to tough gun laws, all three cities are considering de-funding the police in order to curb the strength of the police and/or changing how they react to violent situations. We should probably first ask the families of the 33 fatalities and 181 victims from the 4th of July weekend what their opinion is on the subject. Now is not the time for a wacky social experiment, but rather time for law and order.</p>
<p>For a long time, President Trump has said the Federal Government is willing to come to the assistance of the cities through financial and tactical resources to restore law and order. All the mayors and governors have to do is ask. Unfortunately, his offers are routinely snubbed by Democrat mayors, particularly de Blasio, Lightfoot, and Bottoms. So much so, it seems like they are under orders from senior Democrat officials not to deal with the President as it might be perceived as another “win” for Mr. Trump prior to election day. In the meantime, the shootings and fatalities pile up. This makes you wonder about the priorities of these mayors, particularly Mayor de Blasio who is more interested in painting “Black Lives Matter” on 5th Avenue, in front of Trump Tower.</p>
<p>In the end, the citizens of New York, Chicago, Atlanta, and other Democrat urban areas better get used to burying bodies while the mayors play politics. To them, it is more important to beat President Trump in the general election as opposed to saving the lives of their own local citizens.</p>

<p>Bari Weiss, a Jewish, centrist, young opinion writer and editor for <em>The New York Times</em>, left her position at the paper, leaving a <a href="https://www.bariweiss.com/resignation-letter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">resignation letter</a> that is a damning indictment of how the Far Left and its bullying culture has taken over the paper.</p>
<p>The de-evolution of the <em>Times</em> is worth examining, not just because it is happening at one of the country’s papers of record, but because these same tactics are being mimicked at institutions across the country.</p>
<p>Weiss was hired by the <em>Times</em> in 2017 to bring centrist and conservative opinions</p>
<p>as well as new voices to the paper following the election of Donald Trump to the presidency, an election that the paper failed to anticipate. “It didn’t have a firm grasp of the country it covers,” according to Weiss as well as Dean Baquet, the paper’s executive editor.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“But the lessons that ought to have followed the election—lessons about the importance of understanding other Americans, the necessity of resisting tribalism, and the centrality of the free exchange of ideas to a democratic society—have not been learned,” Weiss writes.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Instead, she says, a new “consensus” emerged in the press and especially at the <em>Times:</em></p>
<blockquote><p><em>“Truth isn’t a process of collective discovery, but an orthodoxy already known to an enlightened few whose job is to inform everyone else …” </em></p></blockquote>
<p>This perception of reality was something antithetical to Weiss’ beliefs.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“I was always taught that journalists were charged with writing the first rough draft of history. Now, history itself is one more ephemeral thing molded to fit the needs of a predetermined narrative.” </em></p></blockquote>
<p>In her letter of resignation, Weiss describes the constant bullying she was subjected to at the <em>Times, </em>both professionally and personally.</p>
<p>For her “forays into Wrongthink,” she was called a Nazi and a racist by fellow staff members. Particularly distasteful were the comments she received when she wrote about something having to do with Jews.</p>
<p>Coworkers thought to be friendly to her were badgered. Weiss writes that she was openly demeaned on the <em>Times’</em> Slack channels, a company-wide messaging app in which top management also participates.</p>
<p>In true Orwellian tradition, her coworkers demanded that she be “rooted out” if the <em>Times</em> was to be “a truly ‘inclusive’ “ company. Others simply posted emojis of axes next to her name. In addition, she notes,</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“Still other New York Times employees publicly smear me as a liar and a bigot on Twitter with no fear that harassing me will be met with appropriate action. They never are.” </em></p></blockquote>
<p>As to the editorial bullying going on at the <em>Times</em>, Weiss writes that stories are chosen with “extreme selectivity,” to the point where writers and editors self-censor to avoid the inevitable harassment of offering anything but the accepted opinion.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“If a person’s ideology is in keeping with the new orthodoxy, they and their work remain unscrutinized. Everyone else lives in fear of the digital thunderdome. Online venom is excused so long as it is directed at the proper targets.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Every employee is well aware of the perils of going against the narrative, Weiss contends. Even if a higher-up says they will stand behind a writer’s or editor’s work that goes against groupthink, Weiss advises not to believe it.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“Eventually, the publisher will cave to the mob, the editor will get fired or reassigned, and you’ll be hung out to dry,” she says.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>In his dystopian novel <em>1984</em>, George Orwell coined the phrase “Newspeak,” a language which was designed, in Orwell’s words, “to diminish the range of thought.”</p>
<p>Not only was Newspeak used to obfuscate (calling expulsion an act of “inclusiveness” in Weiss’ case), its purpose was also to promote a narrowing of thought about and awareness of the world.</p>
<p>Newspeak fundamentally left citizens in a binary world of simple dichotomies – good and evil, war and peace. You are either with us or against us.</p>
<p>Our modern version of Newspeak removes nuance from our perceptions of the world — either through indoctrination by the press or through the intimidation and shaming tactics used by the cancel culture.</p>
<p>If there was ever a time to speak up for free speech, it is now. By all accounts, it does work.</p>
<p>The recent attempt by the cancel culture to take down Goya Foods, because its (Hispanic) CEO praised President Trump at a recent White House event, has been an epic fail. Instead a counter “buy-cott” movement has flipped the narrative and seen a full-on buying spree of the company’s products.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Goya boycott looks like it&#39;s working well. <a href="https://t.co/fOamynAjei">pic.twitter.com/fOamynAjei</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>As for Bari Weiss, her letter also leaves us with hope. Addressing young and upcoming writers and editors, she notes:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“As places like The Times and other once-great journalistic institutions betray their standards and lose sight of their principles, Americans still hunger for news that is accurate, opinions that are vital, and debate that is sincere. I hear from these people every day.</em></p>
<p><em> “’An independent press is not a liberal ideal or a progressive ideal or a democratic ideal. It’s an American ideal,’  you said a few years ago. I couldn’t agree more. America is a great country that deserves a great newspaper.”</em></p></blockquote>

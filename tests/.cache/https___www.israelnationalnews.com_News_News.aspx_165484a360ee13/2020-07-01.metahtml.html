Iran has denied the allegations.</p><p>The latest news about the upgrading comes less than a week before talks between Iran and the P5+1 group -- the United States, Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany -- <a href="/News/News.aspx/164848" target="_blank">are to resume in the Kazakh city of Almaty</a>.</p><p>Reports last week indicated that during the next round of talks, the West <a href="/News/News.aspx/165289" target="_blank">plans to offer</a> to ease sanctions barring trade in gold and other precious metals with Iran in return for Iranian steps to shut down the Fordow uranium enrichment plant.</p><p>The underground Fordow facility is carved into a&#160;<span id="IL_AD3">mountain</span>&#160;to protect it against possible attacks.</p><p>However, an Iranian lawmaker <a href="/News/News.aspx/165350" target="_blank">rejected the Western proposal</a>, saying that the Fordow site will never be shut down because that means &#8220;helping the Zionist regime to carry out its threats and threaten our facilities.&#8221;</p></article>

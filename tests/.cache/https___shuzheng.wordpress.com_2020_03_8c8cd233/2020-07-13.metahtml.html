<p>If you need China&#8217;s assistance, here are the various ways to reach us:</p>
<ul>
<li>CCTV office, if there is one in your city,</li>
<li>China Foreign Ministry, consulate, trade office,</li>
<li>Chinatown associations. If you don&#8217;t know where to find one, just walk into the second biggest restaurant,</li>
<li>find a Mainland Chinese student and ask him/her: <span class="tlid-translation translation" lang="zh-CN"><span class="" title="">&#20013;&#22269;&#22823;&#20351;&#39302;</span></span>?</li>
<li>drop a line in Comment,</li>
<li>online try asking at <a href="https://www.zhihu.com/signin?next=%2F">zhihu &#30693;&#20046;</a> where you need to register, language is Chinese, and</li>
<li>if, after all that, you still can&#8217;t reach us, you are a lost cause.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most staff members can handle the local languages.</p>
 
<p>***</p>

<p>*</p>
 
<ul>
<li>Can someone explain why is it the Martins and the Stevies are so easily bought?</li>
<li>Why is it always the US find it easy to buy some filthy brown-skin <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Author/Martin-Vengadesan-JournalistMusicianAuthor-635337166957466/">Indian thambi</a> to serve their imperial interest?</li>
</ul>
<p>Is it because of the thambi&#8217;s English mother tongue? Or Christianity? Or they have no ethical morality? Or all three?</p>
<h3>Martin Who?</h3>
 
<p>All these Vengas, Martins and Stevies.</p>
<p>*</p>
 
<p>*</p>
<h1>THAMBI VENTILATING VENGA</h1>
<p>*</p>
<p>Are you hard-pressed to find, <a href="https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/517811">what is the news</a>? Where? Which?</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s further suppose Stevie Wonder Gan says this is Pompeo&#8217;s &#8216;point of view&#8217;, and he is entitled to it. Where then is this &#8216;view&#8217; we hadn&#8217;t heard before? What exactly is it? What is the evidential backing or the logicism in the &#8216;view&#8217;, even to be heard the thousandth time?</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh, Venga go fuck your thambi mother&#8221; &#8212; is that a point of view?</p>
<p>Sigh&#8230; The above just goes to reaffirm Stevie&#8217;s lies all along: They are &#8216;free and independent&#8217;. Or they tell &#8216;truth to power&#8217;.</p>
<p>Mkini, the Stevies and the Martins are just US-paid hacks, the first as rag sheet of the US propaganda arm in Malaysia. America tells Stevie Wonder Gan, &#8220;Jump&#8220;, he asked how high. America tells him, &#8216;Sit boy!&#8221; and he proceeds to suck some Yankee penis.</p>
<p>Why is he doing this? Answer, Money. (What else unless American exceptionalism is a religion.)</p>
<p>How else is Martin going to make money? That article? Maybe 50 depreciated ringgit, so one is told, is a pittance in US dollar, can&#8217;t even buy a Covid mask in NY. The Fed prints money like it&#8217;s toilet paper, 23 trillion al-leady, and 3.5 trillion more coming.</p>
<p>The so-called journalism &#8216;profession&#8217; (sic) is more useless than the soldier in his barrack doing nothing the whole day. The certificates that Mkini prints and issues from &#8216;Kini Academy&#8216; and which they call &#8216;journalism&#8217; or &#8216;communication&#8217; tells you nothing about any intellectual wherewithal or practical skill set.</p>
<p>All day long, the poor kids from who the Venga, the Martins and Stevie take money, hear only yada, yada, yada, never having to ask questions like, &#8220;Eh, thambi professor what is a ventilator, ar? How you make one la?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kiniacademy.com/">Kini academy</a> (<a href="https://www.kiniacademy.com/" rel="nofollow">https://www.kiniacademy.com/</a>) is a fucking money scam.</p>
<p>Proof of the statement into the uselessness of &#8216;journalism&#8217; is the Internet. All you need is a computer and an Internet connection. You don&#8217;t even need a tongue.</p>
<p>*</p>

<p>*</p>
<h1>DUTY?&#160;&#160; HUMANITARIAN?</h1>
<p>*</p>
 
 
<p>***</p>
<p>Now, immediately below, watch how US-funded Malaysiakini and Anglophile Venga actually lied for Pompeo and had distributed his lies.</p>
<p>And you don&#8217;t have to search hard to catch those lies&#8230;</p>
<p>Towards Iranians, America does not regard Iranians as humans&#8230;</p>
 
<p>The rest of the world wants nothing from the US. It is good enough it doesn&#8217;t get in the way.</p>
<p>But for a Third World country like Malaysia to lie on US behalf? 
</p>
<p>It shows the loyalty and the morality of Anglophiles like Steven Gan and Ventilator Venga.</p>
<p>For money, they&#8217;d even sell their daughters to prostitute rackets in Calcutta.</p>
<p>You can see, therefore, why the US got what&#8217;s due to them.</p>
 
<p>*</p>
<p>In the Mkini above titled article is <a href="https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/517855">another example</a> of Ventilating Venga ventilating for Pompeo, meaning reselling and redistributing US propaganda: Pompeo selling yada, yada to the world that is a mirror reflection of Trump saying the same thing in the US.</p>
<p>In January, Trump promise US$100 million to &#8216;Asia&#8217;, meaning South Korea, Japan and Taiwan. In all three countries, not a cent arrived, and we have already taken care of the problem. But does Ventilating Venga state that fact? No, because the journalist job to inform is only secondary to the purpose of publication. And that purpose, Venga&#8217;s purpose, Mkini&#8217;s purpose is, as a poodle barking dog, to peddle influence, distribute American propaganda, as if after all that the world would be better off when it never is, as if lying and as if words have no consequences.</p>
<p>Now, listen to the clip below: It is not Ventilating Venga manufacturing fake news. It is not a Venga cover-up for the US in order to make his master Mike Pompeo looks good. It&#8217;s called truth.</p>
<p>*</p>

<p>*</p>
<h3>THE THAMBI&#8217;S LIE</h3>
<p>Top humanitarian aid provider?</p>
<p>Pompeo can&#8217;t even do duty to his own people. But, for a true understanding of the term &#8216;humanitarian&#8217; &#8212; that America is the world&#8217;s &#8216;top humanitarian aid provider&#8217;, so wrote Ventilator Venga on behalf of the USA &#8212; listen to the clip below. And here is the added problem: Those lies kill people, Americans kill Americans. So be it.</p>
<p>In spreading the lie for America, the lie that they are more concerned for human welfare than money, Venga encourages the Malaysian government to do exactly the same: Kill its own people. Hurray!</p>

<h1>RACHEL</h1>
<p>*</p>
<p>Watch Rachel&#8217;s expressions and gestures, clip below. Me thinks she is cute, particularly when she launches her finger into flight. 
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are so cute, I&#8217;d give you a kiss if we aren&#8217;t separated by an ocean, six mountains, two continents, and the most powerful deterrent of all &#8212; the Chinese Virus!.</p>
<p>So, you got <a href="https://shuzheng.wordpress.com/2020/03/28/china-laos-neighbors-post-covid-note-to-rachel-maddow/">our message</a>. We Chinese say, you cross the river by feelings the stones under your feet. In the vernacular: You work the problem by wading into it. Otherwise, by the time you finish fixing your supply chain, measuring the water depth, temperature, speed of current, etc, we&#8217;d all be dead before you even wet your toes. Or your panties.</p>
<p>When this is over, America is still intact (we&#8217;d wish otherwise), and you still have your job, the drink is on you.</p>
<p>Skip Trump, Skip Pence. Skip Pompeo. They don&#8217;t own America; they are not even owning up to their responsibilities.</p>
<p>And suggests this to that McNeil NYT stooge: Offer each Chinese doctor <a href="https://youtu.be/kJLhFm9fWLQ">a million bucks</a>, two months, to save America. And America can afford a million each; tell the Fed to print it. But here is my million dollar bet with you: The higher the McNeil bid, the louder comes the answer, &#8216;No!&#8217;</p>
<p>Wanna to know why?</p>
<p>I tell you, Americans can be very, very stupid and ignorant &#8212; on top of being narcissistic.</p>
<p>Stay safe, ya! Need anything, call. We insist.</p>
<p>BTW, Wear a fucking mask, Rachel!</p>
<p>Imagine all America looking at you in that garb. It&#8217;s the stuff of history &#8212; and you&#8217;d still be just as pretty. Unfortunately, some wrinkles are showing up under your eyes. And your chin is beginning to sag. We Chinese have just the medicine for both. Want some?</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>IS IT NOW CALLED</h3>
<h3>SYMPHONIC VIRUS?</h3>
 
<p>*</p>
<p>Rachel, Our Medic</p>
<p>Recall, those were the days when nobody knows what we were truly dealing with. 40,000 had left home and nobody knows how many would return alive. Over 3,000 were infected, about a dozen died.</p>
<p>Today, America and the world know exactly what to do because of them.</p>
<p>Our nation &#8212; no, the world &#8212; owes them an eternal debt of gratitude that can never be repaid.</p>
<h3 class="title style-scope ytd-video-primary-info-renderer">IMAGINE, WHAT IF INSTEAD</h3>
<h3 class="title style-scope ytd-video-primary-info-renderer">IT WAS AMERICA?</h3>
<p>I believe you know the answer</p>

<h1>DEMOCRACY AT WORK</h1>
<p>*</p>
<p>In the clips below, they express what Harapan Anglophile democracy and Anglo-American HK freedom mean:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>(a) transparency in decision making,</li>
<li>(b) MBA style cost-benefit analysis, between jobs and ICU beds,</li>
<li>(c) a liberal contest over the best response-ideas,</li>
<li>(d) always consider the majority opinion, perhaps even holding a referendum,</li>
<li>(e) no restrictions on the free movement of people, goods, ideas,</li>
<li>(f) freedom of expression, of Press, to debate the best course of action.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You like, we like!</p>
<p>Keep it up White man! Malaiyoo, Anglophile!</p>

<p>*</p>
<p>Wuhan Virus?</p>
<h3>US Scientists: Covid-19 didn&#8217;t come from wet market!</h3>
<p>*</p>
 
<p>*</p>
 
<p>Before Nature, which is a peered-review publication concluded about the outside origin of Covid-19 (clip above), the medical science community had doubted the virus came from bats and wildlife and said so in <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/01/wuhan-seafood-market-may-not-be-source-novel-virus-spreading-globally#">Science Magazine</a> in January 2020. In late February and early March the Chinese researchers twice reaffirmed the same thing: first time, the virus didn&#8217;t come from China, including the Wuhan wet market; second time it had originated from outside China.</p>
<p>Where, we don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>Now, see below, dated Mar 27.</p>
<p>The Sun newspaper owned by the Robert Murdoch, who also owns America&#8217;s Fox News, played up the same American-Mike Pompeo lie about &#8216;Wuhan virus&#8217;, meaning wild animals, specifically in Wuhan, had caused the virus.</p>
<p>After which Reuters and BBC picked up on that lie, re-circulating it, the result of an instruction actually put down in written circular from Pompeo and the US National Security Council, then distributed by the State Department to all embassies and Press contacts. It was their way of waging war against China. US-sponsored Mkini had also used that line about bats as well.</p>
<p>This is the same propaganda tactic used before, lying about concentration camps in Xinjiang and lying that the Hong Kong riots were &#8216;democratic activism&#8217; when in actuality it was pure mayhem, inflicting a reign of terror on the streets. <a href="http://lifeofaannie.blogspot.com/">Lady Annie</a>, along with the HK Anglophile Press, repeatedly spread the propaganda lie, also circulated by Mkini, by calling the riots &#8216;peaceful protests&#8217; in a &#8216;Fight for Freedom&#8217;.</p>
<p>Throughout, the Anglo-American Press, notable Reuters, BBC, the Washington Post and New York Times were at the forefront of manufacturing those stories, faking a narrative invented then passed on for use by the US-paid, NED-sponsored politicians in Hong Kong to the international media.</p>
<p>Below, they are doing it again&#8230;</p>
<p>This theory is now clear: Because the US is powerless militarily, it is using an alternative full war spectrum, hence trade war, media war, propaganda war, biological war, cyber war, internal agitations, bribing local politicians, agents and so on.</p>
<p>What did the Chinese did to deserve all this? That&#8217;s also like asking what did the Libyans did to deserve the total destruction of their country, the Syrians, the Afghans, the Iraqis, now the Venezuelans, and the Cubans.</p>
<p>In the current pandemic, the US warned its European allies against asking or accepting any medical assistance from Cuba, China and Russia. This is so perverse: the situation is like in America, it is short of supplies and manpower so they rather see people fall ill, suffer, and die than doing something, anything, even if that means begging. And to make things worse, the CDC or Center for Disease Control which is suppose to control, as the name says, actually do the opposite, instituting SOPs that would further spread the virus!</p>
<p>Did you read about all that in the &#8216;free and independent&#8217;, the &#8216;telling Truth to Power&#8217; Press? In comparison to the coverage of the epidemic in China, about authorities silencing some doctor, did you read about the pain and agony&#160; of the New York hospital staff? (Top of post.)</p>
<p>What does all that mean? The Press, including US-bribed Steven Gan, is complicit to US power and human neglect, and an accessory to death.</p>

<h3>Laos speaks to China, 7 weeks ago.</h3>
<h3>Thank you, LAOS!</h3>
 
<p>The Indo-China language of Laos, Cambodia and Thailand is so beautiful and pleasant to listen to.</p>
<p>I can listen to it all day without understanding a word.</p>
<p>We Chinese are so glad they are untouched by the Anglophile world where the poison there is greater and more long lasting than Covid-19. 
</p>
 
<p>Laos isn&#8217;t a rich country. But these simple messages truly inspired us, which we value deeply. 
</p>
<p>If we are safe, if our neighbors are safe (further below), Laos, too, would be safe!</p>

<p>Below, is Iraq, which donated to us supplies on Feb 14.</p>
<p>How can we ever, ever repay this debt from a country such as Iraq!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rachel, we give up on USA. You guys do what you want! Stay safe.</p>
<p>Xi Jinping has told&#160; Trump, if the US needs us, in any way the US deems fit, just call. We&#8217;ll mobilize and deliver. But Trump won&#8217;t because Pompeo won&#8217;t let him.</p>
<p>Get around that motherfucker. Pompeo doesn&#8217;t own America. Have the individual mayors, better yet the state governors, call us. We&#8217;ll do what we can.</p>
<p>If you like, let&#8217;s start with severity and need, one county at a time then replicate the process. We&#8217;re good at that, and we have both manpower and resources on the criteria laid out. Our medical people have rested, though not all, and they are willing to help but one would suggest deployment in batches of full Covid-19 specialist teams, own equipment, own gear, everything, 7-to-12 members per county per shift depending on size.</p>
<p>None of this is to suggest we can take care of the US epidemic starting with NYC. To handle 60,000 Covid-19 patients in Wuhan alone, we needed about 40,000 extra medical staff running 24/7, three shifts, covering at peak 12,000 Covid-only beds for moderate to severe symptoms, per bed occupied 2 to 6 weeks for the most severe. But that&#8217;s our standard: every 10 person in, 10 walk out alive. In America, we will have no control on containment which is not a hospital problem but is a social, governance, municipal issue. Yet hospital/treatment efficacy is inversely related to containment, the weaker of one increases severity in the other. You understand?</p>
<p>All we can do is produce and therefore show a working model for replication, plus planning ahead and immediate suggestions in-situ.</p>
<p>Contact the Chinatown association. They will know where to reach us.</p>
<p>PS: We&#8217;ll get even with Pompeo another time.</p>

					<p>USA hides its Covid-19 infections then sub-contracts the Anglophile world for hit pieces (eg thambi <a href="https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/517116">Phlip Rodrigues</a> at Mkini, India&#8217;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_gUM8rL-Lrg6O3adPW9K1g">WION</a>, Australia&#8217;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/skynews">Sky</a>), bashing China for under-reporting, opaqueness, even exporting, by publishing articles that the war-mongering Fox News would think, &#8216;yuk&#8217;.&#160; But,</p>

But why? What do they gain? A criminal intent &#8212; a war crime &#8212; to begin with&#8230;?</p>

<h1>CAKAP SAJA</h1>
<p>*</p>
<p>Like talking its way into Regime Change, like Democracy, like Elections&#8230;</p>
<p>USA talks to Virus to talk its way out, like yada-yada Indians, like Anglophiles. They know only how to talk because that&#8217;s all they have, from an Indian hole between a pair of Indian legs to the tip of a White man&#8217;s crown. Keep it up&#8230; brother, sister!</p>
<p>Below are some cakap saja cases.</p>
<p>*</p>
 
<p>*</p>
 
<p>*</p>
<p>UPDATE&#8230;UPDATE&#8230;UPDATE</p>
<p>We Chinese let the Virus do the talking back to USA</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Keep it up, America! We Chinese virus are right behind you. Right behind!</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>US Dollar Hegemony is a Wimp</h3>
<p>The US has a lot and a lot and a lot of money, as much as it can print them because its people and countries elsewhere, it is assumed, need US dollars more than anything else in the world; can&#8217;t do without it. US can even use money, its US dollar, to punish poor people and to cripple countries it doesn&#8217;t like, such as Venezuela, Iran, Cuba, Syria, like it had tried on Russia and China and Nicaragua.</p>
<p>But that &#8212; money &#8212; is not the fundamental problem facing American life and death today nor is it the most powerful thing in the world. What Covid-19 shows is that, that thing called money, US dollar, is not the power nor the most important thing in life! What is?</p>
<p>For the answer, see below, though that&#8217;s not spelled out &#8212; reporters are just that.</p>
<p>What you see and hear in the clip is pure, utterly pure manifestation of that &#8216;fundamental problem&#8217; inside America and in its hold on its outside paid agents, and on countries and in stupid people like Steven Gan, Rais Hussin, and in other Anglophiles in Damansara, and like those Indians shitting in New Delhi sidewalks even today.</p>
<p>Rachel Maddow below is describing the manifestation of that problem. But, stupid as White people are, she imagines that if the US stop manifesting the problem, then the problem is resolved. That&#8217;s exactly the attitude the US had in dealing with Covid-19 &#8212; first, they begin by talking to the virus.</p>
<p>Pompeo, Trump call that virus the Chinese virus in the belief that, since this is a Chinese virus, the Chinese needs to answer back, perhaps even provide US the solution to its fundamental problem and the manifestations of that problem.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t. Even if &#8212; and that&#8217;s a big if &#8212; America wants solutions, don&#8217;t ask us. Ask <a href="https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/517116">Phlip Rodrigues</a> at Mkini, India&#8217;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_gUM8rL-Lrg6O3adPW9K1g">WION</a>, Australia&#8217;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/skynews">Sky</a>, they are so clever, they have so much of spittle, surely they know the answers.</p>
<p>Even the virus doesn&#8217;t have to answer back.</p>
<p>But, when it did so, it was done without talking. How? Go back to top of post and to the charts above.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rachel! You just don&#8217;t get it!</p>

					<p>Update 1 
</p>
<blockquote>
<h1>YOU&#8217;RE ALIVE!</h1>
</blockquote>
<p>*</p>
<p>Actual words spoken (see clip).</p>
<p>In the last leg of the Covid-19 fight, ECMO use (<a href="https://shuzheng.wordpress.com/2020/03/24/why-is-it-malaysia-fart-so-much/">see this for more details</a>) is critical, saving every life. ECMO use is taking over the functions of the heart and lungs to circulate blood and to oxygenate the body.</p>
<p>This mechanical technique is employed more and more often at the ICUs because the critically ill are bunched up in the last few weeks.</p>
<p>In the case (below), ECMO treatment went on for 10 days! Imagine, ten days! The clip shows the last five minutes before ECMO was terminated after all critical organ functions were normalized, heart beat rate, pressure, etc.</p>
<p>We want to save everyone, regardless of age.</p>
 
<p>*</p>
<h3>One Day in ICU</h3>
<p>Even seeing the clip, you can sense how busy, hardworking and dedicated must be the staff &#8212; attending, for example, to a patient who wants to pee or fetching a syringe.</p>
 
<p>*</p>
<h3>What goes on in ICU</h3>
<p>Delirium and convulsions show up frequently in ICU cases. These are signs from serious consequence of Covid-19 infection, which is oxygen deprivation, affecting everything inside the body, including the brains in particular. Because of this deprivation, there can be long-term damage, to the lungs and the brains.</p>
<p>The clip below gives you a slice of life inside an ICU that staff must be prepared for because, unlike normal ICU situations, there are dozens of patients &#8212; all around you. Another clip further below elaborates.</p>
<p>After a shift, a nurse eats a lot. Why? Hungry from the never-ending physical exertion, lifting a body, turning over a body, carrying equipment, dashing here and there, on and on and on, six hours non-stop, and all the while you can&#8217;t have drink or a snack because of the protective suit.</p>
<p>Removing a protective suit takes 10-15 minutes, more time than wearing it because you don&#8217;t want contamination, which is guaranteed to arise, such as when you put on an oxygen mask for a patient or carry out a surgical incision or pat the back or feed the patient.</p>
 
<p>*</p>
 
<p>***</p>

<p>*</p>
<h3>AMERICAN VALUES</h3>
 
<p>The same values sold, resold, distributed and redistributed:</p>
<ul>
<li>by Reuters,</li>
<li>in Malaysiakini,</li>
<li>by Anglophiles,</li>
<li>by Steven Gan,</li>
<li>Mahathir Mohamad,</li>
<li>by Rais Hussin,</li>
<li>Saifuddin Abdullah,</li>
<li>Lim Guan Eng,</li>
<li>Steve Oh,</li>
<li>Yeo Bee Yin,</li>
<li>Dennis Ignatius,</li>
<li>Lady Annie,</li>
<li>in Hong Kong by Joshua Wong,</li>
<li>Alvin Yeung,</li>
<li>Martin Lee,</li>
<li>Claudia Bowring,</li>
<li>Tom Grundy,</li>
<li>Anson Maria Elizabeth Chan, and</li>
<li>in eight months of daily rioting in Hong Kong.</li>
</ul>
<p>They call those values, in the collective, &#8216;freedom&#8217;: Freedom of expression, freedom of speech, freedom of the Press, freedom this, freedom that.</p>
<p>***</p>

 
<p>*</p>
<p>Do they know what&#8217;s telling truth to power?</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8230;because, what if the Power is a Virus?</li>
<li>&#8230;what if they don&#8217;t know what is Truth?</li>
<li>&#8230;what if they don&#8217;t even know how to Speak?</li>
</ul>
<p>*</p>
 
<p>FREEDOM FOR A LITANY OF LIES</p>
<p>Above, Rachel Maddox&#8217;s concluding point is, in effect, suppress freedom of speech! And that is suppressing, no less, the White House. She is some motherfucking White bitch. But in the above, we Chinese can positively say, she is right.</p>
<p>Still, they won&#8217;t listen to her. That is, instead of actually working, they talk and talk and talk&#8230;, talking lies, like what you read daily in Mkini. That is, instead of finding and killing virus, they talk their way out.</p>
<p>The reason? They don&#8217;t know how to find the virus, which is a matter of science and not of talking. After all, how did Trump become president? Strictly, by counting noses. He is president because he is most popular, and not by how clever nor how good he is, not even as a human.</p>
<p>And how did Trump become most popular? By talking! The same thing it is with Mahathir and Anwar and Lim Guan Eng, and there&#8217;s Mkini to distribute that talk. Hence, talk your way in, talk your way to stay in.</p>
<p>*</p>
<h3>HOW PLAYING WITH WORDS, LANGUAGE</h3>
<h3>WILL FUCK UP USA &#8212; &amp; ITS COPYCAT MALAYSIA</h3>
<p>Like stoking the Hong Kong riots, like an electoral campaign, they played with words (it&#8217;s called lying), and with perceptions (propaganda), in order to influence outcomes and attitudes, that is, to manufacture a consensus, usually for a political goal as toppling government.</p>
<p>It is as if they can fuck, fuck, and fuck with reality, with people, with situations, and there&#8217;s no price to pay.</p>
<p>In the US establishment, with those attitudes (also adopted in Malaysia, by DAP, by its mouthpiece Malaysiakini, by PKR), they think they can talk their way out of a pandemic.</p>
<p>That is, playing footsie with words, throughout January, February, even in March (Chinese virus), they believe they can deliver the results like winning an election, like toppling a government, like getting people to riot or come out on the streets.</p>
<p>Instead, the results are those below&#8230;</p>
 
 
<p>Keep it up Donald Trump! Keep it up DAP, Stevie Wonder Gan!</p>
<p>Numbers in the hands of stupid Malaysians they manipulate. Malaysia has as many cases as Indonesia and Thailand but look again &#8212; against population size and total cases (second column).</p>
<p>May the virus decimate those fucking countries, starting with the USA, followed by the newsrooms &#8212; we don&#8217;t even to have fire a single shot. 
</p>
<p>Or speak a word of lie!</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Until today, they, in the US and Malaysia, don&#8217;t know what it is they truly, truly, truly need to do, except to employ words like &#8216;containment, flattening the curve, cutting transmission chain&#8217; to conjure up some image they are doing something useful, productive.</p>
<p>But what exactly do you do that effectively matches Reality with the words, containment or flattening some fucking curve?</p>
<p>Speaking truth to power? You don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s power, stupid Motherfucker Gan. Today, we are talking real power.</p>
<p>In the end, the like of Donald Trump (distributed by Reuters, and <a href="https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/516668">still distributed</a>, by Mkini, by Steven Wonder Gan, by Lady Annie), they are just so much yada (<a href="https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/516646">Mkini subscribers</a>), yada (<a href="https://www.malaysiakini.com/columns/516430">Jacqueline Ann Surin</a>), and <a href="https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/516653">more yada</a>.</p>
<p>This post follows from the <a href="https://shuzheng.wordpress.com/2020/03/24/why-is-it-malaysia-fart-so-much/">earlier one</a>: What do you get for so much of fart. Detailed results will follow.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>When the &#8216;Great Communicator&#8217; uses</p>
<p>Reality Show vs Actual Reality. Word Spin vs Empiricism 
</p>
 
<p>&#8230;guess who wins, always wins.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Update 2</p>
<h3>THOSE WHO MUST PAY</h3>
<p>Not Trump, not Pompeo, and not the Editors at WION, Sky News, at Guardian, Reuters, Mkini have to pay for their political propaganda (Chinese virus, hence won&#8217;t affect White people), their medical misinformation (stay at home), their mischief (it will go away) and their word spin (look after &#8216;<a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/limkitsiang/rss/~3/iHEwamoF38A/">health</a>&#8216; of the stock market).</p>
<p>No. Instead, the <a href="https://youtu.be/rxkE24eavEs">entire family below</a> has to pay:</p>
 
<p>They stayed at home, as told.</p>
<p>&#8230;Four are dead, three in hospital, 20 under quarantine. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/post/UgyIJ2Lkk2gGYGg7pzt4AaABCQ">Said one of them</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="style-scope yt-formatted-string" dir="auto">&#8216;The second we start to grieve about one, the phone rings and there is another person gone.&#8217; </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In times like these, democracy is deadly: You are free when you are dead.</p>
<p>You deserve the government you voted in? Why bother with democracy? Is it worth it, this democracy? A family wiped clean, dead?</p>
<p>We Chinese would prefer an authoritarian and caring government anytime over a freely elected incompetent government that had simply talked its way into power, promoted by motherfucking editors.</p>
<p>***</p>

<p>*</p>
<p><a href="https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/516668">Below</a>, Reuters distributes more US talk:</p>
<p>It is how USA wish for us to share with them more talk? By smearing us &#8212; with talk? 
</p>
 
<p>*</p>
<h3>NO! WE CHINESE&#8230;</h3>
<h3>WILL SHARE NOTHING WITH USA!</h3>
<h3>NOTHING! 
</h3>
<p>Not even one thread for a face mask! And what you&#8217;re going to do?</p>
<ul>
<li>Send us another batch of virus?</li>
<li>Send US military into Wuhan for basketball?</li>
<li>Try another season of rioting in HK?</li>
<li>Get Muslims to invade China?</li>
<li>Try change regime again?</li>
<li>Send more warships to Taiwan?</li>
<li>Or, have Reuters resell even more propaganda?</li>
</ul>
<p>Take your pick, USA! Even try all at the same time. If we can win the war against the Virus, USA is nothing to us.</p>
<p>You can bully Iraq, Syria, Venezuela, Cuba and lots of other countries, we Chinese will take you on. Anytime.</p>

<p>This reason why mediums like Malaysiakini, Reuters, Facebook, YouTube must be controlled is that they sell, resell, distribute and re-distribute garbage, fear and bigotry, most of which are personal to the stupid and bias editors.

<h3>Happy farting Malaysia.</h3>
<h3>Keep it up!</h3>
<h3>Fight for <a href="http://lifeofaannie.blogspot.com/">fart freedom</a>!</h3>
<p>*</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s long awaited answer to titled question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Malaysian Anglophiles love a loud, booming fart.</p>
<p>The rest of the world actually work. In Malaysia, instead, they are all ears, nose and eyes for a good, stinking fart. They &#8212; the jobless, the retired, the old busybodies, the chattering class &#8212; help keep unemployable reporters and editors and Malaysiakini in business where you only need know how to type.</p>
<p>Name me one person &#8212; and prove it &#8212; who is ever wiser coming out of Fart Center and I hereby pledge to be your slave for life. Will even throw in my thambi girlfriend below, long pink tongue, brown lips, black eyes, darkie skin. She may look like a witch but she can suck well, in between your legs, all to your heart&#8217;s content &#8212; while you fart! Satisfaction guaranteed or your money back.</p>

<h3>A Life Saver&#8230;</h3>
<p>and the ICU Most Expensive Equipment</p>
 
<p>This is when <a href="https://shuzheng.wordpress.com/2020/03/22/nepali-friend-in-china-one-month-lockdown-update-yeobeeyin-death-culture/">ventilators</a> are of no use. The ECMO is brought in as the last resort, when the lungs seizes to function and body descends into convulsion.</p>
<p>At that stage, in Italy, they give up. The method is a very extreme but on several occasions we found it work though present literature says it&#8217;s good for in operating theaters though for temporary support. In one case, the patient fully recovered three days later; a week later, he walked out. He was about 50. Without it, he would be dead. Pessimism elsewhere arises because of the thing called <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30628-0/fulltext">cytokine storm</a> (Lancet article below) which damages internal organs.</p>
<p>But, more to the point, the ECMO is difficult to use (see clip, and count number of people involved) and expensive. If the government didn&#8217;t intervene, nobody can afford it. Upon outbreak, the Chinese government bought 16 ECMOs for Wuhan and arranged ECMO from other provinces to be transported there. Up to March 4th, 67 ECMOs were in use.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>From <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30628-0/fulltext">the Lancet</a>, <span class="article-header__publish-date bulleted"><span class="article-header__publish-date__value">March 16, 2020</span></span>, excerpt (emphasis added):</p>
<h3 class="article-header__title">COVID-19: consider cytokine storm syndromes and immunosuppression</h3>
<blockquote>
<p class="section-paragraph">As of March 12, 2020, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been confirmed in 125, 048 people worldwide, carrying a mortality of approximately 3&#183;7%, compared with a mortality rate of less than 1% from influenza. There is an urgent need for effective treatment. Current focus has been on the development of novel therapeutics, including antivirals and vaccines.</p>
 
<p class="section-paragraph">Accumulating evidence suggests that a subgroup of patients with severe COVID-19 might have a cytokine storm syndrome. We recommend identification and treatment of hyperinflammation using existing, approved therapies with proven safety profiles to address the immediate need to reduce the rising mortality.</p>

<p>Current management of COVID-19 is supportive, and respiratory failure from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the leading cause of mortality. Secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH) is an under-recognised, hyperinflammatory syndrome characterised by a fulminant and fatal hypercytokinaemia with multiorgan failure. In adults, sHLH is most commonly triggered by viral infections and occurs in 3&#183;7&#8211;4&#183;3% of sepsis cases.</p>
<p>Cardinal features of sHLH include unremitting fever, cytopenias, and hyperferritinaemia; pulmonary involvement (including ARDS) occurs in approximately 50% of patients.</p>

<p class="section-paragraph">A cytokine profile resembling sHLH is associated with COVID-19 disease severity, characterised by increased interleukin (IL)-2, IL-7, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, interferon-&#947; inducible protein 10, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, macrophage inflammatory protein 1-&#945;, and tumour necrosis factor-&#945;. Predictors of fatality from a recent retrospective, multicentre study of 150 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Wuhan, China, included elevated ferritin (mean 1297&#183;6 ng/ml in non-survivors vs 614&#183;0 ng/ml in survivors; p&lt;0&#183;001) and IL-6 (p&lt;0&#183;0001), suggesting that mortality might be due to virally driven hyperinflammation. &#8230;</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="section-paragraph">*</p>

<p class="section-paragraph">*</p>
<h3>WHY MILITARY MEDIC</h3>
<p>The danger they faced must not be underestimated although nobody remembers them:</p>
<p>We had no clear idea about the disease except it is contagious and if you get it, death awaits. Every minute inside the hospital is dangerous. Yet they stayed for 2 months.</p>
<p>Today, the world doesn&#8217;t have to deal with their uncertainties.</p>
 
<p>***</p>
 
<p>Remember the hospital we build in 10 days?</p>
<p>That one alone saved at least 1,000. The military ran it.</p>
<p>Imagine if <a href="https://www.facebook.com/yeobeeyin/">Yeo Bee Yin</a> were in charge. She&#8217;d ask what is the cost-benefit analysis? When is the payoff?</p>
<p>Small wonder China is successful, and Malaysia is so fucked up: Anglophiles, Christians, they do immeasurable damage to people lives, like it is happening in America and the UK. And all over what?</p>

					<h3>WORDS HAVE CONSEQUENCES</h3>
 
<p>Jonathan Mok in UK: early consequence of Anglo-American anti-Chinese campaign. 
</p>
<p>*</p>
<h1>HOW TO GLOBALIZE AN

<p>*</p>
<h1>ANTI-CHINESE POGROM</h1>
<p>*</p>
<p>Start at the top&#8230;</p>
 
<p>*</p>
 
<p>***</p>

<p>*</p>
<p>Make it a State policy&#8230;</p>
 
 
<p>*</p>
 
<h3>US Govt issues blame China circular to State, other Depts</h3>
<ul>
<li>Blame China for everything: cover up epidemic, creating pandemic.</li>
<li>Praise USA for everything: humanitarian, transparent, care for the world</li>
</ul>
<p>*</p>
<p>(This is Trump, two months earlier, on Jan 25)</p>
 
<p>(Or see this: <a href="https://shuzheng.wordpress.com/2020/03/20/smoking-gun-proof-us-had-covid-19-before-china/">US had Covid-19 before China)</a></p>
<p>*</p>

<p>*</p>
<p>Then distribute globally via the Press. Below, right on queue&#8230;

<p>*</p>
<h3>ANTI-CHINESE POGROM &#8212; AGAIN</h3>
<p>Exploiting Covid-19 in an anti-Chinese pogrom has had its precedents, taking place as recent as the Hong Kong riots, a campaign sponsored by the US State department, promoted and distributed by Reuters and Malaysiakini for Anglophone consumption to their equally perverse readers.</p>
<p>This is an intended pogrom because before the actual killing, like the attack on Jonathan Mok (on top of this post), like the HK riots (below), it starts with a media campaign. The same pattern was seen in Malaysia 1969, Indonesia 1965, 1998, in the US Chinese Exclusion Act, 1800s, Australia and Canada at the same time.</p>
<p>What did the Chinese do to deserve all that? Nothing. You have only to be Chinese.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Malaysiakini: China virus&#8230;</p>
 
<p>*</p>
<p>Malaysiakini: China virus&#8230;</p>
 
<p>*</p>
<p>Malaysiakini: China virus&#8230;</p>
 
<p>*</p>
<p>Malaysiakini Facebook: China virus&#8230;</p>
 
<p>*</p>
<h3>ANTI-CHINESE POGROM IN HK</h3>
<p>Reuters in Hong Kong: Chinese OUT!</p>
 
<p>Above, Ukrainian Neo-Nazis joined the Hong Kong riots, Nov 2019. Below in Ukraine, 2014, financed by the US, same black uniform, masked. 
</p>
 
<p>Below the anti-Chinese campaign in January in Hong Kong, also using Covid-19 
</p>
 
<p>*</p>
<p>See the Reuters headline? It wasn&#8217;t erroneous, it was unashamedly a lie.</p>
<p>Reuters knew very well that before the strike, the Fanling isolation ward was firebombed by the same strikers who, in turn, were motivated by the same racial attacks and anti-Chinese pogrom in the Jun 2019-Jan 2020 Hong Kong riots. The primary aim of the riots was to chase away every Chinese from Hong Kong &#8212; &#8216;liberate Hong Kong&#8217; from Chinese, which is accompanied by the Reuters&#8217;s photo of the riot banner below.</p>
<p>Covid-19 succeeded where the riots failed, that is, shut Hong Kong out of China.</p>
<p>Note also the American flag in the background. Both the riots and the strike were carried out in America&#8217;s name &#8212; democracy and freedom &#8212; during which rioters bludgeoned and attacked more than 300 Chinese on the streets and burn hundreds of Chinese enterprises including banks.</p>
<p>The term &#8216;anti-Chinese pogrom in Hong Kong&#8217; seems like a contradiction in terms. It is not. The strikers and Black Shirt rioters and their US-paid politician-backers and Press reporters don&#8217;t consider themselves Chinese but Anglophiles, loyal to Anglo-America only.</p>
<p>*</p>
 
 
 
<p>The term, &#8216;No to China&#8217;, meaning &#8216;No to Chinese&#8217;, is used only in the English. The Chinese version after that doesn&#8217;t say it.</p>
<p>*</p>
<h3>CHINESE OUT!</h3>
<p>Go farther back, see the similarity in the messages?</p>
 
 
 
<p>***</p>
<p>Postscript:</p>
<p>Many Anglophiles are returning to Hong Kong from UK and US, although they insist Anglo-America is superior in culture, values, and systems of government. Hence, on a personal note, we Chinese don&#8217;t mind if the Anglophiles bring with them Covid-19 and after that decimate the entire Hong Kong population. Their minds are so badly poisoned, worse than Covid-19, that they are beyond saving.</p>
<p>*</p>

<p>*</p>
<h3>OTHER, SANE VOICES</h3>
 
 
<p>*</p>
<p>POISON IN TANAH MELAYU</p>
<p>So great and pervasive is Anglophone media on the Anglophile consciousness that the other voices, above clips, barely make a dent. Not even if they tell the truth.</p>
<p>This suggest we Chinese are losing the propaganda war? Hardly. Anglo-America, through its culture, language and money control that space. Take Mkini, for example. The Chinese ambassador visited them; and nothing happened. You can hardly win on their turf, so you don&#8217;t fight them. Besides we have no propaganda to circulate. For what? And what propaganda?</p>
<p>Eventually the price in the anti-Chinese campaign will be paid by overseas Chinese, including Anglophiles, but the main body of Chinese, inside mainland China, are protected.</p>
<p>Anglophiles would include the DAP Chinese, Christian, English speaking, who thinks the world of Anglo-America and re-distributes the latter&#8217;s ideology and racism, but in the name of freedom and democracy, like the Anglophile Hongkees.</p>
<p>Malaiyoos should be wary of those DAP Anglophiles. America has them in their pockets. But, once the American influence spread to the main Malay population, then you have a problematic situation like in Hong Kong, Ukraine, Georgia where the US, via local players, control the politics because they control the propaganda space in the body polity. The spread of this influence is not difficult to spot: Rais Hussin is an example. Phar Kim Beng another. Dennis Ignatius, Saifuddin Abdullah, Maria Chin and, of course, Anwar Ibrahim and the PKR shebang, starting with Wong Chen.</p>
<p>The problem with them is their loyalty.</p>
<p>Deal with them sooner, you have a lesser problem later.</p>
<p>How to deal with them? That&#8217;s your problem. But know your enemy. Because of America, the Anglophiles have international connections and financial and propaganda support: HK, UK, Germany (Soros is there), India, and especially Taiwan. Hence, you see PKR and DAP fellas forever running to Taiwan whenever they get into trouble at home. From HK, the Black Shirt rioters and their US-paid politicians do the same, hide in Taiwan as well, which explains why they are against the extradition Bill, now revoked.</p>

<li class="sidebox"><h2>Erich Maria Remarque</h2>			<p>"No," he said quickly. "Never. Stay friends? Try to grow a small rose garden on the ashes of broken feelings? No, this will never work for you and me. It happens only after small affairs and it looks fake. Love should not be spoiled by friendship." 
* 
No one can become stranger than the person you once loved. 
* 
How clumsy a person behaves when he is truly in love! How quickly his self-confidence fades! And how lonely he feels; all his praised experience seems to be gone, just like fog, and he feels so weak and helpless. 
* 
Love cannot stand explanations. It requires actions. Love wants to be eternal. That is the source of the torture it causes us. 
* 
"I have always thought a woman should not tell a man she is in love with him. Her shining and happy eyes should bear witness to that." 
* 
"You have to break your principles sometimes. Otherwise they bring you no joy." 
* 
"Whatever you can&#8217;t get always seems better than whatever you have. This is the romance and the stupidity of our life." 
* 
"Nothing&#8217;s lost yet," I said. "You only lose someone when he&#8217;s dead."

Where? Which?</p> <p>Let’s further suppose Stevie Wonder Gan says this is Pompeo’s ‘point of view’, and he is entitled to it. Where then is this ‘view’ we hadn’t heard before? What exactly is it? What is the evidential backing or the logicism in the ‘view’, even to be heard the thousandth time?</p> <p>“Eh, Venga go fuck your thambi mother” — is that a point of view?</p> <p>Sigh… The above just goes to reaffirm Stevie’s lies all along: They are ‘free and independent’. Or they tell ‘truth to power’.</p> <p>Mkini, the Stevies and the Martins are just US-paid hacks, the first as rag sheet of the US propaganda arm in Malaysia. America tells Stevie Wonder Gan, “Jump“, he asked how high. America tells him, ‘Sit boy!” and he proceeds to suck some Yankee penis.</p> <p>Why is he doing this? Answer, Money. (What else unless American exceptionalism is a religion.)</p> <p>How else is Martin going to make money? That article? Maybe 50 depreciated ringgit, so one is told, is a pittance in US dollar, can’t even buy a Covid mask in NY. The Fed prints money like it’s toilet paper, 23 trillion al-leady, and 3.5 trillion more coming.</p> <p>The so-called journalism ‘profession’ (sic) is more useless than the soldier in his barrack doing nothing the whole day. The certificates that Mkini prints and issues from ‘Kini Academy‘ and which they call ‘journalism’ or ‘communication’ tells you nothing about any intellectual wherewithal or practical skill set.</p> <p>All day long, the poor kids from who the Venga, the Martins and Stevie take money, hear only yada, yada, yada, never having to ask questions like, “Eh, thambi professor what is a ventilator, ar? How you make one la?</p> <p><a href="https://www.kiniacademy.com/">Kini academy</a> (<a href="https://www.kiniacademy.com/" rel="nofollow">https://www.kiniacademy.com/</a>) is a fucking money scam.</p> <p>Proof of the statement into the uselessness of ‘journalism’ is the Internet. All you need is a computer and an Internet connection. You don’t even need a tongue.</p> <p>*</p> <p>*</p> <h1>DUTY?   HUMANITARIAN?</h1> <p>*</p> <p><del></del></p><del> </del><p><del><a href="https://shuzheng.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/mkini1-1.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47112" src="https://shuzheng.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/mkini1-1.png?w=500&amp;h=292" alt="" width="500" height="292"> Link: https://shuzheng.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/mkini1-1.png </a></del></p> <p>***</p> <p>Now, immediately below, watch how US-funded Malaysiakini and Anglophile Venga actually lied for Pompeo and had distributed his lies.</p> <p>And you don’t have to search hard to catch those lies…</p> <p>Towards Iranians, America does not regard Iranians as humans…</p> <p>The rest of the world wants nothing from the US. It is good enough it doesn’t get in the way.</p> <p>But for a Third World country like Malaysia to lie on US behalf? 
</p> <p>It shows the loyalty and the morality of Anglophiles like Steven Gan and Ventilator Venga.</p> <p>For money, they’d even sell their daughters to prostitute rackets in Calcutta.</p> <p>You can see, therefore, why the US got what’s due to them.</p> <p>*</p> <p>In the Mkini above titled article is <a href="https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/517855">another example</a> of Ventilating Venga ventilating for Pompeo, meaning reselling and redistributing US propaganda: Pompeo selling yada, yada to the world that is a mirror reflection of Trump saying the same thing in the US.</p> <p>In January, Trump promise US$100 million to ‘Asia’, meaning South Korea, Japan and Taiwan. In all three countries, not a cent arrived, and we have already taken care of the problem. But does Ventilating Venga state that fact? No, because the journalist job to inform is only secondary to the purpose of publication. And that purpose, Venga’s purpose, Mkini’s purpose is, as a poodle barking dog, to peddle influence, distribute American propaganda, as if after all that the world would be better off when it never is, as if lying and as if words have no consequences.</p> <p>Now, listen to the clip below: It is not Ventilating Venga manufacturing fake news. It is not a Venga cover-up for the US in order to make his master Mike Pompeo looks good. It’s called truth.</p> <p>*</p> <p>*</p> <h3>THE THAMBI’S LIE</h3> <p>Top humanitarian aid provider?</p> <p>Pompeo can’t even do duty to his own people. But, for a true understanding of the term ‘humanitarian’ — that America is the world’s ‘top humanitarian aid provider’, so wrote Ventilator Venga on behalf of the USA — listen to the clip below. And here is the added problem: Those lies kill people, Americans kill Americans. So be it.</p> <p>In spreading the lie for America, the lie that they are more concerned for human welfare than money, Venga encourages the Malaysian government to do exactly the same: Kill its own people. Hurray!</p> <p>*</p> <h1>RACHEL</h1> <p>*</p> <p>Watch Rachel’s expressions and gestures, clip below. Me thinks she is cute, particularly when she launches her finger into flight. 
</p> <blockquote><p>You are so cute, I’d give you a kiss if we aren’t separated by an ocean, six mountains, two continents, and the most powerful deterrent of all — the Chinese Virus!.</p> <p>So, you got <a href="https://shuzheng.wordpress.com/2020/03/28/china-laos-neighbors-post-covid-note-to-rachel-maddow/">our message</a>. We Chinese say, you cross the river by feelings the stones under your feet. In the vernacular: You work the problem by wading into it. Otherwise, by the time you finish fixing your supply chain, measuring the water depth, temperature, speed of current, etc, we’d all be dead before you even wet your toes. Or your panties.</p> <p>When this is over, America is still intact (we’d wish otherwise), and you still have your job, the drink is on you.</p> <p>Skip Trump, Skip Pence. Skip Pompeo. They don’t own America; they are not even owning up to their responsibilities.</p> <p>And suggests this to that McNeil NYT stooge: Offer each Chinese doctor <a href="https://youtu.be/kJLhFm9fWLQ">a million bucks</a>, two months, to save America. And America can afford a million each; tell the Fed to print it. But here is my million dollar bet with you: The higher the McNeil bid, the louder comes the answer, ‘No!’</p> <p>Wanna to know why?</p> <p>I tell you, Americans can be very, very stupid and ignorant — on top of being narcissistic.</p> <p>Stay safe, ya! Need anything, call. We insist.</p> <p>BTW, Wear a fucking mask, Rachel!</p> <p>Imagine all America looking at you in that garb. It’s the stuff of history — and you’d still be just as pretty. Unfortunately, some wrinkles are showing up under your eyes. And your chin is beginning to sag. We Chinese have just the medicine for both.

It was their way of waging war against China. US-sponsored Mkini had also used that line about bats as well.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>This is the same propaganda tactic used before, lying about concentration camps in Xinjiang and lying that the Hong Kong riots were ‘democratic activism’ when in actuality it was pure mayhem, inflicting a reign of terror on the streets. <a href="http://lifeofaannie.blogspot.com/">Lady Annie Link: http://lifeofaannie.blogspot.com/ </a>, along with the HK Anglophile Press, repeatedly spread the propaganda lie, also circulated by Mkini, by calling the riots ‘peaceful protests’ in a ‘Fight for Freedom’.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Throughout, the Anglo-American Press, notable Reuters, BBC, the Washington Post and New York Times were at the forefront of manufacturing those stories, faking a narrative invented then passed on for use by the US-paid, NED-sponsored politicians in Hong Kong to the international media.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Below, they are doing it again…</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>This theory is now clear: Because the US is powerless militarily, it is using an alternative full war spectrum, hence trade war, media war, propaganda war, biological war, cyber war, internal agitations, bribing local politicians, agents and so on.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>What did the Chinese did to deserve all this? That’s also like asking what did the Libyans did to deserve the total destruction of their country, the Syrians, the Afghans, the Iraqis, now the Venezuelans, and the Cubans.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>In the current pandemic, the US warned its European allies against asking or accepting any medical assistance from Cuba, China and Russia. This is so perverse: the situation is like in America, it is short of supplies and manpower so they rather see people fall ill, suffer, and die than doing something, anything, even if that means begging. And to make things worse, the CDC or Center for Disease Control which is suppose to control, as the name says, actually do the opposite, instituting SOPs that would further spread the virus!</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Did you read about all that in the ‘free and independent’, the ‘telling Truth to Power’ Press?

We’re good at that, and we have both manpower and resources on the criteria laid out. Our medical people have rested, though not all, and they are willing to help but one would suggest deployment in batches of full Covid-19 specialist teams, own equipment, own gear, everything, 7-to-12 members per county per shift depending on size.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>None of this is to suggest we can take care of the US epidemic starting with NYC. To handle 60,000 Covid-19 patients in Wuhan alone, we needed about 40,000 extra medical staff running 24/7, three shifts, covering at peak 12,000 Covid-only beds for moderate to severe symptoms, per bed occupied 2 to 6 weeks for the most severe. But that’s our standard: every 10 person in, 10 walk out alive. In America, we will have no control on containment which is not a hospital problem but is a social, governance, municipal issue. Yet hospital/treatment efficacy is inversely related to containment, the weaker of one increases severity in the other.

Predictors of fatality from a recent retrospective, multicentre study of 150 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Wuhan, China, included elevated ferritin (mean 1297·6 ng/ml in non-survivors vs 614·0 ng/ml in survivors; p&lt;0·001) and IL-6 (p&lt;0·0001), suggesting that mortality might be due to virally driven hyperinflammation. …</ins></p><ins> </ins></blockquote><ins> </ins><p class="section-paragraph"><ins>*</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="section-paragraph"><ins>*</ins></p><ins> </ins><h3><ins>WHY MILITARY MEDIC</ins></h3><ins> </ins><p><ins>The danger they faced must not be underestimated although nobody remembers them:</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>We had no clear idea about the disease except it is contagious and if you get it, death awaits.

The primary aim of the riots was to chase away every Chinese from Hong Kong — ‘liberate Hong Kong’ from Chinese, which is accompanied by the Reuters’s photo of the riot banner below.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Covid-19 succeeded where the riots failed, that is, shut Hong Kong out of China.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Note also the American flag in the background. Both the riots and the strike were carried out in America’s name — democracy and freedom — during which rioters bludgeoned and attacked more than 300 Chinese on the streets and burn hundreds of Chinese enterprises including banks.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The term ‘anti-Chinese pogrom in Hong Kong’ seems like a contradiction in terms. It is not. The strikers and Black Shirt rioters and their US-paid politician-backers and Press reporters don’t consider themselves Chinese but Anglophiles, loyal to Anglo-America only.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>*</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The term, ‘No to China’, meaning ‘No to Chinese’, is used only in the English. The Chinese version after that doesn’t say it.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>*</ins></p><ins> </ins><h3><ins>CHINESE OUT!</ins></h3><ins> </ins><p><ins>Go farther back, see the similarity in the messages?</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>***</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Postscript:</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Many Anglophiles are returning to Hong Kong from UK and US, although they insist Anglo-America is superior in culture, values, and systems of government. Hence, on a personal note, we Chinese don’t mind if the Anglophiles bring with them Covid-19 and after that decimate the entire Hong Kong population. Their minds are so badly poisoned, worse than Covid-19, that they are beyond saving.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>*</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>*</ins></p><ins> </ins><h3><ins>OTHER, SANE VOICES</ins></h3><ins> </ins><p><ins>*</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>POISON IN TANAH MELAYU</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>So great and pervasive is Anglophone media on the Anglophile consciousness that the other voices, above clips, barely make a dent. Not even if they tell the truth.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>This suggest we Chinese are losing the propaganda war? Hardly. Anglo-America, through its culture, language and money control that space. Take Mkini, for example. The Chinese ambassador visited them; and nothing happened. You can hardly win on their turf, so you don’t fight them. Besides we have no propaganda to circulate. For what? And what propaganda?</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Eventually the price in the anti-Chinese campaign will be paid by overseas Chinese, including Anglophiles, but the main body of Chinese, inside mainland China, are protected.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Anglophiles would include the DAP Chinese, Christian, English speaking, who thinks the world of Anglo-America and re-distributes the latter’s ideology and racism, but in the name of freedom and democracy, like the Anglophile Hongkees.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Malaiyoos should be wary of those DAP Anglophiles. America has them in their pockets. But, once the American influence spread to the main Malay population, then you have a problematic situation like in Hong Kong, Ukraine, Georgia where the US, via local players, control the politics because they control the propaganda space in the body polity. The spread of this influence is not difficult to spot: Rais Hussin is an example. Phar Kim Beng another. Dennis Ignatius, Saifuddin Abdullah, Maria Chin and, of course, Anwar Ibrahim and the PKR shebang, starting with Wong Chen.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The problem with them is their loyalty.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Deal with them sooner, you have a lesser problem later.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>How to deal with them? That’s your problem. But know your enemy. Because of America, the Anglophiles have international connections and financial and propaganda support: HK, UK, Germany (Soros is there), India, and especially Taiwan. Hence, you see PKR and DAP fellas forever running to Taiwan whenever they get into trouble at home. From HK, the Black Shirt rioters and their US-paid politicians do the same, hide in Taiwan as well, which explains why they are against the extradition Bill, now revoked.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>***</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>*</ins></p><ins> </ins><blockquote><p><ins>Aim high, but keep your feet on the ground.</ins></p><ins> </ins></blockquote><ins> </ins><h3><ins>Descendants of the Dragon:</ins></h3><ins> </ins><h3><ins>We’ll Rejuvenate!</ins></h3><ins> </ins><p><ins>*</ins></p><ins> </ins><h3 class="title style-scope ytd-video-primary-info-renderer"><ins>《我和我的祖國》</ins></h3><ins> </ins><p><ins>My Motherland and I</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>***</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins><a href="https://shuzheng.wordpress.com/2020/03/24/usa-anti-chinese-pogrom-viral-hate-campaign-govt-backing-press-distribute/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to USA ANTI-CHINESE POGROM: Viral the hate campaign, govt backing, Press distribute">Read Full Post » Link: https://shuzheng.wordpress.com/2020/03/24/usa-anti-chinese-pogrom-viral-hate-campaign-govt-backing-press-distribute/ </a></ins></p><ins> </ins><p align="center"><ins><a href="https://shuzheng.wordpress.com/2020/03/page/2/">Older Posts » Link: https://shuzheng.wordpress.com/2020/03/page/2/ </a></ins></p><ins> </ins><ul><li class="sidebox"><h2><ins>Erich Maria Remarque</ins></h2><ins> </ins><p><ins>"No," he said quickly. "Never. Stay friends? Try to grow a small rose garden on the ashes of broken feelings? No, this will never work for you and me. It happens only after small affairs and it looks fake. Love should not be spoiled by friendship." 
* 
No one can become stranger than the person you once loved. 
* 
How clumsy a person behaves when he is truly in love! How quickly his self-confidence fades! And how lonely he feels; all his praised experience seems to be gone, just like fog, and he feels so weak and helpless. 
* 
Love cannot stand explanations. It requires actions. Love wants to be eternal. That is the source of the torture it causes us. 
* 
"I have always thought a woman should not tell a man she is in love with him. Her shining and happy eyes should bear witness to that." 
* 
"You have to break your principles sometimes. Otherwise they bring you no joy." 
* 
"Whatever you can’t get always seems better than whatever you have. This is the romance and the stupidity of our life." 
* 
"Nothing’s lost yet," I said. "You only lose someone when he’s dead."

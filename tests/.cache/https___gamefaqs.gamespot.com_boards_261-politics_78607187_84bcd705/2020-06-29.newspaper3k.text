The truth will set you free, but first it will piss you off. If he died, I wonder how long it would take before the world knew about it. Dude is only 36.

If justice is blind, why do you get a jury of your peers?

-Literally said by OMGWTFPIE Should have followed Trump's example and f***ed a bunch of porn stars and hookers. Too bad. Guess even being God Emperor doesn't make you immune to STDs. Unless your're Trump.

Sister.



So he has a sister.



She currently is his propagandist-in-chief and acts sometimes as a stand-in. The cult is rapidly building around her too.

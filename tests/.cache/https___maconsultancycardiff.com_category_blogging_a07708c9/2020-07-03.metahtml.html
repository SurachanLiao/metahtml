<p>Reese Witherspoon had the best reaction when she was mistaken for another Hollywood celebrity.</p>
<p>The actress was at a barbecue restaurant in Nashville when a fan approached her asking if she was Carrie Underwood. </p>
<p>The blonde beauty took to Twitter to express her delight when a fan saw the resemblance, saying, &#8220;To the woman in the parking lot who just asked me if I was Carrie Underwood: you officially made my day!&#8221;</p>
<p>The tweet got the attention of Underwood, who gushed, &#8220;Your day?! That lady just made my whole life!&#8221; </p>
<p>The exchanges got better when it was made known the fan had taken to TikTok to explain her side of the story before Witherspoon announced it on Twitter.</p>
<p>Blogger Noha Hamid said she was with her husband in Nashville when she spotted Witherspoon wearing a mask and a big cowboy hat. She couldn&#8217;t make out her face, though, so she approached Witherspoon after her meal and asked if she was Underwood.</p>
<p>Witherspoon allegedly replied, &#8220;Hey, no, I&#8217;m not Carrie Underwood, but have a great day.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Witherspoon went on Twitter to talk about the encounter, Hamid replied with her TikTok. </p>
<p>&#8220;I swear when I walked away I was like wait, that was totally Reese Witherspoon!&#8221; she concluded.</p>
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">YOUR day?!?!?!?! That lady just made my whole life! &#10084;&#65039;&#10084;&#65039;&#10084;&#65039;</p>

<p>Banksy&#8217;s prints racked up around US$138,000 in an art auction at the International Art Centre in Auckland, New Zealand. </p>
<p>Three of the prints were sold for world-record prices for the editions, and raked in US$45,000 to US$52,000 each.</p>
<p>Banksy&#8217;s Golf Sale print fetched US$45,000, his Super Mare print sold for US$41,000, while the artist&#8217;s Soup Can print sold for US$52,000.</p>
<p>&#8220;Banksy had this idea that Andy Warhol&#8217;s image of the Campbell&#8217;s soup was just so expensive and so overpriced&#8230; and he painted the Tesco version,&#8221; International Art Centre director Richard Thompson told <a href="https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/banksy-prints-sell-world-record-prices-auckland-auction" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 News</a> about Banksy&#8217;s Soup Can art.</p>

<p>When couples announce their pregnancies is a personal choice. While some celebrities don&#8217;t mind wearing their glowing new mom looks out and proud, others prefer to keep things private until they&#8217;re ready.</p>
<p>As for Gigi Hadid, she chose to keep her pregnancy under wraps for half a year before confirming that she and longtime boyfriend Zayn Malik are with child. What particularly amazed fans was that she never stayed away from the public eye during these months, but still managed to avoid suspicion.</p>
<p>The supermodel finally unveiled her styling secret on an Instagram Live, where she was seen in a tan jumpsuit that revealed no sign of her pregnant belly. Hadid was discussing the <a href="https://designtaxi.com/category/BLM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black Lives Matter</a> movement with chef and welfare advocate Sophia Roe during the live stream.</p>
<p>An expectant mother asked her, &#8220;How do you not have a tummy? I&#8217;m four months into my pregnancy and my tummy is huge. You look great, though!&#8221;</p>
<p>To which, Hadid responded, &#8220;This angle and the really baggy jumpsuit make for an optical illusion,&#8221; implying that she has been cleverly using this trick to keep her pregnancy a secret.</p>
<p>However, she acknowledged, &#8220;From the side, it&#8217;s a different story!&#8230; Wishing you the best!&#8221; </p>
<p>The model is expecting the birth of her baby with Malik in September.</p>

<p>Select users will first see two rows of Stories, but tapping on a &#8220;See All Stories&#8221; button directs them to a full-screen Stories-only section.</p>

<p>Upcoming film Habit, which stars Bella Thorne as &#8220;a street smart, party girl with a Jesus fetish&#8221; and Paris Jackson as Jesus, has received backlash for portraying Christ as &#8220;a lesbian woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Janell Shirtcliff-directed movie has wrapped up filming, though there are no release plans at this time. It follows Thorne&#8217;s character, who finds herself in the midst of a violent drug deal. She tries to find her way out by pretending to be a nun. Jackson&#8217;s character later appears to Thorne as Jesus.</p>
<p>This film, unfortunately, has incurred the wrath of Christian groups.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.change.org/p/warner-brothers-prevent-the-distribution-of-the-film-habit">petition</a> was created on Change.org by Vivian N., who describes Habit as a &#8220;new blasphemous Hollywood film.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Distributors haven&#8217;t picked it up as of yet, so lets please spread awareness and wake people up to the Christianophobic garbage that is spread nowadays,&#8221; the statement in the page reads.</p>
<p>The petition has received over 275,000 signatures, with commenters arguing that &#8220;portraying Jesus as a lesbian is heresy and wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is a film about "lesbian jesus" very disrespectful to my religion. Sign this petition to get this movie cancelled. If your following Paris Jackson DONT.

<p>IKEA is known for offering furniture and other household products at affordable prices. This has allowed the Swedish giant to expand across the globe. </p>
<p>To help ensure that IKEA employees always provide good customer service, <a href="https://www.insider.com/things-you-should-never-do-at-an-ikea-according-to-employees">Insider</a> asked staffers to share what customers shouldn&#8217;t do at the stoes. Scroll down for some key takeaways.</p>
<p><span>Refrain from eating while browsing</span></p>
<p>According to current and former employees of the flat-pack company, you should avoid eating and drinking in the display areas. Former IKEA employee <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sonny-cartright-2074171a5/">Sonny Cartright</a> said that customers who consume food in the furniture display areas usually &#8220;leave marks behind.&#8221; Stick to eating at food halls instead of taking your snacks with you to look for furniture.</p>
<p><span>Ensure your children do not mess up the furniture</span></p>
<p>If you bring kids to an IKEA store, do keep a close eye on them. &#8220;There is nothing worse than children running through the store screaming, messing things up, and leaving sticky handprints everywhere,&#8221; Cartright said. &#8220;It&#8217;s taxing on the staff and unfair to other customers.&#8221;</p>
<p>IKEA&#8217;s merchandise associate <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kelly-roberts-b55ba61a5/">Kelly Roberts</a> also urged for parents to keep drinks out of the hands of their kids. &#8220;It&#8217;s a recipe for disaster and if they end up spilling it we&#8217;re the ones that end up cleaning it up,&#8221; Roberts told <a href="https://www.insider.com/things-you-should-never-do-at-an-ikea-according-to-employees">Insider</a>.</p>
<p>Parents can opt to have their kids play in IKEA&#8217;s Sm&#229;land playground, where trained staff members can watch them while you shop.</p>
<p><span>Don&#8217;t ask employees for staff discounts</span></p>
<p>Asking employees for staff discounts is frowned upon, Roberts revealed. &#8220;Not only does this put us in an awkward situation, it can also put our jobs in jeopardy,&#8221; she said. </p>
<p>If you wish to save money, sign up for the IKEA Family card.</p>
<p><span>Avoid <a href="https://designtaxi.com/news/409862/IKEA-Responds-To-Viral-Video-Of-Woman-Pleasuring-Herself-In-Showroom-In-China/">getting too comfortable</a> on the display furniture</span></p>
<p>Cartright advised customers not too get &#8220;too comfortable on the display furniture.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We once found that someone had used a display toilet for their own needs,&#8221; Cartright explained. &#8220;There have been interesting finds in the beds, as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>While it is completely alright to test out furniture, getting under blankets or compromising on personal hygiene is discouraged on the store floor.</p>
<p>For a comprehensive list of things not to do at IKEA, read the full rundown <a href="https://www.insider.com/things-you-should-never-do-at-an-ikea-according-to-employees">here</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://designtaxi.com/category/BLM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black Lives Matter</a> voices are finally being heard. After <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2020/07/01/mississippi-state-flag-redesign-confederacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">numerous failed attempts</a> to fix its state flag over the years, Mississippi passed a bill to remove the Confederate battle emblem from its state flag on 28 June.</p>
<p>The redesigned flag will feature the US motto seen on all paper bills&#8212;&#8220;In God We Trust&#8221;&#8212;therefore replacing the blue saltire cross with white stars that was picked up by white supremacists during the civil rights movement in the 50s and 60s, according to <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2020/07/01/mississippi-state-flag-redesign-confederacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dezeen</a>.</p>
<p>The decision is in response to a call to remove symbols representing the Confederacy, which was established in 1861 by the seven slave-holding states Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Texas. Mississippi is the last state to vote out its Confederacy emblem.</p>
<p>Legislature will be previewed the revamped look by 14 September, and members of the public will then vote on whether to keep this new version at a special election on 3 November. </p>
<p>The state will greenlight the redesign if the majority votes for it, but return to the drawing board if reception towards it is poor.</p>
<p>The bill reads, &#8220;If a majority of the qualified electors vote against the new design, then the commission shall reconvene to recommend another new design for the Mississippi state flag to be presented to the legislature during the 2021 regular session.&#8221;</p>
<p>It also behests the takedown of the current flag from all Mississippi public buildings within 15 days.</p>

<p>Artist Takashi Murakami released an emotional 15-minute clip about the impacts of the <a href="https://designtaxi.com/category/COVID-19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">coronavirus pandemic</a>.</p>
<p>Murakami stated that his Tokyo-based gallery and arts organization,&#160;<a href="http://en.gallery-kaikaikiki.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kaikai Kiki</a>, is now facing bankruptcy, leading to a number of his projects being canceled, as well. </p>
<p>His sci-fi feature film Jellyfish Eyes Part 2: Mahashankh, for one, has terminated production due to the spread of the virus. &#8220;For nine long years, I had persevered! It was a film that was to realize my childish dreams!&#8221; Murakami shared in the clip.</p>
<p>However, he suggested that the film might be available in a series of videos focusing on the disruption. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how many episodes the series will end up being, but a series it will be, so please come along with me on this journey for a little while,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Watch his heartfelt message below.</p>

<p> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tv/CCEDqIQlmy5/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This spring, I streamed a series of cooking show of a sort on Instagram Live. I&#8217;m sure those who watched them were utterly confused, but I was trying to buoy my own thoroughly sunken feelings through these streamings. With the sudden swoop of COVID-19 pandemic, my company faced bankruptcy and I had to give up on a number of projects, the most symbolic of which being the production of my sci-fi feature film, Jellyfish Eyes Part 2: Mahashankh. For nine long years, I had persevered! It was a film that was to realize my childish dreams! The enormous budget I poured into this project, as well as my tenacious persistence, put a constant and tremendous stress on my company&#8217;s operation for the past nine years. But at the same time, I was able to endure various hardships because I had this project. Faced with the current predicament, however, I was persuaded by both my business consultant and tax attorney that I must, simply must try and drastically reduce our business tax by filing the film&#8217;s production cost as tax-exempt expenditure. To that end, I am going to produce and release a series of videos to publicly announce the discontinuation of the film&#8217;s production. (To be clear, this is an entirely legitimate procedure&#8212;I&#8217;m not trying to evade tax!) These videos will be released against the backdrop of our struggle to avoid an economic catastrophe, but perhaps it may have a cathartic effect on the viewers/my followers to see the story of stupid Murakami&#8217;s failure. Long story short, I&#8217;m a silly human being for whom the moment of bliss is when I am thinking my truly childish sci-fi thoughts. I don&#8217;t know how many episodes the series will end up being, but a series it will be, so please come along with me on this journey for a little while.</a></p>

<p>It turns out that most fans have been pronouncing Charlize Theron&#8217;s name wrongly.</p>
<p>The actress finally decided to clear things up during an appearance on The One Show. Theron was asked by host Gethin Jones if fans should put emphasis on the first or second syllable of her name, and she 
 revealed that it was neither. </p>
<p>&#8220;The truth of the matter is those are not even remotely close to the real pronunciation,&#8221; she laughed. She shared that her last name is actually enunciated more like the word &#8220;throne,&#8221; with a slight roll of the &#8220;r&#8221; instead of &#8220;Therrone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s actually French,&#8221; she clarified. &#8220;It&#8217;s a French name, but in South Africa, if you are Afrikaans-speaking, you would say &#8216;Thron,&#8217; and if you were English-speaking you would say &#8216;Therrone&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kendall Jenner took it upon herself to shoot a series of photos for <a href="https://us.burberry.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Burberry</a>&#8217;s latest ad campaign. </p>
<p>Jenner propped up her camera at home during the <a href="https://designtaxi.com/category/COVID-19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">coronavirus pandemic</a> to capture new self-portraits using her own computer. </p>
<p>The model is seen wearing the brand&#8217;s TB summer monogram collection with an updated look of the Peter Saville-designed TB logo prints first introduced by chief creative officer&#160;Riccardo Tisci in 2018.</p>
<p>The new TB logo is a little bigger and comes with new shades like azure blue, graphite, and cobalt blue with orange accents. The initials pay tribute to the founder Thomas Burberry.</p>
<p>The collection features summer pieces, including a sporty bikini and a bright bodysuit worn by Jenner. The project was directed with the help of creatives Nick Night and Katy England, who worked on the video featuring CGI geometric designs that reflect skateparks and swimming pools.</p>

<p>Disney is well aware no one is as saintly as its princesses. In fact, if it had to be frank, adults are more like its moody and raging villains on most days. These flaws make us interesting, and it turns out, superb ideas for mug designs.</p>
<p>If the only takeaway you have after an hours-long meeting is, &#8220;This could have been an email,&#8221; Disney&#8217;s new drinkware will be your cup of tea. The company&#8217;s official store has rolled out a series of Disney villain-themed mugs splashed with memes that describe everyday adulting pains.</p>
<p>The two-sided mugs pair imagery of Sleeping Beauty&#8217;s Maleficient, The Little Mermaid&#8217;s Ursula, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&#8217; Evil Queen, and Aladdin&#8217;s Jafar, with jokes about real-world pains, such as when you haven&#8217;t had your caffeine fix or when group chats get too annoying.</p>
<p>The hilarious yet painfully honest drinkware collection is available to purchase at US$14.99 per coffee mug via <a href="https://www.shopdisney.com/home/tabletop-kitchen/drinkware/mugs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shopDisney</a>.</p>

<p>President Donald Trump gave himself a new nickname last Tuesday.</p>
<p>On Twitter, he described himself as &#8220;the lone warrior,&#8221; complete with an exclamation mark in true Trump fashion. His son, Eric Trump, agreed with his father&#8217;s tweet, replying, &#8220;You truly are.&#8221;</p>
<p>POTUS gave himself the moniker after claiming to know about a <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/white-house-aware-russian-bounties-2019_n_5efaa7a8c5b6acab284609c9">Russian military unit</a> that had been paying bounties to Afghan militants for murdering American soldiers. He also called himself a &#8220;<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/18/trump-administration-self-swab-coronavirus-tests-135590">wartime president</a>&#8221; as he remained clear during the <a href="https://designtaxi.com/category/COVID-19">coronavirus pandemic</a>.</p>
<p>Twitter users, of course, were quick to reply to the label, and many disagreed with Trump&#8217;s tweet. Some called him out for not serving during the Vietnam War due to his <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-are-heel-spurs-donald-trump-vietnam-deferments-jacqueline-sutera-2017-8">bone spurs</a>.</p>
<p>One user said he was &#8220;the lone warrior hiding <a href="https://designtaxi.com/news/410211/Bunker-Boy-Is-A-Cute-Song-About-Trump-s-Time-In-The-Bunker-Amid-Protests/">in his bunker</a>,&#8221; backing the claim up with a photo of Trump peeking through the blinds.</p>

<p>A live broadcast captured a CNN reporter in Brazil being mugged by a homeless man.</p>
<p>Bruna Macedo and her news crew were stationed near the Bandeiras Bridge in S&#227;o Paulo to report about the rising water level in the Tiet&#234; River due to heavy rainfall.</p>
<p>As Macedo was speaking to her anchor colleague, Rafael Colombo, the suspect was seen in the background, looking over the bridge barrier. He then walked towards Macedo, who greeted him while her coworker spoke about the flooding points in the city.</p>
<p>The man then pulled out a knife, which shocked Macedo. She took a few steps back and handed over her smartphone before the camera panned away and focused on the shot of the street. Macedo also handed over her second smartphone before the mugger left the scene. </p>

For Samsung, this has happened more than once. In 2018, the South Korean tech giant unintentionally dropped the launch video for the Galaxy S9 <a href="https://designtaxi.com/news/398431/Samsung-Galaxy-S9-Launch-Video-Goes-Online-A-Day-Ahead-Phone-s-Announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a mere day ahead</a> of the supposed debut.

The model was evidently not the Galaxy Note 8, and if <a href="https://bgr.com/2020/05/25/galaxy-note-20-plus-leak-design-update-camera/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">earlier leaks</a> are to be believed, the design instead matched that of the forthcoming Galaxy Note 20 Ultra instead.</p><p>The photos appeared to depict the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra in a &#8216;Mystic Bronze&#8217;, along with a camera configuration of three sensors aligned vertically on the left and the others on the right.</p><p>The listing was taken down shortly after it was discovered.</p><p>Samsung is only expected to announce the Galaxy Note 20 series during the Galaxy Unpacked event, which is speculated to take place virtually on 5 August. A less significant detail the rumor mill hasn&#8217;t fully agreed on is the name of the larger model; apart from Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, some are calling it the Galaxy Note 20+.</p><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Damn the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra accidentally got leaked &#128525;It looks so nice!

<p>When you&#8217;re dealt a bad hand at your next photoshoot, vexing won&#8217;t be an option. Simply keep your poker face on and get these playing cards out.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/travel9to5/photography-deck" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Photography Deck</a> is an intriguing and educational take on classic playing cards that intertwines card games with photography rules and methods. The set, designed by filmmaker <a href="https://travel9to5.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eric Bohring</a>, serves as a pocket-sized cheat sheet to help you shuffle new concepts into your photography work in a flash.</p>
<p>Here, the traditional suits&#8212;spades, hearts, clubs, and diamonds&#8212;are respectively replaced with the categories of Camera Basics, Composition, Technical Info, and Shooting Styles. Perhaps even more amusingly so, the court cards&#8212;King, Queen, Jack, and Joker&#8212;have been given cameras, too.</p>
<p>While novices might chance upon ideal photographic conditions now and then, this deck ensures you won&#8217;t have to take that gamble. Find out more about The Photography Deck, which is currently on Kickstarter mode, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/travel9to5/photography-deck" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

<p>An influencer has sparked outrage after <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CBP4BYmgtwx/">filming</a> a fitness workout near a religious ceremony.</p>
<p>In the footage, the blonde lady was spotted doing squats in a one-piece swimsuit while her friend filmed from the back. Both women appeared rather unconcerned about the nearby group of Balinese people, who were dressed in traditional clothing and seemed to be preparing for a ritual. The video was believed to have been recorded at a beach in Canggu, Bali.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/travel/news/article.cfm?c_id=7&amp;objectid=12340126">NZ Herald</a> reported that that the Balinese women were preparing for a ritual called Canang Sari, a daily offering by Balinese Hindus to thank &#8220;The Divine Order&#8221; Sang Widhi Wasa.</p>
<p>Social media users were unhappy seeing the tourists being disrespectful to the locals, and branded the two as &#8220;ignorant.&#8221;</p>

Luckily, Antoni Porowski, Bobby Berk, Jonathan Van Ness, Karamo Brown, and Tan France were here to make the gritty a little more pretty.</p><p>Gritty was nominated by Phillie Phanatic, the green bird mascot of the Phillies Major League Baseball team. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think Gritty needs to change a ton.

<p>Two Ryanair pilots are currently under investigation after a video of them operating a throttle lever of an aircraft using a rubber chicken surfaced online.</p>
<p>The air carrier criticized the &#8220;unprofessional&#8221; conduct of its pilots after watching the video of the pilots in the cockpit of the parked aircraft. The clip was said to have been filmed while passengers were boarding.</p>
<p>The pilots were playing with their toy, and one of them squeezed and used it to push the lever of the aircraft. The clip also showed rosary beads hanging from one of the levers inside the cockpit. </p>
<p>The scenes circulated online, prompting anger from internet users. &#8220;This is so unprofessional and makes me worry what else is going on in the cockpit. This is a terrible look for Ryanair,&#8221; one concerned user said,</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Ryanair said that the photos and video showed the crew was on the ground and in a parked aircraft. &#8220;While the images are unprofessional, the actions in them posed no risk and safety was never compromised,&#8221; they said. &#8220;We encourage our crew to enjoy their work, however, we expect them to remain professional at all times and we are investigating the matter further.&#8221;</p>

<p>TGI Fridays in the UK is reopening its doors to customers once again under a new brand identity and logo.</p>
<p>The restaurant now goes by a spanking new name: Fridays. With a &#8220;simplified&#8221; menu, the brand decided to drop its catchy TGI prefix that rolled off the tongue since the restaurant opened its doors in 1965. </p>
<p>Now known as &#8220;Fridays,&#8221; the company has also unveiled its new logo on its official Twitter account.</p>
<p>The new wordmark sees the removal of the letters &#8220;TGI&#8221; and the word &#8220;Fridays&#8221; housed in a decorative black border. The mobile logo, on the other hand, has more character as the brand is plastered against a red-and-white striped background.</p>
<p>The word &#8220;Fridays&#8221; is spelled out with a plain sans serif font. The social media avatar features the letter &#8220;F&#8221; in a black condensed border. According to <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_for_tgi_fridays_uk.php">Brand New</a>, the Fridays wordmark isn&#8217;t properly aligned inside the border, therefore it looks heavy on the left side.</p>
<p>According to the restaurant, the rebrand <a href="https://www.tgifridays.co.uk/famous-at-fridays/">aims</a> to bring back &#8220;that Fridays feeling&#8221; among consumers along with a brand new menu.</p>
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">New logo, new menu, new look! You may notice a few more changes happening &#8211; stay tuned to find out what else is coming &#128064;</p>

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">When try and fix something that isn&#8217;t broken&#8230; the Fridays I know and love is gone &#128546; logo looks like something I could have made on Paint&#8230;</p>

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Is this a poor joke? Have I missed the punchline because there is zero incentive to visit again. &#128557; Fridays at TGI will be no more.</p>

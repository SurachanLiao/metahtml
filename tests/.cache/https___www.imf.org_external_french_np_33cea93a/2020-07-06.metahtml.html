 <td width="70%">
 
 
 () 
 Parentheses may be used to change the order of the Boolean operators by searching for concept enclosed in the parenthesis first, resulting in a more advanced search strategy. 
 (international OR free) AND Trade 
The search engine first looks for documents with either "international" or "free" in the text, then looks at those documents containing the word "trade". 

Debt AND (restructuring NOT relief) 

The search engine first looks for documents with "restructuring", but no documents containing the word "relief". Last, it retrieves from the set of documents only the ones containing the word "debt". 

Tips:  
Always use the Boolean operator "AND" before or after the parentheses as shown. 
Do not use too many terms at once. Your search could be too specific thereby retrieving nothing.

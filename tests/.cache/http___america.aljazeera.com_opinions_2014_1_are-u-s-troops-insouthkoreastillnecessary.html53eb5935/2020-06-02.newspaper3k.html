Some 28,500 U.S. troops are based in South Korea under a mutual defense pact to deter against the North Korean threat. Secretary of State John Kerry announced in January that the U.S. will be sending another 800 troops.

<p>&#226;&#128;&#156;We remain fully committed to the defense of the Republic of Korea,&#226;&#128;&#157; Kerry explained, &#226;&#128;&#156;including through extended deterrence and putting the full range of U.S. military capabilities in place.&#226;&#128;&#157;</p>
<p>A day earlier, U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel <a href="http://www.defense.gov/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=16464" target="_blank">discussed</a> with Yun &#226;&#128;&#156;the importance of maintaining a robust combined defense of the Korean Peninsula as a strong deterrent against provocations from North Korea.&#226;&#128;&#157;</p>
<p>But how necessary is it, really, to continue to fight on one side of a stalemated civil war that has lasted for more than 60 years? Politicians in Washington insist it is in our vital national interest, but that is far from the truth.&#194;&#160;</p>
<p>The Korean War erupted after World War II, when the defeated Japanese empire, which had occupied the Korean Peninsula since 1895 (and fully annexed it in 1910), retreated. The United States and the then&#226;&#128;&#147;Soviet Union divided the peninsula in half, and two hostile states emerged. U.S. President Harry Truman intervened, without the consent of Congress, to try to defeat the northern communists. More than 2 million deaths later, an armistice agreement was signed in 1953, neither side the winner.&#194;&#160;</p>
<p>To this day, the U.S. backs South Korea. Washington has security guarantees with Seoul obligating the U.S to go to war against South Korea&#226;&#128;&#153;s enemies in the event conflict breaks out. Americans are told they must spend taxpayer money providing military aid and paying expensive operating costs for tens of thousands of U.S. troops so that South Korea is properly defended.</p>
<p>But Seoul can easily defend itself. South Korea&#226;&#128;&#153;s GDP is <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/country/korea-republic" target="_blank">$1.13 trillion</a>, versus North Korea&#226;&#128;&#153;s paltry <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/kn.html" target="_blank">$40 billion</a>, with similar disparities in the sizes of their respective defense budgets.</p>
<p>The brutal authoritarian regime of North Korea is made out to be a major threat to its neighbors, but it is comparatively weak, lacking the kind of advanced industrial and technological military capacity of its southern neighbor and, certainly, the U.S. Experts consider Pyongyang <a href="http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2013/10/7/north-korea-warnsusofdisastrousconsequencesaftermilitaryexercise.html" target="_blank">unfit to fight an extended modern battle</a>.</p>
<p>Contrary to the rhetoric that justifies continued U.S. meddling in a civil war that is none of our business, the U.S. military presence in South Korea is not about deterring North Korea. More accurately, it is about maintaining U.S. military dominance in the Asia-Pacific region.</p>
<p>As a January 2013 Congressional Research Service <a href="http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/R42077.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> (PDF) explained, the U.S. has sought &#226;&#128;&#156;to have a world-wide, continuous global military presence,&#226;&#128;&#157; in order to preserve the extraordinary military and economic superiority it had at the end of World War II.</p>
<p>Throughout the postwar period, Washington has maintained a constant naval presence throughout the Asia-Pacific region as well as military bases in Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Guam and, as of 2011, Australia. Washington even backed dictators in Indonesia and fought a disastrous war in Vietnam to help demonstrate its projection of power in the region.</p>

East Asia Tribune, the online publication that gives you stories such as China to hand back Hong Kong to the UK; China to introduce "alternate breathing days" where the population will be divided in two with one half being able to breath on even numbered days and the other on the odd numbered days!

The source given in the PattayaOne article is a well known satire paper in China.

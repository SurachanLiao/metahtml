Natanz Central Mosque (Masjid-e Jameh) is located near Sheikh Abdol Samad Isfahani Tomb in the city of Natanz in Iran's Isfahan province. This four-iwan central mosque is one of the best preserved of all Ilkhanid-era buildings, dating from the early 14th century. Look out for the very worn, but intricately carved wooden door at the entrance to the mosque.

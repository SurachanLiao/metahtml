Malaysian officials have detained a woman holding a Vietnamese passport in connection with the death of the half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The woman was traveling under the name Doan Thi Huong and had returned to the airport in an attempt to catch a flight to Vietnam Wednesday morning local time.

General of Police Tan Sri Khalid Abu Bakar said she is the same woman shown on surveillance footage.

“She was in possession of a Socialist Republic of Vietnam travel document,” Khalid said in a statement, adding that the “suspect was positively identified from the CCTV footage at the airport and was alone at the time of the arrest,” Khalid said in a statement.

South Korea’s spy agency said earlier in the day that it suspects two female North Korean agents assassinated the estranged half-brother of the North Korean leader on Tuesday and that there are others involved that are on the run.

The 46-year-old older brother, who at one time branded his little brother’s regime a ‘joke’, died on his way to hospital after being poisoned.

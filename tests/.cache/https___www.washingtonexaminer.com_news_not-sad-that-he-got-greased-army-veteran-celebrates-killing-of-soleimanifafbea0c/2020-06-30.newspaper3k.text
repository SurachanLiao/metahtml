A Gulf War veteran and journalist said that he was not upset “a damn bit” that the United States killed Qassem Soleimani.

Mike Glenn, a reporter for the Washington Times who served as an officer during the Gulf War, condemned Soleimani and his attacks on the United States in a viral tweet on Friday.

“I'm a reporter but I was a Soldier for several years and led a platoon of cavalry troops into combat in Iraq,” Glenn said. “Qassim Solemani was directly responsible for the deaths of scores of American military personnel in Iraq.

“I'm not sad that he got greased. Not a damn bit,” Glenn added.

Soleimani, 62, was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Baghdad on Friday, along with Abu Mahdi al Muhandis, who led the Iranian-backed Popular Mobilization Forces.

Soleimani was responsible for the deaths of more than 600 U.S. troops during the Iraq War as the commander of the Quds Force, a branch of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps responsible for special operations in other countries.

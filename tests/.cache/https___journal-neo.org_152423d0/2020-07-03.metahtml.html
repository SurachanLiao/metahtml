					<p>With tectonic changes, reflected largely through a massive decline in Saudi influence, taking place within the &#8216;Muslim world&#8217;, a potent struggle for new dominance has already begun. The symbolic and actual battlefield is Libya, gateway to a big part of the Muslim world in Africa. While a number of countries&#8212;Egypt, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Russia, France&#8212;are involved directly&#8230;</p>

					<p>Despite international community&#8217;s efforts to resolve the Libyan conflict via peaceful&#160;means, it is intensifying and new participants are becoming embroiled in it. On June 21, while inspecting Egyptian Armed Forces of Western Military Region stationed in the Sidi Barrani air base, located near the border with Libya, President of Egypt Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi told the troops to &#8220;be prepared to carry out any&#8230;</p>

					<p>For the Southeast Asian state of Myanmar, the decision to expand ties with China despite Western pressure was a no-brainer. Significant economic ties have been expanded and the prospect for several large-scale infrastructure projects have been firmed up. Chinese President Xi Jinping&#8217;s recent visit to Myanmar could be considered a victory lap of sorts; the cementing of long-standing&#8230;</p>

					<p>For now, many countries worldwide are still under siege from the Coronavirus, threatening millions of lives. However, it is leaving a much different mark, for instance, in the Indo-Pacific Region. Even before the pandemic hit, it had been far from smooth sailing in the area due to a number of disputes and conflicting interests between regional players, for whom&#8230;</p>

					<p>In general terms, relations between the world&#8217;s two leading powers, despite the strain in recent months (which, in the author&#8217;s view, is almost exclusively down to the intensifying political climate within the United States), now and then are illuminated by glimmers of positivity. This gives us cause to hope that the situation between both of the&#8230;</p>

					<p>Politicians and experts have been discussing the presence of a deep crisis within North Atlantic Alliance for many decades. It may seem purely symbolic, however France has pointed out the existence of a crisis on multiple occasions: first in 1966, when Charles de Gaulle decided to withdraw France from the military integrated structures of NATO, and then when the alliance&#8217;s headquarters&#8230;</p>

					<p>Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which without warning began ravaging our planet, some important issues have been put on hold. However, they will have to be resolved sooner or later. One of them is the water scarcity problem. In fact, some scientists and experts believe that it may lead to wars, which could cause more deaths than the Coronavirus pandemic. It is common&#8230;</p>

					<p>Donald Trump is finished. He&#8217;s gone halfway to destroying the office of President of the United States. The &#8220;deep state&#8221; he swore he would eradicate, they&#8217;re massaging the shoulders of truth killer Joe Biden as if to ready him like a has-been boxer about to emerge from a sweaty arena tunnel of American politics. But nobody is talking about the 2020 endgame&#8230;</p>

					<p>Australia and Oceania, just as other regions of the planet, have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The first novel Coronavirus case was recorded in Australia (Melbourne) on January 25, 2020, and then the disease began to spread rapidly throughout the region. At the end of February, New Zealand reported its first infection. Numerous island nations of Oceania rushed&#8230;</p>

					<p>Given the way the US-European alliance is falling apart rapidly, there is little to no denying that some tectonic changes of global level are likely to take place, paving the way for a kind of multipolar world order to emerge where the US ability to influence the world will decrease massively.

Then she enrolled at the Lewisville Learning Center. She’s graduating from high school this summer.</ins></p> <p>Brooke Ronk was about 4 years old when her parents split up. Since then, she and her mother have bounced around, living with relatives or at a hotel. They finally had their own home in Dallas. But then she discovered her mother’s drug problem. Ronk dropped out of high school. Three months later, the 18-year­-old enrolled at the Lewisville Learning Center. She’s graduating from high school this summer and wants to become a forensic psychologist. She lives with her sister in The Colony.</p> <p>A year ago, when my mom and I had been living in an apartment on our own, she had started up drug use. Things got really rough. I could see my mom going downhill. She pretty much lost everything we had owned all together, and I always ended up trying to have to find a place.</p> <p>My mom is the one who actually took me away from school and decided that I wouldn’t be able to get back into high school. I didn’t think I would graduate; I didn’t think I would have a good job. I thought everything was disappearing. It was a really difficult time. It kind of hurt a lot being unenrolled, not knowing what was going to happen next or who I was going to be around.</p> <p>I started going to the Lewisville Learning Center the day that I turned 18. It was actually a really great thing; it was nice to start school again. I was still having issues finding where to live when I started at the Learning Center. It was iffy about where I was staying; it would either be at my sister’s house or between friends from Lewisville across from where the school is.</p> <p>I did have a lot of anxiety problems whenever I couldn’t figure out where I was going to stay on certain nights or how I was going to be getting to school or if I would even being going home that night—to a home—and I always had to come up with something—like make 1,000 phone calls, any family that I could stay with possibly.</p> <p>Knowing that I’m going through school now and going to get a diploma is really calming, knowing that I’m probably going to be able to get in a better place. After all that’s happened with my mom, I still want to help her because she’s my mom, and no matter what, she’s always going to be my mom.</p> <p>I can’t push her out of my life even though she had tried to push me and my sister out of hers. It’s nice knowing that’s she’s going to have someone there.</p> <p>Read the entire Homeless in High School series <a href="http://stories.kera.org/homeless-in-high-school/" target="_blank">here</a>. </p> <p class="robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon-text sd-sharing"><ins></ins></p><h3 class="sd-title"><ins>Share this story with a friend:</ins></h3><ul><li class="share-facebook"><ins><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" class="share-facebook sd-button share-icon" href="https://www.texasstandard.org/stories/stories-of-homelessness-brooke-ronk/?share=facebook" target="_blank" title="Click to share on Facebook"><span>Facebook</span> Link: https://www.texasstandard.org/stories/stories-of-homelessness-brooke-ronk/?share=facebook </a></ins></li><li class="share-twitter"><ins><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" class="share-twitter sd-button share-icon" href="https://www.texasstandard.org/stories/stories-of-homelessness-brooke-ronk/?share=twitter" target="_blank" title="Click to share on Twitter"><span>Twitter</span> Link: https://www.texasstandard.org/stories/stories-of-homelessness-brooke-ronk/?share=twitter </a></ins></li><li class="share-email"><ins><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" class="share-email sd-button share-icon" href="https://www.texasstandard.org/stories/stories-of-homelessness-brooke-ronk/?share=email" target="_blank" title="Click to email this to a friend"><span>Email</span> Link: https://www.texasstandard.org/stories/stories-of-homelessness-brooke-ronk/?share=email </a></ins></li></ul><ins> </ins><p class="widget_container"><ins></ins></p><h3><ins>More from 06/19/2015</ins></h3><ul class="wpp-list"><li class="  "><h4 class="align-right"><ins><a href="https://www.texasstandard.org/stories/what-if-houston-were-to-get-a-live-dinosaur-theme-park/">What if Houston Were to Get A Live Dinosaur Theme Park?

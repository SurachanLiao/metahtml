<div><p>I hope Brad Jackson wasn&#8217;t too disappointed, not only by all the ways I found to say, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; but also by my questioning of much of the nonsense stories that so many &#8220;news&#8221; and listicle sites have propagated&#160;about North Korea lately. If you &#8220;know&#8221; less by the end of the interview than at the beginning, I&#8217;ll feel that I&#8217;ve done some good. The proliferation of so much superficial nonsense must be more than&#160;a function of its inexhaustible supply....</p>

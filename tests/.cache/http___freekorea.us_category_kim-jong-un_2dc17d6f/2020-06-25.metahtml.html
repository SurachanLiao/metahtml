				<h2 class="post-title">Does Kim Jong-un consciously imitate Dr. Evil?</h2>

									<p>As I contemplate both the competence and the incompetence with which North Korea (probably) executed the murder of Kim Jong-nam, I can&#8217;t help reflecting on how it often seems to combine the guile and ruthlessness of SPECTRE with the executive competence of Dr. Evil. On one hand, the plot worked with ruthless efficiency. The target is dead. A potential Pu Yi is removed from the scene, and its terrorist objectives have been successful, at least in part. The South Korean...</p>

									<p>The reasons why North Korea is holding a party congress are still a matter of conjecture to those of us fortunate enough not to live there. The congress is almost certainly related to Kim Jong-un&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s consolidation of power in some way. It will probably reinforce the personality cult. The regime&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s organization charts and wiring diagrams may be rearranged. Pessimists suspect that there will be more bloody purges or another nuclear test.

									<p>South Korea&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s Foreign Minister, Yun Byung-se, believes that Pyongyang is increasingly isolated. He believes that&#194;&#160;this is causing it &#226;&#8364;&#339;more distress this year than any other time,&#8221; and that Kim Jong-un&#194;&#160;will redouble his efforts&#194;&#160;to break that isolation this year. There are reasons to be skeptical of Yun&#8217;s statement. First, South Korea, having nominally signed on to a policy of pressuring Pyongyang to disarm without actually complying with that policy itself, must want to world to think that it&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s sufficient&#194;&#160;for everyone else...</p>

				<h2 class="post-title">Stage Five Watch</h2>

									<p>Over the last year, this site has carefully tracked reports about the popularity or (more often) the unpopularity of Kim Jong-Un. Throughout the summer and fall of this year, numerous reports have suggested the existence of discontent &#8212; however latent, unfocused, spontaneous, and unorganized &#8212;&#160; among North Korea&#8217;s youth, within the elites, and even inside the military. Three recent&#160;reports have added to this evidence. A North Korean defector said Pyongyang&#8217;s Workers&#8217; Party is &#8220;imploding&#8221; due to Kim Jong Un&#8217;s inconsistent...</p>

The Cuban crisis has been in my thoughts recently because of how it compares to the Korean nuclear crisis as it is today, and how it will be in January 2017. While most attention is on Iran, the consensus is quietly shifting to the view that North Korea is at the verge&#160;of nuclear breakout. Furthermore, President Obama...</p>

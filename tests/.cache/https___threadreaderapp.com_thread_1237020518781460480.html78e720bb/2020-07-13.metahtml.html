If we want to understand how powerful an opponent SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is, let&#226;&#128;&#153;s take a look what has been required to stop it in China. The Chinese government has essentially used a social nuclear weapon in its efforts. Let&#226;&#128;&#153;s talk about this, to understand what US is facing. <span class="nop nop-end"> 1/</span>

The Chinese have had the most COVID19 cases so far (80,859), but the number of new cases has dropped from 100's per day a month ago to ~46 per day now &#226;&#128;&#148; in a country of 1.4B people. This is an astonishing achievement from a public health point of view. <a class="entity-url" href="https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200308-sitrep-48-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=16f7ccef_4">who.int/docs/default-s&#226;&#128;&#166;</a> <span class="nop nop-end"> 2/</span>

We can get a sense of how strong something is by getting a sense of what sort of force is required to stop it, to borrow a Newtonian physics metaphor. COVID-19 requires a powerful force to stop. This is clear from the Chinese response. <span class="nop nop-end"> 3/</span>

Of course, China has a collectivist culture and an authoritarian government, both of which have allowed this enormous, widespread response. It is well suited to fight a pandemic, if it indeed takes in factual information and responds rationally.

Ably assisted by some Chinese students in my lab <a class="entity-hashtag" href="/hashtag/HNL">#HNL</a>, we quantified what Chinese government has been able to achieve. Beginning January 23, they imposed movement restrictions (typically with people staying at home, leaving just once a week) on provinces with &gt;930M people! <span class="nop nop-end"> 5/</span>

</p><p id="tweet_6" class="content-tweet allow-preview" dir="auto">
The imposition of such public health measures on such a scale for such a duration has never been seen before. Here are links to the websites for many of the provinces into which China is divided, indicating what the rules for movement, imposed on 930M people, have been. 6/

Most Chinese cities are still implementing these types of quarantine at the community-level, now over *six weeks* in, depending on the severity level of the situation in their cities. This is called "closed-off management" &#229;&#176;&#129;&#233;&#151;&#173;&#231;&#174;&#161;&#231;&#144;&#134; by the government and media). <span class="nop nop-end"> 7/</span>

</p><p id="tweet_8" class="content-tweet allow-preview" dir="auto">
Common features of "closed-off management&#226;&#128;&#157; include: movement of people &amp; vehicles is checked with an exit-entrance permit; body temperature at entrance of community is checked; disinfection of vehicles; food delivery; permits for only one person per household to go out. <span class="nop nop-end"> 8/</span>

The licenses for personal travel in China, being used by many millions of people, look like this. Some of them have a slogan &#226;&#128;&#156;It is everyone&#226;&#128;&#153;s responsibility to fight the virus.&#226;&#128;&#157; 10/  

</p><p id="tweet_10" class="content-tweet allow-preview" dir="auto">
In many cities, workers have been organized on a vast scale to deliver food to homes; residents can only go out to shop if they have a permit; &amp; shops are open at limited times. In Chongqing, for example, only one person per household can go out shopping, only occasionally. <span class="nop nop-end"> 11/</span>

Schools have moved online. Jokes circulate: Parents complain to upstairs neighbors: "Could you please have your kids stop jumping? It is too noisy and our kids are taking an online math class now.&#226;&#128;&#157; The neighbors reply: "Oh sorry! But my kids are taking a sports class now.&#226;&#128;&#157; <span class="nop nop-end"> 12/</span>

As a result, the Chinese have dropped the Re (the Effective Reproductive Rate) of COVID19 from ~3.8 new cases per extant case to ~0.32. When this number is below 1.0, the epidemic extinguishes (at least it will, for a while, within China). <a class="entity-url" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.03.20030593v1">medrxiv.org/content/10.110&#226;&#128;&#166;</a> <span class="nop nop-end"> 13/</span>

My lab, <a class="entity-hashtag" href="/hashtag/HNL">#HNL</a>, has been studying this topic in another way, along with Chinese collaborators. We are also developing forecasting tools.

The Chinese government is slowly beginning to lift restrictions, but it is continuing to implement many quite inventive procedures, on a large scale. For instance, elevators in a Beijing building only allow four people at a time, as marked by tape on the floor. 15/  

</p><p id="tweet_15" class="content-tweet allow-preview" dir="auto">
The sign in the elevator says: "No more than four people in the elevator. Please be patient and wait for the next elevator.&#226;&#128;&#157; Below, it says "Let's unite together to fight the virus in this special period." This type of collectivist slogan is very common throughout China now. 16/

Currently, some provinces are adjusting their emergency level downwards according to their risk-level evaluations. As of March 2, 7 provinces adjusted to second-level, 9 provinces to third-level, 4 provinces to just the within-province emergency level. <a class="entity-url" href="http://www.bjnews.com.cn/news/2020/03/02/697916.html">bjnews.com.cn/news/2020/03/0&#226;&#128;&#166;</a> <span class="nop nop-end"> 17/</span>

China has a collectivist culture and an authoritarian government, so its success fighting COVID-19, while deeply impressive, will not be easy to reproduce elsewhere. The USA must prepare to combat the virus using tools at its disposal. It will not be easy. <span class="nop nop-end"> 18/</span>

Another example of social distancing, widely employed in China, thanks to <a class="entity-mention" href="https://twitter.com/aoziparis">@aoziparis</a>. This is a photo from Henan province, just to the north of Hubei, one month ago. Shoppers, when they are allowed out, wait in a line, 1.5m away from each other, before entering grocery store. 20/

Working with industry, Chinese authorities encouraged delivery companies to distribute goods, and the companies vouched that their drivers were wearing masks and did not have a fever. The app used noted such details as the driver approach. 22/

As workers in China return to offices, many systems are being put into place, such as at restaurants and cafeterias, to maintain social distancing. These include rules to eat fast, one-person-to-a-table, cardboard dividers, and admonitions not to talk to each other. 24/

Gallows humor prevails among Chinese coping w COVID19. Re procedures now in use for eating out, many are saying "This one table per person experience reminds me of my old school days while taking exams."

In China, apparently the young were more concerned initially about COVID19 than the old, who were nonchalant. Images like this circulated. It's good not to panic or be alarmist; but it's also good not to be complacent. <a class="entity-hashtag" href="/hashtag/gallowshumor">#gallowshumor</a> 30/

Religion and the Buddhist tradition were enlisted, too, emphasizing civic duty.

Many millions of Chinese have not forgotten Dr. Li Wenliang who first sounded the alarm and was ignored and called before the police to be accused of "rumor mongering" (lest we forget the authoritarianism of China). He ultimately died of COVID19. <a class="entity-url" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-51403795">bbc.com/news/world-asi&#226;&#128;&#166;</a> <span class="nop nop-end"> 32/</span>

How Beijing reframed the coronavirus narrative. I&#226;&#128;&#153;ve been very clear re China&#226;&#128;&#153;s government being authoritarian and its failings.

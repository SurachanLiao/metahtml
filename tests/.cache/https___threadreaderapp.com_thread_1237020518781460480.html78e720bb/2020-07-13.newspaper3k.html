Many smart scientists are working full time to assemble such data and fill in holes in data we have. <p class="nop nop-end"> 2/</p></p>
<p class="content-tweet">Given all the data uncertainties, reasonable estimates for the case fatality ratio (CFR) of COVID19 in the general U.S. population could be between 0.05% (half as deadly as the flu) to 1% (ten times as deadly as the flu), according to Ioannidis! That's a huge range. <p class="nop nop-end"> 3/</p></p>

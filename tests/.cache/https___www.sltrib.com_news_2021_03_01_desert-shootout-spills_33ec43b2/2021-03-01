The shooting didn’t happen last year. And the officer wasn’t charged with killing the man.</div></div><div class="article-body-element"><div class="body-raw">This 2018 case involves a Colorado deputy, who now faces charges for firing through his windshield during a rolling shootout with men in an old Ford Tempo.</div></div><div class="article-body-element"><div class="body-raw">While no video footage exists of the chase or shooting, a Salt Lake Tribune review of police reports and interviews investigators conducted with the officer and a person in the other car offer an unusually detailed look at this chaotic case.</div></div><div class="article-body-element"><div class="body-raw">The chase ended less than a mile into Utah, when Sgt. Edward Oxley of the Montezuma County Sheriff’s Office blew out the Tempo’s tire and it crashed.</div></div><div class="article-body-element"><div class="body-raw">Inside the vehicle, Fordell Hill had just one bullet left. A passenger, Averill Beletso, said in his interview with investigators that Hill contemplated using it on himself, but instead fired one last shot at Oxley. It missed.</div></div><div data-testid="ad" style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center"><div id="sltrib-promo-2" style="width:300px;height:250px;background-color:#F7F7F7" class=""></div></div><div class="article-body-element"><div class="body-raw">Then the two got out of the car and on the ground, as ordered, but Hill moved as if to get up.</div></div><div class="article-body-element"><div class="body-raw">“Get down before I shoot,” Oxley warned. Hill reportedly responded, “You going to shoot me, shoot me.” Oxley fired twice with “no hesitation,” hitting Hill once, Beletso said. Hill’s empty gun was found 5 feet away from his body.</div></div><div class="article-body-element"><div class="body-raw">Hill died in Utah within the Navajo Nation. John Huber, the U.S. attorney for Utah, reviewed the case and found Oxley’s actions “negligent, even reckless.” He also decided the shooting was “unquestionably justified.” He declined to file charges.</div></div><div class="article-body-element"><div class="body-raw">But the shootout also took place in Colorado and that’s why the Colorado Bureau of Investigation got involved. In September 2020, prosecutors there charged Oxley, who has since been fired, with two felonies — an act that, <a href="https://www.cpr.org/2020/01/31/meth-guns-aggressive-tactics-combine-to-give-colorado-one-of-nations-highest-police-shooting-rates/">as in Colorado</a>, is exceedingly rare in Utah.</div></div><div class="article-body-element"><div class="body-raw">A Salt Lake Tribune database of police shootings shows that over the past decade, <a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/2020/06/28/only-utah-cops-faced/">only three other officers were charged</a> in connection with shooting at someone here, and none was convicted.</div></div><div data-testid="ad" style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center"><div id="sltrib-promo-3" style="width:300px;height:250px;background-color:#F7F7F7" class=""></div></div><div class="article-body-element"><div class="body-raw">That database also shows that since 2004, at least seven police shootings involved people of Indigenous descent. This represents 2% of the people police shot at, while Native Americans constitute <a href="https://gardner.utah.edu/wp-content/uploads/June2020CensusEstRacev2019.pdf">1% of the state’s population</a>. Those seven encounters were fatal, and three were within Indigenous nations. That includes the Hill shooting.</div></div><div class="article-body-element"><div class="body-raw">Oxley’s attorney did not respond to requests for comment, and the person who answered a call to a listed number for Beletso said he was not available.

As they drove their off-white sedan east, Oxley was driving west on patrol.</div></div><div class="article-body-element"><div class="body-raw">The cars passed each other near the Battle Rock Elementary School, and Oxley said he noticed the Tempo was missing a taillight and had a seemingly altered license plate.</div></div><div class="article-body-element"><div class="body-raw">He swung around and pulled the car over. The sergeant asked Fernando Hill for his license and registration, but all he had was an ID card. Fordell Hill, in the front passenger seat, gave Oxley a fake name and other phony information. Beletso gave his own name.</div></div><div class="article-body-element"><div class="body-raw">When Oxley asked if they had any outstanding warrants, Hill said he did, according to Beletso. Oxley went back to his car.</div></div><div data-testid="ad" style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center"><div id="sltrib-promo-4" style="width:300px;height:250px;background-color:#F7F7F7" class=""></div></div><div class="article-body-element"><div class="body-raw">Oxley told Colorado Bureau of Investigation agents in an interview nine months later that he saw Fordell Hill “protecting” a black backpack between his legs and got “a pretty good feeling these are bad guys.”</div></div><div class="article-body-element"><div class="body-raw">When he returned to his car with Fernando’s ID, he left his door “cocked open, because I got a feeling something’s going to go down,” he said.</div></div><div class="article-body-element"><div class="body-raw">In the Tempo, the friends were despairing. Hill pulled out a gun, said, “The only way is this,” and told his brother Fernando to “go, go, go. I’m wanted,” Beletso said.</div></div><div class="article-body-element"><div class="body-raw">Beletso said he didn’t know what charge Hill was wanted on, but court records show that on Jan. 25, 2018 he was released from the Salt Lake County jail, where he’d been held on a stabbing at the downtown Salt Lake City Library. He had reached a plea deal and was released until sentencing, but by the time he was pulled over, he had already missed an appointment with Utah Adult Probation &amp; Parole.</div></div><div class="article-body-element"><div class="body-raw">Fernando peeled out and headed back toward the state line. Oxley decided to follow.</div></div><div data-testid="ad" style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center"><div id="sltrib-promo-cadf28ff-d0c6-4c09-b116-4688c791f7cf" style="width:300px;height:250px;background-color:#F7F7F7" class=""></div></div><div class="article-body-element"><div class="body-raw">After two cars passed the school again, Hill leaned out of the passenger side window and shot at Oxley.</div></div><div class="article-body-element"><div class="body-raw">“My immediate reaction was to draw my gun, go out the window, and fire a few rounds at him, which is obviously ineffective,” the sergeant told CBI investigators.</div></div><div class="article-body-element"><div class="body-raw">Next, Oxley fired through his own windshield. He said he saw Beletso looking back at him during the chase and “having a good time.”</div></div><div class="article-body-element"><div class="body-raw">Beletso, by contrast, told CBI agents he was curled in a ball in the backseat. “I was just lying there, praying, praying, praying don’t let me get shot,” he said. At one point, he glanced back, and thought they had lost Oxley.</div></div><div class="article-body-element"><div class="body-raw">The sergeant had switched from his handgun to his department-issued AR-15 mid-chase. He had pulled over to reload his rifle and then raced to catch up. When he did, he “punched a hole” through his broken windshield for better aim.</div></div><div data-testid="ad" style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center"><div id="sltrib-promo-18954eef-62d8-4803-ba73-a467a0c43061" style="width:300px;height:250px;background-color:#F7F7F7" class=""></div></div><div class="article-body-element"><div class="body-raw">“The bullets kept hitting the car,” Belesto recalled. As the chase approached the state line, demarcated by the <a href="https://www.loc.gov/item/2017687421/">abandoned Ismay Trading Post</a>, Oxley shot out one of the Tempo’s tires. The car slid, and Hill said he had been shot in the shoulder.</div></div><div class="article-body-element"><div class="body-raw">Hill’s brother Fernando, whom CBI agents tried to reach for an interview but were never able to, pulled the car over and jumped out as it was still coming to a stop. It hit a fence, and a small brush fire started.</div></div><div class="article-body-element"><div class="body-raw">Beletso said after the crash, while they were still in the car, Hill put the gun, which held his last bullet, underneath his chin. He said he didn’t want to go back to jail. “This is for me,” he said.</div></div><div class="article-body-element"><div class="body-raw">But then Oxley pulled up and took cover behind his vehicle. When Oxley “peeked” around the side, Hill fired his last bullet at him through the shot-out rear window.</div></div><div class="article-body-element"><div class="body-raw">“To this day, I don’t know why that round didn’t hit me,” Oxley told investigators.</div></div><div data-testid="ad" style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center"><div id="sltrib-promo-90c28f54-7906-4da5-a6c9-d773d5a003c5" style="width:300px;height:250px;background-color:#F7F7F7" class=""></div></div><div class="article-body-element"><div class="body-raw">Beletso and Hill then got out of the car and followed Oxley’s order to lay on the ground.

A student in one of my classes, with friends and family in Queens, told me that he knew personally of fifteen COVID-19 deaths in Queens alone (Elmhurst). New York City essentially leads the world right now in COVID-19 cases.</p><p>Somewhat lost in the shuffle as it always is, is the second-place case of New Jersey, where, apart from graduate school, I’ve lived all my life. You can turn on the TV to see what things are like in New York, but whether you see it there or not, things aren’t much different in Jersey: like New York, New Jersey is under siege. And “siege” is no metaphor. COVID-19 is an invading army–much more so than the Japanese, the Nazis, the Soviets, Al Qaeda, Saddam, or ISIS ever were–and we’re losing the battle to it. <a href="https://irfankhawajaphilosopher.com/2020/03/31/coronavirus-diary-26-new-jersey-under-siege/#more-20985" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">→</span></a></p></article> <article id="post-20975" class="post-20975 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-covid-19"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><ins>My babies are too young to read this now.

She posted this on Facebook, and was reluctant to have it posted publicly, describing it as more a “frustrated, heart-broken rant than a reasoned opinion.” But there’s been no paucity of reasoned opinions at this point. Every other commenter on her Facebook post has a story to tell about someone’s backsliding or refusing to comply with social distancing, the ban on gatherings, etc. If we’re going to break our health care workers and our health care facilities in this excruciating way, we should have the courage to watch it happen in real time.  <a href="https://irfankhawajaphilosopher.com/2020/03/30/coronavirus-diary-23-a-disdain-for-science/#more-20942" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">→</span> Link: https://irfankhawajaphilosopher.com/2020/03/30/coronavirus-diary-23-a-disdain-for-science/#more-20942 </a></ins></p></article><article id="post-20928" class="post-20928 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-covid-19 tag-acdc tag-coronavirus tag-covid-19"><p><ins><span>P</span>ERCHANCE he for whom this bell tolls may be so ill as that he knows not it tolls for him.</ins></p><p><ins>–John Donne, <a href="http://www.luminarium.org/sevenlit/donne/meditation17.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meditation XVII Link: http://www.luminarium.org/sevenlit/donne/meditation17.php </a></ins></p></article><article id="post-20917" class="post-20917 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-covid-19 tag-coronavirus tag-covid-19 tag-health-care tag-nursing tag-public-health"><p><ins>A viral video worth watching:</ins></p><p><ins>There are two ways of interpreting this video.  <a href="https://irfankhawajaphilosopher.com/2020/03/29/coronavirus-diary-22-im-breaking/#more-20917" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">→</span> Link: https://irfankhawajaphilosopher.com/2020/03/29/coronavirus-diary-22-im-breaking/#more-20917 </a></ins></p></article><article id="post-20904" class="post-20904 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-covid-19 tag-chris-sciabarra tag-coronavirus tag-covid-19 tag-covid-19-narratives tag-medicine"><p><ins>This is the second in my series of <a href="https://irfankhawajaphilosopher.com/covid19narrativeproject/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID-19 Narratives, Link: https://irfankhawajaphilosopher.com/covid19narrativeproject/ </a> by my dear friend <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Matthew_Sciabarra" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chris Sciabarra Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Matthew_Sciabarra </a>, sheltering in place in Brooklyn, New York. Though the series is primarily about what I called the “supply side” of the health care equation during this crisis, I wanted to run some posts that described the “demand side” as well, that is, what it’s like to be a patient during the pandemic. Particularly valuable about Chris’s post is how it illustrates the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic for people with serious medical conditions whose previously scheduled medical procedures have now been deemed “elective.” “Elective” in this context doesn’t mean “optional.” It means downgraded to second or third priority out of sheer, dire necessity: hospital beds, equipment, and personnel have to be left vacant or unused to absorb the overwhelming crush of COVID-19 patients we expect to see. And even at the center of the pandemic, we haven’t yet reached the peak of that crush. <a href="https://irfankhawajaphilosopher.com/2020/03/29/covid-19-narrative-2-chris-matthew-sciabarra/#more-20904" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">→</span> Link: https://irfankhawajaphilosopher.com/2020/03/29/covid-19-narrative-2-chris-matthew-sciabarra/#more-20904 </a></ins></p></article><article id="post-20891" class="post-20891 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-covid-19 tag-announcements tag-coronavirus tag-covid-19 tag-valley-hospital"><p><ins>Here’s some more you can do while locked down: donate to the <a href="https://www.valleyhospitalfoundation.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Valley Hospital Foundation Link: https://www.valleyhospitalfoundation.org/ </a>. <a href="https://www.valleyhealth.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Valley Hospital Link: https://www.valleyhealth.com/ </a> is at the epicenter of the COVID-19 crisis, in Ridgewood, New Jersey.</ins></p><p><ins><a href="https://irfankhawajaphilosopher.com/2020/03/28/coronavirus-diary-21-more-you-can-do-while-locked-down/#more-20891" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">→</span> Link: https://irfankhawajaphilosopher.com/2020/03/28/coronavirus-diary-21-more-you-can-do-while-locked-down/#more-20891 </a></ins></p></article><article id="post-20882" class="post-20882 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-covid-19 tag-coronavirus tag-covid-19 tag-donald-trump tag-emergencies tag-ems tag-suleman-khawaja tag-valley-hospital"><p><ins>From a <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2020/03/trumps-statements-about-the-coronavirus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">list of Donald Trump’s statements on the COVID-19 crisis Link: https://www.factcheck.org/2020/03/trumps-statements-about-the-coronavirus/ </a>:</ins></p><blockquote><p><ins>Jan. 22: “We have it totally under control. It’s one person coming in from China.

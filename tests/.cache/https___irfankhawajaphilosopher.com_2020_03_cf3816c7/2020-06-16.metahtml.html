A student in one of my classes, with friends and family in Queens, told me that he knew personally of fifteen COVID-19 deaths in Queens alone (Elmhurst). New York City essentially leads the world right now in COVID-19 cases.</p><p>Somewhat lost in the shuffle as it always is, is the second-place case of New Jersey, where, apart from graduate school, I&#8217;ve lived all my life. You can turn on the TV to see what things are like in New York, but whether you see it there or not, things aren&#8217;t much different in Jersey: like New York, New Jersey is under siege. And &#8220;siege&#8221; is no metaphor. COVID-19 is an invading army&#8211;much more so than the Japanese, the Nazis, the Soviets, Al Qaeda, Saddam, or ISIS ever were&#8211;and we&#8217;re losing the battle to it. <a href="https://irfankhawajaphilosopher.com/2020/03/31/coronavirus-diary-26-new-jersey-under-siege/#more-20985" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a></p></article><article id="post-20975" class="post-20975 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-covid-19"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

Apparently, the Indian government <a href="https://www.travelandleisure.com/travel-news/india-repurposing-empty-train-carriages-coronavirus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has decided to re-purpose railway cars as medical facilities</a>. This particular idea seems to be the successor to an earlier one, described in a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6933430/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent paper</a> in the Bulletin of the World Health Organization.  <a href="https://irfankhawajaphilosopher.com/2020/03/31/coronavirus-diary-24-peace-trains/#more-20954" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a></p></article><article id="post-20942" class="post-20942 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-covid-19 tag-coronavirus tag-covid-19 tag-ethics tag-jessica-franklin tag-valley-hospital"><p>A plea from my sister-in-law, <a href="https://www.valleyhealth.com/doctors/jessica-c-franklin-md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jessica Franklin, MD</a>, of <a href="https://www.valleyhealth.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Valley Hospital</a> in Ridgewood, New Jersey. She posted this on Facebook, and was reluctant to have it posted publicly, describing it as more a &#8220;frustrated, heart-broken rant than a reasoned opinion.&#8221; But there&#8217;s been no paucity of reasoned opinions at this point. Every other commenter on her Facebook post has a story to tell about someone&#8217;s backsliding or refusing to comply with social distancing, the ban on gatherings, etc. If we&#8217;re going to break our health care workers and our health care facilities in this excruciating way, we should have the courage to watch it happen in real time.&#160; <a href="https://irfankhawajaphilosopher.com/2020/03/30/coronavirus-diary-23-a-disdain-for-science/#more-20942" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a></p></article><article id="post-20928" class="post-20928 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-covid-19 tag-acdc tag-coronavirus tag-covid-19"><p><span>P</span>ERCHANCE he for whom this bell tolls may be so ill as that he knows not it tolls for him.</p><p>&#8211;John Donne, <a href="http://www.luminarium.org/sevenlit/donne/meditation17.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meditation XVII</a></p></article><article id="post-20917" class="post-20917 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-covid-19 tag-coronavirus tag-covid-19 tag-health-care tag-nursing tag-public-health"><p>A viral video worth watching:</p><p>There are two ways of interpreting this video.  <a href="https://irfankhawajaphilosopher.com/2020/03/29/coronavirus-diary-22-im-breaking/#more-20917" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a></p></article><article id="post-20904" class="post-20904 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-covid-19 tag-chris-sciabarra tag-coronavirus tag-covid-19 tag-covid-19-narratives tag-medicine"><p>This is the second in my series of <a href="https://irfankhawajaphilosopher.com/covid19narrativeproject/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID-19 Narratives,</a> by my dear friend <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Matthew_Sciabarra" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chris Sciabarra</a>, sheltering in place in Brooklyn, New York. Though the series is primarily about what I called the &#8220;supply side&#8221; of the health care equation during this crisis, I wanted to run some posts that described the &#8220;demand side&#8221; as well, that is, what it&#8217;s like to be a patient during the pandemic. Particularly valuable about Chris&#8217;s post is how it illustrates the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic for people with serious medical conditions whose previously scheduled medical procedures have now been deemed &#8220;elective.&#8221; &#8220;Elective&#8221; in this context doesn&#8217;t mean &#8220;optional.&#8221; It means downgraded to second or third priority out of sheer, dire necessity: hospital beds, equipment, and personnel have to be left vacant or unused to absorb the overwhelming crush of COVID-19 patients we expect to see. And even at the center of the pandemic, we haven&#8217;t yet reached the peak of that crush. <a href="https://irfankhawajaphilosopher.com/2020/03/29/covid-19-narrative-2-chris-matthew-sciabarra/#more-20904" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a></p></article><article id="post-20891" class="post-20891 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-covid-19 tag-announcements tag-coronavirus tag-covid-19 tag-valley-hospital"><p>Here&#8217;s some more you can do while locked down: donate to the <a href="https://www.valleyhospitalfoundation.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Valley Hospital Foundation</a>. <a href="https://www.valleyhealth.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Valley Hospital</a> is at the epicenter of the COVID-19 crisis, in Ridgewood, New Jersey.</p><p> <a href="https://irfankhawajaphilosopher.com/2020/03/28/coronavirus-diary-21-more-you-can-do-while-locked-down/#more-20891" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a></p></article><article id="post-20882" class="post-20882 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-covid-19 tag-coronavirus tag-covid-19 tag-donald-trump tag-emergencies tag-ems tag-suleman-khawaja tag-valley-hospital"><p>From a <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2020/03/trumps-statements-about-the-coronavirus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">list of Donald Trump&#8217;s statements on the COVID-19 crisis</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Jan. 22:&#160;&#8220;We have it totally under control.&#160;It&#8217;s one person coming in from China.

Matter is indestructible, it changes its forms, but it cannot cease to exist. It is only a living organism that faces a constant alternative: the issue of life or death.

Now imagine that the hero of the piece is not a shadowy figure like John Galt but the functional (not moral) equivalent of Dr. Robert Stadler. Now imagine that a retreat to Galt&#8217;s Gulch is a physical impossibility. If, for some readers, this requires a re-conceptualization of how the world works, maybe a lot of other things do, too.  <a href="https://irfankhawajaphilosopher.com/2020/03/28/coronavirus-diary-19-this-isnt-john-galt-speaking/#more-20875" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a></p></article></section></div>

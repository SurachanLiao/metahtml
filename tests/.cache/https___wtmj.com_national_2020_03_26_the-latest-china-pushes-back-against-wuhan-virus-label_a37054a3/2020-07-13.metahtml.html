</p><p>By The Associated Press</p><p>The Latest on the coronavirus pandemic. The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people, but for some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death.</p><p>TOP OF THE HOUR:</p><p>&#8212; China pushes back against &#8220;Wuhan virus&#8221; label.</p><p>&#8212; Health minister in Romania resigns.</p><p>&#8212; France evacuates coronavirus patients on medicalized train.</p><p>___</p><p>BEIJING &#8212; China is strongly pushing back on U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo&#8217;s insistence on referring to the deadly novel coronavirus that has sparked a global pandemic as the &#8220;Wuhan virus&#8221; after the city in China where it was first detected.</p><p>Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Thursday that it was an effort to &#8220;stigmatize China and discredit China&#8217;s efforts in an attempt to divert attention and shift responsibilities.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;He has a very sinister motive,&#8221; Geng told reporters at a daily briefing.</p><p>Geng also defended China&#8217;s efforts at tackling the virus and denied it was seeking to place responsibility for the outbreak elsewhere. China has been accused of trying to squelch information about the outbreak during its early stages, and some of its diplomats have openly suggested that the virus may have been brought to China from the United States.</p><p>Pompeo&#8217;s call for the virus to be identified by name as the &#8220;Wuhan virus&#8221; at a virtual meeting of foreign ministers from the Group of 7 leading industrialized countries resulted in their opting against releasing a group statement.</p><p>The World Health Organization and others have cautioned against giving the virus a geographic name because of its global nature, and even President Donald Trump has steered away from those terms as critics have said they foster discriminatory sentiments and behavior against Asians and Asian Americans.</p><p>___</p><p>BUCHAREST, Romania &#8212; Romania&#8217;s prime minister has announced the resignation of the health minister, whose announcement that everyone in the capital city of Bucharest would be tested for the coronavirus had been strongly criticized.</p><p>Prime Minister Ludovic Orban said Thursday in a statement that while he regretted Victor Costache&#8217;s departure, &#8220;on the other hand, I understand it and I thank him.&#8221;</p><p>Orban said the government&#8217;s priority was to acquire protective equipment for hospitals to protect medical staff.</p><p>Romania has registered 906 coronavirus cases, with 17 deaths.</p><p>___</p><p>PARIS &#8212; France has begun evacuating its citizens infected with the coronavirus from the Alsace epicenter onboard a special medicalized high-speed train.</p><p>France&#8217;s health minister said that the TGV train-cum-hospital is a &#8220;first in Europe.&#8221;</p><p>Around 20 patients are being evacuated from Strasbourg to hospitals in the Pays-de-la-Loire and other regions Thursday morning, thanks to the medical locomotive.</p><p>It consists of five cars, each one kitted out with medical material and attended by an anesthesiologist-resuscitator, an intern, a nurse anesthetist and three nurses.</p><p>The train has been employed to relieve the French region worst hit by the coronavirus that has already claimed over 1,300 lives in France &#8212; almost half of whom have died in the Grand Est region&#8217;s hospitals.</p><p>___</p><p>MOSCOW &#8212; Russia&#8217;s Defense Ministry promised to build 16 medical centers for treating infectious diseases by mid-May amid the growing coronavirus outbreak in the country. The centers will be spread across a range of Russian regions, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said at a government meeting Thursday.</p><p>&#8220;We need to ensure the fastest construction of these centers in order for our military medicine to be ready to deal with the (coronavirus) infection,&#8221; Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said.</p><p>Russia has ramped up measures to prevent the new virus from spreading further as its caseload grew at an increasing pace. Earlier on Thursday, the government announced halting all international flights except for those bringing Russian nationals home from abroad. On Wednesday, President Vladimir Putin declared next week a holiday, during which only essential businesses &#8211; such as grocery shops, pharmacies and banks &#8211; will operate.</p><p>Russian authorities reported 840 cases of the new coronavirus on Thursday, with 182 new cases registered since the day before.</p><p>___</p><p>ANKARA, Turkey &#8212; Turkey&#8217;s trade minister says the country is restricting the export of respirator-related medical equipment in order to meet domestic needs.</p><p>Ruhsar Pekcan said on Twitter Thursday that the export of equipment including ventilators, intubation devices and intensive care monitors would be subject to government authorization.</p><p>The measure aims to ensure that a &#8220;disruption to the health services does not occur and the existing capacity is used effectively,&#8221; the minister said.</p><p>Turkey has reported 59 COVID-19 deaths and at least 2,433 infections.</p><p>___</p><p>MOSCOW &#8212; Moscow officials on Thursday ordered to close restaurants, cafes, bars, shopping malls and some parks in the city for nine days starting from Saturday.</p><p>The move, aimed at keeping people at home amid the coronavirus outbreak, comes a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin declared next week a holiday, during which only essential businesses &#8212; such as pharmacies, grocery stores and banks &#8212; will continue to operate.</p><p>The number of coronavirus cases in Russia has been growing rapidly this week. Russian authorities reported 840 cases of the new coronavirus on Thursday, with 182 new cases registered since the day before.</p><p>On Tuesday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin told Putin that the situation is &#8220;serious.&#8221; Russia&#8217;s comparatively low caseload could reflect insufficient screening rather than the actual scale of the epidemic, he said, and urged Putin to ramp up testing all across the country.</p><p>___</p><p>STOCKHOLM &#8212; Sweden saw a surge in the number of deaths that could change the Scandinavian&#8217;s rather lax approach keeping primary and elementary schools, restaurants and bars open and even encouraging people to go out and enjoy the spring sun.</p><p>Health officials have within the past 24 hours seen an increase of 18 deaths since Wednesday, bringing the total to 62 deaths in the country of 10 million that has had 2,510 people tested positive of which 176 are in intensive care.</p><p>The head of Stockholm&#8217;s health service Bjorn Eriksson said &#8220;the storm is over us,&#8221; hours after Anders Tegnell of the Public Health Agency of Sweden told a news conference that the situation was &#8220;stable.&#8221;</p><p>In neighboring Denmark, the government allegedly was planning to further tighten the law so that smaller groups &#8212; less than 10 &#8212; can be banned.</p><p>And in Finland, the government says it will in an exceptional move block the movement of citizens into and out of a key southern region that includes the Nordic nation&#8217;s capital, Helsinki, to prevent the spreading of coronavirus to other areas. The Uusimaa region includes Helsinki and affects the daily lives of some 1.7 million people, nearly a third of Finland&#8217;s population.</p><p>___</p><p>LONDON &#8212; Britain&#8217;s government has ordered 10,000 ventilators to grapple with the COVID-19 crisis.</p><p>Billionaire inventor James Dyson told his staff in an email that a team of engineers had been working on a design for the last 10 days since receiving a request for help from Prime Minister Boris Johnson.</p><p>Dyson says the device draws on technology used in the company&#8217;s air purifier ranges and is powered by a digital motor.</p><p>The device was created in partnership with Cambridge-based science engineering firm TTP and still must face regulatory approval.</p><p>Britain wants to increase the availability of ventilators from 8,000 to 30,000.</p><p>___</p><p>TOKYO &#8212; Tokyo Olympic organizers announced Thursday that they are canceling a cultural event featuring collaborative performances of kabuki and opera next month due to the spreading of the coronavirus.</p><p>The event already had a setback last year after world-famous tenor Placido Domingo withdrew following his sexual harassment allegations.</p><p>The cancellation follows Tuesday&#8217;s agreement between Tokyo&#8217;s Organizing Committee and the International Olympic Committee to postpone the Tokyo Games until the summer of 2021 due to the ongoing global pandemic.</p><p>The revised &#8220;Tokyo 2020 Nippon Festival&#8221; scheduled for April 18, was to feature Japanese kabuki actor Ebizo Ichikawa and opera singers &#8212; Italian soprano Anna Pirozi and Uruguayan bass-baritone Erwin Schrott &#8212; in a performance aimed at bringing together the east and the west and contrasting the traditional and the modern.</p><p>___</p><p>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia &#8212; Malaysia&#8217;s king and queen are under quarantine after seven palace staff members tested positive for COVID-19.</p><p>The palace said Thursday that seven staff were hospitalized Tuesday and health authorities were trying to identify the source of the transmission. It said King Sultan Abdullah Sultan Ahmad Shah and his wife Tunku Azizah Aminah Maimunah Iskandariah were tested for the virus, but both were negative. It said the royal couple decided to observe a 14-day self-quarantine from Wednesday, with deep cleansing to be carried out in the palace.</p><p>Malaysia, which has 21 deaths and the highest total of cases in Southeast Asia at 1,796, has extended its lockdown by another two weeks to April 14.</p><p>___</p><p>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka: &#8212; Sri Lanka&#8217;s president Gotabaya Rajapaksa has requested international donor agencies to provide a debt moratorium or debt deferment facility to all developing nations facing the risk of being severely affected by coronavirus.</p><p>Rajapaksa had urged Director General of the World Health Organization to forward this request to multi-lateral and bilateral lending agencies.</p><p>He has pointed out that such &#8220;a relief would be helpful to manage COVID-19 Social Distancing, Public Health and Social Security Systems in those countries.&#8221;</p><p>His statement comes as Sri Lanka will have to repay a US $4.8 billion external debt this year amid an economy that performed poorly last year. The island nation&#8217;s economy suffered a severe blow last year due to the Easter Sunday bomb attacks by Islamic militants.</p><p>Sri Lanka&#8217;s economic growth is estimated to hit an 18-year low of 2.7 to 2.8% in 2019.</p><p>However, the International Monetary Fund said in February that Sri Lanka&#8217;s economy is gradually recovering from the terrorist attacks last April. The IMF said the real GDP growth is estimated at 2.6% in 2019 and that the GDP growth in 2020 is projected at 3.7%.</p><p>___</p><p>MOSCOW &#8212; Russian government officials announced the halting of all international flights starting from Friday amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>An exception will be made for flights bringing Russians home from abroad, according to a statement published Thursday on the cabinet&#8217;s website.</p><p>Earlier this month, Russian authorities limited its air traffic to regular flights to world capitals and charter flights.</p><p>The new measure comes as the number of coronavirus cases in Russia rapidly grows. On Wednesday, the government reported a total of 658 cases, with 163 new cases registered since the previous day. That is a significantly bigger daily increase than in previous weeks, when the number of cases was growing by several dozens a day.</p><p>___</p><p>SEOUL, South Korea &#8212; South Korea&#8217;s central bank says it will temporarily provide an &#8220;unlimited&#8221; amount of money to eligible banks and other financial institutions for three months through repurchase agreements as it tries to calm financial markets rattled by the global coronavirus crisis.</p><p>The Bank of Korea on Thursday said the measure was unprecedented but didn&#8217;t provide an estimate on how much money would be supplied to financial markets through the short-term borrowings.</p><p>The bank last week executed an emergency rate cut of 0.5 percentage points to help ease the economic fallout from the coronavirus, which brought its policy rate to an all-time low of 0.75%.</p><p>Some experts say it&#8217;s unclear whether traditional financial tools to boost money supplies would be effective now when the global pandemic has damaged both supply and demand, decimating industrial hubs in China and Italy and forcing millions to stay at home under tightened quarantines.</p><p>Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

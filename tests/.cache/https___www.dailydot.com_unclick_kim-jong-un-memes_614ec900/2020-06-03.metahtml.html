<p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is reportedly in &#8220;grave danger&#8221; following a surgery, according to a U.S. official cited by <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/20/politics/kim-jong-un-north-korea/index.html">CNN</a>.</p>



<p>The 36-year-old leader reportedly underwent a cardiovascular system procedure on April 12, according to South Korean newspaper Daily NK, which covers North Korea. Kim reportedly received the surgery for &#8220;excessive smoking, obesity, and overwork.&#8221; </p> 




<p>South Korea on Tuesday morning played down concerns, according to the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/kim-jong-un-no-signs-that-north-korean-leader-is-in-grave-danger-south-says/2020/04/21/0a40c438-8380-11ea-81a3-9690c9881111_story.html">Washington Post</a>. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/21/us-kim-jong-uns-health-national-security-adviser-197982">Politico</a> reports that the U.S. is keeping a close watch on his condition.</p>



<p>Speculation about Kim&#8217;s health ramped up when he missed the birthday celebration for his grandfather and founder of North Korea, Kim Il-sung, on April 15. It is considered North Korea&#8217;s most important holiday.</p> 




<p>Ascertaining reliable information about Kim Jong Un is difficult, as North Korea has no free press and almost never offers insight into its leadership decisions. In a statement given to reporters, South Korea&#8217;s Presidential Blue House said it has seen &#8220;no unusual signs&#8221; regarding Kim&#8217;s health, while the Unification Ministry and Defense Ministry gave &#8220;no comment&#8221; to CNN.</p>



<p>In lieu of comment from the North Korean government on Kim&#8217;s health, Twitter users provided their own&#8212;and, unsurprisingly, they came in the form of memes. </p> 




<h2>Kim Jong Un memes</h2>



<p>Many users joked that Kim was headed to the Gulag&#8212;the Russian prison featured in Call of Duty: Warzone where players killed in combat can fight one-on-one for a chance to return to the game&#8212;which has become a popular meme over the past week and a half.&#160;</p> 




<p>Some Twitter users chalked Kim Jong Un&#8217;s health scare up to karmic retribution for claiming North Korea had seen no coronavirus cases, despite being bordered by China and South Korea&#8212;two of the first countries to be infected.&#160;Others mocked Kim&#8217;s surgeon for what they perceived to be either incompetence or malicious intent. In general, Twitter searches for &#8220;Kim Jung Un&#8221; and &#8220;#KimJongUn&#8221; produced a lot of schadenfreude.</p> 




<p>Other Twitter users still poked fun at the efforts of smaller Twitter accounts to strike while the iron was hot and craft the perfect Kim Jong Un meme tweet. </p> 




<p>Reports on Kim Jong Un&#8217;s health are likely to change over the next few days.</p>

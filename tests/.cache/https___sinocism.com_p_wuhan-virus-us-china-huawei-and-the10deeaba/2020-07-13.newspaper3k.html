You talked a moment ago about, you know, do democracies have the ability to have these grand strategies? Well, in fact, the private sector is what takes the lead. They have the spotlight in free and open societies. And they're the ones who provided tens of trillions of dollars of capital globally to build the world. We don't rely on central planning or a vanity project of some autocrat to say we're going to invest there.<br><br>Saran: Can you very quickly for the benefit of all those in the room, describe the Blue Dot project? Because you were mentioning that very interesting idea yesterday night.<br><br>Pottinger: Yeah, very briefly. So the Blue Dot Network is a new initiative that Japan, Australia and the United States are the first underwriters of, but it's really a multi-stakeholder initiative that's designed to ensure that countries around the world have that private-sector led, sustainable, transparent financing for infrastructure development. So we're encouraging friends around the region, we're encouraging Europe, to look at this as well. The idea is that we will evaluate and certify infrastructure projects that meet a basic set of good standards. For example, is it financially sustainable? Are the terms of the project transparent? Is it environmentally sound? And if the projects meet those standards it&#8217;s assigned a Blue Dot. It's kind of like getting a Michelin star rating for your restaurant. And what that means is, as that catches on, private sector players are going to want to get in and participate in those projects. And anyone's able to&#8212;it doesn't exclude any country&#8212;it just says you've got to meet some basic standards. So this is designed to also crowd out some of the more corrupt approaches to infrastructure investment that that really threaten to undermine prosperity for all of us.</p></blockquote><p><strong>And <a href="https://sinocism.com/p/wuhan-effectively-quarantined-peoples">here are</a> Mr. Pottinger's comments at the forum about Huawei and decoupling, from yesterday's newsletter in Item #3, now outside the paywall.</strong></p><p></p><h4>4.

To my knowledge, trying to contain a city of 11 million people is new to science. It has not been tried before as a public health measure, so we cannot at this stage say it will or will not work. If this is happening we will note carefully to what extent it is maintained and how long it can take. There are pros and cons to such a decision. Such a decision obviously has social and economic impacts that are considerable. On the other hand, it demonstrates a very strong public health commitment and a willingness to take dramatic action. It sends a message to Wuhan, to China and to the rest of the countries. It remains to be seen what it’s effect will be... We are now daily hearing of massive increases in the numbers. Part of that increase is coming from the processing of specimens earlier. Another part is a broadening of the case definition. So numbers are going to increase. Even if they are in the thousands, this would not surprise us. That is not an indicator of seriousness. Indeed it is very, very good to get and identify as many cases as possible.</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://www.caixinglobal.com/2020-01-23/wuhan-virus-latest-china-reports-second-pneumonia-linked-death-101505300.html">Caixin - Wuhan Virus Latest: Wuhan Imposes Massive Quarantine, Shutting Down Public Transit</a></p><blockquote><p>A Hong Kong-based virologist who helped identify the coronavirus that caused SARS has weighed in on the current outbreak with some sobering words. “I’ve never felt scared,” he told Caixin on Thursday. “This time I’m scared.” Guan Yi, who heads the University of Hong Kong’s State Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases, said he traveled to Wuhan this week expecting the city to be on a war footing. He said despite strong words from China’s central authorities, that’s not what he saw. “I don't think the local government has done what it should do. They haven’t even been handing out quarantine guides to people who were leaving the city.” Guan told Caixin he feared the spread of this virus could be over 10 times larger than SARS, and that the lockdown implemented Thursday was unlikely to be effective because the window for controlling its spread ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday had already closed... Doctors at several major local hospitals in Wuhan told Caixin that it is estimated that the number of people infected with the epidemic may eventually exceed 6,000.</p></blockquote><p>The original interview with Guan - <a href="http://www.caixin.com/2020-01-23/101507670.html">管轶：去过武汉请自我隔离_财新网_财新网</a></p><blockquote><p>Guan says he has been through many epidemics, and this is the first time he has felt afraid. 保守估计，此次感染规模最终可能会是SARS的10倍起跳。我经历过这么多，从没有感到害怕过，大部分可控制，但这次我怕了。</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/3047230/wuhan-mayor-under-pressure-resign-over-response-coronavirus#Echobox=1579736733">Wuhan mayor under pressure to resign over response to coronavirus outbreak | South China Morning Post</a></p><blockquote><p>Zhou Xianwang, the 57-year-old mayor of the Hubei provincial capital, is weathering what will likely be the toughest crisis of his career, with a flood of calls for his resignation after he told state broadcaster CCTV that the city’s “warnings were not sufficient”... “From the perspective of continued understanding of the situation, it is only at this time that everyone realises it is so dangerous,” said Zhou, who has been mayor since September 2018. “If we knew at first from the virus spread that it would be so serious, finding effective control and prevention methods of course would be good, but the problem is usually we cannot realise the severity from the outset.”</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/6996d92a-3ce2-11ea-a01a-bae547046735">How China’s slow response aided coronavirus outbreak | Financial Times $$</a></p><blockquote><p>Chinese censors also initially instructed media to stick to reprinting official reports on the virus from central government-controlled media, severely restricting independent reporting, according to multiple journalists. In one example, a Chinese reporter said this month that they were told by a medical professional that hospitals in the city were given a target of “zero infections” among staff, with hospital deans liable to be fired for failing to meet the target. As a result, medical staff were slow to report infections among nurses... Part of the reason for the tightly controlled release of information was that Wuhan, a provincial capital, was hosting annual meetings of the top municipal and provincial officials from January 7 to 17.</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/23/opinion/coronavirus-china-wuhan.html">Opinion | Is China Setting Itself Up for Another Epidemic? - The New York Times OpEd - Huang Yanzhong</a></p><blockquote><p>It is exploding in China and spreading to other countries, much as SARS did in 2003.

It needs much courage and rationality to take this step. We sincerely appreciate the sacrifices made by Wuhan citizens. They will make a great contribution to stop the uncontrolled spread of the epidemic. Some Wuhan people's normal travels will be affected and the suspension of public transportation in the city will also bring a serious inconvenience to Wuhan locals. As a media organization, we want to pay tribute to the city of Wuhan and its over 10 million citizens.

Under the strong leadership of the CPC, all members of the Party, armed forces and people of all ethnic groups must fear no wind or wave, rise up to challenges and keep marching toward the glorious goal of national rejuvenation and the great prospect of building a community with a shared future for humanity, Xi said... From now to the middle of this century, the Chinese people will strive to build China into a great modern socialist country. It will be a great era in which a new splendid chapter of the Chinese civilization will be written, he said. Every Chinese person must feel proud of living in such a great era, Xi said.

The proposed solution represents a “calculated compromise”, which can be presented to Washington as a tough restriction on the Chinese firm but also accepted by British operators already using the company’s equipment, one of the sources said.</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facing-pushback-from-allies-u-s-set-for-broader-huawei-effort-11579775403?mod=hp_lead_pos2">Facing Pushback From Allies, U.S. Set for Broader Huawei Effort - WSJ</a></p><blockquote><p>The latest setback came last week when U.K. officials stood their ground after the White House sent senior officials to Britain to present more evidence about the risks posed by Huawei. “We had already anticipated the kind of threat the new U.S. material demonstrates and have factored that into our planning,” said a spokesman for the U.K. government, which is expected to make a decision next week... “The appetite for a U.S.-U.K. trade agreement could be diminished by the U.K. making the wrong decision on Huawei,” a senior Trump administration official said. A U.S. official said Washington is “engaged in all countries” and plans to give financial assistance to developing countries to use alternative suppliers in 5G networks via newly empowered government agencies and initiatives... The official said Washington plans to use the State Department’s Digital Connectivity and Cybersecurity Partnership, the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Export-Import Bank of the U.S. and U.S. International Development Finance Corporation, or DFC, toward this goal. Such financial assistance would help wireless carriers in foreign countries buy equipment from Huawei’s rivals, which are chiefly Sweden’s Ericsson AB, Finland’s Nokia Corp. and South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co.</p></blockquote><p>Comment: One use for the Blue Dot Network…Here is Deputy National Security Advisor Matt Pottinger at the Raisina Dialogue in India last week on the Blue Dot Network, discussing its role in the Indo-Pacific but also more generally how it might work, from an unofficial transcript sent to me by a US official:</p><blockquote><p>if there isn't an American player that wants to play then we'll work with an Indian one, we'll work with an Australian company, we’ll work with an Indonesian or Vietnamese company. The amount of capital that is available under the Development Finance Corporation is now, as you put it, sixty billion dollars, a more than doubling of the amount. And it also allows DFC to participate in private equity, not just lending schemes for these various projects. So this is something that is designed to galvanize private-sector money. You talked a moment ago about, you know, do democracies have the ability to have these grand strategies? Well, in fact, the private sector is what takes the lead. They have the spotlight in free and open societies. And they're the ones who provided tens of trillions of dollars of capital globally to build the world. We don't rely on central planning or a vanity project of some autocrat to say we're going to invest there. Saran: Can you very quickly for the benefit of all those in the room, describe the Blue Dot project? Because you were mentioning that very interesting idea yesterday night. Pottinger: Yeah, very briefly. So the Blue Dot Network is a new initiative that Japan, Australia and the United States are the first underwriters of, but it's really a multi-stakeholder initiative that's designed to ensure that countries around the world have that private-sector led, sustainable, transparent financing for infrastructure development. So we're encouraging friends around the region, we're encouraging Europe, to look at this as well. The idea is that we will evaluate and certify infrastructure projects that meet a basic set of good standards. For example, is it financially sustainable? Are the terms of the project transparent? Is it environmentally sound? And if the projects meet those standards it’s assigned a Blue Dot. It's kind of like getting a Michelin star rating for your restaurant. And what that means is, as that catches on, private sector players are going to want to get in and participate in those projects. And anyone's able to—it doesn't exclude any country—it just says you've got to meet some basic standards. So this is designed to also crowd out some of the more corrupt approaches to infrastructure investment that that really threaten to undermine prosperity for all of us.</p></blockquote><p>And <a href="https://sinocism.com/p/wuhan-effectively-quarantined-peoples">here are</a> Mr. Pottinger's comments at the forum about Huawei and decoupling, from yesterday's newsletter in Item #3, now outside the paywall.</p><h4>4.

class="_1SzQc">Some medical experts are warning there is worse to come.</p><p class="_1SzQc">Anthony Costello is a former director of maternal and child health at the World Health Organisation, and a Professor at University College London's Institute for Global Health.</p><p class="_1SzQc">He thinks the virus could ultimately claim more lives in the UK than any other European nation.</p><p class="_1SzQc">"It's going to be very embarrassing for us," Professor Costello told 7.30.</p><blockquote class="OsWT8"><p class="_1SzQc">"We basically allowed an exponentially rising epidemic to get

the Government's inaction was in full swing in Cheltenham.</p><p class="_1SzQc">At Cheltenham races, one of the most prestigious events on the British racing calendar, 250,000 people packed the stands.</p><p class="_1SzQc">"We had a big horseracing event with a quarter of a million people going to it," Mr Blakeley said.</p><p class="_1SzQc">"I just thought, 'there's something not right here,

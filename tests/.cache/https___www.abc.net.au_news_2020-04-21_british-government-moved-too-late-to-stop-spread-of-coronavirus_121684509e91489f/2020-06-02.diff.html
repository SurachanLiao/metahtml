class="_1SzQc">How could it happen in a first-world nation where politicians had not only been warned, but could see for themselves the tragedy unfolding in other nations in Europe?</p><p class="_1SzQc">Some medical experts are warning there is worse to come.</p><p class="_1SzQc">Anthony Costello is a former director of maternal and child health at the World Health Organisation, and a Professor at University College London's Institute for Global Health.</p><p class="_1SzQc">He thinks the virus could ultimately claim more lives in the UK than any other European nation.</p><p

class="_1SzQc">At Cheltenham races, one of the most prestigious events on the British racing calendar, 250,000 people packed the stands.</p><p class="_1SzQc">"We had a big horseracing event with a quarter of a million people going to it," Mr Blakeley said.</p><p class="_1SzQc">"I just thought, 'there's something not right here, there's going to be a lot of people affected by this'."</p><p

contact tracing would be stopped and restricted to those who were admitted to hospital.</p><p class="_1SzQc">That was at a time when the virus was largely contained in London.</p><p class="_1SzQc">In

Little is known about the third-generation leader whose <a href="http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/04/04/17605085-north-korea-foreign-embassy-staff-may-not-be-safe-if-theres-war?lite" rel="nofollow">recent actions and rhetoric</a> have sparked fears of a potential confrontation with the U.S. or its allies.</p><p>“This is a leader for whom we know as little as anyone in the world,” said P.J. Crowley, former U.S. assistant secretary of state for public affairs, Friday on Jansing &amp; Co. “In this particular case, Kim Jong Un is largely a black box.”</p><p>Despite the mystery shrouding him, a few details of the North Korea leader’s life <a href="http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/04/05/17601453-nine-facts-about-north-koreas-kim-jong-un-he-loves-the-nba-disco-and-his-grandfather?lite" rel="nofollow">have trickled out</a>:

He’s very, very young. He does have a coterie of senior people, family members, others, who are guiding him. I don’t think that his position in Korean society is necessarily challenged.”</p></article>

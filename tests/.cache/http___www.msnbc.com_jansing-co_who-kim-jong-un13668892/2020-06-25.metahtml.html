<article class="panel__main"><p>North Korean media calls him &#8220;the greatest-ever commander.&#8221; But there is no dictator more puzzling and arguably more unpredictable than Kim Jong Un. Little is known about the third-generation leader whose <a href="http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/04/04/17605085-north-korea-foreign-embassy-staff-may-not-be-safe-if-theres-war?lite" rel="nofollow">recent actions and rhetoric</a> have sparked fears of a potential confrontation with the U.S. or its allies.</p><p>&#8220;This is a leader for whom we know as little as anyone in the world,&#8221; said P.J. Crowley, former U.S. assistant secretary of state for public affairs, Friday on Jansing &amp; Co. &#8220;In this particular case, Kim Jong Un is largely a black box.&#8221;</p><p>Despite the mystery shrouding him, a few details of the North Korea leader&#8217;s life <a href="http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/04/05/17601453-nine-facts-about-north-koreas-kim-jong-un-he-loves-the-nba-disco-and-his-grandfather?lite" rel="nofollow">have trickled out</a>:
</p><ul><li>He has a first lady named Ri Sol-ju whom South Korean media says is a former cheerleader and singer.</li>
 
<li>It&#8217;s been widely reported he was educated in Bern, Switzerland, possibly from 1998 to 2000.</li>
 
<li>The North Korean public did not even know he existed until a few years before his father&#8217;s death.</li>
 
<li>South Koreans <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2013/04/kim-jong-un-facts-89632.html?hp=r5" rel="nofollow">have speculated</a> he underwent plastic surgery to look more like his father.</li>
 
<li>He loves basketball (remember that recent trip by <a href="http://newsfeed.time.com/2013/03/12/dennis-rodman-with-a-penchant-for-diplomacy-plans-vacations-to-the-vatican-and-north-korea/" rel="nofollow">Dennis Rodman</a> to North Korea?).</li>
 
<li>His official birthday is celebrated on Jan. 8, but the actual date of his birth is not publicly known.</li>
</ul><p>
 
&#8220;The dilemma is he&#8217;s not widely known,&#8221; Crowley told msnbc&#8217;s Chris Jansing. &#8220;He&#8217;s not widely traveled. He&#8217;s very, very young. He does have a coterie of senior people, family members, others, who are guiding him. I don&#8217;t think that his position in Korean society is necessarily challenged.&#8221;</p></article>

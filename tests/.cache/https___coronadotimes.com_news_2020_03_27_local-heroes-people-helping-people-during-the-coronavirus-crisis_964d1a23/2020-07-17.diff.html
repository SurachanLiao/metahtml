You will always find people who are helping.’”</p><p>Coronado is full of helpers during this unprecedented time of fear and panic. We have doctors and nurses working the front lines, tending to the ill. We have kind-hearted neighbors who are willing to drop everything to pick up groceries and run errands for the high-risk among us. We have community coordinators, creating platforms to help and assist in spreading joy, ultimately boosting the spirit of those depleted in hope.</p> <p class="td-adspot-title"><del>- Advertisement - </del></p><del><a href="https://www.baysidemarket.com/" target="_blank"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Boneys_tp2.png"> Link: https://www.baysidemarket.com/ </a></del> <p>Here are just a few of many Coronado locals who are doing wonderful things to help others.</p><p>Rebecca Sauer, critical care nurse.

She is an angel and has helped us so much with this world-wide coronavirus challenge.”</p> <p class="td-adspot-title"><del>- Advertisement -</del></p><del><a href="https://www.coronado.ca.us/news/what_s_new/mask_up__coronado_--_mask_giveaway" target="_blank"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/city_mask.png"> Link: https://www.coronado.ca.us/news/what_s_new/mask_up__coronado_--_mask_giveaway </a></del> <p>Bill Rogers, founder of Liberty Call Distilling.

I explained my morning and shared that after multiple stops I failed to find any toilet paper and was headed home. Without hesitation, she offered me an 18 pack of toilet paper, refused payment, and asked if there was anything else we needed. Deb is not only an outstanding neighbor, and a caring friend, she is a disabled Air Force veteran and military spouse. Her service to our country and her kindness and generosity inspires me.”</p><p>Jay Doucet, MD, FRCSC, FACS. Nominated by Lourdes Smith Huidor, for his work fighting the COVID-19 virus in his leadership role at UC San Diego Health.</p> <p><del><a href="https://coronadotimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/44B4B5C5-3EA3-492F-8C94-C98CD1E20191.jpeg"><img class="wp-image-141009 size-full" title="Jay Doucet" src="https://coronadotimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/44B4B5C5-3EA3-492F-8C94-C98CD1E20191.jpeg" alt="Jay Doucet" width="170" height="212"> Link: https://coronadotimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/44B4B5C5-3EA3-492F-8C94-C98CD1E20191.jpeg </a></del></p> <p>“I nominate Jay Doucet who is fighting this current war against the invisible enemy from the frontlines as a surgeon, educator and leader,” says Lourdes. “Dr. Doucet and his team are working around the clock caring for patients, the community, and in developing protocols and safety measures to better assist with the process.”</p><p>Maggie Pettit, local mom and Coronado Village Elementary PTO President. Nominated by Julie Dabbieri, for spreading light and cheer.</p> <p><del><a href="https://coronadotimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/3581B64A-DD6F-4CF0-BC0A-A2180E87D989.jpeg"><img class="wp-image-141005 size-medium" title="Maggie Pettit" src="https://coronadotimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/3581B64A-DD6F-4CF0-BC0A-A2180E87D989-300x275.jpeg" alt="Maggie Pettit" width="300" height="275"> Link: https://coronadotimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/3581B64A-DD6F-4CF0-BC0A-A2180E87D989.jpeg </a></del></p> <p>“The first week of quarantine, she organized a nightly 6:45pm ‘wave’ on our block,” explains Julie. “This is somewhat of a highlight for all of us, kids and adults!”</p><p>Maggie has also organized children’s chalk walks, window walks, and led other efforts helping kids spread color and happiness to their neighbors.</p><p>Rashida Cooper and her staff at the Youth Center at Lincoln Military Housing at Silver Strand. Nominated by Jennifer Moore, for caring for children of essential employees with the U.S. Navy.</p><p>“Rashida and her staff are truly unsung heroes and our partners in educating, championing, and loving many military-connected students at Silver Strand,” says Jennifer. “Many people do not know that this facility serves students TK through 12th grade before and after school (early and late hours) and including on holidays. As essential employees they have been working full-time while our schools are closed and while their parents, also essential employees, serve our country. During regular school days I am witness to a warm hand-offs between our staff and theirs before and after school….I hope that you will recognize their tremendous service to our community and nation…and the future leaders of our country!”</p><p>Dr. Wael Kouli, Plastic Surgeon.

My wife texted Dr. Kouli and he responded within minutes, meeting us in the alley behind his offices to stitch up my hand while I sat in the passenger seat of my car. I can’t thank him enough for his care.”</p><p>Kelley Kraft Casey, social media rockstar.

A neighbor, who is a contractor, provided me with an industrial grade filtration mask, that I was able to give her. This may mean the difference between them having to self-isolate apart for weeks, versus being able to stay together. This forum did that.”</p><p>Lisa Solis, singer, musician and music teacher.

I want to recognize your generosity and express my deepest appreciation! You keep my mind clear, my emotions more stable and my body from becoming total mush! Each morning I set up my workouts on my porch that faces the sunrise, pop in my ear buds, and get pumped that I get to workout with you and other fellow Sweat Equity members.”</p><p>Thanks for reading everyone.

Although initially horrified by surfers, flannels and skateboards, she ultimately grew to love all things So-Cal. A graduate of UCSD, Christine got her first writing job on the KUSI ten o’clock news while simultaneously juggling a reporter position at the San Diego Community News Group. She worked as a public relations professional, a book editor, real estate professional, and a freelance writer before eventually succumbing to motherhood in 2008.A decade later, Christine resurfaced to start the Island Girl Blog, a Coronado lifestyle blog. In addition, she writes a monthly page for Crown City Magazine. Christine loves hanging out with her husband, Ian, and their two spirited daughters, Holland and Marley, who attend Village Elementary and Coronado Middle School. When she’s not working, you’ll find her practicing yoga, spilling coffee at school drop off, meeting friends for sushi, or sailing the Bay with her family and English Bulldog, Moshi.

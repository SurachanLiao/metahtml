Provided the Aussie dollar is reasonably stable, motorists may be able to look forward to filling up for near $1 a litre,” he wrote in a research note.</p><p>Fuel prices in Australia’s capital cities on Sunday ranged from an average of $1.19 a litre in Adelaide to $1.536 in Hobart, according to Motormouth.com.au. In Sydney, petrol was selling for $1.248, while it cost an average of $1.239 in Melbourne.</p><p>RELATED: <a href="https://www.news.com.au/finance/markets/australian-markets/australian-share-market-to-fall-to-fresh-horrific-depths-as-coronavirus-fears-escalate/news-story/728c50e2f64e5c5b089e417f4f13e217">Australian share market plunges to ‘horrific’ depths</a></p><p>RELATED: <a href="https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/health/health-problems/coronavirus-across-the-country-infected-man-visited-sydney-emergency-department/live-coverage/d422aa4299b1b05aa163c463b925b199">Two Sydney schools closed after three students infected</a></p><p>RELATED: <a href="https://www.news.com.au/finance/business/retail/toilet-paper-is-like-gold-coronavirus-fears-create-queues-out-the-door-at-grocery-shops/news-story/a72a3789ac5fbf6881b1e5f9b446c2ca">Toilet paper is ‘like gold’ as coronavirus fears spread</a></p> <p class="caption"><ins>Motorists should be able to get cheaper petrol amid a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia.<span class="image-source">Source:News Limited</span></ins></p> <del><img width="650" height="365" alt="Motorists should be able to get cheaper petrol amid a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia."></del> <p>Treasurer Josh Frydenberg today urged consumer watchdog Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) to ensure lower oil prices were passed on at petrol pumps.</p><p>Mr Frydenberg said he had spoken to ACCC chair Rod Sims on Monday about the organisation’s role in monitoring prices at the bowser.</p><p>“I wanted to re-emphasise to the ACCC the importance of holding the oil retailers to account in ensuring that Australians get the benefit from the lower oil prices,” he told reporters in Canberra.</p><p>“They have assured me that they will not only maintain their monitoring role and the vigilance that that involves.</p><p>“They’ll also be calling out any energy companies that don’t pass on the reduction in the wholesale price to the Australian consumer.”</p><p>RELATED: <a href="https://www.news.com.au/topics/coronavirus">Follow the latest updates on coronavirus</a></p><p>Saudi Arabia, Russia, and other major producers last battled for market share like this between 2014 and 2016 to try to squeeze out production from the United States, now the world’s biggest oil producer as flows from shale oil fields doubled the country’s output during the last decade.</p><p>“Saudi Arabia and Russia are entering into an oil price war that is likely to be limited and tactical,” Eurasia Group said in a note.</p><p>“The most likely outcome of this crisis is entrenchment into a painful process that lasts several weeks or months, until prices are low enough to … some form of compromise on resumed OPEC+ production restraint,” Eurasia said.</p></article>

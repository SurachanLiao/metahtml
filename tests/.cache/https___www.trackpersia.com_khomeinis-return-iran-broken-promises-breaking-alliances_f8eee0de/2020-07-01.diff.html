Many woke up soon to find out that their dreams would fade away as Khomeini’s promises about bringing about democracy soon gave way to an authoritarian clerical rule and his revolution devoured many of its children including those on the stairs as well as those behind him waiting to see Iran, some after many years.</p> <p>Prominent historian and political analyst Dr. Abbas Milani told Radio Farda in the program that the combination of people around Khomeini on the plane was carefully pre-planned and was not “accidental.” He refers to Khomeini’s negotiations with “Americans in Paris” and “his representatives’ negotiations with Americans in Tehran.”</p> <p>“It was exactly the combination that was planned to be on Khomeini’s cabinet later,” adding that “Khomeini promised to create a ‘National Front’ or ‘Freedom Movement’ government.” Said Milani. These were liberal political groups that were influenced by the ideas of former Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadeq, a nationalist politician who was removed from office during a coup in 1953.</p> <p>“Khomeini clearly and repeatedly promised to negotiators and the nation of Iran that clerics, including himself are not going to be in power. He said he would go to the seminary in Qom.” Milani added, reminding that “The Constitution prepared in Paris for the next regime was based on the constitution of the fifth French Republic and did not contain anything about Velayat-e Faqih,” or the rule of a top cleric, an ideology that brought about authoritarian clerical rule.</p> <p>According to Milani, it took the clerics only a few moths to replace Prime Minister Bazargan’s liberal government by the powerful cleric-dominated Revolutionary Council.</p> <p>As regards Khomeini’s travel companions in his journey to Tehran, Sadeq Qotbzadeh, who was sitting next to him on the plane was executed on charges of conspiring to assassinate Khomeini three years after he was appointed the head of the state Radio and TV and Foreign Minister.</p> <del><img class=" enhanced" src="https://gdb.rferl.org/5FA49E1E-03E8-4026-A87A-87A9811C8594_w650_r0_s.jpg" alt="An original photo of Ayatollah Khomeini's arrival on February 01, 1979 (R) and a manipulated version of the same photo which is published by Fars news agency."></del> <p>Ayatollah Morteza Motahari, said to be one of the theoreticians of the Islamic revolution, and Haj Mehdi Araqi, Khomeini’s pay master in Paris, were assassinated by a radical Islamist group in Tehran within weeks of the victory of the revolution in February 1979.</p> <p>President Abolhassan Banisadr, was disqualified around less than a year after being elected and had to secretly fly back to exile in Paris. He was disqualified by hardliners around Khomeini, including Ali Khamenei, who was an MP at the time.</p> <p>Ayatollah Hassan Lahouti Eshkevari died while in custody in 1982. Many reports say he was killed but prison officials, who link him to an outlawed opposition group, say he committed suicide.</p> <p>Khomeini’s own son Ahmad, is said to have been killed in 1995 in a plot led by “rouge elements” at the Intelligence Ministry, by meddling with his medication.</p> <p>A few including Hassan Habibi, who served as vice-president under several Iranian presidents, and Sadeq Tabatabai, who was the spokesman for the government in 1979, died of natural causes after years of illness.</p> <p>The same picture showing Khomeini and a dozen others on the staircase, was doctored skillfully so many times that its most recent versions show only the pilot ushering Khomeini to the troubled country.</p> <p>RFE/RL</p> <p class="fusion-meta-info-wrapper"><ins>By <span class="vcard"><span class="fn"><a href="https://www.trackpersia.com/author/shatha-juburigmail-com/" title="Posts by Track Persia" rel="author">Track Persia Link: https://www.trackpersia.com/author/shatha-juburigmail-com/ </a></span></span><span class="fusion-inline-sep">|</span><span class="updated">2019-02-02T12:24:45+00:00</span><span>February 2nd, 2019</span><span class="fusion-inline-sep">|</span><a href="https://www.trackpersia.com/category/iran/" rel="category tag">Iran Link: https://www.trackpersia.com/category/iran/ </a><span class="fusion-inline-sep">|</span></ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="fusion-sharing-box fusion-single-sharing-box share-box"><ins></ins></p><h4><ins>Share This Story, Choose Your Platform!</ins></h4><ins> </ins><h3 class="title-heading-left"><ins>Related Posts</ins></h3><ul class="fusion-carousel-holder"><li class="fusion-carousel-item"><p class="fusion-rollover-content"><ins><a class="fusion-rollover-link" href="https://www.trackpersia.com/iran-police-question-four-deadly-tehran-blast/">Permalink Link: https://www.trackpersia.com/iran-police-question-four-deadly-tehran-blast/ </a> <a class="fusion-rollover-gallery" href="https://www.trackpersia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2169486-463262813.jpg">Gallery Link: https://www.trackpersia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2169486-463262813.jpg </a> </ins></p><h4 class="fusion-rollover-title"><ins><a href="https://www.trackpersia.com/iran-police-question-four-deadly-tehran-blast/">Iran police question four after deadly Tehran blast Link: https://www.trackpersia.com/iran-police-question-four-deadly-tehran-blast/ </a></ins></h4><ins> </ins></li><li class="fusion-carousel-item"><p class="fusion-rollover-content"><ins><a class="fusion-rollover-link" href="https://www.trackpersia.com/court-sentences-7-iranian-christian-converts-prison-financial-penalty/">Permalink Link: https://www.trackpersia.com/court-sentences-7-iranian-christian-converts-prison-financial-penalty/ </a> <a class="fusion-rollover-gallery" href="https://www.trackpersia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3A77E78E00000578-3944922-image-a-4_1479376461093.jpg">Gallery Link: https://www.trackpersia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3A77E78E00000578-3944922-image-a-4_1479376461093.jpg </a> </ins></p><h4 class="fusion-rollover-title"><ins><a href="https://www.trackpersia.com/court-sentences-7-iranian-christian-converts-prison-financial-penalty/">Court sentences 7 Iranian Christian converts to prison and financial penalty Link: https://www.trackpersia.com/court-sentences-7-iranian-christian-converts-prison-financial-penalty/ </a></ins></h4><ins> </ins></li><li class="fusion-carousel-item"><p class="fusion-rollover-content"><ins><a class="fusion-rollover-link" href="https://www.trackpersia.com/mission-khamenei-javad-zarif-president/">Permalink Link: https://www.trackpersia.com/mission-khamenei-javad-zarif-president/ </a> <a class="fusion-rollover-gallery" href="https://www.trackpersia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/11.jpg">Gallery Link: https://www.trackpersia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/11.jpg </a> </ins></p><h4 class="fusion-rollover-title"><ins><a href="https://www.trackpersia.com/mission-khamenei-javad-zarif-president/">A mission from Khamenei: Javad Zarif for president?

Reading this material will allow the reader to understand the core ideologies the Iranian regime since Khomeini's Revolution in 1979 has based on; to not only establish a strong power base in Iran, but also to appeal to communities of similar sectarian/religious belief in the region, to strengthening its self-appointed status &quot;The Defender of Shii Islam&quot;.

This section aims at assisting the reader in understanding the difference between mainstream &quot;Sunni&quot; Islam and the “Shi'i” Islam and examining the Safavism ideology which promotes the Persian racism and geo-strategic expansion which the current Iranian theocracy uses to revive the Persian Empire. To achieve this goal, this section focuses on historical background of the foundation of Safavid Empire, which caused the deaths of thousands of people from numerous sects, religions and nationalities. It is hoped it will help in unwinding deep-rooted tension caused by the Iranian regime’s radical and revolutionary ideologies that have led to the instability in the Middle East.">Ideology Link: https://www.trackpersia.com/category/ideology/ </a> </ins></li><ins> </ins><li class="cat-item cat-item-35"><ins><a href="https://www.trackpersia.com/category/india/">India Link: https://www.trackpersia.com/category/india/ </a> </ins></li><ins> </ins><li class="cat-item cat-item-37"><ins><a href="https://www.trackpersia.com/category/indonesia/">Indonesia Link: https://www.trackpersia.com/category/indonesia/ </a> </ins></li><ins> </ins><li class="cat-item cat-item-31"><ins><a href="https://www.trackpersia.com/category/iran/">Iran Link: https://www.trackpersia.com/category/iran/ </a> </ins></li><ins> </ins><li class="cat-item cat-item-29"><ins><a href="https://www.trackpersia.com/category/iraq/">Iraq Link: https://www.trackpersia.com/category/iraq/ </a> </ins></li><ins> </ins><li class="cat-item cat-item-18"><ins><a href="https://www.trackpersia.com/category/isreal/">Isreal Link: https://www.trackpersia.com/category/isreal/ </a> </ins></li><ins> </ins><li class="cat-item cat-item-20"><ins><a href="https://www.trackpersia.com/category/jordan/">Jordan Link: https://www.trackpersia.com/category/jordan/ </a> </ins></li><ins> </ins><li class="cat-item cat-item-41"><ins><a href="https://www.trackpersia.com/category/kazakhstan/">Kazakhstan Link: https://www.trackpersia.com/category/kazakhstan/ </a> </ins></li><ins> </ins><li class="cat-item cat-item-42"><ins><a href="https://www.trackpersia.com/category/kenya/">Kenya Link: https://www.trackpersia.com/category/kenya/ </a> </ins></li><ins> </ins><li class="cat-item cat-item-27"><ins><a href="https://www.trackpersia.com/category/kuwait/">Kuwait Link: https://www.trackpersia.com/category/kuwait/ </a> </ins></li><ins> </ins><li class="cat-item cat-item-44"><ins><a href="https://www.trackpersia.com/category/latin-america/">Latin America Link: https://www.trackpersia.com/category/latin-america/ </a> </ins></li><ins> </ins><li class="cat-item cat-item-16"><ins><a href="https://www.trackpersia.com/category/lebanon/">Lebanon Link: https://www.trackpersia.com/category/lebanon/ </a> </ins></li><ins> </ins><li class="cat-item cat-item-36"><ins><a href="https://www.trackpersia.com/category/libya/">Libya Link: https://www.trackpersia.com/category/libya/ </a> </ins></li><ins> </ins><li class="cat-item cat-item-38"><ins><a href="https://www.trackpersia.com/category/malaysia/">Malaysia Link: https://www.trackpersia.com/category/malaysia/ </a> </ins></li><ins> </ins><li class="cat-item cat-item-4"><ins><a href="https://www.trackpersia.com/category/marocco/">Marocco Link: https://www.trackpersia.com/category/marocco/ </a> </ins></li><ins> </ins><li class="cat-item cat-item-6"><ins><a href="https://www.trackpersia.com/category/mauritania/">Mauritania Link: https://www.trackpersia.com/category/mauritania/ </a> </ins></li><ins> </ins><li class="cat-item cat-item-51"><ins><a href="https://www.trackpersia.com/category/middle-east/">Middle East Link: https://www.trackpersia.com/category/middle-east/ </a> </ins></li><ins> </ins><li class="cat-item cat-item-4729"><ins><a href="https://www.trackpersia.com/category/minorities/" title="This section is updated with news, updates, and articles that explore the Status of Minorities in Iran.

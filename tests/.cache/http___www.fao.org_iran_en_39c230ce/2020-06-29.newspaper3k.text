FAO has had a long-lasting collaboration with the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran since the country became a member of FAO in 1953. The cooperation was strengthened with the re-opening of a country office in 1992, and over the years FAO has provided policy and technical assistance in promoting sustainable development of the country’s agriculture and rural sectors. More recently, the interventions have been focused on policy advice, capacity building and planning for increasing agricultural productivity and improvements to forestry. To date, FAO has implemented almost 200 national and regional projects in Iran.

These projects mainly focus on providing technical assistance in the areas of:

· Capacity building

· Policy and strategy development

· Crop production

· Livestock and animal health

· Fisheries and aquaculture

· Emergency and rehabilitation programmes

· Forestry

· Water governance and water accounting

· Climate change

In line with the priorities of the country to promote sustainable agriculture and rural development, FAO is pursuing a country programme framework, to be implemented during the period (2017-2021), on four major pillars of:

· Environmentally Sustainable and Climate-Smart Agriculture

· Food and Nutrition Security and Food Safety

· Inclusive and Resilient Rural Development

· Knowledge-based economy and society

Global capacity and technical expertise of FAO, has made it possible for the Organization to support the initiatives of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran. A support that aims to reinforce Iran’s existing institutional structure and capabilities for:

· Promoting more comprehensive and cross-cutting interventions

· Engaging the participation of all pertinent stakeholders

· Mobilizing support from other external entities

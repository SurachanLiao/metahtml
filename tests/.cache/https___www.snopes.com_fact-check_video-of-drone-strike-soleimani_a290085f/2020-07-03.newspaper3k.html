<p>This is not a genuine video of the drone attack on Soleimani but a clip from the mobile video game &#8220;AC-130 Gunship Simulator: Special Ops Squadron&#8221; from <a href="http://www.byteconveyor.com/p/blog-page.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Byte Conveyor Studio</a>.</p>
<p>Byte Conveyor Studio uploaded the official version of this clip to its YouTube page in March 2015 with the following caption:</p>
<blockquote><p>Development preview of our upcoming game for mobile platforms, &#8220;AC-130 Gunship Simulator: Special Ops Squadron&#8221;. Voted TOP 50 2014 App of the Year at SlideDB.</p>
<p>During the Vietnam War, AC-130 Gunships flew air interdiction and armed reconnaissance missions over the Ho Chi Minh trail with the objective of disrupting the North Vietnamese supply lines.<br>
The Gunship was extremely successful in that role, destroying tens of thousands of supply vehicles heading for the front lines.</p></blockquote>

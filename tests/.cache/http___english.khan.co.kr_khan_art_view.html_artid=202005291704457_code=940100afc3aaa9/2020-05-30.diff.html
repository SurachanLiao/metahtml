This day, the Coupang logistics center in Goyang, Gyeonggi-do, where a COVID-19 case was confirmed, was also closed, and vehicle entry was prohibited. Kweon Ho-wook, Senior Reporter / Yonhap News</ins></p><p><ins>The cluster transmission of COVID-19 at the Coupang logistics center in Bucheon, Gyeonggi-do again revealed the people who could not afford to temporarily “pause.” Some people had to make a living working multiple jobs day and night.</ins></p><p><ins>In order to sustain the increasing amount of  “untact” consumption, someone had to go to work everyday to a logistics center where distancing was difficult.</ins></p><p><ins>According to the movements of the confirmed COVID-19 cases from the Bucheon logistics center released by the local governments on May 28, A, who lives in Incheon, worked two jobs: one at a call center, and the other at the logistics center. From 9 a.m. until 6 p.m. on May 22, A worked at the call center. Then from the afternoon of May 23, a Saturday, until 3 a.m. the next day, he worked part time at the Bucheon logistics center. On May 25, Monday, he went back to work at the call center. B, another person confirmed to be COVID-19-positive, worked as a temporary part-time assistant for the emergency care (dolbom) classes at an elementary school from May 21 to 22, while working at the logistics center from April 8 until May 22.</ins></p><p><ins>In the transcript of a meeting just before the Bucheon logistics center was shut down (afternoon of May 25) obtained by the Kyunghyang Shinmun, the first thing that one worker worried about was his other job. When a company representative notified the workers of the closure and explained, “The people who have not been contacted separately at present have not come in direct contact with the positive cases,” the worker first asked if he could go and work at his other job. When the representative replied, “I’m not sure about that,” he further asked, “Can the people who also have another job go to work today and tomorrow?”</ins></p><p><ins>At the first birthday party of a child--believed to be the transmission point of the first COVID-19 case in the Bucheon logistics center--there was also a photographer who worked two jobs. The photographer, who was confirmed COVID-19-positive on May 22, worked as a taxi driver on weekdays. An employee at the call center in Guro-gu, Seoul whose infection was confirmed in March also delivered vegetable juice in the early morning. A man in his twenties in Gumi-si, Gyeongsangbuk-do, who was confirmed around the same time, delivered goods at a supermarket from 11 a.m. and from 5 p.m. until 3 a.m. the next day, he worked at a restaurant.</ins></p><p><ins>Coupang, the nation’s number one online shopping mall, had been praised for playing a major role in helping consumers with their grocery shopping amidst the COVID-19 outbreak. When COVID-19 fiercely spread in the Daegu area in February, orders for “Rocket Delivery,” which Coupang boasts of, had surged. The company also became popular for changing its delivery methods allowing people to receive their goods without coming into contact with the couriers in order to reduce contact with consumers. Since then, untact consumption has significantly increased to prevent the transmission of infectious diseases, but behind all this, there were people who had to work in high intensity contact labor in a crowded environment in order to deliver the increasing number of orders.</ins></p><p><ins>Workers at the logistics center say that the system makes it impossible for workers to avoid close contact when stacking, wrapping and moving the goods. The COVID-19 cases at the Bucheon logistics center who did not hold multiple jobs often had to put up with crazy schedules, working nights and having days off, in order to handle all the deliveries. A female resident of Incheon in her twenties worked at the logistics center from 11 p.m. until 8 a.m. the next day. A man in his fifties also boarded the shuttle bus after getting off work at the logistics center at around 8 a.m. when most people headed to work.</ins></p><p><ins>Even after the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed at the Bucheon logistics center on May 23, the center looked for workers sending a message out to its workforce asking those who could come to work in the afternoon to reply with “afternoon possible” up until May 25. The afternoon shift starts at 5 p.m. and ends at 2 a.m. the next day.</ins></p><p><ins>The logistics center, notorious for the high intensity of labor required, had conditions that allowed a large number of people whose livelihoods were affected by COVID-19 to enter. Such centers are always short on workers and people can go straight to work even without any particular skills. A worker who worked at the logistics center said many people who were pushed out of manufacturing after the COVID-19 outbreak and self-employed small business owners as well as those who held other delivery jobs came to work at the logistics center. C, who used to work at the Bucheon logistics center right up till the temporary shutdown, said, “When I talked to the people at work, they were mostly workers from airports, the service industry, and students--people primarily hit by COVID-19.”</ins></p><p><ins>As of 11 a.m. on May 28, 82 COVID-19-positive cases have been confirmed in connection with the Coupang logistics center in Bucheon. These cases were all confirmed within five days since the first patient was confirmed on May 23. Of the confirmed cases, 63 were workers who had worked at the Bucheon logistics center.</ins></p><p class="linetop"><ins>Copyright The Kyunghyang Shinmun. All rights reserved.

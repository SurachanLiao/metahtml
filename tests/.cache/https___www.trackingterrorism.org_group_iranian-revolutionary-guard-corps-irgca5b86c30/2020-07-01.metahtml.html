<p>Groups and individuals included in TRAC's database range from actual perpetrators of&#160;<span class="546314913-20052012">social or political violence</span>&#160;to more passive groups that support or condone (perhaps unwittingly)&#160;<span class="546314913-20052012">such&#160;</span>violence. The spectrum of violence represented by these groups is vast, from Jihadists who bomb train stations to financial institutions that transfer funds.

<div><p><strong>KOMPAS.com</strong> - Most people look to plastic surgery as a way of turning back time. But Kim Jong-un, the 27-year-old heir to the North Korean regime, has reportedly taken the opposite tack by going under the knife to look more like his grandfather.</p><p> Speculation is rife in North and South Korea over the striking similarity between Kim Jong-un and Kim Il-sung, the founder of the family dynasty.</p><p> Gone is the slender youth shown in earlier pictures of the youngest son of ailing North Korean leader Kim Jong-il.</p><p> His first official photographs reveal an unmistakable resemblance with his deeply respected grandfather, with the same chubby jowls, double chin and down-turned mouth. He also favours the family's trademark swept-back hairstyle.</p><p class="ads-on-body"></p><p> South Korean newspapers suggest the new look is all part of a concerted effort to raise the hitherto unknown prospective leader&#8217;s standing with the public.</p><p> He has had a dizzying rise to prominence. Until the past few weeks, he had never even been named by the North Korean media and before a recent Worker&#8217;s Party conference, when he was promoted to senior positions within the government and the military, only a few grainy images of him had been seen.</p><p> It is no surprise, then, that his handlers feel that he may need a little help to make his mark.</p><p class="ads-on-body"></p><p> The Dong-A Ilbo newspaper in South Korea said the Pyongyang regime was hoping to cement Kim&#8217;s position as the country&#8217;s next leader through &#8216;a reincarnation of North Korea&#8217;s late founder.&#8217;</p><p> Another report said North Koreans were also speculating that Kim may have had some cosmetic help with his new look.</p><p> &#8216;A lot of people in South Korea have pointed out that Kim&#8217;s face is very different from when he was young, particularly the shape of his chin,&#8217; said Professor Toshimitsu Shigemura, an expert on North Korea at&#160; Tokyo&#8217;s Waseda University.</p><p> &#8216;From previous photos, everyone had remarked that he looked nothing like his grandfather, so the change is quite dramatic,&#8217; he said in an interview.</p><p> Kim Il-Sung, officially referred to as the &#8216;Great Leader&#8217; in North Korea, ran the country from its founding in 1948 until his death in 1994, when his son, Kim Jong-il took over the reins of power.</p><p class="liftdown_v2_tanda"></p>                    <p class="fb-quote"></p>

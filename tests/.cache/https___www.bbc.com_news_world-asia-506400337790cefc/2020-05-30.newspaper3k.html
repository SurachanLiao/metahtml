<p class="story-body__introduction">North Korea has officially opened a new town its media is calling the "epitome of modern civilisation". </p><p>Leader Kim Jong-un cut the red ribbon at Samjiyon near Mount Paektu in the north - hailed as one of the country's most important construction projects.</p><p>State media KCNA said the town - which is able to accommodate 4,000 families - boasts new apartments, a ski slope, and a stadium amongst other facilities.</p><p>However, forced labour is said to have gone into the construction of Samjiyon.</p><p>And the town - even if it lives up to state media billing - will be an outlier in North Korea, where the majority of people live in poor conditions. </p><p class="bbccom_advert">

<p>According to non-governmental organisation the <a href="https://www.ncnk.org/" class="story-body__link-external">National Committee on North Korea</a>, many "suffer from shortages of food, fuel, electricity, running water and other necessities".</p>

        <h2 class="story-body__crosshead">What does the town look like?</h2><p>According to Colin Zwirko, a correspondent at specialist site NK News, the town is a "model" of sorts.</p><p>"As it appears now, it [has] nice clean facades and unique, ornately designed buildings that would not resemble really any other town in North Korea," he told the BBC. </p><p>"Someone roaming around Samjiyon as a tourist would not stumble into less well-kept areas away from the main road, as is the case in Pyongyang and other cities."</p><p>Mr Zwirko added that the town is "quite small and walkable", measuring around 2-3km in either direction. </p>

        <h2 class="story-body__crosshead">When did construction begin?</h2><p>Mr Kim visited Samjiyon town exactly two years ago, where he first announced a big "rebuilding" project.</p><p>But it has not exactly been built from the ground up. </p><p>A town already existed before the reconstruction. Some buildings were remodelled, while many more were torn down and replaced with new buildings, according to Mr Zwirko.</p><p>State media <a href="https://www.nknews.org/2018/07/samjiyon-county-construction-project-includes-400-new-buildings-images-reveal/" class="story-body__link-external">previously reported that more than 450 new buildings would be constructed</a>, including industrial and recreational facilities.</p><p>KCNA said the town had undergone a "drastic change", <a href="https://kcnawatch.org/newstream/1575356451-925187476/detailed-report-on-construction-of-township-area-of-samjiyon-county" class="story-body__link-external">describing it as a "utopia town under socialism". </a></p><p>It is not clear if anyone has moved in, but the town was previously home to some residents - though it is also unclear how many. </p><h2 class="story-body__crosshead">What has gone into building it?</h2><p>It's not known how much money has gone into construction of the town.</p><p>But construction happened at a time when North Korea is under tough sanctions, and its completion shows how much importance the government placed on the project.</p><p>Mr Zwirko said the state "pushed construction regardless of resources, and regardless of lack of access to better building materials due to sanctions".</p><p>There is also evidence, said Mr Zwirko, that forced labour was used to complete the projects. </p>

        <p>"We have seen evidence of forced labour in terms of local civilians working on the project," he said. "State media even boasts of such work, though [they call] them volunteers."</p><p>It is not uncommon for local civilians to be "forced" to work on such projects, and locals are often "required to contribute to construction projects by working and/or providing resources".</p><p>"Typically people either comply or some reports tell of [them] bribing their way out," said Mr Zwirko. </p><h2 class="story-body__crosshead">Why is the project important?</h2><p>Firstly, for its proximity to Mount Paektu - considered to be a sacred mountain in North Korea and said to be the birthplace of Kim Jong-un's father.</p><p>"It's the town's significance as the [reported] birthplace of Kim Jong Il that makes it the big important state construction project that it is," said Mr Zwirko.</p><p>The town has also been presented as a model for other towns in the country to look up to.</p><p>In his annual new year's address this year, Mr Kim directly referenced Samjiyon, <a href="https://www.ncnk.org/resources/publications/kimjongun_2019_newyearaddress.pdf/file_view" class="story-body__link-external">calling it an "ideal socialist village".</a></p><p>"The whole party, the entire army, and all the people should turn out to transform Samjiyon into a model of modern mountainous city, an ideal socialist village," he said in his speech. </p>

        <p>The opening of the town is just one part of a bigger scheme. It's the second stage of a three-stage plan to boost the entire county the town is located in.</p><p>The three-stage construction project is expected to be complete by October 2020. </p><p>So though the town itself has been officially opened, Mr Zwirko has described it as a "soft opening".</p><p>"Satellite imagery shows a lot of planned facilities such as the hotel resort around the ski hill are not complete and we haven't seen if buses are ready to serve the town yet.</p><p>"This to me looks like more of a soft opening designed to boost morale, and to perhaps allow some money to be recouped through small-scale tourism this winter before the big proper opening next October."</p>

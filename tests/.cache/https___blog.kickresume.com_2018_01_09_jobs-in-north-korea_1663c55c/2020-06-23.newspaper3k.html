<p>During the 1990s, <strong>all teachers had to learn the accordion</strong>. Many say this requirement remains to this day.</p>
<p>Accordions are often called &#8220;the people&#8217;s instrument&#8221;. If you can&#8217;t quite imagine anyone being this crazy about accordions, check out this North Korean take on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBgMeunuviE">A-Ha&#8217;s Take On Me.&#160;</a></p>
<p>Keep in mind that as a music teacher you&#8217;d be required to make your students truly&#160;<strong>master their instrument</strong>. For a reference of the students&#8217; abilities, here&#8217;s a video of North Korean children <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSedE5sU3uc">mastering the guitar</a>. Creepy or cute?</p>
<h2>5. Tour Guide</h2>
<img class="size-full wp-image-4568" src="https://d3ibl6bxs79jg9.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/http-cdn.cnn_.com-cnnnext-dam-assets-131202121054-5-north-korea-tourism-kim-statues.jpg" alt="Jobs In North Korea" width="1100" height="619"><p>Being a tour guide is one of the jobs in North Korea that require most responsibility.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, tourism has been on the rise in North Korea. It&#8217;s estimated, that every year, around <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/22/you-would-have-to-be-a-lunatic-tourists-to-north-korea-describe-risks-and-rewards">6,000 Western tourists</a> visit the secretive country.</p>
<p>Still, tourists aren&#8217;t allowed to explore the coutnry on their own. They&#8217;re forced to rely on a tour guide.</p>
<p>As a tour guide, you&#8217;d essentially be the keyholder. It&#8217;d be your responsibility to watch every move the foreign visitors make and show them the country in the best possible light.</p>
<p>You&#8217;d have the following <strong>responsibilities:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ensuring tourists don&#8217;t take any photos of the military or pictures reflecting poverty,</li>
<li>Sticking to the designated routes,</li>
<li>Making sure no tourists leave their hotel unescorted,</li>
<li>Admire the dear leaders and all their accomplishments during the tours,</li>
<li>Ensure that tourists bow to the statues and the bodies of former leaders Kim Il Sung ad Kim Jong Il.</li>
</ul>
<h2>6. Tailor</h2>
<img class="size-full wp-image-4569" src="https://d3ibl6bxs79jg9.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-12-at-1.13.40-PM.png" alt="Jobs In North Korea" width="1176" height="769"><p>If you&#8217;re looking for a job in the fashion industry, get ready to get busy.</p>
<p>Between 2016 and 2017, North Korea exported <a href="http://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2107584/clothing-becomes-north-koreas-main-export-china-after">$166.82 million</a> worth of men&#8217;s waterproof jackets alone.</p>
<p>North Korea exports a lot of clothes, but at the same time they&#8217;re always looking for local fashion designers to design clothes that <strong>comply with the state regulations.</strong></p>
<p>If you were to design clothes for casual wear in North Korea, &#160;you&#8217;d have to follow these <strong>job&#160;guidelines:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Eliminate any influence of Western fashion such as short skirts, design brands, bright colors, or indecent patterns.</li>
<li>Your main material will be vynalon. A stiff, synthetic fiber created in North Korea in the 195o&#8217;s. This material is used for both uniforms and casual clothes.</li>
<li>Remember, no denim is allowed, as jeans represent the capitalist USA.</li>
</ol>

Especially, when you consider the number of uniforms that has to be made every year.</p>
<p>People in North Korea wear&#160;<strong>uniforms</strong> regardless of their age and gender.&#160;Children wear pioneer uniforms, students wear school uniforms, and understandably, the military requires thousands of uniforms for its members.</p>
<h2>7. Hairdresser</h2>
<img class="wp-image-4555 size-full" src="https://d3ibl6bxs79jg9.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/ap107251477025.jpg" alt="Jobs In North Korea" width="1500" height="1000"><p>As a hairdresser in North Korea, your creativity would be somewhat limited. You would be required to have a perfect knowledge of the <a href="http://newsfeed.time.com/2013/02/25/these-are-north-koreas-28-state-approved-hairstyles/">28 state-approved hairstyles</a>.</p>
<p>Allegedly, only <strong>18 hairstyles for women</strong> and <strong>10 for men</strong> are allowed in North Korea.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a few <strong>basic rules</strong> you&#8217;d have to learn before the interview:</p>
<p>Single ladies are allowed to keep their hair longer, while married women must cut their hair short.</p>
<p>As for men, they have to keep their hair no longer than 2 inches. Older men, however, can get away with 3 inches.</p>
<p>As a hairdresser, don&#8217;t even think about copying the leader&#8217;s look. Kim Jong Un has put a trademark on his side-shaved swept-back style.</p>
<img class="wp-image-4563 size-full" src="https://d3ibl6bxs79jg9.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/kim-jong-un1.jpg" alt="Jobs In North Korea" width="664" height="441"><h2>8. Sculptor</h2>
<img class="wp-image-4562" src="https://d3ibl6bxs79jg9.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-12-at-10.22.01-AM.png" alt="Jobs in North Korea" width="1280" height="860"><p>Overall, this is a boring job. You&#8217;ll have a multiple options as to what statues to create. Kim Il Sung, Kim Jong Il or Kim Jong Un.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you <strong>would never run out of job opportunities</strong>. There&#8217;s <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/asia/north-korea/galleries/what-you-didn-t-know-about-north-korea/but-there-are-34-000-kim-il-sung-statues/">34,000 statues</a> of Kim Il Sung, the country&#8217;s founder, making it one for every 750 citizens.</p>
<p>If you want your artworks to be treated with respect, then becoming a sculptor in North Korea might be the perfect job for you! Everyone who passes the leaders&#8217; monuments has to<strong> bow three times to the statues</strong>.</p>
<p>On top of that, when a tourist wants to take a photo of these statues, they have to fit the entirety of the statue in the picture. Otherwise, you risk punishment for accidentally cropping of Kim Jong Il&#8217;s feet from your photo.</p>
<h2>9. Academia</h2>
<img class="wp-image-4606" src="https://d3ibl6bxs79jg9.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/72634178_exercisescreenshot1.png.jpeg" alt="Jobs In North Korea" width="1280" height="720"><p>Current job openings:</p>

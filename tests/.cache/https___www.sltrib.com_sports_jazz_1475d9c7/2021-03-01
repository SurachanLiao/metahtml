Durant lost the ball, kicked it up to Ronnie Price at the old Key Arena, and Price let the ball bounce a couple of extra times to ensure the assist would count, before &lt;a href=\&quot;https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=8258397&amp;itype=NGPSID\&quot; target=_blank&gt;finishing the breakaway dunk&lt;/a&gt; with 35 seconds left on the clock.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;ZGAOJ3T4PJAQ5NTSW5J7RCPARQ&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;_id&quot;:1614298515679,&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[]},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Boozer took that ball home that night as a memento — and with it, the Jazz’s ability to get a regular-season triple-double ever again.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;OADLWDMBWVEO5C7BSNCS2EY4VM&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;_id&quot;:1614298515680,&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[]},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;OK, maybe that’s journalistic malpractice. We have no proof Boozer stole the Jazz’s ability to get a triple-double. But what other explanation is there for the Jazz’s drought? Since that moment in an arena that’s no longer used for NBA basketball, against a franchise that’s now in Oklahoma City, the Jazz have had a grand total of &lt;i&gt;zero&lt;/i&gt; triple-doubles in the regular season.

In fact, 32 teams have gotten triple-doubles, including three teams that no longer exist: the New Jersey Nets, the Charlotte Bobcats, and the New Orleans Hornets. If you merge those teams with their extant franchises, the fewest any other team in the league has gotten is &lt;i&gt;seven.&lt;/i&gt; The woeful New York Knicks have had seven triple-doubles in the last 13 years, and the Jazz can’t get a single one.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;FLA2ZDMKWNBOBKZHCABJWH52OA&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;raw_html&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;BSYYQUPLFBAPXLXDXIILQN2B4A&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:[]},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;div class=\&quot;flourish-embed flourish-chart\&quot; data-src=\&quot;visualisation/5399598\&quot;&gt;&lt;script src=\&quot;https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js\&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;ZIWZEFRVWVEYZCY5Y32WB6S77Q&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;_id&quot;:1614298515685,&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[]},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The Oklahoma City Thunder have far and away the most triple-doubles since then, with 148. Perhaps Boozer gifted the triple-double magic to the Supersonics, who took it with them to Oklahoma.

In fact, he joins 137 players in the NBA who have picked up a triple-double since Boozer’s mystical 2008 performance. LeBron James has 83 of them since then, James Harden has 52, and Nikola Jokic has 48.

I’m sure you remember Ben Uzoh — oh, you don’t? He averaged four points, two rebounds, and two assists per game in 60 total NBA appearances and still managed to pick one up. Tony Wroten got one for the Process Sixers. Terrence Williams got one, as did T.J. McConnell. Mario Hezonja, Greivis Vazquez, even Chuck Hayes — Hayes averaged 3.7 points and 1.2 assists per game in his whole career! — got one.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;FCQH3Y7WFFCDHLMB6ZOFGM73VM&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;raw_html&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;WCE7U53WZJEPPIO4MLJB3I2GQQ&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:[]},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;div class=\&quot;flourish-embed flourish-chart\&quot; data-src=\&quot;visualisation/5399754\&quot;&gt;&lt;script src=\&quot;https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js\&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;FMEMQ64MZZD7ZCDNQ6U5VE33ZM&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;_id&quot;:1614298515690,&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[]},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;And yet, the Jazz have had the very triple-double capable talents of Deron Williams, Andrei Kirilenko, Mehmet Okur, Paul Millsap, Gordon Hayward, Derrick Favors, Devin Harris, Al Jefferson, Joe Ingles, Ricky Rubio, Donovan Mitchell, Bojan Bogdanovic, and Mike Conley come through, and ended up with zero regular-season triple-doubles. There wasn’t ever a game where teams doubled Big Al on the block, and he ended up kicking it out 10 times? There hasn’t been a game where peak Deron didn’t have a missed shot bounce his way 10 times? It seems like magic.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;LQWKSPOVSZB7FDCRB3M62CZIRI&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;_id&quot;:1614298515691,&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[]},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;OK, there’s definitely a certain logic to what’s going on. Jazz coach Quin Snyder’s system is very democratic with the ball, so it’s unusual to see one player garner very many assists. Just take a look at Rubio’s assist numbers before and after his Jazz career: He averaged 8.3 per game with Minnesota, then fell to 5.7 per game with the Jazz, then bounced back up to 8.8 per game with Phoenix last season.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;OF7C4KHG45FBXCUO5BKR7SVG3Y&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;_id&quot;:1614298515692,&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[]},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;And rebounding duties have been vacuumed up by the big men, usually Jefferson or Gobert.

There have been 26 games since in which a Jazz player got at least eight points, eight rebounds, and eight assists. Williams did it six times, Hayward seven. Ingles has three times, including &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.nba.com/jazz/news/joe-ingles-didnt-need-triple-double-make-special-night-better\&quot; target=_blank&gt;one close brush on Autism Awareness Night&lt;/a&gt;. Jazz PGs Conley and Rubio both came close twice, and even Gobert had eight assists once. Just to show how wacky triple-doubles can be, even plug-in point guards Earl Watson and Shelvin Mack both have come very close. No dice for anyone in getting over the top.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;EQXIKYYQOZAG5FTT3SEH5EGVIQ&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;_id&quot;:1614298515694,&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[]},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The Jazz hadn’t yet had two triple-double scares in one night — before Wednesday’s win against the Lakers.

Even Miye Oni delivered in an expanded role, nailing a pair of 3s and grabbing a couple offensive rebounds to generate some crucial extra possessions.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;7N3ORDOJSNFSFH2QJFVALXG65E&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;_id&quot;:1614492237244,&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[]},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“It’s crazy — you can go down the list about who we can get involved,” Mitchell said. “It’s crazy how many options we have.”&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;UJYUND5YBVCIZNJWF3J4VFNRYU&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;_id&quot;:1614492237245,&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[]},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;It’s also crazy how they found that extra gear after coming out so apparently weary; crazy how they turned a potential trap game into another eventual blowout; crazy how thy saved themselves from a second consecutive defeat (his time against a less-than-illustrious opponent) that would have empowered disbelieving critics to call into question all their previous strong play and dismiss it as fool’s gold.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;M7SETMMZ3BFR5INOLXALHK3S24&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;_id&quot;:1614492237246,&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[]},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Seems as though Snyder was right after all: These Jazz don’t get to be tired.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;5IZCYVWCORAC7EV6JFI5NB3D2M&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;_id&quot;:1614492237247,&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[]},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“I mean, we did get in at 3 a.m. or whatever time was … but, yeah, the schedule is what it is — every team is going through it, we’re not the only team that’s playing back-to-backs, or have flights getting in late or whatever,” noted Ingles. “You can probably tell with my eyes how glassy they are.

Last year, none of the bench lineups were effective at all. The lineups with even four starters were only average, and once they had more bench players, they were losing leads built by the starters, and fast. So Snyder tried to minimize the time where they played with anything less than 4 starters.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;MYH62DI4UJDFHIGMJTIETZC2AU&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[]},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;2. This year, the lineups with two starters have been really good. That’s typically Rudy Gobert and Mike Conley, along with some combination of Jordan Clarkson, Georges Niang, Joe Ingles, and Miye Oni. In those minutes, the Jazz have outscored teams by 14 points per 100 possessions. That’s meant Snyder can play everyone fewer minutes, and there’s much less of a white-knuckle ride in the bench times.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;JBUKCDXITBBGDD6XXR4VJM4EAA&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[]},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;3.

All of a sudden, the Jazz can, and frequently do, build big leads while only having two starters on the floor.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;VR7DN7JAFBBLLLQIKR2S37PBXM&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[]},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Normally, I might be a little bit worried about this as a methodology for team success, because teams play their bench lineups less during the playoffs. 16 minutes of bench minutes become eight, meaning there’s about half the time for bench players to make a positive impact. But truthfully, given that the starters have been more effective too, the Jazz get the best of both worlds — they’re just a quality, well-rounded team with very few holes.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;QTN2UW446ZF7XDQYY65UAOUX6U&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;header&quot;,&quot;level&quot;:2,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[]},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;2.

But that’s when Mitchell can sneak down a little earlier and help his guy out — Gobert’s got his side of the court. On the other hand, it’s also a hard play because Leonard’s hands are so good.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;V3ECNFDFTJAELJP67U24SWNMRM&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[],&quot;_id&quot;:1613832096064},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;That was something I saw repeatedly: it wasn’t very frequent that the Jazz made defensive rebounding mistakes, or nor was it frequent that they weren’t trying, but that the Clippers’ length gave them significant problems.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;ARKP4FSW2NG3JDQAJNY2XGA7XU&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[],&quot;_id&quot;:1613832096065},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;So that’s a real question for this team in the playoffs: they’ve rebounded extremely well despite only having one big player at his position — Gobert. Will they still be able to do that against the league’s taller teams? I think that’s still up in the air. This is nitpicky, but you do wish the Jazz had a big rebounding forward to play that role against terrific length.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;GAHFQRMBIJGGHEUW5BTZXOCW6Q&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;header&quot;,&quot;level&quot;:2,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[],&quot;_id&quot;:1613832096066},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;2.

Both players are actually very capable perimeter defenders, but they can’t be asked to do both — the Jazz need to rotate and scramble out in those possessions.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;S2TSKYWLXRCGFLF5EP4S3GNXAQ&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[],&quot;_id&quot;:1613832096069},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;This is a problem because Morris is a 50% 3-point shooter this season. Yes, literally, 50%. So I understand that Royce O’Neale is stunting off of Kawhi Leonard here, and yet, he does actually need to be more of a pest than this.&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;oembed_response&quot;,&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;youtube&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;NCOHGKSVVNG7PM5E3CPRFF4SBQ&quot;,&quot;raw_oembed&quot;:{&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Morris pick and pop&quot;,&quot;author_name&quot;:&quot;Andy Larsen&quot;,&quot;author_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/javaisfun&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;youtube&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:315,&quot;width&quot;:560,&quot;version&quot;:&quot;1.0&quot;,&quot;provider_name&quot;:&quot;YouTube&quot;,&quot;provider_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.youtube.com/&quot;,&quot;thumbnail_height&quot;:360,&quot;thumbnail_width&quot;:480,&quot;thumbnail_url&quot;:&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Rl3f4WFWRQs/hqdefault.jpg&quot;,&quot;html&quot;:&quot;&lt;iframe width=\&quot;560\&quot; height=\&quot;315\&quot; src=\&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rl3f4WFWRQs?feature=oembed\&quot; frameborder=\&quot;0\&quot; allow=\&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;https://youtu.be/Rl3f4WFWRQs&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;_id&quot;:1613832155756}},&quot;referent&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;https://youtu.be/Rl3f4WFWRQs&quot;,&quot;service&quot;:&quot;oembed&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;youtube&quot;,&quot;provider&quot;:&quot;https://www.youtube.com/oembed?maxwidth=560&amp;maxheight=340&amp;url=&quot;,&quot;referent_properties&quot;:{&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;_id&quot;:1613832155756}}}},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;YS773AJTERCHTIDB7E6GR5LY5Y&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[],&quot;_id&quot;:1613832096071},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Or, maybe better, just switch that play.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;FB2SUC5IFJFO7EYLUKP5HYBHQI&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[],&quot;_id&quot;:1613832096072},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Gobert comes in, and the Clippers are still small.

A full-strength Clippers team, with something to prove, coming off some rest, after the Jazz embarrassed them a little the game before, in the Staples Center... it’s probably the second or third-hardest game they’ll have all season, only behind their trips to Los Angeles to face the team in yellow — we’ll see if the Lakers are at full strength for those.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;W7SS6CREY5EJJKPJVLQP7WR7HE&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[],&quot;_id&quot;:1613832096079},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;And yet, the Jazz’s offense held up. They still had a 114 offensive rating overall, and a 101 in halfcourt, both of which are pretty good figures. They didn’t get to the rim much, but still got up a relatively good number of threes against the Clippers’ defense. They missed some open ones, but so did the Clippers.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;UYZL7I4YBVHMVL6FBYITIHK3EM&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[],&quot;_id&quot;:1613832096080},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;They also forced the Clippers to take a lot of midrange shots: the Clippers were a remarkable 11-17 from outside 14 feet but inside the 3-point line. Obviously, they do have a lot of players who can make those shots, but that’ll be near their high point. Now, you just wish that the Jazz had rebounded the misses they did get.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;HK4CJXMCYVDUDNSO74XFPOKK2I&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[],&quot;_id&quot;:1613832096081},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;I still think it’s a very good matchup for Rudy Gobert, even though he didn’t play well offensively tonight: the Clippers only took 15 shots at the rim. Having two centers he can play well against is nice, and the Clippers can’t go small for very many minutes overall.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;OUXYPEPFBVGHDJ3LS3KOS7AMYU&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[],&quot;_id&quot;:1613832096082},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;There was some worry about Bogdanovic’ performance after Wednesday, but he bounced back strongly.

Three things: That Hawks team was absolutely crushing the East (these Jazz lead the West by 2.5 games as of this writing), the Eastern Conference had less talent then than the West does now, and Korver was a suspect choice as an injury replacement.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;NF2V5L4ID5DJ5PYQBIUUBCBHSY&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[],&quot;_id&quot;:1613762337753},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Maaaaaybe Mike Conley makes it, owing to the combination of his ridiculous plus/minus numbers and rewarding the Jazz and sentimentality for never having made it before. But as good as he’s been, he’s averaging “only” 16.5 points and 5.8 assists on a balanced team. Given that Don and Damian Lillard are locks as the backcourt reserves, Mike would have to be a wild card. Does he make it over Devin Booker? Chris Paul? DeMar DeRozan? All of their teams have been successful and will warrant representation. And Shai Gilgeous-Alexander has been pretty much a one-man team for the Thunder.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;HGICXRBKUVDR7EW2FMTFK25XVI&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[],&quot;_id&quot;:1613762337754},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;It’d be awesome for Mike to finally make it, even in this bizarre year, but I’m dubious it’ll happen.

Elvis Costello.&lt;/b&gt; I think one time in my less-educated days, I heard one or two of his slower, mellower songs, like, say, “Shipbuilding” or “Indoor Fireworks,” and assumed all of his stuff was in that vein. Ha! Coincidentally, it was a guest spot he did that made me intrigued — his loosey-goosey vocal stylings on Jenny Lewis’ “Carpetbaggers” caught my ear. I’ve already begun to give some of his stuff a listen, and am impressed by his versatility: “Pump It Up” and “No Flag” are early faves.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;RYGEPVWKEBAZPMG2G4RVIOVYHQ&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[],&quot;_id&quot;:1613762337762},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;b&gt;2. Blondie.&lt;/b&gt; For all my love of punk music, I’ve never quite investigated the New Wave side of the movement as much. Pretty much everyone knows songs like “Heart of Glass” and “Call Me” and “One Way or Another.” But just watching Debbie Harry do her chameleonic thing is mesmerizing.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;HNW7XT6Z3BCXBIVJSZDZTMFCK4&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[],&quot;_id&quot;:1613762337763},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;b&gt;3. The Replacements.&lt;/b&gt; Noticing a theme? Lots of late-’70s/early-’80s acts with tangential ties to punk here, I’ll admit, though all with a bit more musicality. I know a few tracks here and there (I love “Bastards of Young”), but Bill Riley of ESPN 700 has given me a quick crash-course primer on stuff to immerse myself in that I’ll be getting to shortly.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;BMMAGLSVAFAAJFI2B4DVCIRORU&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[],&quot;_id&quot;:1613762337764},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;b&gt;4. Jeff Beck (Group)/Faces.&lt;/b&gt; Kinda cheating here in lumping together a solo artist, one of his bands, and an offshoot of that band, but whatever — it’s my list. Beck never had the same commercial success as fellow former Yardbirds guitarists Eric Clapton and Jimmy Page, but he’s incendiary in his own right. Meanwhile, I’m intrigued to hear what he did alongside the likes of Rod Stewart and Ronnie Wood, and what they did alongside the ex-members of The Small Faces.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;M5L2MV343JCOBITGUNSHIQM4QQ&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[],&quot;_id&quot;:1613762337765},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;b&gt;5. R.E.M.&lt;/b&gt; Look, I know all their hits, OK? I already love a ton of their stuff. Which makes me realize that there’s likely a treasure trove of deep album cuts that I’ve been missing out on all this time. Michael Stipe’s haunting, urgent vocals and Peter Buck’s jangly guitars are just such a cool combination that I’ve got to discover what didn’t make onto some “Greatest Hits” compilation.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;3SVESME2QBCNHM6Q52APDJ2ZTM&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[],&quot;_id&quot;:1613762337766},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;}],&quot;created_date&quot;:&quot;2021-02-19T15:32:57.386Z&quot;,&quot;revision&quot;:{&quot;revision_id&quot;:&quot;YUC37OEGM5GVRIPVXB7G4ZHBKI&quot;,&quot;parent_id&quot;:&quot;YTP6GSKMNFCWNEEOOPMO6LAFSA&quot;,&quot;editions&quot;:[&quot;default&quot;],&quot;branch&quot;:&quot;default&quot;,&quot;user_id&quot;:&quot;jbaird@sltrib.com&quot;,&quot;published&quot;:true},&quot;last_updated_date&quot;:&quot;2021-02-19T22:25:20.069Z&quot;,&quot;canonical_url&quot;:&quot;/sports/jazz/2021/02/19/weekly-run-newsletter&quot;,&quot;headlines&quot;:{&quot;basic&quot;:&quot;Weekly

The Jazz plucked Ingles off the scrap heap, and while he would go on to appear in 79 games for the team (and even start 32 of them), he averaged all of 5.0 points, 2.3 assists, and 2.2 rebounds in 21.2 minutes per game, while shooting 41.5% from the field and 35.6% from beyond the arc.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;FL6I5AVTMFDEJDHGR426GYFD4U&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[],&quot;_id&quot;:1613693906424},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;This season, going into the 24-5 Jazz’s rematch against L.A. on Friday, Ingles is averaging 11.8 points, 4.7 assists, and 3.5 rebounds in 26.6 minutes, while posting career-best shooting percentages (51.8% from the field, 45.1% from the arc, 88.2% from the stripe).&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;OX4BIZEUVFBV7OUYKNNM4PLEGM&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[],&quot;_id&quot;:1613693906425},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;For most of the season, he’s been a crucial cog in Utah’s much-improved second unit.

basket with regularity&lt;/a&gt;, and surged to a 15-point lead in the fourth quarter, Clippers big man Marcus Morris lofted a 3-point look that missed badly, prompting the team’s TV color analyst,

so, after Gobert wrapped up his 23-point, 20-rebound night (shooting 8 of 12 from the floor and 7 of 8 from the stripe) in Utah’s ninth consecutive victory, Ingles had zero problems discussing how

But on this night, as the Jazz faced rookie Kevin Durant and the Seattle SuperSonics, Boozer stayed in the game until the final minute despite a sizable Jazz cushion. Durant lost the ball, kicked it up to Ronnie Price at the old Key Arena, and Price let the ball bounce a couple of extra times to ensure the assist would count, before &lt;a href=\&quot;https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=8258397&amp;itype=NGPSID\&quot; target=_blank&gt;finishing the breakaway dunk&lt;/a&gt; with 35 seconds left on the clock.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;ZGAOJ3T4PJAQ5NTSW5J7RCPARQ&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;_id&quot;:1614298515679,&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[]},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Boozer took that ball home that night as a memento — and with it, the Jazz’s ability to get a regular-season triple-double ever again.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;OADLWDMBWVEO5C7BSNCS2EY4VM&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;_id&quot;:1614298515680,&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[]},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;OK, maybe that’s journalistic malpractice. We have no proof Boozer stole the Jazz’s ability to get a triple-double. But what other explanation is there for the Jazz’s drought? Since that moment in an arena that’s no longer used for NBA basketball, against a franchise that’s now in Oklahoma City, the Jazz have had a grand total of &lt;i&gt;zero&lt;/i&gt; triple-doubles in the regular season. Four thousand, seven hundred, and sixty-one days have passed since Boozer took that ball home with him.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;RGUP5AENLBGH5L4T4EZBUKXAXI&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;quote&quot;,&quot;content_elements&quot;:[{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;LOHJHGB3BFDV5DPPDOUTICLB34&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[]},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;b&gt;JAZZ AT PELICANS&lt;/b&gt;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;ZUXFBH7GDJAPNNJPF4AWKBJCVY&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[]},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;b&gt;When&lt;/b&gt; • Monday, 6 p.m. MT&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;2BXDYJETNJBQXOCWAI5JA7NSRQ&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[]},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;b&gt;TV&lt;/b&gt; • ATTSN&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;}],&quot;citation&quot;:{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;blockquote&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;VTOMBTKYWRHRTFEO66O6GYK7CY&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:[]}},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;JITOORD7PVDXRNMI52MJV2OWIQ&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;_id&quot;:1614607732905,&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[]},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Yes, there has been one Jazz playoff triple-double since then, which serves to only further highlight the ridiculousness of the Jazz’s regular-season streak.

If you merge those teams with their extant franchises, the fewest any other team in the league has gotten is &lt;i&gt;seven.&lt;/i&gt; The woeful New York Knicks have had seven triple-doubles in the last 13 years, and the Jazz can’t get a single one.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;FLA2ZDMKWNBOBKZHCABJWH52OA&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;raw_html&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;BSYYQUPLFBAPXLXDXIILQN2B4A&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:[]},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;div class=\&quot;flourish-embed flourish-chart\&quot; data-src=\&quot;visualisation/5399598\&quot;&gt;&lt;script src=\&quot;https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js\&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;ZIWZEFRVWVEYZCY5Y32WB6S77Q&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;_id&quot;:1614298515685,&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[]},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The Oklahoma City Thunder have far and away the most triple-doubles since then, with 148.

In fact, he joins 137 players in the NBA who have picked up a triple-double since Boozer’s mystical 2008 performance. LeBron James has 83 of them since then, James Harden has 52, and Nikola Jokic has 48.

I’m sure you remember Ben Uzoh — oh, you don’t? He averaged four points, two rebounds, and two assists per game in 60 total NBA appearances and still managed to pick one up. Tony Wroten got one for the Process Sixers. Terrence Williams got one, as did T.J. McConnell.

There wasn’t ever a game where teams doubled Big Al on the block, and he ended up kicking it out 10 times? There hasn’t been a game where peak Deron didn’t have a missed shot bounce his way 10 times?

Jazz coach Quin Snyder’s system is very democratic with the ball, so it’s unusual to see one player garner very many assists. Just take a look at Rubio’s assist numbers before and after his Jazz career: He averaged 8.3 per game with Minnesota, then fell to 5.7 per game with the Jazz, then bounced back up to 8.8 per game with Phoenix last season.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;OF7C4KHG45FBXCUO5BKR7SVG3Y&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;_id&quot;:1614298515692,&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[]},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;And rebounding duties have been vacuumed up by the big men, usually Jefferson or Gobert.

Last year, none of the bench lineups were effective at all. The lineups with even four starters were only average, and once they had more bench players, they were losing leads built by the starters, and fast. So Snyder tried to minimize the time where they played with anything less than 4 starters.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;MYH62DI4UJDFHIGMJTIETZC2AU&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[]},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;2. This year, the lineups with two starters have been really good. That’s typically Rudy Gobert and Mike Conley, along with some combination of Jordan Clarkson, Georges Niang, Joe Ingles, and Miye Oni. In those minutes, the Jazz have outscored teams by 14 points per 100 possessions. That’s meant Snyder can play everyone fewer minutes, and there’s much less of a white-knuckle ride in the bench times.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;JBUKCDXITBBGDD6XXR4VJM4EAA&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[]},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;3.

All of a sudden, the Jazz can, and frequently do, build big leads while only having two starters on the floor.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;VR7DN7JAFBBLLLQIKR2S37PBXM&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[]},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Normally, I might be a little bit worried about this as a methodology for team success, because teams play their bench lineups less during the playoffs. 16 minutes of bench minutes become eight, meaning there’s about half the time for bench players to make a positive impact. But truthfully, given that the starters have been more effective too, the Jazz get the best of both worlds — they’re just a quality, well-rounded team with very few holes.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;QTN2UW446ZF7XDQYY65UAOUX6U&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;header&quot;,&quot;level&quot;:2,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[]},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;2.

But that’s when Mitchell can sneak down a little earlier and help his guy out — Gobert’s got his side of the court. On the other hand, it’s also a hard play because Leonard’s hands are so good.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;V3ECNFDFTJAELJP67U24SWNMRM&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[],&quot;_id&quot;:1613832096064},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;That was something I saw repeatedly: it wasn’t very frequent that the Jazz made defensive rebounding mistakes, or nor was it frequent that they weren’t trying, but that the Clippers’ length gave them significant problems.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;ARKP4FSW2NG3JDQAJNY2XGA7XU&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[],&quot;_id&quot;:1613832096065},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;So that’s a real question for this team in the playoffs: they’ve rebounded extremely well despite only having one big player at his position — Gobert. Will they still be able to do that against the league’s taller teams? I think that’s still up in the air. This is nitpicky, but you do wish the Jazz had a big rebounding forward to play that role against terrific length.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;GAHFQRMBIJGGHEUW5BTZXOCW6Q&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;header&quot;,&quot;level&quot;:2,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[],&quot;_id&quot;:1613832096066},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;2.

Both players are actually very capable perimeter defenders, but they can’t be asked to do both — the Jazz need to rotate and scramble out in those possessions.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;S2TSKYWLXRCGFLF5EP4S3GNXAQ&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[],&quot;_id&quot;:1613832096069},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;This is a problem because Morris is a 50% 3-point shooter this season. Yes, literally, 50%. So I understand that Royce O’Neale is stunting off of Kawhi Leonard here, and yet, he does actually need to be more of a pest than this.&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;oembed_response&quot;,&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;youtube&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;NCOHGKSVVNG7PM5E3CPRFF4SBQ&quot;,&quot;raw_oembed&quot;:{&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Morris pick and pop&quot;,&quot;author_name&quot;:&quot;Andy Larsen&quot;,&quot;author_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/javaisfun&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;youtube&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:315,&quot;width&quot;:560,&quot;version&quot;:&quot;1.0&quot;,&quot;provider_name&quot;:&quot;YouTube&quot;,&quot;provider_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.youtube.com/&quot;,&quot;thumbnail_height&quot;:360,&quot;thumbnail_width&quot;:480,&quot;thumbnail_url&quot;:&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Rl3f4WFWRQs/hqdefault.jpg&quot;,&quot;html&quot;:&quot;&lt;iframe width=\&quot;560\&quot; height=\&quot;315\&quot; src=\&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rl3f4WFWRQs?feature=oembed\&quot; frameborder=\&quot;0\&quot; allow=\&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;https://youtu.be/Rl3f4WFWRQs&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;_id&quot;:1613832155756}},&quot;referent&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;https://youtu.be/Rl3f4WFWRQs&quot;,&quot;service&quot;:&quot;oembed&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;youtube&quot;,&quot;provider&quot;:&quot;https://www.youtube.com/oembed?maxwidth=560&amp;maxheight=340&amp;url=&quot;,&quot;referent_properties&quot;:{&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;_id&quot;:1613832155756}}}},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;YS773AJTERCHTIDB7E6GR5LY5Y&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[],&quot;_id&quot;:1613832096071},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Or, maybe better, just switch that play.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;FB2SUC5IFJFO7EYLUKP5HYBHQI&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[],&quot;_id&quot;:1613832096072},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Gobert comes in, and the Clippers are still small.

A full-strength Clippers team, with something to prove, coming off some rest, after the Jazz embarrassed them a little the game before, in the Staples Center... it’s probably the second or third-hardest game they’ll have all season, only behind their trips to Los Angeles to face the team in yellow — we’ll see if the Lakers are at full strength for those.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;W7SS6CREY5EJJKPJVLQP7WR7HE&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[],&quot;_id&quot;:1613832096079},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;And yet, the Jazz’s offense held up. They still had a 114 offensive rating overall, and a 101 in halfcourt, both of which are pretty good figures. They didn’t get to the rim much, but still got up a relatively good number of threes against the Clippers’ defense. They missed some open ones, but so did the Clippers.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;UYZL7I4YBVHMVL6FBYITIHK3EM&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[],&quot;_id&quot;:1613832096080},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;They also forced the Clippers to take a lot of midrange shots: the Clippers were a remarkable 11-17 from outside 14 feet but inside the 3-point line. Obviously, they do have a lot of players who can make those shots, but that’ll be near their high point. Now, you just wish that the Jazz had rebounded the misses they did get.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;HK4CJXMCYVDUDNSO74XFPOKK2I&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[],&quot;_id&quot;:1613832096081},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;I still think it’s a very good matchup for Rudy Gobert, even though he didn’t play well offensively tonight: the Clippers only took 15 shots at the rim. Having two centers he can play well against is nice, and the Clippers can’t go small for very many minutes overall.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;OUXYPEPFBVGHDJ3LS3KOS7AMYU&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[],&quot;_id&quot;:1613832096082},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;There was some worry about Bogdanovic’ performance after Wednesday, but he bounced back strongly.

Three things: That Hawks team was absolutely crushing the East (these Jazz lead the West by 2.5 games as of this writing), the Eastern Conference had less talent then than the West does now, and Korver was a suspect choice as an injury replacement.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;NF2V5L4ID5DJ5PYQBIUUBCBHSY&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[],&quot;_id&quot;:1613762337753},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Maaaaaybe Mike Conley makes it, owing to the combination of his ridiculous plus/minus numbers and rewarding the Jazz and sentimentality for never having made it before. But as good as he’s been, he’s averaging “only” 16.5 points and 5.8 assists on a balanced team. Given that Don and Damian Lillard are locks as the backcourt reserves, Mike would have to be a wild card. Does he make it over Devin Booker? Chris Paul? DeMar DeRozan? All of their teams have been successful and will warrant representation. And Shai Gilgeous-Alexander has been pretty much a one-man team for the Thunder.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;HGICXRBKUVDR7EW2FMTFK25XVI&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[],&quot;_id&quot;:1613762337754},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;It’d be awesome for Mike to finally make it, even in this bizarre year, but I’m dubious it’ll happen.

Elvis Costello.&lt;/b&gt; I think one time in my less-educated days, I heard one or two of his slower, mellower songs, like, say, “Shipbuilding” or “Indoor Fireworks,” and assumed all of his stuff was in that vein. Ha! Coincidentally, it was a guest spot he did that made me intrigued — his loosey-goosey vocal stylings on Jenny Lewis’ “Carpetbaggers” caught my ear. I’ve already begun to give some of his stuff a listen, and am impressed by his versatility: “Pump It Up” and “No Flag” are early faves.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;RYGEPVWKEBAZPMG2G4RVIOVYHQ&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[],&quot;_id&quot;:1613762337762},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;b&gt;2. Blondie.&lt;/b&gt; For all my love of punk music, I’ve never quite investigated the New Wave side of the movement as much. Pretty much everyone knows songs like “Heart of Glass” and “Call Me” and “One Way or Another.” But just watching Debbie Harry do her chameleonic thing is mesmerizing.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;HNW7XT6Z3BCXBIVJSZDZTMFCK4&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[],&quot;_id&quot;:1613762337763},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;b&gt;3. The Replacements.&lt;/b&gt; Noticing a theme? Lots of late-’70s/early-’80s acts with tangential ties to punk here, I’ll admit, though all with a bit more musicality. I know a few tracks here and there (I love “Bastards of Young”), but Bill Riley of ESPN 700 has given me a quick crash-course primer on stuff to immerse myself in that I’ll be getting to shortly.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;BMMAGLSVAFAAJFI2B4DVCIRORU&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[],&quot;_id&quot;:1613762337764},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;b&gt;4. Jeff Beck (Group)/Faces.&lt;/b&gt; Kinda cheating here in lumping together a solo artist, one of his bands, and an offshoot of that band, but whatever — it’s my list. Beck never had the same commercial success as fellow former Yardbirds guitarists Eric Clapton and Jimmy Page, but he’s incendiary in his own right. Meanwhile, I’m intrigued to hear what he did alongside the likes of Rod Stewart and Ronnie Wood, and what they did alongside the ex-members of The Small Faces.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;M5L2MV343JCOBITGUNSHIQM4QQ&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[],&quot;_id&quot;:1613762337765},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;b&gt;5. R.E.M.&lt;/b&gt; Look, I know all their hits, OK? I already love a ton of their stuff. Which makes me realize that there’s likely a treasure trove of deep album cuts that I’ve been missing out on all this time. Michael Stipe’s haunting, urgent vocals and Peter Buck’s jangly guitars are just such a cool combination that I’ve got to discover what didn’t make onto some “Greatest Hits” compilation.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;3SVESME2QBCNHM6Q52APDJ2ZTM&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[],&quot;_id&quot;:1613762337766},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;}],&quot;created_date&quot;:&quot;2021-02-19T15:32:57.386Z&quot;,&quot;revision&quot;:{&quot;revision_id&quot;:&quot;YUC37OEGM5GVRIPVXB7G4ZHBKI&quot;,&quot;parent_id&quot;:&quot;YTP6GSKMNFCWNEEOOPMO6LAFSA&quot;,&quot;editions&quot;:[&quot;default&quot;],&quot;branch&quot;:&quot;default&quot;,&quot;user_id&quot;:&quot;jbaird@sltrib.com&quot;,&quot;published&quot;:true},&quot;last_updated_date&quot;:&quot;2021-02-19T22:25:20.069Z&quot;,&quot;canonical_url&quot;:&quot;/sports/jazz/2021/02/19/weekly-run-newsletter&quot;,&quot;headlines&quot;:{&quot;basic&quot;:&quot;Weekly

The Jazz plucked Ingles off the scrap heap, and while he would go on to appear in 79 games for the team (and even start 32 of them), he averaged all of 5.0 points, 2.3 assists, and 2.2 rebounds in 21.2 minutes per game, while shooting 41.5% from the field and 35.6% from beyond the arc.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;FL6I5AVTMFDEJDHGR426GYFD4U&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[],&quot;_id&quot;:1613693906424},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;This season, going into the 24-5 Jazz’s rematch against L.A. on Friday, Ingles is averaging 11.8 points, 4.7 assists, and 3.5 rebounds in 26.6 minutes, while posting career-best shooting percentages (51.8% from the field, 45.1% from the arc, 88.2% from the stripe).&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;OX4BIZEUVFBV7OUYKNNM4PLEGM&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[],&quot;_id&quot;:1613693906425},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;For most of the season, he’s been a crucial cog in Utah’s much-improved second unit.

basket with regularity&lt;/a&gt;, and surged to a 15-point lead in the fourth quarter, Clippers big man Marcus Morris lofted a 3-point look that missed badly, prompting the team’s TV color analyst,

so, after Gobert wrapped up his 23-point, 20-rebound night (shooting 8 of 12 from the floor and 7 of 8 from the stripe) in Utah’s ninth consecutive victory, Ingles had zero problems discussing how

still with 2.5 seasons left in a Jazz uniform, was smarting from not taking full advantage of an eight-assist night a few weeks prior. But on this night, as the Jazz faced rookie Kevin Durant and the Seattle SuperSonics, Boozer stayed in the game until the final minute despite a sizable Jazz cushion. Durant lost the ball, kicked it up to Ronnie Price at the old Key Arena, and Price let the ball bounce a couple of extra times to ensure the assist would count, before &lt;a href=\&quot;https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=8258397&amp;itype=NGPSID\&quot; target=_blank&gt;finishing the breakaway dunk&lt;/a&gt; with 35 seconds left on the clock.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;ZGAOJ3T4PJAQ5NTSW5J7RCPARQ&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;_id&quot;:1614298515679,&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[]},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Boozer took that ball home that night as a memento — and with it, the Jazz’s ability to get a regular-season triple-double ever again.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;OADLWDMBWVEO5C7BSNCS2EY4VM&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;_id&quot;:1614298515680,&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[]},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;OK, maybe that’s journalistic malpractice. We have no proof Boozer stole the Jazz’s ability to get a triple-double. But what other explanation is there for the Jazz’s drought? Since that moment in an arena that’s no longer used for NBA basketball, against a franchise that’s now in Oklahoma City, the Jazz have had a grand total of &lt;i&gt;zero&lt;/i&gt; triple-doubles in the regular season. Four thousand, seven hundred, and sixty-one days have passed since Boozer took that ball home with him.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;RGUP5AENLBGH5L4T4EZBUKXAXI&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;quote&quot;,&quot;content_elements&quot;:[{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;LOHJHGB3BFDV5DPPDOUTICLB34&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[]},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;b&gt;JAZZ AT PELICANS&lt;/b&gt;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;ZUXFBH7GDJAPNNJPF4AWKBJCVY&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[]},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;b&gt;When&lt;/b&gt; • Monday, 6 p.m. MT&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;2BXDYJETNJBQXOCWAI5JA7NSRQ&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[]},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;b&gt;TV&lt;/b&gt; • ATTSN&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;}],&quot;citation&quot;:{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;blockquote&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;VTOMBTKYWRHRTFEO66O6GYK7CY&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:[]}},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;JITOORD7PVDXRNMI52MJV2OWIQ&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;_id&quot;:1614607732905,&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[]},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Yes, there has been one Jazz playoff triple-double since then, which serves to only further highlight the ridiculousness of the Jazz’s regular-season streak.

If you merge those teams with their extant franchises, the fewest any other team in the league has gotten is &lt;i&gt;seven.&lt;/i&gt; The woeful New York Knicks have had seven triple-doubles in the last 13 years, and the Jazz can’t get a single one.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;FLA2ZDMKWNBOBKZHCABJWH52OA&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;raw_html&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;BSYYQUPLFBAPXLXDXIILQN2B4A&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:[]},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;div class=\&quot;flourish-embed flourish-chart\&quot; data-src=\&quot;visualisation/5399598\&quot;&gt;&lt;script src=\&quot;https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js\&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;ZIWZEFRVWVEYZCY5Y32WB6S77Q&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;_id&quot;:1614298515685,&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[]},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The Oklahoma City Thunder have far and away the most triple-doubles since then, with 148.

In fact, he joins 137 players in the NBA who have picked up a triple-double since Boozer’s mystical 2008 performance. LeBron James has 83 of them since then, James Harden has 52, and Nikola Jokic has 48.

I’m sure you remember Ben Uzoh — oh, you don’t? He averaged four points, two rebounds, and two assists per game in 60 total NBA appearances and still managed to pick one up. Tony Wroten got one for the Process Sixers. Terrence Williams got one, as did T.J. McConnell.

There wasn’t ever a game where teams doubled Big Al on the block, and he ended up kicking it out 10 times? There hasn’t been a game where peak Deron didn’t have a missed shot bounce his way 10 times?

Jazz coach Quin Snyder’s system is very democratic with the ball, so it’s unusual to see one player garner very many assists. Just take a look at Rubio’s assist numbers before and after his Jazz career: He averaged 8.3 per game with Minnesota, then fell to 5.7 per game with the Jazz, then bounced back up to 8.8 per game with Phoenix last season.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;OF7C4KHG45FBXCUO5BKR7SVG3Y&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;_id&quot;:1614298515692,&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[]},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;And rebounding duties have been vacuumed up by the big men, usually Jefferson or Gobert.

Last year, none of the bench lineups were effective at all. The lineups with even four starters were only average, and once they had more bench players, they were losing leads built by the starters, and fast. So Snyder tried to minimize the time where they played with anything less than 4 starters.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;MYH62DI4UJDFHIGMJTIETZC2AU&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[]},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;2. This year, the lineups with two starters have been really good. That’s typically Rudy Gobert and Mike Conley, along with some combination of Jordan Clarkson, Georges Niang, Joe Ingles, and Miye Oni. In those minutes, the Jazz have outscored teams by 14 points per 100 possessions. That’s meant Snyder can play everyone fewer minutes, and there’s much less of a white-knuckle ride in the bench times.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;JBUKCDXITBBGDD6XXR4VJM4EAA&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[]},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;3.

All of a sudden, the Jazz can, and frequently do, build big leads while only having two starters on the floor.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;VR7DN7JAFBBLLLQIKR2S37PBXM&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[]},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Normally, I might be a little bit worried about this as a methodology for team success, because teams play their bench lineups less during the playoffs. 16 minutes of bench minutes become eight, meaning there’s about half the time for bench players to make a positive impact. But truthfully, given that the starters have been more effective too, the Jazz get the best of both worlds — they’re just a quality, well-rounded team with very few holes.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;QTN2UW446ZF7XDQYY65UAOUX6U&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;header&quot;,&quot;level&quot;:2,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[]},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;2.

But that’s when Mitchell can sneak down a little earlier and help his guy out — Gobert’s got his side of the court. On the other hand, it’s also a hard play because Leonard’s hands are so good.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;V3ECNFDFTJAELJP67U24SWNMRM&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[],&quot;_id&quot;:1613832096064},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;That was something I saw repeatedly: it wasn’t very frequent that the Jazz made defensive rebounding mistakes, or nor was it frequent that they weren’t trying, but that the Clippers’ length gave them significant problems.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;ARKP4FSW2NG3JDQAJNY2XGA7XU&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[],&quot;_id&quot;:1613832096065},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;So that’s a real question for this team in the playoffs: they’ve rebounded extremely well despite only having one big player at his position — Gobert. Will they still be able to do that against the league’s taller teams? I think that’s still up in the air. This is nitpicky, but you do wish the Jazz had a big rebounding forward to play that role against terrific length.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;GAHFQRMBIJGGHEUW5BTZXOCW6Q&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;header&quot;,&quot;level&quot;:2,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[],&quot;_id&quot;:1613832096066},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;2.

Both players are actually very capable perimeter defenders, but they can’t be asked to do both — the Jazz need to rotate and scramble out in those possessions.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;S2TSKYWLXRCGFLF5EP4S3GNXAQ&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[],&quot;_id&quot;:1613832096069},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;This is a problem because Morris is a 50% 3-point shooter this season. Yes, literally, 50%. So I understand that Royce O’Neale is stunting off of Kawhi Leonard here, and yet, he does actually need to be more of a pest than this.&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;oembed_response&quot;,&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;youtube&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;NCOHGKSVVNG7PM5E3CPRFF4SBQ&quot;,&quot;raw_oembed&quot;:{&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Morris pick and pop&quot;,&quot;author_name&quot;:&quot;Andy Larsen&quot;,&quot;author_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/javaisfun&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;youtube&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:315,&quot;width&quot;:560,&quot;version&quot;:&quot;1.0&quot;,&quot;provider_name&quot;:&quot;YouTube&quot;,&quot;provider_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.youtube.com/&quot;,&quot;thumbnail_height&quot;:360,&quot;thumbnail_width&quot;:480,&quot;thumbnail_url&quot;:&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Rl3f4WFWRQs/hqdefault.jpg&quot;,&quot;html&quot;:&quot;&lt;iframe width=\&quot;560\&quot; height=\&quot;315\&quot; src=\&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rl3f4WFWRQs?feature=oembed\&quot; frameborder=\&quot;0\&quot; allow=\&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;https://youtu.be/Rl3f4WFWRQs&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;_id&quot;:1613832155756}},&quot;referent&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;https://youtu.be/Rl3f4WFWRQs&quot;,&quot;service&quot;:&quot;oembed&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;youtube&quot;,&quot;provider&quot;:&quot;https://www.youtube.com/oembed?maxwidth=560&amp;maxheight=340&amp;url=&quot;,&quot;referent_properties&quot;:{&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;_id&quot;:1613832155756}}}},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;YS773AJTERCHTIDB7E6GR5LY5Y&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[],&quot;_id&quot;:1613832096071},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Or, maybe better, just switch that play.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;FB2SUC5IFJFO7EYLUKP5HYBHQI&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[],&quot;_id&quot;:1613832096072},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Gobert comes in, and the Clippers are still small.

A full-strength Clippers team, with something to prove, coming off some rest, after the Jazz embarrassed them a little the game before, in the Staples Center... it’s probably the second or third-hardest game they’ll have all season, only behind their trips to Los Angeles to face the team in yellow — we’ll see if the Lakers are at full strength for those.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;W7SS6CREY5EJJKPJVLQP7WR7HE&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[],&quot;_id&quot;:1613832096079},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;And yet, the Jazz’s offense held up. They still had a 114 offensive rating overall, and a 101 in halfcourt, both of which are pretty good figures. They didn’t get to the rim much, but still got up a relatively good number of threes against the Clippers’ defense. They missed some open ones, but so did the Clippers.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;UYZL7I4YBVHMVL6FBYITIHK3EM&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[],&quot;_id&quot;:1613832096080},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;They also forced the Clippers to take a lot of midrange shots: the Clippers were a remarkable 11-17 from outside 14 feet but inside the 3-point line. Obviously, they do have a lot of players who can make those shots, but that’ll be near their high point. Now, you just wish that the Jazz had rebounded the misses they did get.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;HK4CJXMCYVDUDNSO74XFPOKK2I&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[],&quot;_id&quot;:1613832096081},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;I still think it’s a very good matchup for Rudy Gobert, even though he didn’t play well offensively tonight: the Clippers only took 15 shots at the rim. Having two centers he can play well against is nice, and the Clippers can’t go small for very many minutes overall.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;OUXYPEPFBVGHDJ3LS3KOS7AMYU&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[],&quot;_id&quot;:1613832096082},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;There was some worry about Bogdanovic’ performance after Wednesday, but he bounced back strongly.

Three things: That Hawks team was absolutely crushing the East (these Jazz lead the West by 2.5 games as of this writing), the Eastern Conference had less talent then than the West does now, and Korver was a suspect choice as an injury replacement.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;NF2V5L4ID5DJ5PYQBIUUBCBHSY&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[],&quot;_id&quot;:1613762337753},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Maaaaaybe Mike Conley makes it, owing to the combination of his ridiculous plus/minus numbers and rewarding the Jazz and sentimentality for never having made it before. But as good as he’s been, he’s averaging “only” 16.5 points and 5.8 assists on a balanced team. Given that Don and Damian Lillard are locks as the backcourt reserves, Mike would have to be a wild card. Does he make it over Devin Booker? Chris Paul? DeMar DeRozan? All of their teams have been successful and will warrant representation. And Shai Gilgeous-Alexander has been pretty much a one-man team for the Thunder.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;HGICXRBKUVDR7EW2FMTFK25XVI&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[],&quot;_id&quot;:1613762337754},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;It’d be awesome for Mike to finally make it, even in this bizarre year, but I’m dubious it’ll happen.

Elvis Costello.&lt;/b&gt; I think one time in my less-educated days, I heard one or two of his slower, mellower songs, like, say, “Shipbuilding” or “Indoor Fireworks,” and assumed all of his stuff was in that vein. Ha! Coincidentally, it was a guest spot he did that made me intrigued — his loosey-goosey vocal stylings on Jenny Lewis’ “Carpetbaggers” caught my ear. I’ve already begun to give some of his stuff a listen, and am impressed by his versatility: “Pump It Up” and “No Flag” are early faves.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;RYGEPVWKEBAZPMG2G4RVIOVYHQ&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[],&quot;_id&quot;:1613762337762},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;b&gt;2. Blondie.&lt;/b&gt; For all my love of punk music, I’ve never quite investigated the New Wave side of the movement as much. Pretty much everyone knows songs like “Heart of Glass” and “Call Me” and “One Way or Another.” But just watching Debbie Harry do her chameleonic thing is mesmerizing.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;HNW7XT6Z3BCXBIVJSZDZTMFCK4&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[],&quot;_id&quot;:1613762337763},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;b&gt;3. The Replacements.&lt;/b&gt; Noticing a theme? Lots of late-’70s/early-’80s acts with tangential ties to punk here, I’ll admit, though all with a bit more musicality. I know a few tracks here and there (I love “Bastards of Young”), but Bill Riley of ESPN 700 has given me a quick crash-course primer on stuff to immerse myself in that I’ll be getting to shortly.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;BMMAGLSVAFAAJFI2B4DVCIRORU&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[],&quot;_id&quot;:1613762337764},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;b&gt;4. Jeff Beck (Group)/Faces.&lt;/b&gt; Kinda cheating here in lumping together a solo artist, one of his bands, and an offshoot of that band, but whatever — it’s my list. Beck never had the same commercial success as fellow former Yardbirds guitarists Eric Clapton and Jimmy Page, but he’s incendiary in his own right. Meanwhile, I’m intrigued to hear what he did alongside the likes of Rod Stewart and Ronnie Wood, and what they did alongside the ex-members of The Small Faces.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;M5L2MV343JCOBITGUNSHIQM4QQ&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[],&quot;_id&quot;:1613762337765},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;b&gt;5. R.E.M.&lt;/b&gt; Look, I know all their hits, OK? I already love a ton of their stuff. Which makes me realize that there’s likely a treasure trove of deep album cuts that I’ve been missing out on all this time. Michael Stipe’s haunting, urgent vocals and Peter Buck’s jangly guitars are just such a cool combination that I’ve got to discover what didn’t make onto some “Greatest Hits” compilation.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;3SVESME2QBCNHM6Q52APDJ2ZTM&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[],&quot;_id&quot;:1613762337766},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;}],&quot;created_date&quot;:&quot;2021-02-19T15:32:57.386Z&quot;,&quot;revision&quot;:{&quot;revision_id&quot;:&quot;YUC37OEGM5GVRIPVXB7G4ZHBKI&quot;,&quot;parent_id&quot;:&quot;YTP6GSKMNFCWNEEOOPMO6LAFSA&quot;,&quot;editions&quot;:[&quot;default&quot;],&quot;branch&quot;:&quot;default&quot;,&quot;user_id&quot;:&quot;jbaird@sltrib.com&quot;,&quot;published&quot;:true},&quot;last_updated_date&quot;:&quot;2021-02-19T22:25:20.069Z&quot;,&quot;canonical_url&quot;:&quot;/sports/jazz/2021/02/19/weekly-run-newsletter&quot;,&quot;headlines&quot;:{&quot;basic&quot;:&quot;Weekly

The Jazz plucked Ingles off the scrap heap, and while he would go on to appear in 79 games for the team (and even start 32 of them), he averaged all of 5.0 points, 2.3 assists, and 2.2 rebounds in 21.2 minutes per game, while shooting 41.5% from the field and 35.6% from beyond the arc.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;FL6I5AVTMFDEJDHGR426GYFD4U&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[],&quot;_id&quot;:1613693906424},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;This season, going into the 24-5 Jazz’s rematch against L.A. on Friday, Ingles is averaging 11.8 points, 4.7 assists, and 3.5 rebounds in 26.6 minutes, while posting career-best shooting percentages (51.8% from the field, 45.1% from the arc, 88.2% from the stripe).&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;OX4BIZEUVFBV7OUYKNNM4PLEGM&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[],&quot;_id&quot;:1613693906425},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;For most of the season, he’s been a crucial cog in Utah’s much-improved second unit.

basket with regularity&lt;/a&gt;, and surged to a 15-point lead in the fourth quarter, Clippers big man Marcus Morris lofted a 3-point look that missed badly, prompting the team’s TV color analyst,

so, after Gobert wrapped up his 23-point, 20-rebound night (shooting 8 of 12 from the floor and 7 of 8 from the stripe) in Utah’s ninth consecutive victory, Ingles had zero problems discussing how

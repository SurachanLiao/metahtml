But so far the response has been subdued. Yes, there has been ample news coverage, but there are no riots in response, no social movement to “clean up the nursing homes,” no Ralph Nader-like crusader who has made this his or her political cause.</p> <p>Nor has there been much resulting vilification. There are plenty of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/13/opinion/inequality-san-francisco-coronavirus.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">condemnations</a>of technology billionaires, but very few of nursing-home CEOs.

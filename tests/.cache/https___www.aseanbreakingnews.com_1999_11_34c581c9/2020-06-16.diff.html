One, described by Ms Nishizawa as a young Thai with long hair, was waiting on a motorbike without a license plate. The second man, who also appeared to be Thai, had short hair and was dressed in a black shirt and pants. He was sitting on a bench near the road where she was walking. The man with short hair snatched her bag as she walked past and ran to the waiting motorbike. A Thai man who witnessed the incident chased the motorbike until he reached Kalim Bay where a pick-up truck pulling out onto the road blocked him.

After the 15-a-side match at the Saphan Hin stadium, Gazettes skipper Patrick Cotter was gracious in defeat. “It was a tough game,” he said. “The ball was slippery, and we were playing in wintry English conditions. The better team won. We were simply outplayed by superior fitness and skills.” The Aussies scored two tries, both converted, in the first quarter of the match, with Mark Williamson and Michael Croo leading the charge. After the three-minute break, the Gazettes made a strong comeback, confining play mostly to the Australian end of the pitch. Sitthiha Singsuk, the sprinter of the team, nearly made it, getting within two meters from the goal line before being smothered by the speedier … <a href="https://www.aseanbreakingnews.com/1999/11/aussie-soldiers-massacre-gazettes-45-0/" class="more-link">[Read more...] <span class="screen-reader-text">about Aussie soldiers massacre Gazettes 45-0</span> Link: https://www.aseanbreakingnews.com/1999/11/aussie-soldiers-massacre-gazettes-45-0/ </a></ins></p></article> <article class="post-34125603 post type-post status-publish format-standard entry"><p>CHALONG: Four construction workers from Phuket were crushed to death and two others were seriously hurt when a 10-wheel truck crashed on Patak Rd in Karon on Saturday. Pol Capt Sanae Panmee of Chalong Police Station told the Gazette that the truck was carrying a 3½-ton excavator as well as 10 construction workers, four in the cab with the driver and the other six riding behind with the excavator. The accident took place as the truck was descending the steep hill into Karon on the road from Chalong circle. The driver, Liang Muangsakul, 66, from Bangkok, told police that this was the first time he had driven in Phuket. The weight of the machinery in the back of the truck, he explained, made it difficult for him to brake. This, combined with the tight bends on that stretch of road, resulted in his loss of control. The truck ran off the road and fell onto its side. The workers, thrown overboard, were crushed by the falling excavator. … <a href="https://www.aseanbreakingnews.com/1999/11/four-crushed-to-death-in-truck-accident/" class="more-link">[Read more...] <span class="screen-reader-text">about Four crushed to death in truck accident</span></a></p></article></main>

<div><p>Once order is restored, 10 lucky Russians&#8211;who are brought to Moscow, courtesy of the show, by ox-cart&#8212;face off in a "fastest finger" round to determine who will sit in the "hot seat" in front of Ivaskevich to compete for the nutrient-containing jackpot. The advancing contestant is asked a series of increasingly difficult questions, each carrying a larger food prize, from a scrap of rotting cabbage to the grand prize of a one-course dinner for one. Stumped contestants can use one of three "lifelines"&#8211;polling the audience, writing a letter to a friend for help, or ingesting a packet of glucose syrup if they are losing consciousness due to hunger. &#8230; <a href="https://www.xbuy.info/1999/11/russian-television-scores-hit-with-new-game-show/" class="more-link">[Read more...] about Russian Television Scores Hit With New Game Show</a></p></div>

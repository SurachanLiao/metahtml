    Ayatollah

<p>Derived from the terms <i>&#257;yat</i> (sign, testimony, miracle, verses of the Qur&#703;&#257;n) and <i>All&#257;h</i> (God), ayatollah (Ar., &#257;<i>yatull&#257;h</i>, sign of God) is an honorific title with hierarchical value in Twelver Imamite Shiism, bestowed by popular usage on outstanding
   mujtahids, with reference to Qur&#8217;&#257;n <a href="/article/book/islam-9780192831934?sura=41&amp;astart=53">41:53</a>. The sense of this title can be traced to the need for legitimacy sought by the Sh&#299;&#703;&#299; <i>&#703;ulam&#257;&#703;</i> during the absence of the twelfth imam, the Master of the Age, in the end of the greater occultation, from 940 to the end
   of time. Its attribution reflects the socioreligious environment prevailing in the Q&#257;j&#257;r period (1796&#8211;1925). The title was not in use among the Sh&#299;&#703;&#299;s of Lebanon, Pakistan, or India and remained restricted in Iraq to mujtahids of
   Iranian origin. An imitation of the title <i>&#7827;ill All&#257;h</i> (shadow of God) traditionally applied to Persian Islamic rulers, which was confirmed by the use of <i>&#257;yat All&#257;h z&#257;dah</i> (son of ayatollah), a counterpart of <i>sh&#257;h z&#257;dah</i> (son of the shah), has also been proposed as the origin of the title (Mat&#299;n&#299;, 1983).
</p>
<p>The attribution of this title seems to have coincided with crucial moments of influence of Twelver Shiism in Iran. Its first
   reputed bearer, Ibn al-Mu&#7789;ahhar al-&#7716;ill&#299; (d. 1325), converted the Mongol Il-Kh&#257;n &#214;ljeit&#252; Mu&#7717;ammad Khud&#257;bandah (r. 1304&#8211;1317) to Twelver Shiism. He was styled &#257;<i>yat All&#257;h f&#299; al-&#703;&#257;lamayn</i> (ayatollah in the two worlds), in addition to his best-known title of <i>al-&#703;All&#257;ma&#703;</i> (that is, &#8220;the most learned&#8221;; this title became an essential requisite for a <i>marja&#703; al-taql&#299;d</i>, a &#8220;source of emulation&#8221; in the Q&#257;j&#257;r period). But this case remained an exception. Although the modern hagiographical Sh&#299;&#703;&#299;
   literature sometimes applies retrospectively titles such as <i>marja&#703; al-taql&#299;d</i> or &#8220;ayatollah&#8221; to pre-Q&#257;j&#257;r &#703;<i>ulam&#257;&#703;</i>, this is historically groundless. Former &#7778;afavid and even Q&#257;j&#257;r Sh&#299;&#703;&#299; titles were styled differently. Most titles were related
   to the functions of the mujtahid, such as <i>mujtahid al-zam&#257;n</i> (mujtahid of the age), <i>kh&#257;tam al-mujtahid&#299;n</i> (seal of mujtahids), <i>shaykh al-mujtahid&#299;n</i> (dean of mujtahids), and so forth. Except for the functional title of <i>marja&#703; al-taql&#299;d</i>, other titles were related to Islam, such as <i>thiqat al-Isl&#257;m</i> (trustee of Islam) and <i>&#7717;ujjat al-Isl&#257;m</i> (proof of Islam).
</p>
<p>The general use of the title &#8220;ayatollah&#8221; appears in the late Q&#257;j&#257;r period. It is mentioned in a pamphlet against the &#703;<i>ulam&#257;&#703;</i> (see <a href="/article/opr/t236/e1106">&#7716;&#257;JJ SAYY&#257;H</a>, <i>Kh&#257;ter&#257;t</i> [Tehran, 1930, p. 338; text written between the 1870s and 1910s). Among its earlier modern bearers one may find religio-political leaders
   of the constitutional revolution of 1905 to 1911, Sayyids &#703;Abd All&#257;h Bihbah&#257;n&#299; (d. 1910) and Mu&#7717;ammad &#7788;ab&#257;&#7789;ab&#257;&#703;&#299; (d. 1918). But anticonstitutionalist mujtahids were also called &#8220;ayatollah,&#8221; and a spiritual leader, &#703;Abd al-Kar&#299;m &#7716;&#257;&#703;ir&#299;-Yazd&#299; (d. 1937), founder of the new theological center of Qom, is said to be the first mujtahid to bear this title. Titles such as <i>&#257;yat All&#257;h f&#299; al-an&#257;m</i> (ayatollah among mankind), or <i>f&#299; al-&#703;&#257;lamayn</i> (in the two worlds), or <i>f&#299; al-war&#257;</i> (among mortals) also appeared during the time of the constitutional revolution.
</p>
<p>Besides being a fully qualified mujtahid, an aspiring ayatollah must assert his authority over both his peers and his followers.
   As shown by research on Sh&#299;&#703;&#299; leadership (Amanat, 1988), to the prerequisite notion of <i>a&#703;lam&#299;yat</i> (superiority in learning) must be added the often overlooked concept of <i>riy&#257;sat</i> (leadership) that is solidified by popular acclamation and payment of religious taxes. Although contributing to centralizing
   clerical authority, <i>riy&#257;sat</i> also meant clerical leadership over specific communities (for instance, Arab, Turkish, or Persian-speaking groups in Iraqi
   Sh&#299;&#703;&#299; sanctuaries, the &#703;<i>atab&#257;t</i>see <a href="/article/opr/t236/e0082">&#703;ATAB&#257;T</a>).
</p>
<p>With the appearance of such outstanding figures as Mo&#7717;ammad &#7716;osayn Borujerdi (d. 1962), who emerged as the sole <i>marja&#703; al-taql&#299;d</i>, and the religious political leader Abol-Q&#257;sem K&#257;sh&#257;ni (d. 1962), the title &#8220;ayatollah&#8221; became ubiquitous. Losing its initial prestige, it even came to be applied, against their own usage,
   to Sunn&#299; religious dignitaries. The leading ayatollah of his time came to be designated by the elative <i>&#257;yatull&#257;h al-&#703;u&#7827;m&#257;</i> (grand ayatollah&#8212;that is, the supreme mujtahid or <i>marja&#703; al-taql&#299;d</i>), the first bearer of the title being Borujerdi. A kind of restricted college of ayatollahs, in Qom, decided on his nomination.
   A further debasement of even this higher title occurred with the application of the title <i>im&#257;m</i> to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini (d. 1989), quite unusual for Twelver Sh&#299;&#703;&#299; (see Mat&#299;n&#299;, 1983, p. 603f.).
</p>
<p>At the time of Borujerdi's death there was a great discussion among prominent mujtahids, ayatollahs, and Sh&#299;&#703;&#299; laymen regarding
   the role of the <i>marja&#703; al-taql&#299;d</i> and his function. Among the views discussed was the idea, formerly favored by &#703;Abd al-Kar&#299;m &#7716;&#257;&#703;ir&#299;-Yazd&#299;, that the concept of a sole <i>marja&#703; al-taql&#299;d</i> be abandoned. Each mujtahid should then specialize in a field and be followed in that field. Another idea was that a council
   of mujtahids should be sharing leadership. In practice, there was a split in the leadership, outstanding ayatollahs and <i>mar&#257;ji&#703; al-taql&#299;d</i> being established in the main centers of learning (Mashhad and Qom in Iran; Najaf in Iraq). After rivaling Qom from the 1960s
   until the mid-1970s, Mashhad declined in importance. After the events of 1963, Ayatollah Khomeini emerged as one of the top-ranking <i>mar&#257;ji&#703; al-taql&#299;d</i>, although Mu&#7717;sin al-&#7716;ak&#299;m (supported by the shah) had a large following in Iraq.
</p>
<p>Although Sh&#299;&#703;&#299; &#703;<i>ulam&#257;&#703;</i> were traditionally reluctant to structure their leadership, as a result of the Iranian Islamic Revolution, by 1980 a sort of seven-degree hierarchy was established: <i>&#7789;alabah</i> (student), <i>thiqat al-Isl&#257;m</i> (title formerly given to higher-ranking mujtahids), <i>&#7717;ujjat al-Isl&#257;m</i>, <i>&#7717;ujjat al-Isl&#257;m wa al-muslim&#299;n</i>, <i>&#257;yatull&#257;h</i>, <i>&#257;yatull&#257;h al-&#703;u&#7827;m&#257;</i>, and <i>n&#257;yib-i im&#257;m</i> (lieutenant of the imam). The last title reflects the assumption of both temporal and spiritual power by Khomeini. The concept
   of <i>niy&#257;bat</i> (general vicegerency of the Hidden Imam) was until then purely theoretical in Twelver Shiism. Despite its devaluation, a
   growing number of mujtahids bore the title &#8220;ayatollah.&#8221; A decree from Khomeini (September 1984) stated that certain persons calling themselves ayatollah should henceforth be called <i>&#7717;ujjat al-Isl&#257;m</i>.
</p>
<p>With the establishment of the Islamic Republic of Iran in 1979, a leading role was attributed to prominent ayatollahs. But some of them reluctantly accepted or even objected or opposed
   the application of Khomeini&#8201;'s theory of <i>vil&#257;yat-i faq&#299;h</i> (<i>wil&#257;yat al-faq&#299;h</i>; mandate of the jurist), the most prominent opponent being Shar&#299;&#703;at Mad&#257;r&#299; (d. 1986), demoted from the rank of grand ayatollah in 1982. One of the leading opponents, Ayatollah Abol-Q&#257;sem Kho&#703;i (Ab&#363; al-Q&#257;sim Kh&#363;&#703;&#299;, d. 1992), had many followers. After Khomeini's death, Sayyid &#703;Ali Khamene&#703;i became the <i>val&#299;-i faq&#299;h</i> (leading theologian), while Ayatollah &#7716;usayn &#703;Al&#299; Munta&#7827;ir&#299;, initially nominated by Khomeini as his spiritual heir (and ratified
   by the Assembly of Experts, or <i>sh&#363;r&#257;-yi khibrig&#257;n</i>, in 1985), had been dismissed by Khomeini in 1989.

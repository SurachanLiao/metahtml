Like when Trump says that he misses his old life and thought that being president “<span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 kVnoAv js_link" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-100days-idUSKBN17U0CA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">would be easier</a></span>.” Or when Trump says that a “<span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 kVnoAv js_link" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-exclusive-idUSKBN17U04E" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">major, major</a></span>” conflict with North Korea is possible. But the most jarring moment might be when he empathizes with Kim Jong-un.</p><p class="bxm4mm-16 ozJxb">Advertisement</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 dQFbxq">It’s a positive thing when a leader in a powerful position empathizes with an adversary. Typically, that’s something that can de-escalate conflicts and lead to peace. But Trump’s empathy with the dictator of North Korea seems to be coming from a very strange place. Namely, that of a man who sees another man who, like Trump, inherited an empire at a young age.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 dQFbxq">When Reuters asked about Kim Jong-un, Trump seemed to be projecting all of his own life experiences. Trump, of course, came from a wealthy real estate family and started off on his own (with a lot of Dad’s money, of course) at the age of 27. So guess what Trump had to say about Kim Jong-un?</p><p class="bxm4mm-16 ozJxb">Advertisement</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 dQFbxq">“He’s 27 years old. His father dies, took over a regime. So say what you want but that is not easy, especially at that age,” Trump <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 kVnoAv js_link" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-exclusive-idUSKBN17U04E" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told Reuters</a></span>. </p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 dQFbxq">“I’m not giving him credit or not giving him credit,” Trump continued. “I’m just saying that’s a very hard thing to do. As to whether or not he’s rational, I have no opinion on it. I hope he’s rational.”</p> <p class="sc-1to1lfh-8 hQyEYS"><ins>G/O Media may get a commission</ins></p><p class="sc-1to1lfh-1 kzUztX"><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-1to1lfh-2 iubiHk js_link" href="https://meh.com/deals/vava-1080p-wide-angle-dash-cam-with-8gb-sd-card?affiliate=5e9630cd2c61980cb0a26c4e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><p class="sc-1to1lfh-4 goUJzW"><ins>Capture All Your Road Encounters With a VAVA Mini Dash Cam, Only $25</ins></p><p class="sc-1to1lfh-7 jGSGRu"><ins>VAVA Mini Dash Cam</ins></p><ins> Link: https://meh.com/deals/vava-1080p-wide-angle-dash-cam-with-8gb-sd-card?affiliate=5e9630cd2c61980cb0a26c4e </ins></a></p> <p class="sc-77igqf-0 dQFbxq">Yes, it would appear that Donald Trump feels Kim Jong-un’s pain. It’s not easy to take over a regime at 27. Especially when you’re starving your own people to build a standing army of 1.3 million soldiers. Life sure seems hard at the top.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 dQFbxq">Trump may not want to be the president anymore, but he may be up for dictator of North Korea. </p></main> <p class="bxm4mm-11 bxm4mm-12 hHSvJD"><del></del></p><p class="bxm4mm-16 ozJxb"><del>Advertisement</del></p><p class="ad-container dfp dfp-slot-MOBILE_IN_POST ad-mobile"><del></del></p><p class="bt-wrapper"><del></del></p><p class="bt-uid-tg"><del></del></p><p class="bxm4mm-11 bxm4mm-13 hefxsW"><del></del></p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 dQFbxq"><del>[<a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 kVnoAv js_link" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-exclusive-idUSKBN17U04E" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reuters Link: http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-exclusive-idUSKBN17U04E </a>]</del></p>

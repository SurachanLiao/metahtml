Like when Trump says that he misses his old life and thought that being president &#8220;<a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 kVnoAv js_link" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-100days-idUSKBN17U0CA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">would be easier</a>.&#8221; Or when Trump says that a &#8220;<a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 kVnoAv js_link" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-exclusive-idUSKBN17U04E" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">major, major</a>&#8221; conflict with North Korea is possible. But the most jarring moment might be when he empathizes with Kim Jong-un.<br></p><p class="bxm4mm-8 gFyuvV js_video-sticky__top-limit"></p><p class="bxm4mm-11 bxm4mm-12 hHSvJD"></p><p class="bxm4mm-16 ozJxb">Advertisement</p><p class="ad-container dfp dfp-slot-MOBILE_IN_POST ad-mobile js_swappable-mobile-ad"></p><p class="bt-wrapper"><p class="bt-uid-tg"></p></p><p class="bxm4mm-11 bxm4mm-13 hefxsW"></p><p class="bxm4mm-7 BkGlG js_video-sticky-trigger"></p><p class="bxm4mm-6 dIYVrz instream-native-video instream-permalink js_video-sticky-target instream-native-video--mobile"></p><p class="bxm4mm-9 dxKfqc js_video-sticky__bottom-limit"></p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 dQFbxq">It&#8217;s a positive thing when a leader in a powerful position empathizes with an adversary. Typically, that&#8217;s something that can de-escalate conflicts and lead to peace. But Trump&#8217;s empathy with the dictator of North Korea seems to be coming from a very strange place. Namely, that of a man who sees another man who, like Trump, inherited an empire at a young age.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 dQFbxq">When Reuters asked about Kim Jong-un, Trump seemed to be projecting all of his own life experiences. Trump, of course, came from a wealthy real estate family and started off on his own (with a lot of Dad&#8217;s money, of course) at the age of 27. So guess what Trump had to say about Kim Jong-un?</p><p class="bxm4mm-11 bxm4mm-12 hHSvJD"></p><p class="bxm4mm-16 ozJxb">Advertisement</p><p class="ad-container dfp dfp-slot-MOBILE_IN_POST ad-mobile"></p><p class="bt-wrapper"><p class="bt-uid-tg"></p></p><p class="bxm4mm-11 bxm4mm-13 hefxsW"></p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 dQFbxq">&#8220;He&#8217;s 27 years old. His father dies, took over a regime. So say what you want but that is not easy, especially at that age,&#8221; Trump <a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 kVnoAv js_link" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-exclusive-idUSKBN17U04E" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told Reuters</a>. </p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 dQFbxq">&#8220;I&#8217;m not giving him credit or not giving him credit,&#8221; Trump continued. &#8220;I&#8217;m just saying that&#8217;s a very hard thing to do. As to whether or not he&#8217;s rational, I have no opinion on it. I hope he&#8217;s rational.&#8221;</p><p class="bxm4mm-22 hLhqiE"></p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 dQFbxq">Yes, it would appear that Donald Trump feels Kim Jong-un&#8217;s pain. It&#8217;s not easy to take over a regime at 27. Especially when you&#8217;re starving your own people to build a standing army of 1.3 million soldiers. Life sure seems hard at the top.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 dQFbxq">Trump may not want to be the president anymore, but he may be up for dictator of North Korea. </p><p class="bxm4mm-11 bxm4mm-12 hHSvJD"></p><p class="bxm4mm-16 ozJxb">Advertisement</p><p class="ad-container dfp dfp-slot-MOBILE_IN_POST ad-mobile"></p><p class="bt-wrapper"><p class="bt-uid-tg"></p></p><p class="bxm4mm-11 bxm4mm-13 hefxsW"></p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 dQFbxq">[<a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 kVnoAv js_link" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-exclusive-idUSKBN17U04E" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reuters</a>]</p></div>

Like when Trump says that he misses his old life and thought that being president &#8220;<span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 kVnoAv js_link" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-100days-idUSKBN17U0CA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">would be easier</a></span>.&#8221; Or when Trump says that a &#8220;<span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 kVnoAv js_link" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-exclusive-idUSKBN17U04E" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">major, major</a></span>&#8221; conflict with North Korea is possible. But the most jarring moment might be when he empathizes with Kim Jong-un.</p><p class="bxm4mm-16 ozJxb">Advertisement</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 dQFbxq">It&#8217;s a positive thing when a leader in a powerful position empathizes with an adversary. Typically, that&#8217;s something that can de-escalate conflicts and lead to peace. But Trump&#8217;s empathy with the dictator of North Korea seems to be coming from a very strange place. Namely, that of a man who sees another man who, like Trump, inherited an empire at a young age.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 dQFbxq">When Reuters asked about Kim Jong-un, Trump seemed to be projecting all of his own life experiences. Trump, of course, came from a wealthy real estate family and started off on his own (with a lot of Dad&#8217;s money, of course) at the age of 27. So guess what Trump had to say about Kim Jong-un?</p><p class="bxm4mm-16 ozJxb">Advertisement</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 dQFbxq">&#8220;He&#8217;s 27 years old. His father dies, took over a regime. So say what you want but that is not easy, especially at that age,&#8221; Trump <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 kVnoAv js_link" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-exclusive-idUSKBN17U04E" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told Reuters</a></span>. </p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 dQFbxq">&#8220;I&#8217;m not giving him credit or not giving him credit,&#8221; Trump continued. &#8220;I&#8217;m just saying that&#8217;s a very hard thing to do. As to whether or not he&#8217;s rational, I have no opinion on it. I hope he&#8217;s rational.&#8221;</p><p class="sc-1to1lfh-8 hQyEYS">G/O Media may get a commission</p><p class="sc-1to1lfh-1 kzUztX"><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-1to1lfh-2 iubiHk js_link" href="https://meh.com/deals/vava-1080p-wide-angle-dash-cam-with-8gb-sd-card?affiliate=5e9630cd2c61980cb0a26c4e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><p class="sc-1to1lfh-4 goUJzW">Capture All Your Road Encounters With a VAVA Mini Dash Cam, Only $25</p><p class="sc-1to1lfh-7 jGSGRu">VAVA Mini Dash Cam</p></a></p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 dQFbxq">Yes, it would appear that Donald Trump feels Kim Jong-un&#8217;s pain. It&#8217;s not easy to take over a regime at 27. Especially when you&#8217;re starving your own people to build a standing army of 1.3 million soldiers. Life sure seems hard at the top.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 dQFbxq">Trump may not want to be the president anymore, but he may be up for dictator of North Korea. </p></main>

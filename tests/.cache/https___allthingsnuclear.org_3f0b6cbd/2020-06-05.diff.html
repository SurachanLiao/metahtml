This is also true in the world of nuclear weapons policy: US nuclear weapons activities have, and continue to, hurt communities through harmful and sometimes deadly radiation exposure. Now, the survivors of this radiation exposure are also at greater risk from COVID-19. Effective COVID-19 response requires that those who need care can receive it. It also means recognizing who is at greatest risk, and addressing their needs. As we gear up for another stimulus package, <a href="https://ucs-documents.s3.amazonaws.com/global-security/organizational-sign-on-letter-impacted-communities-covid-19.pdf">UCS and more than 100 other organizations across the country</a> are calling for Congress to include funding for health care access for communities directly harmed by US nuclear activities. </span> <a href="https://allthingsnuclear.org/guest-commentary/covid-19-nuclear-weapons" class="more-link">Read more &gt;</a></p> <p class="pagination"><ins><span class="older"><a href="https://allthingsnuclear.org/page/2">« Older Entries Link: https://allthingsnuclear.org/page/2 </a></span> </ins></p><p class="textwidget"><ins></ins></p><h2><ins>Support Our Work</ins></h2><ins> </ins><a href="https://secure.ucsusa.org/onlineactions/5WsPdhRNl0KNw4k74H9EPg2?MS=ucsblog" target="_blank"><p class="support"><ins>Donate</ins></p><ins>  Link: https://secure.ucsusa.org/onlineactions/5WsPdhRNl0KNw4k74H9EPg2?MS=ucsblog </ins></a><p class="join-our-email-list"><ins></ins></p><h2><ins>Stay Informed via email from <a href="https://www.ucsusa.org/contact-us-full">UCS Link: https://www.ucsusa.org/contact-us-full </a></ins></h2><ins> </ins><p class="social-icons"><ins></ins></p><h3><ins>[ SHARE ]</ins></h3><ins> </ins><section id="sidebar_authors"><h3><ins>[ Meet Our Bloggers ]</ins></h3><p class="author_details"><ins></ins></p><p><ins><a href="/author/smeyer">Sean Meyer Link: /author/smeyer </a> has more than 25 years experience as a public policy advocate.

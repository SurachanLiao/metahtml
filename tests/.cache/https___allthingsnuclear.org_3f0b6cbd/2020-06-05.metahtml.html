                <p class="wp-caption-text">On March 1, 1954 the US tested a nuclear weapon 1,000 times more powerful than the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima. The blast from the Castle Bravo test over the Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands rained down over a 7,000 square mile area. U.S. Department of Energy</p>
<p><span>The COVID-19 pandemic is forcing us to confront the vast inequities in our society that have made this virus more deadly in some communities than others. This is also true in the world of nuclear weapons policy: US nuclear weapons activities have, and continue to, hurt communities through harmful and sometimes deadly radiation exposure. Now, the survivors of this radiation exposure are also at greater risk from COVID-19. Effective COVID-19 response requires that those who need care can receive it. It also means recognizing who is at greatest risk, and addressing their needs. As we gear up for another stimulus package, <a href="https://ucs-documents.s3.amazonaws.com/global-security/organizational-sign-on-letter-impacted-communities-covid-19.pdf">UCS and more than 100 other organizations across the country</a> are calling for Congress to include funding for health care access for communities directly harmed by US nuclear activities.&#160;</span> <a href="https://allthingsnuclear.org/guest-commentary/covid-19-nuclear-weapons" class="more-link">Read more&#160;&gt;</a></p>

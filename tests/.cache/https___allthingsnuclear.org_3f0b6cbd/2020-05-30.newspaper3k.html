<div><p>Japan does not have its own nuclear weapons. The Japanese government considered developing them in the past, but <a href="https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/japan-and-americas-nuclear-posture" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decided</a> this would make Japan less secure. Japanese opinion polls consistently express strong public opposition to nuclear weapons. So do their elected representatives.</p>
<p>There is, however, a small group of non-elected Japanese bureaucrats with close ties to the U.S. defense establishment who <a href="http://kakujoho.net/npt/npr2018.html#akiba_e_m" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insist</a> U.S. nuclear weapons should be &#8220;the core of Japan&#8217;s security arrangements.&#8221; Wonks refer to this supposed core as &#8220;extended nuclear deterrence.&#8221; Journalists and politicians, especially in Japan, call it a &#8220;nuclear umbrella.&#8221;</p>

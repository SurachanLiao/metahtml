<p>The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/trump-administration-discussed-conducting-first-us-nuclear-test-in-decades/2020/05/22/a805c904-9c5b-11ea-b60c-3be060a4f8e1_story.html">news</a> that the Trump administration is considering resuming nuclear weapons testing is morally abhorrent. The current US moratorium on nuclear testing was put in place for many reasons, but we must not forget one crucial reason: In conducting explosive nuclear tests, the US government <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/radiation/fallout/feasibilitystudy/Technical_Vol_1_ExecutiveSummary.pdf">killed thousands of innocent people</a> and sickened untold thousands more.

                <p>Japan does not have its own nuclear weapons. The Japanese government considered developing them in the past, but <a href="https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/japan-and-americas-nuclear-posture" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decided</a> this would make Japan less secure. Japanese opinion polls consistently express strong public opposition to nuclear weapons. So do their elected representatives.</p>
<p>There is, however, a small group of non-elected Japanese bureaucrats with close ties to the U.S. defense establishment who <a href="http://kakujoho.net/npt/npr2018.html#akiba_e_m" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insist</a> U.S. nuclear weapons should be &#8220;the core of Japan&#8217;s security arrangements.&#8221; Wonks refer to this supposed core as &#8220;extended nuclear deterrence.&#8221; Journalists and politicians, especially in Japan, call it a &#8220;nuclear umbrella.&#8221;</p>

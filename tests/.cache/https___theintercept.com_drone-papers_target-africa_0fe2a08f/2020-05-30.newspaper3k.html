<div><p>ERADICATING BLANK SPACES on maps of the &#8220;dark continent&#8221; was an obsession of Western powers during the 19th-century scramble for Africa. Today, a new scramble is underway to eradicate a different set of blank spots. The U.S. military has, since 9/11, engaged in a largely covert effort to extend its footprint across the continent with a network of mostly small and mostly low-profile camps. Some serve as <a href="http://www.stripes.com/news/africa/staging-sites-enable-africom-to-reach-hot-spots-within-4-hours-leader-says-1.345120">staging areas</a> for quick-reaction forces or bare-boned outposts where special ops teams can advise local proxies; some can accommodate large cargo planes, others only small surveillance aircraft. All have one mission in common: to eradicate what the military calls the &#8220;<a href="https://theintercept.com/drone-papers/firing-blind/">tyranny of distance</a>.&#8221; These facilities allow U.S. forces to surveil and operate on larger and larger swaths of the continent &#8212; and, increasingly, to strike targets with drones and manned aircraft.</p>

TF 48-4 Focus and Organization</a> According to an internal 2013 <a href="/document/2015/10/14/small-footprint-operations-5-13">Pentagon study</a> obtained by The Intercept on secret drone operations in Somalia and Yemen between January 2011 and summer 2012, a secretive unit known as Task Force 48-4 carried out a shadow war in the region. The task force, with its headquarters at Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti, operated from outposts in Nairobi, Kenya, and Sanaa, Yemen. The aircraft it used &#8212; manned and remotely piloted &#8212; were based out of airfields in Djibouti, Ethiopia, and Kenya, as well as ships off the coast of East Africa.</p>
<p>U.S. Africa Command &#8212; the umbrella organization for U.S. military activities on the continent, known as Africom &#8212; insists that it maintains only a &#8220;<a href="http://www.voanews.com/content/us-military-pays-close-attention-to-boko-haram-militants/1681488.html">small footprint</a>&#8221; in Africa and claims that Camp Lemonnier, a former <a href="http://archive.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=62927">French Foreign Legion</a> outpost, is its only full-fledged base. However, a number of new facilities have been opened in recent years, and even Defense Secretary Ashton Carter has acknowledged that Lemonnier serves as &#8220;a hub with lots of spokes out there on the continent and in the region.&#8221;</p><img class="max-width" src="/wp-uploads/sites/1/2015/10/AfricaMap01.png" alt="" width="1440" height="1500">
<p>One of those spokes can be found just 10 kilometers southwest of Camp Lemonnier. After numerous <a href="http://www.voanews.com/content/us-moves-drones-from-key-africa-base/1756946.html">mishaps</a> and crashes, drone operations were moved from the camp to the more <a href="http://somturk.com.tr/djibouti-craft-apron-parking-area-construction-logistics">remote</a> <a href="http://archive.defensenews.com/article/20130925/DEFREG02/309250035/US-Relocates-Drones-Airfield-After-Djibouti-Crashes">Chabelley Airfield</a> in September 2013. Predator drones have also been based in the cities of <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/pentagon-set-to-open-second-drone-base-in-niger-as-it-expands-operations-in-africa/2014/08/31/365489c4-2eb8-11e4-994d-202962a9150c_story.html">Niamey</a> in Niger and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/31/opinion/dealing-with-boko-haram.html">N&#8217;Djamena</a> in Chad, while Reaper drones have been <a href="http://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424053111904106704576583012923076634?mg=reno64-wsj&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB10001424053111904106704576583012923076634.html">flown</a> out of Seychelles International Airport. The Pentagon study, conducted by the Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Task Force, also notes that, as of June 2012, there were two contractor-operated drones, one Predator and one Reaper, flying out of <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-drone-base-in-ethiopia-is-operational/2011/10/27/gIQAznKwMM_story.html">Arba Minch</a>, Ethiopia. Off the coast of East Africa, a detachment equipped to dispatch a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/25/us/simple-scaneagle-drones-a-boost-for-us-military.html?_r=0">Scan Eagle</a>, a low-cost, low-tech drone used by the Navy, or an <a href="http://www.navair.navy.mil/index.cfm?fuseaction=home.display&amp;key=8250AFBA-DF2B-4999-9EF3-0B0E46144D03">MQ-8 Fire Scout</a>, a remotely piloted helicopter, added to the regional array of surveillance assets, as did those associated with &#8220;Armada Sweep,&#8221; a ship-based system for collecting electronic communications. Additionally, two manned fixed-wing aircraft were based in Manda Bay, Kenya. Recent reports also indicate that the military&#8217;s Joint Special Operations Command, or JSOC, is now working out of two bases in <a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/07/02/exclusive-u-s-operates-drones-from-secret-bases-in-somalia-special-operations-jsoc-black-hawk-down/">Somalia</a> &#8212; one in Kismayo, the other in Baledogle.</p>
<p>While generally austere, many of these bases &#8212; including the airfields in <a href="https://cryptome.org/2014-info/chabelly/chabelly-drone-base.htm">Chabelley</a> and <a href="http://www.nti.org/gsn/article/united-states-using-local-soldiers-fight-al-qaida-allies-east-africa/">Manda Bay</a> &#8212; have expanded in recent years, with more on the way. Last year, for example, Capt. Rick Cook, who at the time was chief of Africom&#8217;s engineer division, <a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/175830/tomgram%3A_nick_turse%2C_africom_becomes_a_%22war-fighting_combatant_command%22">mentioned</a> the potential for a &#8220;base-like facility&#8221; that would be &#8220;semi-permanent&#8221; and &#8220;capable of air operations&#8221; in Niger. The National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2016, <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d114:H.R.1735:">introduced</a> in April, <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/cpquery/?&amp;sid=cp114llNjh&amp;r_n=hr102.114&amp;dbname=cp114&amp;&amp;sel=TOC_1188734&amp;">requests</a> $50 million for construction of an &#8220;Airfield and Base Camp at Agadez, Niger &#8230; to support operations in western Africa.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since 9/11, a multitude of other facilities &#8212; including staging areas, cooperative security locations and forward operating locations &#8212; have also popped up (or been beefed up) in Burkina Faso, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/pentagon-setting-up-drone-base-in-africa-to-track-boko-haram-fighters/2015/10/14/0cbfac94-7299-11e5-8d93-0af317ed58c9_story.html">Cameroon</a>, Central African Republic, <a href="http://www.stripes.com/news/africa/staging-sites-enable-africom-to-reach-hot-spots-within-4-hours-leader-says-1.345120">Gabon</a>, <a href="http://www.stripes.com/news/africa/staging-sites-enable-africom-to-reach-hot-spots-within-4-hours-leader-says-1.345120">Ghana</a>, Kenya, Mali, Senegal, South Sudan, and Uganda. A 2011 report by Lauren Ploch, an analyst in African affairs&#160;with the Congressional Research Service, also mentioned U.S. military access to locations in Botswana, Namibia, Sao Tome and Principe, Sierra Leone, Tunisia, and Zambia. According to Sam Cooks, a liaison officer with the Defense Logistics Agency, the U.S. military has <a href="http://www.dla.mil/Loglines/Pages/LoglinesJF2013Story06.aspx">struck</a> 29 agreements to use international airports in Africa as refueling centers. These locations are only some of the nodes in a growing network of outposts facilitating an increasing number of missions by the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/15/magazine/can-general-linders-special-operations-forces-stop-the-next-terrorist-threat.html">5,000 to 8,000</a> U.S. troops and civilians who annually operate on the continent.</p>
<p>Africom and the Pentagon jealously guard information about their outposts in Africa, making it impossible to ascertain even basic facts &#8212; like a simple count &#8212; let alone just how many are integral to JSOC operations, drone strikes, and other secret activities. &#8220;Due to operational security, I won&#8217;t be able to give you the exact size and number,&#8221; Lt. Cmdr. Anthony Falvo, an Africom spokesperson, told The Intercept by email. &#8220;What I can tell you is that our strategic posture and presence are premised on the concept of a tailored, flexible, light footprint that leverages and supports the posture and presence of partners and is supported by expeditionary infrastructure.&#8221;</p><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-6340" src="/wp-uploads/sites/1/2015/10/CampLemonnier-Aircrafts01.png" alt="">

Illustration: The Intercept</p><p>If you search Africom&#8217;s website for news about Camp Lemonnier, you&#8217;ll find myriad feel-good stories about <a href="http://www.africom.mil/newsroom/article/10020/camp-lemonnier-goes-green-installs-solar-panels-to">green energy</a> initiatives, the <a href="http://www.africom.mil/newsroom/article/8871/us-army-national-guard-conducts-water-drilling-tes">drilling</a> of water wells, and a <a href="http://www.africom.mil/newsroom/article/8940/toby-keith-visits-camp-lemonnier">visit</a> by country music star Toby Keith. But that&#8217;s far from the whole story. The base is a lynchpin for U.S. military action in Africa.</p>
<p>&#8220;Camp Lemonnier is &#8230; an essential regional power projection base that enables the operations of multiple combatant commands,&#8221; said Gen. Carter Ham in 2012, then the commander of Africom, in a <a href="http://www.africom.mil/newsroom/article/8832/2012-posture-statement-statement-of-general-carter">statement</a> to the House Armed Services Committee. &#8220;The requirements for Camp Lemonnier as a key location for national security and power projection are enduring.&#8221;</p>
<p>A map in the Pentagon report indicates that there were 10 MQ-1 Predator drones and four larger, more far-ranging MQ-9 Reapers based at Camp Lemonnier in June 2012. There were also six <a href="http://www.hurlburt.af.mil/News/ArticleDisplay/tabid/136/Article/204913/four-hurlburt-airmen-die-in-u-28a-crash-in-djibouti.aspx">U-28As</a> &#8212; a single-engine aircraft that conducts surveillance for special operations forces &#8212; and two <a href="http://www.lockheedmartin.com/us/products/p3.html">P-3 Orions</a>, a four-engine turboprop aircraft originally developed for maritime patrols but since repurposed for use over African countries. The map also shows the presence of eight F-15E Strike Eagles, manned fighter jets that are much faster and more heavily armed than drones. By August 2012, an average of 16 drones and four fighter jets were <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/remote-us-base-at-core-of-secret-operations/2012/10/25/a26a9392-197a-11e2-bd10-5ff056538b7c_story.html">taking off</a> or landing there each day.</p>
<p>Located on the edge of Djibouti-<a href="http://www.stripes.com/news/military-responds-to-air-safety-issues-in-djibouti-1.344317">Ambouli</a> International Airport, Camp Lemonnier is also the headquarters for Combined Joint Task Force-Horn of Africa (<a href="http://www.hoa.africom.mil/">CJTF-HOA</a>), which <a href="http://www.stripes.com/news/military-responds-to-air-safety-issues-in-djibouti-1.344317">includes</a> soldiers, sailors, and airmen, some of them members of special operations forces. The camp &#8212; which also <a href="http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=128615">supports</a> U.S. Central Command (Centcom) &#8212; has seen the number of personnel stationed there jump around <a href="http://navymedicine.navylive.dodlive.mil/archives/8884">450 percent</a> <a href="http://archive.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=42401">since 2002</a>. The base has <a href="http://themilitaryengineer.com/index.php/contacts/2015-marketing-kit/item/352-documenting-utilities-in-djibouti">expanded</a> from 88 acres to nearly 600 acres and has seen more than $600 million already allocated or awarded for projects such as aircraft parking aprons, taxiways, and a major <a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/175743/tomgram%3A_nick_turse,_africom's_gigantic_%22small_footprint%22">special operations compound</a>. In addition, $1.2 billion in construction and improvements has already been <a href="http://themilitaryengineer.com/index.php/contacts/2015-marketing-kit/item/352-documenting-utilities-in-djibouti">planned</a> for the future.</p>
<p>As it grew, Camp Lemonnier became one of the most critical bases not only for America&#8217;s drone assassination campaign in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/remote-us-base-at-core-of-secret-operations/2012/10/25/a26a9392-197a-11e2-bd10-5ff056538b7c_story.html">Somalia</a> and <a href="http://www.thenation.com/article/dangerous-us-game-yemen/">Yemen</a> but also for U.S. military operations across the region. The camp is so crucial to long-term military plans that last year the U.S. inked a deal securing its lease until 2044, agreeing to hand over <a href="http://www.thenational.ae/world/africa/djibouti-a-safe-harbour-in-the-troubled-horn-of-africa">$70 million</a> per year in rent &#8212; about <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/remote-us-base-at-core-of-secret-operations/2012/10/25/a26a9392-197a-11e2-bd10-5ff056538b7c_story.html">double</a> what it previously paid to the government of Djibouti.</p>

Today, a new scramble is underway to eradicate a different set of blank spots. The U.S. military has, since 9/11, engaged in a largely covert effort to extend its footprint across the continent with a network of mostly small and mostly low-profile camps. Some serve as <a href="http://www.stripes.com/news/africa/staging-sites-enable-africom-to-reach-hot-spots-within-4-hours-leader-says-1.345120">staging areas</a> for quick-reaction forces or bare-boned outposts where special ops teams can advise local proxies; some can accommodate large cargo planes, others only small surveillance aircraft. All have one mission in common: to eradicate what the military calls the &#8220;<a href="https://theintercept.com/drone-papers/firing-blind/">tyranny of distance</a>.&#8221; These facilities allow U.S. forces to surveil and operate on larger and larger swaths of the continent &#8212; and, increasingly, to strike targets with drones and manned aircraft.</p><p><a class="sq-article-link" href="/document/2015/10/14/small-footprint-operations-5-13/#page-3"><span class="">Document</span> 
TF 48-4 Focus and Organization</a> According to an internal 2013 <a href="/document/2015/10/14/small-footprint-operations-5-13">Pentagon study</a> obtained by The Intercept on secret drone operations in Somalia and Yemen between January 2011 and summer 2012, a secretive unit known as Task Force 48-4 carried out a shadow war in the region. The task force, with its headquarters at Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti, operated from outposts in Nairobi, Kenya, and Sanaa, Yemen. The aircraft it used &#8212; manned and remotely piloted &#8212; were based out of airfields in Djibouti, Ethiopia, and Kenya, as well as ships off the coast of East Africa.</p><p>U.S. Africa Command &#8212; the umbrella organization for U.S. military activities on the continent, known as Africom &#8212; insists that it maintains only a &#8220;<a href="http://www.voanews.com/content/us-military-pays-close-attention-to-boko-haram-militants/1681488.html">small footprint</a>&#8221; in Africa and claims that Camp Lemonnier, a former <a href="http://archive.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=62927">French Foreign Legion</a> outpost, is its only full-fledged base. However, a number of new facilities have been opened in recent years, and even Defense Secretary Ashton Carter has acknowledged that Lemonnier serves as &#8220;a hub with lots of spokes out there on the continent and in the region.&#8221;</p><p class="caption">Sources: 1) <a>ISR study</a>; 2) <a>ISR study</a>; 3) <a>ISR study</a>; 4) <a>ISR study</a>; 4) <a>ISR study</a>; 6) <a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/07/02/exclusive-u-s-operates-drones-from-secret-bases-in-somalia-special-operations-jsoc-black-hawk-down/">Foreign Policy</a>; 7) <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/drone-base-in-niger-gives-us-a-strategic-foothold-in-west-africa/2013/03/21/700ee8d0-9170-11e2-9c4d-798c073d7ec8_story.html%20https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/pentagon-set-to-open-second-drone-base-in-niger-as-it-expands-operations-in-africa/2014/08/31/365489c4-2eb8-11e4-994d-202962a9150c_story.html">The Washington Post</a>; 8) <a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/07/02/exclusive-u-s-operates-drones-from-secret-bases-in-somalia-special-operations-jsoc-black-hawk-down/">Foreign Policy</a>; 9) <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/the-african-network/2012/06/13/gJQAmozvaV_graphic.html">The Washington Post</a>; 10) <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/drone-safety-concerns-force-us-to-move-large-fleet-from-camp-lemonnier-in-djibouti/2013/09/24/955518c4-213c-11e3-a03d-abbedc3a047c_story.html">The Washington Post</a>; 11) <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/national-security/drones-and-spy-planes-over-Africa/">The Washington Post</a>; 12) <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/national-security/drones-and-spy-planes-over-Africa/">The Washington Post</a>; 13) <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/22/world/africa/us-sends-troops-to-aid-hunt-for-nigerian-schoolgirls.html">The New York Times</a>; 14) <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/pentagon-setting-up-drone-base-in-africa-to-track-boko-haram-fighters/2015/10/14/0cbfac94-7299-11e5-8d93-0af317ed58c9_story.html">The Washington Post</a></p><p>One of those spokes can be found just 10 kilometers southwest of Camp Lemonnier.

Cmdr. Anthony Falvo, an Africom spokesperson, told The Intercept by email. &#8220;What I can tell you is that our strategic posture and presence are premised on the concept of a tailored, flexible, light footprint that leverages and supports the posture and presence of partners and is supported by expeditionary infrastructure.&#8221;</p><p class="caption source">

Consider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept. Who would hold party elites accountable to the values they proclaim to have? How many covert wars, miscarriages of justice, and dystopian technologies would remain hidden if our reporters weren&#8217;t on the beat?

The kind of reporting we do is essential to democracy, but it is not easy, cheap, or profitable. The Intercept is an independent nonprofit news outlet. We don&#8217;t have ads, so we depend on our members &#8212; 35,000 and counting &#8212; to help us hold the powerful to account. Joining is simple and doesn&#8217;t need to cost a lot: You can become a sustaining member for as little as $3 or $5 a month.

Today, a new scramble is underway to eradicate a different set of blank spots. The U.S. military has, since 9/11, engaged in a largely covert effort to extend its footprint across the continent with a network of mostly small and mostly low-profile camps. Some serve as <a href="http://www.stripes.com/news/africa/staging-sites-enable-africom-to-reach-hot-spots-within-4-hours-leader-says-1.345120">staging areas</a> for quick-reaction forces or bare-boned outposts where special ops teams can advise local proxies; some can accommodate large cargo planes, others only small surveillance aircraft. All have one mission in common: to eradicate what the military calls the “<a href="https://theintercept.com/drone-papers/firing-blind/">tyranny of distance</a>.” These facilities allow U.S. forces to surveil and operate on larger and larger swaths of the continent — and, increasingly, to strike targets with drones and manned aircraft.</p><p><a class="sq-article-link" href="/document/2015/10/14/small-footprint-operations-5-13/#page-3"> <del><img src="/wp-uploads/sites/1/2015/10/ISR-May13-thumb.jpg" alt=""></del> <span class="">Document</span> TF 48-4 Focus and Organization</a> According to an internal 2013 <a href="/document/2015/10/14/small-footprint-operations-5-13">Pentagon study</a> obtained by The Intercept on secret drone operations in Somalia and Yemen between January 2011 and summer 2012, a secretive unit known as Task Force 48-4 carried out a shadow war in the region.

Cmdr. Anthony Falvo, an Africom spokesperson, told The Intercept by email. “What I can tell you is that our strategic posture and presence are premised on the concept of a tailored, flexible, light footprint that leverages and supports the posture and presence of partners and is supported by expeditionary infrastructure.”</p> <del><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-6340" src="/wp-uploads/sites/1/2015/10/CampLemonnier-Aircrafts01.png" alt=""></del> <p class="caption source">Illustration: The Intercept</p><p>If you search Africom’s website for news about Camp Lemonnier, you’ll find myriad feel-good stories about <a href="http://www.africom.mil/newsroom/article/10020/camp-lemonnier-goes-green-installs-solar-panels-to">green energy</a> initiatives, the <a href="http://www.africom.mil/newsroom/article/8871/us-army-national-guard-conducts-water-drilling-tes">drilling</a> of water wells, and a <a href="http://www.africom.mil/newsroom/article/8940/toby-keith-visits-camp-lemonnier">visit</a> by country music star Toby Keith.

The kind of reporting we do is essential to democracy, but it is not easy, cheap, or profitable. The Intercept is an independent nonprofit news outlet. We don’t have ads, so we depend on our members — 35,000 and counting — to help us hold the powerful to account. Joining is simple and doesn’t need to cost a lot: You can become a sustaining member for as little as $3 or $5 a month.

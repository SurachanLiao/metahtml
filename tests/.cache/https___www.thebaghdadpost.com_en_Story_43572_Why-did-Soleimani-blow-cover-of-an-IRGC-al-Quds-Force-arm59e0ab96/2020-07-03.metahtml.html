This
is exactly what happened July 25. The government-controlled Iranian media
reported Major-General Qassem Soleimani, chief commander of extraterritorial
operations al-Quds Force of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC),
appointed a new director for the Reconstruction Organization of Holy Shrines in
Iraq.</p><p>
The
questions are what the exact role of this organization is and why Soleimani
disclosed the relationship between al-Quds Force and its cover.</p><p>
Its
website states that the Reconstruction Organization was established as a
&#8220;non-governmental&#8221; and &#8220;non-profit&#8221; entity in 2003, which coincides with the
US-led invasion of Iraq. The website discloses that, apart from activities in
Balad, Karbala, Kazimiyah, Musayib, Najaf and Samarra in Iraq, the organization
has had engagements in Syria.</p><p>
Besides
reconstructing Shiite shrines, those activities include international
fundraising for the reconstruction effort and servicing Iranian pilgrims. Iraqi
officials interviewed by IRNA said the number of Iranian pilgrims to Iraq totaled
3.5 million by 2018. That number has dramatically declined because of US
sanctions against Iran and a 50% devaluation of the Iranian rial.</p><p>
Despite
claims of the Reconstruction Organization being a non-governmental organization,
there are many indications that it is a governmental entity. The Reconstruction
Organization appears on the country&#8217;s annual budget and representatives of
Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei closely monitor its work.</p><p>
The
organization has long been suspected of being a cover for al-Quds Force. Hassan
Pelarak, the first director of the organization, is a native of Kerman and a
veteran of the 41st Sarallah Division of the IRGC. So is Soleimani, who was
commander of the division during the war with Iraq.</p><p>
The
Reconstruction Organization would be an obvious cover for al-Quds Force, which
can use the cover of pilgrim and construction materials logistics to transport
men and materiel from Iran to Iraq, Syria and Lebanon.</p><p>
Those
suspicions were proven right when Soleimani, on July 25, appointed Pelarak his
&#8220;special assistant&#8221; and &#8220;adviser to the Quds Force commander&#8221; and replaced him
with Mohammad Jalal-Maab, another native of Kerman.</p><p>
Soleimani&#8217;s
motives for disclosing the relationship between the Reconstruction Organization
and al-Quds Force are not clear but the decree he issued may shed light into
them: Al-Quds Force&#8217;s commander asked Pelarak to join &#8220;the economics committee
of the [Quds] Force to neutralize the sanctions.&#8221;</p><p>
It
is not known to what extent al-Quds Force is engaged in bypassing the US
sanctions to help Iran&#8217;s economy and openly declaring such intentions hardly
enhances such schemes. However, Soleimani may hope the declarations alone will
further endear him and al-Quds Force to the Iranian public.</p><p>
This
approach is not free of risk. Rather than perceiving Soleimani and al-Quds
Force as saviors, the Iranian public may just as well question the wisdom of
Iran using scarce resources in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon rather than helping
needy Iranians.</p><p>
Worse,
the Iranian public may blame the regime in Tehran and al-Quds Force for
economic hardships, rather than the Trump administration and its maximum
pressure campaign against Iran.

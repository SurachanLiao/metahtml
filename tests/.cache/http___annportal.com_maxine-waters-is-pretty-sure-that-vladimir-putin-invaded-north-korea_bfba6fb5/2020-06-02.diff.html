The only problem? She seemed confused as to where Putin has — and has not — been.</p><p>The congresswoman was quick to condemn Putin for “supplying the bombs that killed innocent children and families,” but she couldn’t quite remember where that happened. Fortunately, a reporter was able to supply her with the answer: Aleppo.</p><p>While Waters’s “Gary Johnson-esque” Aleppo slip wasn’t her finest moment, it was nothing compared to her next statement. To really drive her point home, she cited another “fact” for reporters: 
“And the fact that he is wrapping his arms around Putin while Putin is continuing to advance into Korea…”</p> <p><del><img class="wp-image-797229 size-full" src="../wp-content/uploads/2017/02/putin.jpg" width="700" height="400"></del></p> <p class="text">Screenshot/Google Maps/Getty/AFP; Independent Journal Review</p><p>Waters didn’t specify which Korea Putin was allegedly advancing into. It seems most likely, however, that she meant Crimea, a Ukrainian territory located more than 4,000 miles from Korea.</p><p>Her slip came moments before Minority House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) claimed she couldn’t work with President Bush. Twitter was quick to take notice of the blunders.</p><p>One user pointed out the inconvenient irony of these obviously “fake news” statements and Jake Tapper defending CNN as real news:</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Pelosi: Bush is President</p> <p>Waters: Putin invaded Korea</p> <p>Jake Tapper: CNN's not <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FakeNews?src=hash">#FakeNews</a></p> <p>— Pamela Moore (@Pamela_Moore13) <a href="https://twitter.com/Pamela_Moore13/status/829121578139000833">February 8, 2017</a></p></blockquote><p>Another tweet used their concerns as a reason to confirm Attorney General nominee Jeff Sessions:</p> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><ins>Confirm <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/JeffSessions?src=hash">#JeffSessions Link: https://twitter.com/hashtag/JeffSessions?src=hash </a> immediately!

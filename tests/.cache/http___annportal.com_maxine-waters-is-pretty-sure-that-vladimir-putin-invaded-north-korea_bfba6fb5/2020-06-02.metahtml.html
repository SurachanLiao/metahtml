<article id="post-2104" class="post-2104 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-politics"><p>During a press conference on Monday, Congresswoman Maxine Waters (D-CA) speculated how President Donald Trump could have a relationship with someone as awful as Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p><p>Waters cited various nefarious behaviors exhibited by Putin to prove her point. The only problem? She seemed confused as to where&#160;Putin has &#8212; and has not &#8212; been.</p><p>The congresswoman&#160;was quick to condemn Putin for &#8220;supplying the bombs that killed innocent children and families,&#8221; but she couldn&#8217;t quite remember where that happened. Fortunately, a reporter was able to supply her with the answer: Aleppo.</p><p>While Waters&#8217;s &#8220;Gary Johnson-esque&#8221;&#160;Aleppo slip wasn&#8217;t her finest moment, it was nothing compared to her next statement. To really drive her point home, she&#160;cited another &#8220;fact&#8221; for reporters: 
&#8220;And the fact that he is wrapping his arms around Putin while Putin is continuing to advance into Korea&#8230;&#8221;</p><p class="text">Screenshot/Google Maps/Getty/AFP; Independent Journal Review</p><p>Waters didn&#8217;t specify which Korea Putin was allegedly advancing into. It seems most likely, however, that she meant Crimea, a Ukrainian territory located more than 4,000 miles from Korea.</p><p>Her slip came moments before Minority House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) claimed she couldn&#8217;t work with President Bush. Twitter was quick to take notice of the blunders.</p><p>One user pointed out&#160;the inconvenient irony of these obviously &#8220;fake news&#8221; statements and Jake Tapper defending CNN as real news:</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Pelosi: Bush is President</p>
<p>Waters: Putin invaded Korea</p>

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">First Nancy Pelsio thinks George Bush is president now Maxine Waters says Putin invaded Korea.  What isn't our government telling us?  &#128514;&#128514;&#128514;&#128514;</p>

<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/brianstelter">@brianstelter</a> There's a difference btw flubs &amp; outright lying.  Media should focus on underlying issue which is Trump's loyalty to Putin.</p>

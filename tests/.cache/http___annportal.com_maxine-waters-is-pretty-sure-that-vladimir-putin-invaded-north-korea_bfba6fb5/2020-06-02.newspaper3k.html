<div><p class="shareaholic-canvas"></p><p class="mailmunch-forms-before-post"></p><p>During a press conference on Monday, Congresswoman Maxine Waters (D-CA) speculated how President Donald Trump could have a relationship with someone as awful as Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>
<p>Waters cited various nefarious behaviors exhibited by Putin to prove her point. The only problem? She seemed confused as to where&#160;Putin has &#8212; and has not &#8212; been.</p>
<p>The congresswoman&#160;was quick to condemn Putin for &#8220;supplying the bombs that killed innocent children and families,&#8221; but she couldn&#8217;t quite remember where that happened. Fortunately, a reporter was able to supply her with the answer: Aleppo.</p>
<p>While Waters&#8217;s &#8220;Gary Johnson-esque&#8221;&#160;Aleppo slip wasn&#8217;t her finest moment, it was nothing compared to her next statement. To really drive her point home, she&#160;cited another &#8220;fact&#8221; for reporters:<br>
&#8220;And the fact that he is wrapping his arms around Putin while Putin is continuing to advance into Korea&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>Waters didn&#8217;t specify which Korea Putin was allegedly advancing into. It seems most likely, however, that she meant Crimea, a Ukrainian territory located more than 4,000 miles from Korea.</p>

<p>Her slip came moments before Minority House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) claimed she couldn&#8217;t work with President Bush. Twitter was quick to take notice of the blunders.</p>
<p>One user pointed out&#160;the inconvenient irony of these obviously &#8220;fake news&#8221; statements and Jake Tapper defending CNN as real news:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Pelosi: Bush is President</p>
<p>Waters: Putin invaded Korea</p>
<p>Jake Tapper: CNN's not <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FakeNews?src=hash">#FakeNews</a></p>

<p></p><p>Another&#160;tweet used their concerns as a reason to confirm Attorney General nominee Jeff Sessions:</p>
<p>While they were trying to fight Trump, one user claimed these gaffes only proved the president&#8217;s success:</p><p class="mailmunch-forms-in-post-middle"></p>

<p></p><p>&#8220;Kate&#8221; wondered what else we don&#8217;t know:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">First Nancy Pelsio thinks George Bush is president now Maxine Waters says Putin invaded Korea.  What isn't our government telling us?  &#128514;&#128514;&#128514;&#128514;</p>

<p></p><p>Still, not everyone&#160;realized Waters had made a mistake:</p>
<p>Waters doesn&#8217;t seem too concerned with her mix up, though. Noting&#160;that &#8220;flubs&#8221; are bipartisan, she tweeted:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/brianstelter">@brianstelter</a> There's a difference btw flubs &amp; outright lying.  Media should focus on underlying issue which is Trump's loyalty to Putin.</p>

<p></p><p>If Putin does indeed advance into Korea, you can probably bet&#160;the media will focus on the &#8220;underlying issue&#8221; of Trump&#8217;s &#8220;loyalty&#8221; to Putin.</p>

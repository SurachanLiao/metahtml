<div><p>This convergence &#8212; which I call the &#8220;ladette&#8221; phenomenon &#8212; isn&#8217;t all welcome news, of course. For one thing, more and more women are suffering from illnesses that were once viewed as predominantly male, such as heart disease and alcoholism. On the other hand, it truly has been liberating. Some people look at women&#8217;s adoption of male attributes and say that convergence is all about sameness. I disagree. To me, it means much greater diversity than we have now.

I feel at ease with women who are stay-at-home moms because that&#8217;s what they want to do. They aren&#8217;t framed by a culture that says, &#8220;This is what you should do.

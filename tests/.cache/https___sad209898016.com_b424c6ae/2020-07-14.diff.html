Mason had performed with Delaney &amp; Bonnie who released a more successful version in 1970.  They recorded a live version on December 7, 1969 with Mason in the band that was on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Tour_with_Eric_Clapton">On Tour with Eric Clapton Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Tour_with_Eric_Clapton </a> album.

Dave Mason, formerly of Traffic, wrote and recorded “Only You Know and I Know” in 1970. Mason had performed with Delaney & Bonnie who released a more successful version in 1970. They recorded a live version on December 7, 1969 with Mason in the band that was on the On Tour with Eric Clapton album. Some musicians probably played on all three versions. Rita Coolidge, who recorded with both Mason and Delaney & Bonnie, covered it in 1971.

I think this was the first recorded version.

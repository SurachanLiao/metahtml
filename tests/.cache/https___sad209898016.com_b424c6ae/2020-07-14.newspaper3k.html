<div><p>Dave Mason, formerly of Traffic, wrote and recorded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Only_You_Know_and_I_Know">&#8220;Only You Know and I Know&#8221;</a> in 1970.  Mason had performed with Delaney &amp; Bonnie who released a more successful version in 1970.  They recorded a live version on December 7, 1969 with Mason in the band that was on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Tour_with_Eric_Clapton">On Tour with Eric Clapton</a> album.  Some musicians probably played on all three versions.  Rita Coolidge, who recorded with both Mason and Delaney &amp; Bonnie, covered it in 1971.  </p>

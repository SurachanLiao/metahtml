Nevertheless, there are times when leaders of a nation are required to consider those options.</p><p class="speakable-p-2 p-text">In our modern world where deadly attacks are performed by proxy nations or radical terrorist groups, there are times understanding who was involved and why creates serious challenges when it comes to retaliation for any nations leader.</p><p class="p-text">President Trump's decision to attack Iranian General Qasem Soleimani&#160;on Jan.&#160;3was a very calculated decision.</p><p class="p-text">Soleimani&#160;was not a politician or political leader, he was considered a soldier. He was the leader of the Iranian Quds&#160;Force, an elite section of the Revolutionary Guard with the primary objective of conducting special operations outside of Iran's borders. The New York Times reports they are currently conducting subversive military activities is Iraq, Syria&#160;and Lebanon.</p><p class="p-text">According to the Geneva Convention,&#160;Soleimani would be legally designated as a military combatant, qualifying him to be a target for military action.</p><p class="p-text">There has been a tremendous amount of hand-wringing and grinding of teeth regarding the president's decision to take such audacious action.</p><p class="p-text">However, Soleimani was indeed a clear and present danger to the United States. He was responsible for the deaths of nearly 600 American personnel since 2003,the Dec. 31 attack on the U.S. Embassy in Iraq&#160;and was allegedly in the process of planning attacks on four&#160;more American embassies.</p><p class="p-text">Obviously when an attack is made upon another nation's military leaders, you must understand and prepare for some type of reprisal. Iran's leaders found themselves in a very tough situation. Doing nothing would show a sign of weakness they could ill afford, as they see themselves as a major player on the world stage.</p><p class="p-text">Consequently, if a military retaliation resulted in large numbers of American deaths, they clearly understood Trump would respond with an overwhelming and ferocious attack that would pound their military back to the stone ages.</p><p class="p-text">Any time you plan a hasty military attack in retaliation, you must consider Murphy's law, and be aware Murphy may very well make his presence known. Such was the case with Iran's Jan. 8 missile attack on Iraq that injured 64 Americans. No doubt it was planned as a face-saving situation&#160;with no intention of causing massive casualties.</p><p class="p-text">Regrettably, their decision and planning was flawed. Shooting down a Ukrainian jetliner killing 176 was surely not anything they could have foreseen, but the odds were against them.</p><p class="p-text">The attack against Soleimani&#160;was only the second time in history that our nation chose to assassinate a foreign nation's top military leader. A similar attack we undertook&#160;was on April 18, 1943, when we shot down Japan's commander of the combined fleet, Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, over Bougainville Island&#160;in the South Pacific.</p><p class="p-text">Even though we had been at war with Japan for 18 months, the morality of assassinating an individual commander was discussed heavily between President Franklin Delano Roosevelt&#160;and the top officials in our war plans department.</p><p class="p-text">Trump's decision to assassinate&#160;Soleimani was no different than&#160;FDR's decision to assassinate Yamamoto. Neither man was the political leader of their nation, and both men were trained combatants, involved in active hostilities against the United States.&#160;</p><p class="p-text">Assassinating any type of leader brings up morality questions that can be argued for years. That's exactly why America has chosen not to take such drastic actions for 77 years. But the world needs to understand dangerous times call for bold and effective leadership, and the willingness to act when called upon to do so.</p><p class="p-text p-text-last" id="article-body-p-last">This is the opinion of Gerry Feld, whose column is published the second Sunday of the month.

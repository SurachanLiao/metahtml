We have a very interesting scenario developing around the world ladies and gentlemen. Al Gore, Greta Thunberg et al, are going to be left with egg on their faces as the use of carbon dioxide emissions drop drastically (which they blame for global warming) due to the global Convid-109 lockdown, as factories and fuel emissions decline world-wide. March brought a substantial (more than 45 %) drop in global commercial air traffic. According to their mantra, as co2 use drops so will the temperature of our planet. <a href="https://www.thebigwobble.org/2020/03/has-coronavirus-put-al-gore-greta.html" target="_blank">TBW Link: https://www.thebigwobble.org/2020/03/has-coronavirus-put-al-gore-greta.html </a></ins></p><p><ins>Covid-19: Day 89: Mar 28th: <span>Almost 600,000 cases: </span>Cases in Italy overtake China as US infections pass 100,000: Countries affected 184 of 195: Rise in domestic violence and child abuse: Hubei Residents Riot After Quarantine Lifted. <span>Countries affected </span><span>184/195. </span><span>The USA confirms </span><span>104,901 cases.</span><span>Total confirmed cases at almost </span><span>600,000 with almost 12,000</span><span>of them in a critical condition.

As I walk my dog every day I come across only occasional other dog walkers or runners who are only too ready to distance themselves from me, eying me with caution. Empty busses pass me by as do the occasional automobile, however, Holland wouldn't be Holland without bicycles and scooters and, this is the mode of transport at the moment, especially for the kids. <a href="https://www.thebigwobble.org/2020/03/a-letter-from-holland-unusual-skies.html" target="_blank">TBW Link: https://www.thebigwobble.org/2020/03/a-letter-from-holland-unusual-skies.html </a></ins></p><p><ins><span>Covid-19: Day 90: Mar 29th: </span>China's stats beginning to reveal a massive cover-up: 1.6million people in England infected?

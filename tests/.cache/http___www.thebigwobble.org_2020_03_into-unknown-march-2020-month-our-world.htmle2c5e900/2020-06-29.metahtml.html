<span>Untold billions of animals and marine life have died due to man, disease and pollution in February </span>2020: Avian Flu, African Swine Fever, algae bloom and greed all a contribution to the carnage.&#160;Below is a "small" list, showing deaths of animals killed by disease, pollution or man in the 2nd month of 2020 and let me tell you, I have hardly scratched the surface,&#160; many millions of more deaths don't get reported. As for marine life, most of the dead sink to the bottom, or the birds, die out at sea, so you see, below is just a tiny per cent of the real carnage.</p><p>

<span>A letter from Holland:</span> Unusual skies this week in the Amsterdam region as the world enters lockdown: Libertine, tolerant and free Amsterdam is at this moment just like the rest of the world, empty as the Covid-19 threat takes hold. As I walk my dog every day I come across only occasional other dog walkers or runners who are only too ready to distance themselves from me, eying me with caution. Empty busses pass me by as do the occasional automobile, however, Holland wouldn't be Holland without bicycles and scooters and, this is the mode of transport at the moment, especially for the kids.&#160;<a href="https://www.thebigwobble.org/2020/03/a-letter-from-holland-unusual-skies.html" target="_blank">TBW</a></p><p>

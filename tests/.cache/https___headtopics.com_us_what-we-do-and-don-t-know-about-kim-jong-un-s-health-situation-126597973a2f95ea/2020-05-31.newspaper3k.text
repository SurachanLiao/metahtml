U.S. sources say the North Korean leader is in critical condition, but South Korea is telling a different story.

U.S. sources say the North Korean leader is in critical condition, but South Korea is telling a different story.

His absence came after he had a cardiovascular procedure on April 12,, a South Korean online newspaper covering news on North Korea. The report cited a single North Korean source, who speculated the surgery may be tied to Kim‚Äôs obesity, smoking habit or ‚Äúoverwork.‚Äù

South Korea is contradicting these reportsConfusion over Kim‚Äôs health grew Tuesday as South Korean officials issued a statementcontradictingreports on Kim‚Äôs health by American media outlets.‚ÄúWe confirm that Chairman Kim Jong Un is currently touring provincial areas with his close aides and we do not detect evidences to support speculation about his ill health,‚Äù President Moon Jae-in‚Äôs office said in a statement.

KCNA KCNA / ReutersSouth Korea has contradicted U.S. media claims that Kim is in dangerously poor health right now. ‚ÄúEven North Korea‚Äôs Worker‚Äôs Party, military or cabinet aren‚Äôt showing any special movements such as emergency decree. We believe that Chairman Kim is active as normal as he has been,‚Äù the office said.

The South Korean currencytook a hitafter reports about Kim‚Äôs health broke.The lack of clarity on Kim‚Äôs health reflects how difficult it is to confirm anything happening in the closed-off dictatorship. North Korea has stricter controls on media than any other country in the world, and the government has a tight hold on what information gets in or out.

In 2011, for example, the country managed to conceal then-leader Kim Jong Il‚Äôs death for two days. Officials are suspected ofsome of the details about his death to make it seem nobler than it was, as projecting an image of a strong, invincible leader is a key element of North Korea‚Äôs politics.

He is suspected to have generally poor healthGiven the instability his death could cause, the global community has long.The supreme leader reportedly smokes and drinks in excess. Experts on Kim have also pointed to hissignificant weight gainwhile in office, which could be dangerous for him given reports he is diabetic and has high blood pressure.

No human being is powerful,its only measured by external forces. Hitler wasn't powerful, but a coward who had the Nazis to act out his evil behaviour on innocent souls,his evil his demise. The article you are is from 4 days ago though! He‚Äôs probably in some Chinese hospital. Do not believe ANYTHING coming from U.S. sources today unless they give pictures, videotape, etc. Trump has so trashed norms that people in the U.S. government who are pro-Trump will actively lie to distract from their Messiah's stupidity.

Rocket man is dead. North Korea really needs a woman‚Äôs touch right now. This article says he has a remaining brother who‚Äôs focused on his music and I need that story green lit yesterday Did Kim take medical advice from Donald? I wouldn't believe 'US sources' if they told me that the sky was blue I hope he lives out his life in a vegetative state, like Otto Warmbier!!

Dead. We dont believe you Huff,fake trash news. So he is getting closer to death. Is there a North Korean version of 'Pranksters' ?

Kang said. &#8220;There is nothing we can confirm with regard to Chairman Kim&#8217;s alleged health problem.&#8221;</p><p>A senior presidential official said that Kim was staying in a provincial region together with close aides.</p><p>&#8220;No unusual signs have been found that can back up the alleged health problem,&#8221; the official said.</p><p>&#8220;North Korea&#8217;s Workers&#8217; Party, the military, the cabinet are not showing any special moves, such as an emergency alert.&#8221;</p><p>The official also said that Kim appeared to be acting &#8220;normally.&#8221;</p><p>Speculation about Kim grew since he skipped an annual visit to the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun for the 108th birthday of his late grandfather and state founder Kim Il-sung last Wednesday.</p><p>Talks between President Donald Trump and Kim over North Korea&#8217;s nuclear program have been stalled since the pair&#160;<a href="https://nypost.com/2019/06/30/trump-meets-with-kim-jong-un-in-koreas-dmz/">met in June 2019 in the DMZ</a>&#160;separating the two Koreas.</p><p>On Tuesday, National Security Adviser Robert O&#8217;Brien told reporters at the White House that the administration was &#8220;watching reports closely.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;We are monitoring these reports very closely and as you know North Korea is a very closed society, there is not a free press there, they are parsimonious with the information they provide on many things, including the health of Kim Jong Un,&#8221; O&#8217;Brien said, adding that the US intelligence community and Defense Department were watching the situation.It&#8217;s unclear what would happen if Kim is sidelined by health problems or dies.</p><p>While North Korea has not made clear who would potentially succeed Kim, some experts believe his sister, Kim Yo Jong, would step in as nominal leader.</p><p>Others told Fox that North Korea could be ruled by the collective leadership of party elites, similar to the Soviet Union after the iron rule of Joseph Stalin.</p><p class="td_block_wrap td_block_related_posts td_uid_105_5ed5e27bb3073_rand td_with_ajax_pagination td-pb-border-top"><h4 class="td-related-title"><a id="td_uid_106_5ed5e27bbb404" class="td-related-left td-cur-simple-item" href="#">RELATED ARTICLES</a><a id="td_uid_107_5ed5e27bbb4bf" class="td-related-right" href="#">MORE FROM AUTHOR</a></h4>                 <a href="https://openyoureyespeoplebreakingnews.com/category/anarchy/" class="td-post-category">Anarchy</a><p class="item-details"><h3 class="entry-title td-module-title"><a href="https://openyoureyespeoplebreakingnews.com/2020/06/01/trump-was-reportedly-rushed-to-underground-bunker-for-protection-during-d-c-protests-video/" rel="bookmark" title="Trump Was Reportedly Rushed To Underground Bunker For Protection During D.C.

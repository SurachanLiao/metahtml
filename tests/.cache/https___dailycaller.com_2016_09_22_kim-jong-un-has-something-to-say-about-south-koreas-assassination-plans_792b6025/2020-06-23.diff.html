Seoul will also obliterate Pyongyang. Next month, South Korea will train with the U.S. to <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2016/09/21/u-s-ups-the-ante-with-b-1b-bomber-deployments-to-south-korea/">eliminate</a> North Korea’s nuclear facilities.</p><p>“The nuclear warheads fired by the KPA as punishment will completely reduce to ashes Seoul, the center of confrontation,” the General Staff of the KPA said in response to these plans.</p><p>The U.S. sent two supersonic B-1B Lancers to <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2016/09/21/u-s-ups-the-ante-with-b-1b-bomber-deployments-to-south-korea/">fly</a> closely along the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) Wednesday. In an unprecedented move, one of the bombers landed and is currently stationed on the Korean Peninsula. B-52 and B-2 bombers may join the aircraft in the future.</p><p>“Should [the U.S.] escalate the danger of military provocations by letting B-1Bs fly over the air of Korea, the KPA will sweep Guam, the base of provocations, from the surface of the earth,” said KPA officials.</p><p>“The ‘operation for eliminating the leadership of the north’ much touted by the Park Geun Hye group would result in reducing Seoul to debris, and the U.S. introduction of nuclear war means would put the aggressor forces’ bases in the theatres of Pacific operations into a nuclear nightmare,” KPA officials explained.</p><p>Pyongyang has the ability to turn some of its threats into actions. For other threats, the North still needs time to develop the necessary capabilities. With significant investments in its military, North Korea is rapidly moving towards the realization of its military ambitions.</p><p>After its latest nuclear weapons test, North Korea claimed that it can now mount nuclear warheads on ballistic missiles. Whether it can or not has yet to be determined, but if Pyongyang has not mastered these skills yet, it is likely to do so soon.</p><p>“The DPRK’s access to the treasured nuclear sword is aimed to foil the adventurous nuclear war racket of the U.S. imperialists,” North Korea’s KPA officials warned.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/rwp2011" target="_blank">Follow Ryan on Twitter</a></p><p>Send tips to <a href="mailto:YOUREMAILHERE@dailycallernewsfoundation.org" target="_blank">ryan@dailycallernewsfoundation.org</a>.</p><p>Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

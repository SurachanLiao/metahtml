<p>Rumours of a coup after the mysterious disappearance of despot Kim Jong-un have been put to bed after it was revealed the North Korean leader is merely recovering from surgery &#8211; after cheese-fuelled weight gain caused him to fracture his ankles.</p>
<p>Unbridled daily binges on Emmental imported from Switzerland are believed to be responsible for the dictator&#8217;s rapid weight gain, with some defectors speculating he was trying to match the considerable bulk of his grandfather, Kim Il-sung.</p>
<p>And South Korea&#8217;s largest newspaper claims that the tubby tyrant is in fact recovering from two fractured ankles after the strain of his expanding waistline put pressure on a pre-existing injury &#8211; and caused the bones to crack.</p>
<p>&#8216;I heard that Kim Jong-un injured his right ankle in June after pushing ahead with on-site visits and ended up fracturing both ankles because he left the injury unattended,&#8217; an unnamed source told Chosun Ilbo.&#160;The source added that the 31-year-old had undergone an operation at the Bonghwa Clinic, an exclusive hospital for high-ranking party members.</p>
<p>Kim, who has not been seen in public in almost a month, missed a session of the Supreme People&#8217;s Assembly in Pyongyang for the first time since ascending to power in 2011, sending the gossip mill into overdrive.</p>
<p>Chinese social media Weibo went crazy with reports that a former North Korean vice marshal had overthrown Kim in a coup, while outside commentators speculated he had developed gout, which runs in his family.</p>

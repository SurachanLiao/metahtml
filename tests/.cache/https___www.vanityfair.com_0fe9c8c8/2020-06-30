<strong>Meghanâs</strong> Archewell apparently wonât be getting a high profile launch this summer.</p>\n<p>While the Covid pandemic is partly to blame, the couple have told their team they want to take their time getting the organization ârightâ and wonât be doing a high profile launch.</p>\n<p>The organization will be the backbone of the coupleâs philanthropic work, and the work the Sussexes are currently involved with reflects the work Archewell will do in the future.</p>\n<p>âThey are in no hurry to launch Archewell , they want to get it  right, thatâs really important to them,â said a source. âThis is something that they want to do for the rest of their lives so theyâre not going to be pressured into launching something thatâs still in the relatively early stages of development.â</p>\n<p>The couple are currently focused on the Black Lives Matter movement, and last week visited Homeboy Industries to learn about their gang intervention and rehabilitation programs. This weekend <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2020/06/meghan-and-harry-civil-rights-work-calls\">it emerged</a> that the couple have also been involved with the Stop Hate for Profit campaign to pressure Facebook to block hate speech on its platform.</p>\n<p>âEverythingÂ they&#39;re doing at the moment is part of Archewell,â a source said. âWhetherÂ Covid, BLM or their ongoing charity work, it&#39;s all part of how they&#39;re working on Archewell and developingÂ their work and focus going forward. Their team have been working on hate speech issues, and tech-for-good behind the scenes since the beginning of the year. It was the focus of their visit to Stanford in February.â</p>\n<p>The Sussexes were prematurely forced to announce details about Archewell, named in honor of their son <strong>Archie</strong>, after trademark documents were leaked to the <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/royal-family/2020/04/06/revealed-prince-harry-meghan-plan-non-profit-empire-name-archewell/\">Daily Telegraph</a> in April.</p>\n<p>As Meghan and Harry cautiously think through their next plans, the new royal book <em>Royals At War</em> revisiting claims that Meghan drove palace staff âto distractionâ by rushing into supporting projects without properly thinking things through, and âwithout proper research.â</p>\n<p>Sources close to the Sussexes say the book is based on rumour rather than fact, but it is no secret that Meghan clashed with some palace officials.  Soon after marrying into the royal family reports emerged about the duchessâs habit of sending 5 a.m. emails, which allegedly earned her the nickname âHurricane Meghan.â Palace staff complained that they were unable to keep up with the new royalâs pace.</p>\n<p>According to one senior palace source, while Meghanâs drive was commended by some, she was urged to slow down by experienced courtiers concerned that she was taking on too much.</p>\n<p>Even <strong>Michelle Obama</strong> urged Meghan to take her time, and when asked what advice she had for the new Duchess in an interview the former First Lady and friend of Prince Harry said, âOne of my biggest pieces of advice would be to take some time and donât be in a hurry to do anything.â</p>\n<p>Meghan continued to work hard, however, and after taking on a handful of patronages she worked around the clock even during her pregnancy. She even worked through most of her maternity leave, editing the September issue of British <em>Vogue</em> and working on a clothing line for the charity Smart Works.</p>\n<p>âYou can say what you want about Meghan, but she works incredibly hard,â said a source who has worked with the Sussexes.  âThe problem is she and Harry have a tendency to hatch big projects over dinner and expect them to be actioned within days. Meghan had brilliant ideas, but she was always in a hurry and aides had to sit down and explain that foundations and big projects take thought, time and commitment, they cannot be rushed.â</p>\n<p>Now it seems the couple are heeding that advice and taking their time. Under the guidance of a new PR team they are hatching a long term plan to become global philanthropists and high-profile public speakers.  It was <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2020/06/prince-harry-meghan-markle-speaking-deal\">announced last week</a> that they have signed up with the Harry Walker agency which could see them earn fees of up to one million dollars for public speaking engagements. However, sources say that Archewell remains their principal focus and their next steps will be slow and deliberate ones.</p>\n<p>âThey have learned from the mistakes of the past and taking their time with Archewell,â said a well-placed source. âThey want to get the next stage right.â</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories From <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; Author Uzodinma Iweala on <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2020/06/white-signs-at-black-protests?itm_content=footer-recirc\">White Signs</a> at Black Protests<br>\n&#8212; âGeorge Floyd Was Killed in <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2020/06/growing-up-in-george-floyds-minneapolis-neighborhood?itm_content=footer-recirc\">My Neighborhood</a>â<br>\n&#8212; 15 Years After Katrina, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2020/06/hard-times-in-the-big-easy?itm_content=footer-recirc\">a Second Storm</a>&#8212;Coronavirus&#8212;Hits New Orleans<br>\n&#8212; How <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2020/06/meghan-markle-george-floyd-black-lives-matter-speech?itm_content=footer-recirc\">Meghan Markle</a> Decided to Finally Speak Out About George Floyd<br>\n&#8212; Nikkita Oliver on Seattleâs Extraordinary Protests and <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2020/06/nikkita-oliver-on-seattles-extraordinary-protests?itm_content=footer-recirc\">What Comes Next</a><br>\n&#8212; Where J.K.

White House has apparently known of possible Russian bounties on Americans in Afghanistan since early 2019, pushing the timeline back a full year earlier than when the administration was initially thought to have learned of the intelligence. The shocking findings that a Russian military intelligence agency offered rewards to Taliban-linked militants for attacks on U.S. and coalition forces is something that President <strong>Donald Trump</strong> was previously reported to have known and done nothing about since late March, despite <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/06/russian-bounty-report-seems-like-kind-of-thing-trump-shouldve-known-gop-says\">claiming</a> on Sunday that no one told him about such information.</p>\n<p>But the Associated Press <a href=\"https://apnews.com/425e43fa0ffdd6e126c5171653ec47d1\">reported</a> on Tuesday that Trump was briefed at least twice on the matter in 2019, in his written daily intelligence briefings as well as by then-national security adviser <strong>John Bolton</strong>, who reportedly told colleagues in March 2019 that he had briefed the president on the intelligence assessment. Bolton declined to comment on this when asked by the outlet on Monday, but did suggest that Trump has a tendency to feign ignorance when trying to skirt accountability. âHe can disown everything if nobody told him about it,â Bolton said on Sundayâs <em>Meet the Press</em>.</p>\n<p>The AP previously reported that Trump was again made aware of the Russian bounty allegations at least two more times this year, in another written presidential daily briefing as well as in a discussion with national security adviser <strong>Robert OâBrien</strong>. OâBrien has denied discussing the intelligence with Trump and on Monday said the assessments âhave not been verified,â an argument put forth by the White House to explain why the president was not, and has yet to be, briefed on the matter. But it is ârare for intelligence to be confirmed without a shadow of a doubt before it is presented to top officials,â notes the APâs <strong>James LaPorta</strong>. âThe administrationâs earlier awareness of the Russian efforts raises additional questions about why Trump did not take any punitive action against Moscow for efforts that put the lives of Americans service members at risk.â (Russia <a href=\"https://www.msnbc.com/andrea-mitchell-reports/watch/kremlin-dmitry-peskov-denies-russia-offered-taliban-bounties-to-kill-u-s-troops-86348869799\">has denied</a> the bounty allegations).</p>\n<p>The president has yet to authorize a response despite reports of potential options developed by career government officials, raising questions of government inaction and Trumpâs kid gloves approach to Russia&#8212;and leaving Republicans scrambling to figure out how to address. Lawmakers have called on the administration to present more information and, the <em>Washington Post</em> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/republicans-once-again-face-questions-over-why-trump-isnt-tougher-on-russia/2020/06/29/c21f0c76-ba18-11ea-bdaf-a129f921026f_story.html\">reported</a>, for Russia to be punished if the intelligence is found to be true. Senators <strong>Cory Gardner</strong> and <strong>Thom Tillis</strong> made similar calls for Russia to be treated by the U.S. government as a state sponsor of terrorism. Senator <strong>Ben Sasse</strong> called on Congress to find out âWho knew what, when, and did the commander in chief know? And if not, how the hell not?â Sasse noted that if the intelligence information is deemed accurate, â[imposing] the proportional cost in responseâ would, in these circumstances, âmean Taliban and GRU body bags.â</p>\n<p>The <em>Post</em> notes that Republicans âtook a notably tougher public toneâ than Trump did but still largely skirted the question of whether Trump should have known about the report. âWhile the Trump administration has taken some aggressive measures against Russia, the presidentâs conciliatory tone toward Russian President <strong>Vladmir Putin</strong> continues to be a thorny political problem for Republicans who have advocated a more hawkish approach toward the authoritarian leader,â writes the <em>Post</em>âs <strong>Seung Min Kim</strong>.</p>\n<p>Those familiar with Trumpâs phone calls with world leaders like Putin and Turkish President <strong>Recep Erdogan</strong> were so concerned by what they heard that they concluded Trump âposed a danger to the national security of the United States,â CNN <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/29/politics/trump-phone-calls-national-security-concerns/index.html\">reported</a>. According to two sources, White House chief of staff <strong>John Kelly</strong> and Defense Secretary <strong>James Mattis</strong> are among the former top Trump deputies who came to see the president as âdelusionalâ in his interactions with foreign leaders.</p>\n<p>âThe sources said there was little evidence that the President became more skillful or competent in his telephone conversations with most heads of state over time,â CNNâs <strong>Carl Bernstein</strong> writes of the alarming calls that are of particular concern in light of the bounty reports. âRather, he continued to believe that he could either charm, jawbone or bully almost any foreign leader into capitulating to his will, and often pursued goals more attuned to his own agenda than what many of his senior advisers considered the national interest.â</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories From <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The Parallel Universe of Ivanka Trump, Americaâs <a

was 1950. Carl Reiner was on the set of Sid Caesarâs variety series <em>Your Show of Shows</em> when he overheard another comic doing a bit about a Jewish pirate.</p>\n<p>âHe said, âI canât afford to pillage and rape anymore! $3.50 for a sailcloth, who can afford that?!ââ Reiner recalled in a 2012 interview <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/JerrySeinfeld/videos/281221871989165/\">with <strong>Jerry Seinfeld.</strong></a> The comedian was, of course, <strong>Mel Brooks,</strong> with whom Reiner would end up working on an improvisational bit called <em>The 2000 Year Old Man.</em> Brooks played the titular ancient character; Reiner played the straight man, peppering his partner with funny questions. The bit, which they spun into a regular sketch and several successful albums, drew fans like Cary Grant and <strong>Queen Elizabeth II.</strong> âI said to Mel, âThe biggest shiksa in the world loved our record. Weâre in!ââ Reiner told <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Upgd4icKDOU\">PBS in 2016.</a></p>\n<p>The albums would become the bedrock of Brooks and Reinerâs friendship, which would span the <a href=\"https://archive.vanityfair.com/article/2013/1/mel-brooks-and-carl-reiner\">next 70 years</a>&#8212;until <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2020/06/carl-reiner-dies\">Reinerâs death Monday night.</a></p>\n<p>âI donât think Iâve ever had a better friend than Carl,â Brooks told <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/feb/20/love-and-free-food-mel-brooks-and-carl-reiner-share-the-secrets-of-their-70-year-friendship\">The Guardian</a></em> in a joint February interview with Reiner.</p>\n<p>âMy God, the thought of being without him&#8212;the world would be too bleak!â Reiner exclaimed in response.</p>\n<p>As true fans of the duo know, the comedy legends were inseparable even as they were shaping their influential and ever-evolving careers. Reiner would create <em>The Dick Van Dyke Show</em> and direct films like <em>The Jerk,</em> while Brooks would helm classics like <em>Blazing Saddles</em> and <em>Young Frankenstein.</em> As they grew older, the duo perfected the same nightly routine: Brooks would get in his car and drive to Reinerâs Beverly Hills house, where they would eat dinner, watch <em>Jeopardy,</em> and then tuck into a movie&#8212;sometimes their own movies, or sometimes cheesy action movies filled with lines like âLock all the doors!â or âSecure the perimeters!â</p>\n<p>â[If] we hear those, we know weâre in for a good time,â Reiner once said. âIf he doesnât come over, I donât know what to do with myself.â</p>\n<p>Occasionally, other friends would join, like comedian <strong>Alan Alda</strong> or <em>The Graduate</em> screenwriter Buck Henry&#8212;whom Reiner would coax into watching their old works, like the series <em>Get Smart,</em> which Henry and Brooks cocreated. âWe watched the pilot...[to] see what we could remember,â Brooks <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/JerrySeinfeld/videos/281221871989165/\">recalled.</a></p>\n<p>Over the years, Brooks and Reiner also continued working together, showing off their chemistry on <em>Late Night</em> and revamping <em>2000 Year Old Man</em> into a book&#8212;the recording of which later earned them a best-spoken-album Grammy. âHeâs a great comedian to this day!â Brooks crowed in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo407vvCZG4\">a 2013 interview</a> about his friend.</p>\n<p>They found ways to keep close even as the coronavirus pandemic struck, calling each other to watch <em>Jeopardy</em> and <em>Wheel of Fortune</em> on their respective TVs at the same time. âWe try to guess the answers and, you know, we have fun on the phone,â Reiner said <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/mel-brooks-carl-reiner-coronavirus-social-distancing-154418268.html\">in April.</a></p>\n<p>They also managed to spend time together on Brooksâs recent 94th birthday on June 28, per Reinerâs manager <strong>George Shapiro,</strong> who posted photos of the celebration on Twitter. In one photo, Brooks and Reiner lay alongside Reinerâs daughter, <strong>Annie,</strong> and sport matching Black Lives Matter shirts.</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote

The video features protest footage interspersed with video game animation and clips from Westâs Saint Pablo tour and Sunday Service events.</p>\n<div class=\"embed block video row\"><div class=\"wrapper\"><iframe height=\"400\" width=\"600\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0U2QUGKbSE\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allowtransparency=\"true\"> </iframe></div></div><p>But itâs not just a new track West is celebrating today.

Emmy nominations approach, Vanity Fairâs HWD team is once again diving deep into some of the shows that struck us most, and asking actors and creators how the seasonâs greatest scenes and characters came together. You can read more of these close looks <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/for-your-consideration-tv\">here</a>.</em></p>\n<h4><strong>The Character: Catherine the Great, <em>The Great</em></strong></h4>\n<p>In <em>The Great</em>âs first episode, a pink-cheeked Catherine (<strong>Elle Fanning</strong>) pilots a flower-entwined swing and burbles to a friend about how romantic her wedding to Russian Emperor Peter III (<strong>Nicholas Hoult</strong>) will be. But after Catherine is delivered from her sleepy German village to the Russian palace, her girlish dreams are dashed when she meets the tyrannical and narcissistic Peter. As she solemnly presents him with an evergreen as a symbol of their love, he turns to one of his minions and barks, âShe gave me a twig. Sheâs not another inbred, is she?â</p>\n<p>Itâs the abrupt end of her innocent imaginings, as well as the start of a young womanâs campaign, aided by her wit and charm, to plot a putsch&#8212;after Catherine learns that if Peter just happens to be killed, she can claim the throne.</p>\n<p>âItâs been phenomenal to watch Elle grow into this character as a performer, to balance a tightrope in bringing her to life as this woman who is naive but strong, and also powerless at times,â says Hoult. â[Sheâs] understanding this new world sheâs been thrown into, and also her raison dâÃªtre.â</p>\n<p>Fanning brings great depth and dimension to her characterâs evolution, holding fast to Catherineâs humanity and vulnerability even as she grows ruthlessly cunning&#8212;particularly in the seasonâs final episode, when she learns just what her power grab will cost her. Below, Fanning explains what drew her to Catherine, the toughest part of filming <em>The Great</em>âs intimate scenes, and the surprising request she made as an executive producer of the show.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Vanity Fair:</em> As Catherine immerses herself in court intrigue and consolidates power, she wavers between confidence and naivete. Was that a hard balance to strike?</strong></p>\n<p><em>Elle Fanning:</em> [The role] challenged me in a way that I havenât been challenged before. As a character, Catherine has one of my favorite qualities, which is that sheâs extremely arrogant. She has a huge ego and doesnât apologize for it, which was so fun to play. But she also questions herself, and has these weaknesses&#8212;these moments of really not knowing if sheâs up for the challenge too&#8212;which was important to me. Iâm not interested in playing âSheâs strong all the time. Sheâs the bravest and she always makes the right decisions!â I donât want to watch that.</p>\n<p>I also love that sheâs very romantic, but she learns that her love affair over the whole season is really her love for Russia. Which was interesting. Her most important quality, too, is her youth. Youth is such a big factor in the decisions she makes&#8212;and sometimes theyâre a bit rash, but sheâs young and sheâs learning. And sheâs a different woman at the end of it.</p>\n<p><strong>You have known your costar Nicholas Hoult since you were 14 and costarred in the film <em>Young Ones.</em> Did that familiarity make things easier during the sex scenes?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes. I felt so unembarrassed with him. He was very familiar with the rhythm of the words, because he was in <em>The Favourite,</em> so he helped keep my rhythm up and the comedic timing. Heâs so incredible, in part because he adds so many layers to his character that could have been one-note. And we were just always on the same page. We wanted to create this dynamic relationship where they do love each other at times and she kind of pities him and sometimes she doesnât want him to die.</p>\n<p>The sex scenes were hard to get through because youâre in this position, which is already awkward or funny, and then you would have to say these hilarious lines. Thereâs one sex scene where Peterâs thrusting for an heir, like a hundred thrusts, and thereâs a wide shot where weâre just in the background. We didnât have to say anything, all he has to do is thrust. Iâm just like, âLetâs get through it.â Thank god weâre not both earnest or take ourselves too seriously, because youâve got to have fun.</p>\n<p><strong>You had an intimacy coordinator on the set. Was that the first time youâve ever worked with someone like that?</strong></p>\n<p>The first time.  Sheâs there for support and so that you feel comfortable, but she also makes sure that things look real, which is interesting. Like sheâll say, âNick, youâre in the wrong position, you need to be lower.â And she provides great pillows, like crotch pillows and things that she sews herself, so you have a kind of separation.</p>\n<p>I really enjoyed those scenes. [Writer] <strong>Tony McNamara</strong> and I would talk about how the show actually is not really sexually explicit at all, because  all the girls&#8212;except for when I was with [court-appointed lover] Leo (<strong>Sebastian de Souza</strong>)&#8212;are basically fully clothed. Because we canât take the corsets off! [<em>laughs</em>] In court, Iâm sure they would just think it was much easier and more practical just to pull your skirts up.</p>\n<p>In my scenes with Nick, Iâm always fully clothed, because itâs just about getting an heir and thatâs it. The only nudity we have on the show is bottoms! We all kind of get a turn. I have a bottom, Nick has a bottom, and Sebastian has a bottom. We all had our moment.</p>\n<p><strong>Speaking of outrageous scenes, you executive produce the show. Did you ever veto anything as too over the top?</strong></p>\n<p>Oh, I wanted it more [over the top]. [<em>laughs</em>]</p>\n<p><strong>More severed heads! Roll them in!</strong></p>\n<p>Thatâs me! People are so surprised by that sometimes. I mean, if you know me, youâre not surprised by it, but you might be if youâre only aware of my Sleeping Beauty persona. I always wanted to push it. I wanted things to be even weirder. I wanted more blood.</p>\n<p><em>This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.</em></p>\n<h5>Where to Watch <em>The Great</em>:</h5>\n<hr/>\n<p><em>All products featured on</em> Vanity Fair <em>are independently selected by our editors.

He worked as a Borscht Belt joker at the Allaben Acres resort in New Yorkâs Adirondack Mountains, where he met his future wife, singer Estelle Lebost, and he learned the skills that served him as a comedy writer under actor Maurice Evans in the U.S. Armyâs entertainment unit in Hawaii during World War II.</p>\n<p>After the war, Reiner landed two jobs with one audition: summer entertainment director at the Lake Spofford Hotel in New Hampshire, and replacement for star Jules Munshin in the touring production of the revue <em>Call Me Mister.</em> Roles such as the latter, as well as in Broadway musicals <em>Inside U.S.A.</em> and <em>Alive and Kicking,</em> led to his casting in the sketch company of Sid Caesarâs landmark live-TV comedy series <em>Your Show of Shows.</em> Throughout the 1950s, Reiner would work as a performer and writer on Caesarâs various shows, working with a legendary team of scribes that included <strong>Neil Simon, Mel Brooks,</strong> Larry Gelbart, and <strong>Woody Allen.</strong> He also wrote his first book, 1958âs <em>Enter Laughing,</em> an autobiographical novel about his early days as an actor.</p>\n<p>Reiner drew from his own life to create his first sitcom, <em>Head of the Family,</em> about a young, recently married TV-sketch-comedy writer, in which Reiner also starred. The show was a flop until Reiner retooled it with a new leading actor and actress and took a supporting role as the sketch showâs egotistical host, Alan Brady. The result was <em>The Dick Van Dyke Show</em> (which was on-air from 1960 to 1966), an innovative series that made <strong>Dick Van Dyke</strong> and Mary Tyler Moore into stars and earned Reiner several Emmys for the showâs mix of sexy, sophisticated comedy and silly slapstick.</p>\n<p>As <em>Dick Van Dyke</em> wound down, Reiner moved on to Hollywood, with a prominent acting role in the 1966 comedy <em>The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming.</em> He made his directing debut in 1967 with the screen version of <em>Enter Laughing.</em> Over the next 30 years, heâd direct such comedies as black-comedy cult hit <em>Whereâs Poppa?</em> (1970), <em>Oh, God!</em> (1977), <strong>Steve Martin</strong> and <strong>Lily Tomlinâs</strong> 1984 <em>All of Me</em> (perhaps the best film Reiner or Martin ever made), the underrated 1987 <em>Summer School,</em> and the 1993 spoof of modern-day noirs <em>Fatal Instinct.</em></p>\n<p>Reiner, who in a 2013 interview described his job as âtalent scout,â was instrumental in launching or jump-starting the careers of numerous funny people. He made TV stars out of Van Dyke and Moore and a film star out of Martin, whom he directed in four movies, including Martinâs first lead role in 1979âs <em>The Jerk.</em> Reiner introduced a new generation of fans to George Burns (then 81), revitalizing the veteran comicâs film career by directing him in <em>Oh, God!</em> He launched British musical-theater star <strong>Robert Lindsayâs</strong> movie career with 1989âs <em>Bert Rigby, Youâre a Fool,</em> which Reiner wrote for Lindsay. Reiner and his wife, Estelle, brought <em>All in the Family</em> star turned film director <strong>Rob Reiner</strong> into the world (and two other children, author <strong>Annie</strong> and artist <strong>Lucas</strong>). And, of course, he helped make his fellow Sid Caesar sketch writer <strong>Mel Brooks</strong> famous via the pairâs â2000 Year Old Manâ routines.</p>\n<p>The comedy routines, worked out by Reiner and Brooks at parties before being immortalized on records, in books, and in an animated TV special, involved Reiner as an interviewer and Brooks as a guy old enough to have known everyone important throughout history&#8212;and to have been less than impressed by all of them. Brooks delivered all the punch lines, but Reiner was a master straight man, coming up with tricky questions that would prompt Brooks to think of more outrageous answers. âMy premise is that you force a genius comedy brain into a corner and theyâll get out, but make it tighter and tougher to get out and theyâre funnier and funnier,â Reiner <a href=\"https://www.momentmag.com/funnyman-carl-reiner/\">explained</a>. âTo save their life, theyâll come up with something funny.â</p>\n<p>Reiner continued to be in demand as an actor well into his 80s and 90s. Most famously, he played con man Saul Bloom, whose age and frailty turn out to be assets, in <strong>Steven Soderberghâs</strong> <em>Oceanâs Eleven</em> (2001) and its two sequels. He was a frequent TV guest star on shows from <em>Mad About You</em> (where he reprised his Alan Brady character and won his ninth Emmy) and <em>Hot in Cleveland</em> (as a suitor to his contemporary Betty White) to <em>Parks and Recreation</em> and <em>Two and a Half Men</em> (in a recurring role as a suitor to <strong>Holland Taylor</strong>).</p>\n<p>His writing career also flourished in the new millennium; of the 15 (TK) novels and memoirs he published, he wrote all but 6 of them after he turned 80. In 2012, the year he turned 90, he published a memoir, <em>I Remember Me,</em> whose e-book version took advantage of the new electronic formatâs multi-media capabilities to include old photos, documents, and video clips of Reiner-family home movies. That same year, he joined Twitter.</p>\n<p>In his 90s, Reiner kept up a daily routine that included writing and tweeting each day, then having fellow widower Brooks over to his Beverly Hills home to eat dinner and watch movies. (Reiner lost wife, Estelle, in 2008, after 65 years of marriage; Brooksâs wife of 41 years, actress Anne Bancroft, died in 2005.) âWriting makes it possible for me to stay interested,â he said at 84. âAnd if you stay interested, you stay alive.â In 2017, he starred in the HBO documentary <em>If Youâre Not in the Obit, Eat Breakfast,</em> titled after one of his own quips. âI rarely go out these days,â he told <em>Vanity Fair</em> <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/06/carl-reiner-if-youre-not-in-the-obit-hbo-documentary-mel-brooks\">upon its release</a>. âOnly for very special occasions. Mostly I hang around the house.â Then he laughed. âBut Iâm still having so much fun!â</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories From <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The 10 <a

ready for <em>Love in the Time of Corona,</em> an upcoming Freeform miniseries joining the glut of coronavirus-inspired movies and shows already flooding an industry that is still trying to sort out <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2020/06/movies-tv-remain-stalled-coronavirus\">how to work</a> through a pandemic. Freeform announced the new series Monday, revealing that the four-episode romantic drama will star and be executive produced by Tony winner <strong>Leslie Odom Jr.</strong> and <em>The Affair</em> star <strong>Nicolette Robinson.</strong> As the title suggests, the series will feature the interwoven stories of people searching for love in the midst of the global pandemic. Production, which will include remote work conducted in talentsâ homes, per <a href=\"https://tvline.com/2020/06/29/love-in-the-time-of-corona-leslie-odom-jr-cast-freeform-quarantine-series/\">TVLine</a>, begins Monday.</p>\n<p><em>Love in the Time of Corona</em> isnât the only coronavirus-themed project to grab headlines in the last few days. It was also recently announced that <strong>Charles Randolph,</strong> the Oscar-winning screenwriter of <em>Bombshell</em> and <em>The Big Short,</em> <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2020/06/wuhan-movie-bombshell-charles-randolph-writing-directing-sk-global-1202971737/\">is penning</a> a screenplay for SK Global that will revolve around the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak. The film, currently being referred to as the Untitled Wuhan Project, will be filmed in China and will star Chinese talent. Randolph is set to direct.</p>\n<p>âThe deeper we dig, the richer the story of Wuhan becomes,â Randolph said in a statement, per Deadline. âItâs one thing to fight a monster. Itâs another thing to fight a monster in the dark.â</p>\n<p>In a similar political vein, <em>The Trip</em> filmmaker <strong>Michael Winterbottom</strong> is set to cowrite and direct a <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/michael-winterbottom-sets-tv-show-boris-johnson-coronavirus-crisis-1300558\">coronavirus-themed series</a> about British prime minister <strong>Boris Johnson</strong>âs response to the outbreak. Johnson, who caught the virus in April and spent three nights in intensive care, has been heavily criticized for the hypocritical way he <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/25/opinions/cummings-covid-19-social-distancing-johnson-response-prince/index.html\">handled the virus</a>, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/may/29/excess-deaths-uk-has-one-highest-levels-europe\">lead to thousands</a> of deaths across the U.K.</p>\n<p>Itâs unclear when production will begin on the project since the world of traditional film and TV production is still being sorted out. However, that isnât stopping <strong>Michael Bay,</strong> who <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2020/05/michael-bay-adam-goodman-songbird-pandemic-themed-thriller-start-in-five-weeks-1202937906/\">is producing</a> the pandemic thriller <em>Songbird</em>&#8212;which will begin production in Los Angeles, according to Deadline. How, exactly, is this going to happen in spite of the California lockdown and the lack of firm safety protocols? Thatâs still a bit murky, but the outlet reports that all the pertinent guilds have apparently given the filmâs team a thumbs-up for production, potentially making <em>Songbird</em> the first film to shoot in Los Angeles in the midst of the pandemic. <strong>Adam Mason</strong> will direct the project, a dystopian look at the world set two years in the future as the outbreak continues on, with the virus mutating and become more dangerous. (Knock on all the wood you can after reading that sentence, thanks!)</p>\n<p>Also pushing ahead to production? <strong>Jenji Kohan</strong>âs <em>Social Distance,</em> a Netflix series that was <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2020/04/social-distance-jenji-kohan-netflix-show-coronavirus\">announced in April</a> and will be shot entirely remotely. Perhaps the title gave it away, but the series will be a quarantine-themed anthology created, produced, and directed by several <em>Orange Is the New Black</em> alums. Considering how quickly it was announced, <em>Social Distance</em> might be the first major project to tackle the pandemic <em>amid</em> the pandemic, but now itâs got a few competitors jockeying for that top spot.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories From <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The 10 <a

this point, even <strong>Donald Trump</strong> knows heâs losing. Those around him have <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/06/27/trump-losing-2020-election-342326\">reportedly</a> come to realize that his disastrous polling could make him a one-term president. Much of that polling shift has occurred in the last three weeks, reflecting a âperformance evaluation,â as UCLA political scientist <strong>Lynn Vavreck</strong> put it to me, on Trumpâs handling of COVID-19, the Black Lives Matter movement, and the shaky economy. And according to a new analysis of polling data and interviews with voters in key states, much of it has come at the hands of independent voters. The movement is significant&#8212;enough to make the <em><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/06/26/trump-looks-down-out-2024-gop-field-is-forming/?arc404=true\">Washington Post</a></em> opinion section gush that Trump looks âdown and outâ and Democrats are âheavy favorites.â Yet the very nature of independent voters, many of whom pay little attention until the eve of the election, makes it unwise to put much stock in the idea that 2020 is Bidenâs to lose.</p>\n<p>In 2016, Trump was elected in part because enough independent voters were willing to take a flier on a candidate who promised to undermine a political order that had not served them well. Trumpâs advantage among independents, while only four points, was enough to carry him to victory. Independents comprise the largest segment of the voting-age population: 40% according to a June <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/15370/party-affiliation.aspx\">Gallup</a> poll. Some self-identified independents are closet partisans, but many are true swing voters, or low-information voters without much ideological loyalty. It is these less-loyal voters who have moved away from Trump in large numbers. In the latest Morning Consult tracking poll, independents favored Biden by 8.5 points.</p>\n<p>The reasons for this are not particularly mysterious. Over the last three months, Trumpâs favorability ratings among independents have tanked across key measures such as the handling of the coronavirus pandemic, his response to the protests over George Floydâs death at the hands of police, and even his management of the economy. More than his Twitter outrages or race baiting, itâs his lack of effectiveness thatâs turning off some independents. <strong>Rick Mirabito,</strong> a county commissioner in Lycoming County in central Pennsylvania, told me that the âeuphoria of people who thought he would get things done has passed.â <strong>Todd Franko,</strong> a former top editor at the now shuttered <em>Youngstown Vindicator,</em> reported similar reactions not to the fantasy of Trump but to the reality of him: âpeople havenât given up on the idea of experimenting, but this one didnât work.â For the better part of three years, independents have stuck with Trump, willing to take âcommerce over conscious,â as Franko put it to me. That deal has made a certain amount of sense to many independents, who tend to be more transactional and less ideological when it comes to politics, but it has looked increasingly less fruitful in recent months. Given the shaky nature of the Trump coalition, if he canât reclaim ground with independents, itâs hard to see a path to victory for him.</p>\n<p>Yet it is far too early to call it for Biden. Thereâs the normal caution: four months to go in an extraordinarily volatile year. But more importantly, independents are a difficult breed to predict. Many are independents because they care little about politics and may not decide their vote until November. As <strong>David Brady,</strong> a political scientist at Stanford, noted to me, it is an ironic aspect of American politics that our elections are often decided by the voters with the least interest in the candidates and the least knowledge of the issues. Given the ubiquity of Trumpâs coverage and the familiarity of a challenger first elected to the Senate almost a half century ago, it would seem that it would be difficult to find a voter without a settled view. And yet a full 30% of independents reported to Morning Consult that they were undecided. Late deciders broke heavily for Trump in 2016, including those in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Florida who decided in the week before the election. The existence of a mass of undecideds this time around is likely to confound any bold prediction of an early Biden knockout.</p>\n<p>The state of the economy is another wild card among independents. Typically, a bad economy in the first half of the year would be a devastating blow for the incumbent. In this unusual year, however, Trump still retains an edge (if a declining one) with independents on the economy&#8212;a critical advantage for a group that often views politics in transactional terms. To the extent that the economy rebounds in the fall, Trump may be able to convince independents heâs a safer bet to keep things moving. <strong>Roger Ford,</strong> a local business leader and political observer in Pikeville, Kentucky, told me that swing voters in the eastern part of the state are sticking with Trump so far because of their faith in his stewardship of the economy and because they see the election through a ânationalist versus globalistâ economic lens. For those voters, Trumpâs recent invocation of the coronavirus as the â<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2020/06/24/trump-once-again-calls-covid-19-coronavirus-the-kung-flu/#18c91a81f59a\">kung flu</a>â is a reminder of the dangers of globalization and that he, not Biden, is the bulwark against China and other outside threats.</p>\n<p>To some observers, the race is perceived as an up-or-down referendum on Trump, which is convenient for Biden. Despite his reputation as a likable centrist, he doesnât test particularly well with independents. In the Morning Consult tracking survey, Biden rated at minus 15 (35% approval, 50% disapproval), and even in polls where he has scored better, his support is soft. In the most recent <em>New York Times</em>/Siena College Poll, two thirds of the independents who were favorable to Biden were only âsomewhat favorable.â Like others, <strong>Dave Betras,</strong> a Democratic Party leader in Youngstown, Ohio, has started to see tentative signs of changing attitudes among the Trump&#8211;Obama voters who defined the last election. But Biden will need to give them a reason to vote for him. âNo sane human being would commit to a stranger,â he told me.</p>\n<p>So far, Biden has been happy to sit back and watch Trump beat himself. But it seems unlikely that this strategy will endear him to independents for another four months. As Biden emerges from his basement, and as voters begin to pay attention to a wave of vicious attacks from the right, the question of whether his soft support among independents can hold will be a crucial one.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories From <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The Parallel Universe of Ivanka Trump, Americaâs <a

this stage of the coronavirus pandemic, the concept of âflattening the curveâ is familiar, especially to anyone whoâs watched <strong>Andrew Cuomo</strong>âs press briefings. At the once-daily eventsâ &#8212;since June 19, theyâre being conducted on what he described as an as-needed basisâ &#8212;he frequently emphasized the importance of slowing the spread of the virus by putting depictions of the strategy in the PowerPoint displays that accompanied his appearances.

<strong>Meghanâs</strong> Archewell apparently wonât be getting a high profile launch this summer.</p>\n<p>While the Covid pandemic is partly to blame, the couple have told their team they want to take their time getting the organization ârightâ and wonât be doing a high profile launch.</p>\n<p>The organization will be the backbone of the coupleâs philanthropic work, and the work the Sussexes are currently involved with reflects the work Archewell will do in the future.</p>\n<p>âThey are in no hurry to launch Archewell , they want to get it  right, thatâs really important to them,â said a source. âThis is something that they want to do for the rest of their lives so theyâre not going to be pressured into launching something thatâs still in the relatively early stages of development.â</p>\n<p>The couple are currently focused on the Black Lives Matter movement, and last week visited Homeboy Industries to learn about their gang intervention and rehabilitation programs. This weekend <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2020/06/meghan-and-harry-civil-rights-work-calls\">it emerged</a> that the couple have also been involved with the Stop Hate for Profit campaign to pressure Facebook to block hate speech on its platform.</p>\n<p>âEverythingÂ they&#39;re doing at the moment is part of Archewell,â a source said. âWhetherÂ Covid, BLM or their ongoing charity work, it&#39;s all part of how they&#39;re working on Archewell and developingÂ their work and focus going forward. Their team have been working on hate speech issues, and tech-for-good behind the scenes since the beginning of the year. It was the focus of their visit to Stanford in February.â</p>\n<p>The Sussexes were prematurely forced to announce details about Archewell, named in honor of their son <strong>Archie</strong>, after trademark documents were leaked to the <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/royal-family/2020/04/06/revealed-prince-harry-meghan-plan-non-profit-empire-name-archewell/\">Daily Telegraph</a> in April.</p>\n<p>As Meghan and Harry cautiously think through their next plans, the new royal book <em>Royals At War</em> revisiting claims that Meghan drove palace staff âto distractionâ by rushing into supporting projects without properly thinking things through, and âwithout proper research.â</p>\n<p>Sources close to the Sussexes say the book is based on rumour rather than fact, but it is no secret that Meghan clashed with some palace officials.  Soon after marrying into the royal family reports emerged about the duchessâs habit of sending 5 a.m. emails, which allegedly earned her the nickname âHurricane Meghan.â Palace staff complained that they were unable to keep up with the new royalâs pace.</p>\n<p>According to one senior palace source, while Meghanâs drive was commended by some, she was urged to slow down by experienced courtiers concerned that she was taking on too much.</p>\n<p>Even <strong>Michelle Obama</strong> urged Meghan to take her time, and when asked what advice she had for the new Duchess in an interview the former First Lady and friend of Prince Harry said, âOne of my biggest pieces of advice would be to take some time and donât be in a hurry to do anything.â</p>\n<p>Meghan continued to work hard, however, and after taking on a handful of patronages she worked around the clock even during her pregnancy. She even worked through most of her maternity leave, editing the September issue of British <em>Vogue</em> and working on a clothing line for the charity Smart Works.</p>\n<p>âYou can say what you want about Meghan, but she works incredibly hard,â said a source who has worked with the Sussexes.  âThe problem is she and Harry have a tendency to hatch big projects over dinner and expect them to be actioned within days. Meghan had brilliant ideas, but she was always in a hurry and aides had to sit down and explain that foundations and big projects take thought, time and commitment, they cannot be rushed.â</p>\n<p>Now it seems the couple are heeding that advice and taking their time. Under the guidance of a new PR team they are hatching a long term plan to become global philanthropists and high-profile public speakers.  It was <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2020/06/prince-harry-meghan-markle-speaking-deal\">announced last week</a> that they have signed up with the Harry Walker agency which could see them earn fees of up to one million dollars for public speaking engagements. However, sources say that Archewell remains their principal focus and their next steps will be slow and deliberate ones.</p>\n<p>âThey have learned from the mistakes of the past and taking their time with Archewell,â said a well-placed source. âThey want to get the next stage right.â</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories From <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; Author Uzodinma Iweala on <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2020/06/white-signs-at-black-protests?itm_content=footer-recirc\">White Signs</a> at Black Protests<br>\n&#8212; âGeorge Floyd Was Killed in <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2020/06/growing-up-in-george-floyds-minneapolis-neighborhood?itm_content=footer-recirc\">My Neighborhood</a>â<br>\n&#8212; 15 Years After Katrina, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2020/06/hard-times-in-the-big-easy?itm_content=footer-recirc\">a Second Storm</a>&#8212;Coronavirus&#8212;Hits New Orleans<br>\n&#8212; How <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2020/06/meghan-markle-george-floyd-black-lives-matter-speech?itm_content=footer-recirc\">Meghan Markle</a> Decided to Finally Speak Out About George Floyd<br>\n&#8212; Nikkita Oliver on Seattleâs Extraordinary Protests and <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2020/06/nikkita-oliver-on-seattles-extraordinary-protests?itm_content=footer-recirc\">What Comes Next</a><br>\n&#8212; Where J.K.

White House has apparently known of possible Russian bounties on Americans in Afghanistan since early 2019, pushing the timeline back a full year earlier than when the administration was initially thought to have learned of the intelligence. The shocking findings that a Russian military intelligence agency offered rewards to Taliban-linked militants for attacks on U.S. and coalition forces is something that President <strong>Donald Trump</strong> was previously reported to have known and done nothing about since late March, despite <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/06/russian-bounty-report-seems-like-kind-of-thing-trump-shouldve-known-gop-says\">claiming</a> on Sunday that no one told him about such information.</p>\n<p>But the Associated Press <a href=\"https://apnews.com/425e43fa0ffdd6e126c5171653ec47d1\">reported</a> on Tuesday that Trump was briefed at least twice on the matter in 2019, in his written daily intelligence briefings as well as by then-national security adviser <strong>John Bolton</strong>, who reportedly told colleagues in March 2019 that he had briefed the president on the intelligence assessment. Bolton declined to comment on this when asked by the outlet on Monday, but did suggest that Trump has a tendency to feign ignorance when trying to skirt accountability. âHe can disown everything if nobody told him about it,â Bolton said on Sundayâs <em>Meet the Press</em>.</p>\n<p>The AP previously reported that Trump was again made aware of the Russian bounty allegations at least two more times this year, in another written presidential daily briefing as well as in a discussion with national security adviser <strong>Robert OâBrien</strong>. OâBrien has denied discussing the intelligence with Trump and on Monday said the assessments âhave not been verified,â an argument put forth by the White House to explain why the president was not, and has yet to be, briefed on the matter. But it is ârare for intelligence to be confirmed without a shadow of a doubt before it is presented to top officials,â notes the APâs <strong>James LaPorta</strong>. âThe administrationâs earlier awareness of the Russian efforts raises additional questions about why Trump did not take any punitive action against Moscow for efforts that put the lives of Americans service members at risk.â (Russia <a href=\"https://www.msnbc.com/andrea-mitchell-reports/watch/kremlin-dmitry-peskov-denies-russia-offered-taliban-bounties-to-kill-u-s-troops-86348869799\">has denied</a> the bounty allegations).</p>\n<p>The president has yet to authorize a response despite reports of potential options developed by career government officials, raising questions of government inaction and Trumpâs kid gloves approach to Russia&#8212;and leaving Republicans scrambling to figure out how to address. Lawmakers have called on the administration to present more information and, the <em>Washington Post</em> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/republicans-once-again-face-questions-over-why-trump-isnt-tougher-on-russia/2020/06/29/c21f0c76-ba18-11ea-bdaf-a129f921026f_story.html\">reported</a>, for Russia to be punished if the intelligence is found to be true. Senators <strong>Cory Gardner</strong> and <strong>Thom Tillis</strong> made similar calls for Russia to be treated by the U.S. government as a state sponsor of terrorism. Senator <strong>Ben Sasse</strong> called on Congress to find out âWho knew what, when, and did the commander in chief know? And if not, how the hell not?â Sasse noted that if the intelligence information is deemed accurate, â[imposing] the proportional cost in responseâ would, in these circumstances, âmean Taliban and GRU body bags.â</p>\n<p>The <em>Post</em> notes that Republicans âtook a notably tougher public toneâ than Trump did but still largely skirted the question of whether Trump should have known about the report. âWhile the Trump administration has taken some aggressive measures against Russia, the presidentâs conciliatory tone toward Russian President <strong>Vladmir Putin</strong> continues to be a thorny political problem for Republicans who have advocated a more hawkish approach toward the authoritarian leader,â writes the <em>Post</em>âs <strong>Seung Min Kim</strong>.</p>\n<p>Those familiar with Trumpâs phone calls with world leaders like Putin and Turkish President <strong>Recep Erdogan</strong> were so concerned by what they heard that they concluded Trump âposed a danger to the national security of the United States,â CNN <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/29/politics/trump-phone-calls-national-security-concerns/index.html\">reported</a>. According to two sources, White House chief of staff <strong>John Kelly</strong> and Defense Secretary <strong>James Mattis</strong> are among the former top Trump deputies who came to see the president as âdelusionalâ in his interactions with foreign leaders.</p>\n<p>âThe sources said there was little evidence that the President became more skillful or competent in his telephone conversations with most heads of state over time,â CNNâs <strong>Carl Bernstein</strong> writes of the alarming calls that are of particular concern in light of the bounty reports. âRather, he continued to believe that he could either charm, jawbone or bully almost any foreign leader into capitulating to his will, and often pursued goals more attuned to his own agenda than what many of his senior advisers considered the national interest.â</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories From <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The Parallel Universe of Ivanka Trump, Americaâs <a

was 1950. Carl Reiner was on the set of Sid Caesarâs variety series <em>Your Show of Shows</em> when he overheard another comic doing a bit about a Jewish pirate.</p>\n<p>âHe said, âI canât afford to pillage and rape anymore! $3.50 for a sailcloth, who can afford that?!ââ Reiner recalled in a 2012 interview <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/JerrySeinfeld/videos/281221871989165/\">with <strong>Jerry Seinfeld.</strong></a> The comedian was, of course, <strong>Mel Brooks,</strong> with whom Reiner would end up working on an improvisational bit called <em>The 2000 Year Old Man.</em> Brooks played the titular ancient character; Reiner played the straight man, peppering his partner with funny questions. The bit, which they spun into a regular sketch and several successful albums, drew fans like Cary Grant and <strong>Queen Elizabeth II.</strong> âI said to Mel, âThe biggest shiksa in the world loved our record. Weâre in!ââ Reiner told <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Upgd4icKDOU\">PBS in 2016.</a></p>\n<p>The albums would become the bedrock of Brooks and Reinerâs friendship, which would span the <a href=\"https://archive.vanityfair.com/article/2013/1/mel-brooks-and-carl-reiner\">next 70 years</a>&#8212;until <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2020/06/carl-reiner-dies\">Reinerâs death Monday night.</a></p>\n<p>âI donât think Iâve ever had a better friend than Carl,â Brooks told <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/feb/20/love-and-free-food-mel-brooks-and-carl-reiner-share-the-secrets-of-their-70-year-friendship\">The Guardian</a></em> in a joint February interview with Reiner.</p>\n<p>âMy God, the thought of being without him&#8212;the world would be too bleak!â Reiner exclaimed in response.</p>\n<p>As true fans of the duo know, the comedy legends were inseparable even as they were shaping their influential and ever-evolving careers. Reiner would create <em>The Dick Van Dyke Show</em> and direct films like <em>The Jerk,</em> while Brooks would helm classics like <em>Blazing Saddles</em> and <em>Young Frankenstein.</em> As they grew older, the duo perfected the same nightly routine: Brooks would get in his car and drive to Reinerâs Beverly Hills house, where they would eat dinner, watch <em>Jeopardy,</em> and then tuck into a movie&#8212;sometimes their own movies, or sometimes cheesy action movies filled with lines like âLock all the doors!â or âSecure the perimeters!â</p>\n<p>â[If] we hear those, we know weâre in for a good time,â Reiner once said. âIf he doesnât come over, I donât know what to do with myself.â</p>\n<p>Occasionally, other friends would join, like comedian <strong>Alan Alda</strong> or <em>The Graduate</em> screenwriter Buck Henry&#8212;whom Reiner would coax into watching their old works, like the series <em>Get Smart,</em> which Henry and Brooks cocreated. âWe watched the pilot...[to] see what we could remember,â Brooks <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/JerrySeinfeld/videos/281221871989165/\">recalled.</a></p>\n<p>Over the years, Brooks and Reiner also continued working together, showing off their chemistry on <em>Late Night</em> and revamping <em>2000 Year Old Man</em> into a book&#8212;the recording of which later earned them a best-spoken-album Grammy. âHeâs a great comedian to this day!â Brooks crowed in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo407vvCZG4\">a 2013 interview</a> about his friend.</p>\n<p>They found ways to keep close even as the coronavirus pandemic struck, calling each other to watch <em>Jeopardy</em> and <em>Wheel of Fortune</em> on their respective TVs at the same time. âWe try to guess the answers and, you know, we have fun on the phone,â Reiner said <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/mel-brooks-carl-reiner-coronavirus-social-distancing-154418268.html\">in April.</a></p>\n<p>They also managed to spend time together on Brooksâs recent 94th birthday on June 28, per Reinerâs manager <strong>George Shapiro,</strong> who posted photos of the celebration on Twitter. In one photo, Brooks and Reiner lay alongside Reinerâs daughter, <strong>Annie,</strong> and sport matching Black Lives Matter shirts.</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote

Emmy nominations approach, Vanity Fairâs HWD team is once again diving deep into some of the shows that struck us most, and asking actors and creators how the seasonâs greatest scenes and characters came together. You can read more of these close looks <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/for-your-consideration-tv\">here</a>.</em></p>\n<h4><strong>The Character: Catherine the Great, <em>The Great</em></strong></h4>\n<p>In <em>The Great</em>âs first episode, a pink-cheeked Catherine (<strong>Elle Fanning</strong>) pilots a flower-entwined swing and burbles to a friend about how romantic her wedding to Russian Emperor Peter III (<strong>Nicholas Hoult</strong>) will be. But after Catherine is delivered from her sleepy German village to the Russian palace, her girlish dreams are dashed when she meets the tyrannical and narcissistic Peter. As she solemnly presents him with an evergreen as a symbol of their love, he turns to one of his minions and barks, âShe gave me a twig. Sheâs not another inbred, is she?â</p>\n<p>Itâs the abrupt end of her innocent imaginings, as well as the start of a young womanâs campaign, aided by her wit and charm, to plot a putsch&#8212;after Catherine learns that if Peter just happens to be killed, she can claim the throne.</p>\n<p>âItâs been phenomenal to watch Elle grow into this character as a performer, to balance a tightrope in bringing her to life as this woman who is naive but strong, and also powerless at times,â says Hoult. â[Sheâs] understanding this new world sheâs been thrown into, and also her raison dâÃªtre.â</p>\n<p>Fanning brings great depth and dimension to her characterâs evolution, holding fast to Catherineâs humanity and vulnerability even as she grows ruthlessly cunning&#8212;particularly in the seasonâs final episode, when she learns just what her power grab will cost her. Below, Fanning explains what drew her to Catherine, the toughest part of filming <em>The Great</em>âs intimate scenes, and the surprising request she made as an executive producer of the show.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Vanity Fair:</em> As Catherine immerses herself in court intrigue and consolidates power, she wavers between confidence and naivete. Was that a hard balance to strike?</strong></p>\n<p><em>Elle Fanning:</em> [The role] challenged me in a way that I havenât been challenged before. As a character, Catherine has one of my favorite qualities, which is that sheâs extremely arrogant. She has a huge ego and doesnât apologize for it, which was so fun to play. But she also questions herself, and has these weaknesses&#8212;these moments of really not knowing if sheâs up for the challenge too&#8212;which was important to me. Iâm not interested in playing âSheâs strong all the time. Sheâs the bravest and she always makes the right decisions!â I donât want to watch that.</p>\n<p>I also love that sheâs very romantic, but she learns that her love affair over the whole season is really her love for Russia. Which was interesting. Her most important quality, too, is her youth. Youth is such a big factor in the decisions she makes&#8212;and sometimes theyâre a bit rash, but sheâs young and sheâs learning. And sheâs a different woman at the end of it.</p>\n<p><strong>You have known your costar Nicholas Hoult since you were 14 and costarred in the film <em>Young Ones.</em> Did that familiarity make things easier during the sex scenes?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes. I felt so unembarrassed with him. He was very familiar with the rhythm of the words, because he was in <em>The Favourite,</em> so he helped keep my rhythm up and the comedic timing. Heâs so incredible, in part because he adds so many layers to his character that could have been one-note. And we were just always on the same page. We wanted to create this dynamic relationship where they do love each other at times and she kind of pities him and sometimes she doesnât want him to die.</p>\n<p>The sex scenes were hard to get through because youâre in this position, which is already awkward or funny, and then you would have to say these hilarious lines. Thereâs one sex scene where Peterâs thrusting for an heir, like a hundred thrusts, and thereâs a wide shot where weâre just in the background. We didnât have to say anything, all he has to do is thrust. Iâm just like, âLetâs get through it.â Thank god weâre not both earnest or take ourselves too seriously, because youâve got to have fun.</p>\n<p><strong>You had an intimacy coordinator on the set. Was that the first time youâve ever worked with someone like that?</strong></p>\n<p>The first time.  Sheâs there for support and so that you feel comfortable, but she also makes sure that things look real, which is interesting. Like sheâll say, âNick, youâre in the wrong position, you need to be lower.â And she provides great pillows, like crotch pillows and things that she sews herself, so you have a kind of separation.</p>\n<p>I really enjoyed those scenes. [Writer] <strong>Tony McNamara</strong> and I would talk about how the show actually is not really sexually explicit at all, because  all the girls&#8212;except for when I was with [court-appointed lover] Leo (<strong>Sebastian de Souza</strong>)&#8212;are basically fully clothed. Because we canât take the corsets off! [<em>laughs</em>] In court, Iâm sure they would just think it was much easier and more practical just to pull your skirts up.</p>\n<p>In my scenes with Nick, Iâm always fully clothed, because itâs just about getting an heir and thatâs it. The only nudity we have on the show is bottoms! We all kind of get a turn. I have a bottom, Nick has a bottom, and Sebastian has a bottom. We all had our moment.</p>\n<p><strong>Speaking of outrageous scenes, you executive produce the show. Did you ever veto anything as too over the top?</strong></p>\n<p>Oh, I wanted it more [over the top]. [<em>laughs</em>]</p>\n<p><strong>More severed heads! Roll them in!</strong></p>\n<p>Thatâs me! People are so surprised by that sometimes. I mean, if you know me, youâre not surprised by it, but you might be if youâre only aware of my Sleeping Beauty persona. I always wanted to push it. I wanted things to be even weirder. I wanted more blood.</p>\n<p><em>This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.</em></p>\n<h5>Where to Watch <em>The Great</em>:</h5>\n<hr/>\n<p><em>All products featured on</em> Vanity Fair <em>are independently selected by our editors.

Carl Reiner had written a deathbed memoir, it would have been titled <em>Exit Laughing.</em> After all, the legendary comedy writer, performer, and director had already published <em>Enter Laughing</em> and <em>Continue Laughing.</em> Having conquered TV, movies, Broadway, and traditional publishing over his seven-decade-plus career, Reiner spent his last years mastering e-books and Twitter, writing and tweeting until Monday night, when he died at age 98 in his Beverly Hills home, TMZ <a href=\"https://www.tmz.com/2020/06/30/carl-reiner-dead-dies-98-dick-van-dyke-show/\">reports</a>. Reiner died of natural causes, <em>Variety</em> <a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/biz/news/carl-reiner-dead-died-dick-van-dyke-1234694208/\">writes</a>. He was prolific til the end, even sitting for an interview in an episode of the YouTube series âDispatches from Quarantineâ that premiered on June 22.</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row iframe\"><div class=\"wrapper\"><div class=\"embed iframe-embed-component \" data-type=\"iframe\" data-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mhju_o9FStY\"><iframe height=\"360\" width=\"640\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mhju_o9FStY\"></iframe></div></div></div><p>Born in the Bronx, Reiner began his New York stage career as a serious Shakespearean thespian, but he found that comedy was what paid the bills. He worked as a Borscht Belt joker at the Allaben Acres resort in New Yorkâs Adirondack Mountains, where he met his future wife, singer Estelle Lebost, and he learned the skills that served him as a comedy writer under actor Maurice Evans in the U.S. Armyâs entertainment unit in Hawaii during World War II.</p>\n<p>After the war, Reiner landed two jobs with one audition: summer entertainment director at the Lake Spofford Hotel in New Hampshire, and replacement for star Jules Munshin in the touring production of the revue <em>Call Me Mister.</em> Roles such as the latter, as well as in Broadway musicals <em>Inside U.S.A.</em> and <em>Alive and Kicking,</em> led to his casting in the sketch company of Sid Caesarâs landmark live-TV comedy series <em>Your Show of Shows.</em> Throughout the 1950s, Reiner would work as a performer and writer on Caesarâs various shows, working with a legendary team of scribes that included <strong>Neil Simon, Mel Brooks,</strong> Larry Gelbart, and <strong>Woody Allen.</strong> He also wrote his first book, 1958âs <em>Enter Laughing,</em> an autobiographical novel about his early days as an actor.</p>\n<p>Reiner drew from his own life to create his first sitcom, <em>Head of the Family,</em> about a young, recently married TV-sketch-comedy writer, in which Reiner also starred. The show was a flop until Reiner retooled it with a new leading actor and actress and took a supporting role as the sketch showâs egotistical host, Alan Brady. The result was <em>The Dick Van Dyke Show</em> (which was on-air from 1960 to 1966), an innovative series that made <strong>Dick Van Dyke</strong> and Mary Tyler Moore into stars and earned Reiner several Emmys for the showâs mix of sexy, sophisticated comedy and silly slapstick.</p>\n<p>As <em>Dick Van Dyke</em> wound down, Reiner moved on to Hollywood, with a prominent acting role in the 1966 comedy <em>The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming.</em> He made his directing debut in 1967 with the screen version of <em>Enter Laughing.</em> Over the next 30 years, heâd direct such comedies as black-comedy cult hit <em>Whereâs Poppa?</em> (1970), <em>Oh, God!</em> (1977), <strong>Steve Martin</strong> and <strong>Lily Tomlinâs</strong> 1984 <em>All of Me</em> (perhaps the best film Reiner or Martin ever made), the underrated 1987 <em>Summer School,</em> and the 1993 spoof of modern-day noirs <em>Fatal Instinct.</em></p>\n<p>Reiner, who in a 2013 interview described his job as âtalent scout,â was instrumental in launching or jump-starting the careers of numerous funny people. He made TV stars out of Van Dyke and Moore and a film star out of Martin, whom he directed in four movies, including Martinâs first lead role in 1979âs <em>The Jerk.</em> Reiner introduced a new generation of fans to George Burns (then 81), revitalizing the veteran comicâs film career by directing him in <em>Oh, God!</em> He launched British musical-theater star <strong>Robert Lindsayâs</strong> movie career with 1989âs <em>Bert Rigby, Youâre a Fool,</em> which Reiner wrote for Lindsay. Reiner and his wife, Estelle, brought <em>All in the Family</em> star turned film director <strong>Rob Reiner</strong> into the world (and two other children, author <strong>Annie</strong> and artist <strong>Lucas</strong>). And, of course, he helped make his fellow Sid Caesar sketch writer <strong>Mel Brooks</strong> famous via the pairâs â2000 Year Old Manâ routines.</p>\n<p>The comedy routines, worked out by Reiner and Brooks at parties before being immortalized on records, in books, and in an animated TV special, involved Reiner as an interviewer and Brooks as a guy old enough to have known everyone important throughout history&#8212;and to have been less than impressed by all of them. Brooks delivered all the punch lines, but Reiner was a master straight man, coming up with tricky questions that would prompt Brooks to think of more outrageous answers. âMy premise is that you force a genius comedy brain into a corner and theyâll get out, but make it tighter and tougher to get out and theyâre funnier and funnier,â Reiner <a href=\"https://www.momentmag.com/funnyman-carl-reiner/\">explained</a>. âTo save their life, theyâll come up with something funny.â</p>\n<p>Reiner continued to be in demand as an actor well into his 80s and 90s. Most famously, he played con man Saul Bloom, whose age and frailty turn out to be assets, in <strong>Steven Soderberghâs</strong> <em>Oceanâs Eleven</em> (2001) and its two sequels. He was a frequent TV guest star on shows from <em>Mad About You</em> (where he reprised his Alan Brady character and won his ninth Emmy) and <em>Hot in Cleveland</em> (as a suitor to his contemporary Betty White) to <em>Parks and Recreation</em> and <em>Two and a Half Men</em> (in a recurring role as a suitor to <strong>Holland Taylor</strong>).</p>\n<p>His writing career also flourished in the new millennium; of the 15 (TK) novels and memoirs he published, he wrote all but 6 of them after he turned 80. In 2012, the year he turned 90, he published a memoir, <em>I Remember Me,</em> whose e-book version took advantage of the new electronic formatâs multi-media capabilities to include old photos, documents, and video clips of Reiner-family home movies. That same year, he joined Twitter.</p>\n<p>In his 90s, Reiner kept up a daily routine that included writing and tweeting each day, then having fellow widower Brooks over to his Beverly Hills home to eat dinner and watch movies. (Reiner lost wife, Estelle, in 2008, after 65 years of marriage; Brooksâs wife of 41 years, actress Anne Bancroft, died in 2005.) âWriting makes it possible for me to stay interested,â he said at 84. âAnd if you stay interested, you stay alive.â In 2017, he starred in the HBO documentary <em>If Youâre Not in the Obit, Eat Breakfast,</em> titled after one of his own quips. âI rarely go out these days,â he told <em>Vanity Fair</em> <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/06/carl-reiner-if-youre-not-in-the-obit-hbo-documentary-mel-brooks\">upon its release</a>. âOnly for very special occasions. Mostly I hang around the house.â Then he laughed. âBut Iâm still having so much fun!â</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories From <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The 10 <a

ready for <em>Love in the Time of Corona,</em> an upcoming Freeform miniseries joining the glut of coronavirus-inspired movies and shows already flooding an industry that is still trying to sort out <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2020/06/movies-tv-remain-stalled-coronavirus\">how to work</a> through a pandemic. Freeform announced the new series Monday, revealing that the four-episode romantic drama will star and be executive produced by Tony winner <strong>Leslie Odom Jr.</strong> and <em>The Affair</em> star <strong>Nicolette Robinson.</strong> As the title suggests, the series will feature the interwoven stories of people searching for love in the midst of the global pandemic. Production, which will include remote work conducted in talentsâ homes, per <a href=\"https://tvline.com/2020/06/29/love-in-the-time-of-corona-leslie-odom-jr-cast-freeform-quarantine-series/\">TVLine</a>, begins Monday.</p>\n<p><em>Love in the Time of Corona</em> isnât the only coronavirus-themed project to grab headlines in the last few days. It was also recently announced that <strong>Charles Randolph,</strong> the Oscar-winning screenwriter of <em>Bombshell</em> and <em>The Big Short,</em> <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2020/06/wuhan-movie-bombshell-charles-randolph-writing-directing-sk-global-1202971737/\">is penning</a> a screenplay for SK Global that will revolve around the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak. The film, currently being referred to as the Untitled Wuhan Project, will be filmed in China and will star Chinese talent. Randolph is set to direct.</p>\n<p>âThe deeper we dig, the richer the story of Wuhan becomes,â Randolph said in a statement, per Deadline. âItâs one thing to fight a monster. Itâs another thing to fight a monster in the dark.â</p>\n<p>In a similar political vein, <em>The Trip</em> filmmaker <strong>Michael Winterbottom</strong> is set to cowrite and direct a <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/michael-winterbottom-sets-tv-show-boris-johnson-coronavirus-crisis-1300558\">coronavirus-themed series</a> about British prime minister <strong>Boris Johnson</strong>âs response to the outbreak. Johnson, who caught the virus in April and spent three nights in intensive care, has been heavily criticized for the hypocritical way he <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/25/opinions/cummings-covid-19-social-distancing-johnson-response-prince/index.html\">handled the virus</a>, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/may/29/excess-deaths-uk-has-one-highest-levels-europe\">lead to thousands</a> of deaths across the U.K.</p>\n<p>Itâs unclear when production will begin on the project since the world of traditional film and TV production is still being sorted out. However, that isnât stopping <strong>Michael Bay,</strong> who <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2020/05/michael-bay-adam-goodman-songbird-pandemic-themed-thriller-start-in-five-weeks-1202937906/\">is producing</a> the pandemic thriller <em>Songbird</em>&#8212;which will begin production in Los Angeles, according to Deadline. How, exactly, is this going to happen in spite of the California lockdown and the lack of firm safety protocols? Thatâs still a bit murky, but the outlet reports that all the pertinent guilds have apparently given the filmâs team a thumbs-up for production, potentially making <em>Songbird</em> the first film to shoot in Los Angeles in the midst of the pandemic. <strong>Adam Mason</strong> will direct the project, a dystopian look at the world set two years in the future as the outbreak continues on, with the virus mutating and become more dangerous. (Knock on all the wood you can after reading that sentence, thanks!)</p>\n<p>Also pushing ahead to production? <strong>Jenji Kohan</strong>âs <em>Social Distance,</em> a Netflix series that was <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2020/04/social-distance-jenji-kohan-netflix-show-coronavirus\">announced in April</a> and will be shot entirely remotely. Perhaps the title gave it away, but the series will be a quarantine-themed anthology created, produced, and directed by several <em>Orange Is the New Black</em> alums. Considering how quickly it was announced, <em>Social Distance</em> might be the first major project to tackle the pandemic <em>amid</em> the pandemic, but now itâs got a few competitors jockeying for that top spot.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories From <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The 10 <a

this point, even <strong>Donald Trump</strong> knows heâs losing. Those around him have <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/06/27/trump-losing-2020-election-342326\">reportedly</a> come to realize that his disastrous polling could make him a one-term president. Much of that polling shift has occurred in the last three weeks, reflecting a âperformance evaluation,â as UCLA political scientist <strong>Lynn Vavreck</strong> put it to me, on Trumpâs handling of COVID-19, the Black Lives Matter movement, and the shaky economy. And according to a new analysis of polling data and interviews with voters in key states, much of it has come at the hands of independent voters. The movement is significant&#8212;enough to make the <em><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/06/26/trump-looks-down-out-2024-gop-field-is-forming/?arc404=true\">Washington Post</a></em> opinion section gush that Trump looks âdown and outâ and Democrats are âheavy favorites.â Yet the very nature of independent voters, many of whom pay little attention until the eve of the election, makes it unwise to put much stock in the idea that 2020 is Bidenâs to lose.</p>\n<p>In 2016, Trump was elected in part because enough independent voters were willing to take a flier on a candidate who promised to undermine a political order that had not served them well. Trumpâs advantage among independents, while only four points, was enough to carry him to victory. Independents comprise the largest segment of the voting-age population: 40% according to a June <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/15370/party-affiliation.aspx\">Gallup</a> poll. Some self-identified independents are closet partisans, but many are true swing voters, or low-information voters without much ideological loyalty. It is these less-loyal voters who have moved away from Trump in large numbers. In the latest Morning Consult tracking poll, independents favored Biden by 8.5 points.</p>\n<p>The reasons for this are not particularly mysterious. Over the last three months, Trumpâs favorability ratings among independents have tanked across key measures such as the handling of the coronavirus pandemic, his response to the protests over George Floydâs death at the hands of police, and even his management of the economy. More than his Twitter outrages or race baiting, itâs his lack of effectiveness thatâs turning off some independents. <strong>Rick Mirabito,</strong> a county commissioner in Lycoming County in central Pennsylvania, told me that the âeuphoria of people who thought he would get things done has passed.â <strong>Todd Franko,</strong> a former top editor at the now shuttered <em>Youngstown Vindicator,</em> reported similar reactions not to the fantasy of Trump but to the reality of him: âpeople havenât given up on the idea of experimenting, but this one didnât work.â For the better part of three years, independents have stuck with Trump, willing to take âcommerce over conscious,â as Franko put it to me. That deal has made a certain amount of sense to many independents, who tend to be more transactional and less ideological when it comes to politics, but it has looked increasingly less fruitful in recent months. Given the shaky nature of the Trump coalition, if he canât reclaim ground with independents, itâs hard to see a path to victory for him.</p>\n<p>Yet it is far too early to call it for Biden. Thereâs the normal caution: four months to go in an extraordinarily volatile year. But more importantly, independents are a difficult breed to predict. Many are independents because they care little about politics and may not decide their vote until November. As <strong>David Brady,</strong> a political scientist at Stanford, noted to me, it is an ironic aspect of American politics that our elections are often decided by the voters with the least interest in the candidates and the least knowledge of the issues. Given the ubiquity of Trumpâs coverage and the familiarity of a challenger first elected to the Senate almost a half century ago, it would seem that it would be difficult to find a voter without a settled view. And yet a full 30% of independents reported to Morning Consult that they were undecided. Late deciders broke heavily for Trump in 2016, including those in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Florida who decided in the week before the election. The existence of a mass of undecideds this time around is likely to confound any bold prediction of an early Biden knockout.</p>\n<p>The state of the economy is another wild card among independents. Typically, a bad economy in the first half of the year would be a devastating blow for the incumbent. In this unusual year, however, Trump still retains an edge (if a declining one) with independents on the economy&#8212;a critical advantage for a group that often views politics in transactional terms. To the extent that the economy rebounds in the fall, Trump may be able to convince independents heâs a safer bet to keep things moving. <strong>Roger Ford,</strong> a local business leader and political observer in Pikeville, Kentucky, told me that swing voters in the eastern part of the state are sticking with Trump so far because of their faith in his stewardship of the economy and because they see the election through a ânationalist versus globalistâ economic lens. For those voters, Trumpâs recent invocation of the coronavirus as the â<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2020/06/24/trump-once-again-calls-covid-19-coronavirus-the-kung-flu/#18c91a81f59a\">kung flu</a>â is a reminder of the dangers of globalization and that he, not Biden, is the bulwark against China and other outside threats.</p>\n<p>To some observers, the race is perceived as an up-or-down referendum on Trump, which is convenient for Biden. Despite his reputation as a likable centrist, he doesnât test particularly well with independents. In the Morning Consult tracking survey, Biden rated at minus 15 (35% approval, 50% disapproval), and even in polls where he has scored better, his support is soft. In the most recent <em>New York Times</em>/Siena College Poll, two thirds of the independents who were favorable to Biden were only âsomewhat favorable.â Like others, <strong>Dave Betras,</strong> a Democratic Party leader in Youngstown, Ohio, has started to see tentative signs of changing attitudes among the Trump&#8211;Obama voters who defined the last election. But Biden will need to give them a reason to vote for him. âNo sane human being would commit to a stranger,â he told me.</p>\n<p>So far, Biden has been happy to sit back and watch Trump beat himself. But it seems unlikely that this strategy will endear him to independents for another four months. As Biden emerges from his basement, and as voters begin to pay attention to a wave of vicious attacks from the right, the question of whether his soft support among independents can hold will be a crucial one.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories From <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The Parallel Universe of Ivanka Trump, Americaâs <a

this stage of the coronavirus pandemic, the concept of âflattening the curveâ is familiar, especially to anyone whoâs watched <strong>Andrew Cuomo</strong>âs press briefings. At the once-daily eventsâ &#8212;since June 19, theyâre being conducted on what he described as an as-needed basisâ &#8212;he frequently emphasized the importance of slowing the spread of the virus by putting depictions of the strategy in the PowerPoint displays that accompanied his appearances. He did that on Monday too, but added a new representation to the mix:</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/luisferre/status/1277631913772138496\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/luisferre/status/1277631913772138496\">https://twitter.com/luisferre/status/1277631913772138496</a></p></blockquote></div><p>Democrat &amp; Chronicle <a href=\"https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/politics/albany/2020/06/29/andrew-cuomo-unveils-foam-mountain-visualize-nys-coivd-19-fight/3278852001/\">reported</a> that the paint and materials for the foam sculpture cost $185, and that it was made in-house by his staff. Once he debuted his commission, Cuomo explained its purpose.</p>\n<p>âDoing this once in life is enough,â he said. âWe donât need to climb another mountain.â</p>\n<p>If itâs unclear why the addition of the sculpture was needed to make the point that no one wants New York to repeat its past few months, itâs worth remembering that Cuomo has a history of making this kind of show. There was the <a href=\"https://abc7ny.com/coronavirus-new-york-ny-cases-in-news/6137521/\">mural of face masks</a> in April, which he described as a âself-portrait of America,â and he and his brother centered one of their many recent gag routines around an <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChrisCuomo/status/1263278630408531974\">oversize cotton swab</a> in May.

Money","inlineEmbeds":[],"items":[{"hed":"The Billionaire Battle in the Bahamas","dek":"Peter Nygard is a hard-partying retail tycoon, whose estate is fit for a Mayan emperor. Louis Bacon is a buttoned-up hedge-fund king, whose passion is conservation. Both are locked in an eight-year legal war with each other that has turned each manâs paradise into hell.","relId":"5661c64dff2f5268396eff9d"},{"hed":"âHello, Madoff!â","dek":"For more than two decades, Bernard Madoffâs secretary sat just outside his office. . Until December 11, 2008, she trusted him as a generous, caring boss. Now, in an exclusive collaboration with Mark Seal, Eleanor Squillari describes the madness surrounding Madoffâs arrest and the mysteries of the 17th floor, two levels down, where his massive Ponzi scheme was perpetrated.","relId":"54cc232b5e7a91c52824159a"},{"hed":"Beware of Greeks Bearing Bonds","dek":"As Wall Street hangs on the question âWill Greece default?,â the author heads for riot-stricken Athens, and for the mysterious Vatopaidi monastery, which brought down the last government, laying bare the countryâs economic insanity. But beyond a $1.2 trillion debt (roughly a quarter-million dollars for each working adult), there is a more frightening deficit. After systematically looting their own treasury, in a breathtaking binge of tax evasion, bribery, and creative accounting spurred on by Goldman Sachs, Greeks are sure of one thing: they canât trust their fellow Greeks.","relId":"54cc22143c894ccb27c8c793"},{"hed":"How Did Johnny Depp Find Himself in a Financial Crisis?","dek":"For years, Depp has topped the box office as one of Hollywoodâs highest-paid actors, yet somehow heâs facing a financial hole. The actor is charging his former business managers, Joel and Robert Mandel, with fraud, while their counterclaim cites his manic spending: the private islands, French chÃ¢teau, 156-foot yacht, and much, much more.","relId":"59554003efdf8459099f6093"},{"hed":"Inheritance Italian Style","dek":"A year ago, the funeral of Carlo Caracciolo&#8212;Prince of Castagneto, Duke of Melito, and co-founder of LâEspresso and La Repubblica&#8212;brought together his extended clan, a social elite of Agnellis, Borgheses, Viscontis, and Pasolinis. But the revelation that his body&#8212;the prime source of DNA&#8212;had been cremated by order of his adopted daughter, Jacaranda, began a scandal that could tear his family apart. Exploring Caraccioloâs racy life and the claims of two other alleged offspring, Bob Colacello tackles the question the entire Italian aristocracy is asking: How many heirs did Carlo have?","relId":"54cc221a3c894ccb27c8c7cf"},{"hed":"Madoffâs World","dek":"Among Bernard Madoffâs many dupes were his closest friends, including two tycoons he loved as surrogate fathers: the late Norman F. Levy&#8212;whose girlfriend, supermodel Carmen DellâOrefice, would lose her life savings&#8212;and the prominent philanthropist Carl J. Shapiro. Amid the sobs, screams, and curses in Aspen, Palm Beach, and New York, with victims sharing their stories, the author gets behind Madoffâs affable faÃ§ade, to reveal his most intimate betrayals.","relId":"54cc23cb2cba652122da0d58"},{"hed":"Her House of Cards","dek":"How did a 26-year-old cocktail waitress end up running a private weekly poker game for some of Hollywoodâs highest rollers, including the likes of Leo, Ben, and Tobey? In an adaptation from her new memoir, Molly Bloom, who has since gained notoriety as âthe Poker Princess,â recalls her lucky break, at the infamous Viper Room; the millions that crossed her table; and the biggest winners&#8212;who could also be the worst losers.","relId":"54cb01e3f547ce3c06e41517"},{"hed":"Inside the Family Battle for the Newmanâs Own Brand Name","dek":"When Paul Newman died, in 2008, he left his Newmanâs Own food empire, and the charitable foundation it supports, in the hands of his adviser Robert Forrester.

It would become the cradle of connectivity, spawning the era of Google and YouTube, of Amazon and Facebook, of the Drudge Report and the Obama campaign. Each breakthrough&#8212;network protocols, hypertext, the World Wide Web, the browser&#8212;inspired another as narrow-tied engineers, long-haired hackers, and other visionaries built the foundations for a world-changing technology.

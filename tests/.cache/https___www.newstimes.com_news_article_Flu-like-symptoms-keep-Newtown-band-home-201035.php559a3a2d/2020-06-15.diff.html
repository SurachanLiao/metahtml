Their symptoms included the sudden onset of malaise, muscle aches, fatigue, sore throat, headache, cough and fever. </p><p>Those students were sent home during the weekend so they would not be in further contact with the other students.</p><p>"My thought process was that I knew there is flu in the community, and that these kids were on the bus for a long period of time for the drive down, and that two kids immediately needed (Friday night) to get sent home for feeling ill," she said.</p><p>Robinson said in addition to students, two high school teachers -- band director and music teacher <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;channel=news&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;searchindex=solr&amp;query=%22Kurt+Eckhardt%22">Kurt Eckhardt</a> and the assistant band director were also quarantined Monday. </p><p>Students stayed at the Inn at Reading on Friday and Saturday nights, in preparation for the U.S. Scholastic Band Association Northern States Championship on Sunday at J. Birney Crum Stadium in Allentown, Pa. </p><p>In addition to rehearsing for Sunday's show, the band spent several hours Saturday at Hershey Park After Dark.</p><p>"By the end of Sunday morning, there were eight band members that needed to be sent home because they were too ill to perform," Machado said Monday. </p><p>Machado said she was part of the decision to close <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;channel=news&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;searchindex=solr&amp;query=%22Reed+Intermediate+School%22">Reed Intermediate School</a> at the end of last school year.</p><p>"I also knew that (flu spread) because of a school trip (then), and that was part of my thinking," she said. "I thought that the down side of missing one day of school to hopefully prevent super-spread outweighed the negative of missing the day."</p><p>Robinson said she'd like to encourage parents to have students get the H1N1 vaccination, but they are not yet available for the high school age group.</p><p>She said students who were forced to remain home Monday were marked as excused and will be able to make up their work.</p><p>To avoid similar situations, the district has "decided to not take any prolonged field trips. This is a good lesson," Robinson said. </p><p>On Monday night, Robinson said band students who were quarantined Monday will be able to come back Wednesday, "Unless I hear otherwise from our medical adviser."</p><p>Machado said as long as students have not experienced symptoms in 24 hours they will be allowed to return to school.</p><p>Health-related questions should be directed to Dee Cupole, Newtown public school nurse supervisor, at 203 426-7649.</p><p>Contact <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;channel=news&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;searchindex=solr&amp;query=%22Melissa+Bruen%22">Melissa Bruen</a> at mbruen@newstimes.com or 203-731-3350.</p></article>

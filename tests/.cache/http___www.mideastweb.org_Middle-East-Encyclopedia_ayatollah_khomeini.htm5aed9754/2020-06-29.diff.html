Sayyid 
Ruhollah Musavi Khomeini (Farsi: روح الله موسوی خمینی)  
was the founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran and its ruler from 1979 to 1989, 
as well as a
<a href="http://www.mideastweb.org/Middle-East-Encyclopedia/Shia.htm">Shia</a> Islamic religious leader and scholar and philosopher and theologist of the Shi'a version of 
radical
<a href="http://www.mideastweb.org/Middle-East-Encyclopedia/Islamism.htm">Islamism</a>.   
</p> <p>The Ayatollah Khomeini was born on May 17, 1900 <a target="n" href="http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/individualProfile.asp?indid=670">ref</a> (or September 24, 1902)
<a target="n" href="http://www.al-islam.org/islamicgovernment/">ref</a>in the Iranian town of Khomein, to Mustafa Musawi and Hajiyah Aga Khanum. His father was murdered 
by bandits when he was 5 months old, his mother died in 1918.  Khomeini 
began his religious and philosophical studies after World War I in Arak and 
later in the religious center of Qom, inspired by Mirza Ali Akbar Yazdi and a 
variety of Sufi mystics. </p> <p>Ruhollah Khomeini was a lecturer in political philosophy, Islamic history and 
ethics at the Qom seminary and in Najaf for many years and was recognized as a  
leading scholar of Shia Islam. In 1929 he married Khadijeh Saqafi Khomeini, who 
was 12 or 13 years old at the time. She bore him seven children, of whom 5 
survived to adulthood. Their eldest son, Mustafa, may have been murdered on 
orders of the Shah while the family was exiled in Najaf, Iraq. </p> <p>Khomeini was elevated to the status of Ayatollah in the 1950s. 
In the 1960s, he became politically active in opposition to the government of 
the Shah. In 1962, he led opposition to a bill that would have reformed 
elections to allow non-<a href="http://www.mideastweb.org/Middle-East-Encyclopedia/Muslim.htm">Muslim</a>s 
to run for office.<a target="n" href="http://ghadeer.org/english/imam/imam-books/kauthar1/kuth1.html">ref</a> Because of his 
increasingly strident opposition to the Iranian government, he was arrested in 
the spring of 1963 and exiled in 
1964. He stayed in Turkey for a year and then moved to Najaf,  Iraq. Until 
he was forced to leave in 1978, Khomeini was successful in imposing himself as a 
political presence in Iran through political initiatives and materials that were 
smuggled into the country. During this period, he also established himself as an 
Islamic authority in Najaf, and he developed his theory of Islamic governance, 
exposed in a series of lectures given in Najaf from January 21 to February 8, 
1970. These were compiled into a book: Hukumat e Islami: Velayat i Faqih (or 
Wilayat al Faqih), or in English: Islamic government: the custodianship of the 
Jurists. The book delineates Khomeini's political principles that justify an 
Islamist religious dictatorship and is discussed in more detail below. </p> <p>When he was exiled from Iraq, Khomeini 
went to France which gave him asylum, perhaps in order to frustrate U.S. Middle 
East policy, until February 1, 1979, after the Shah had departed Iran because of 
illness and political unrest. Khomeini returned home at the invitation 
of Iran's anti-Shah revolutionaries. </p> <p>Soon after his return, Khomeini ousted the interim Prime Minister Shahpour 
Bakhtiar and installed Mehdie Bazargan, his own candidate. The Iranian military, 
loyal to the Shah, did not interfere in any stage of the revolution, probably 
because the United States government warned them against human rights 
violations. The nature of Khomeini's creed and his plans were quite clear 
to many observers outside Iran. He had also explicitly stated his 
anti-democratic idea of Islamic rule in  Hukumat e Islami: Velayat i Faqih, 
published in 1970 and widely circulated in Iran. Nonetheless, the United States refused to interfere to 
restore order or help its allies and supporters in Iran, and Iranian 
revolutionaries convinced themselves that Khomeini would bring about a 
democratic regime. 
</p> <p>Khomeini had promised to adhere to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
and to make Iran into a representative democracy. After he seized power however, 
he formed an Islamic Republic 
making himself  
Head of State for life. He rewrote the draft constitution to include the 
principles of Velayat-i-faqih. He was styled marj al faqih - the source of emulation, 
and implemented the undemocratic concept of Velayat-i-faqih,  Guardianship of 
the Islamic Jurists.  Early in his 
rule, Khomeini was popularly known as "Leader of the Revolution." Later he held 
the title of "Supreme Spiritual Leader." </p> <p>In power, Khomeini undertook to implement his version of
<a href="http://www.mideastweb.org/Middle-East-Encyclopedia/Shia.htm">Shia</a> <a href="http://www.mideastweb.org/Middle-East-Encyclopedia/Sha'aria.htm">Sharia</a> Islamic Law. Women were forced to wear the
<a href="http://www.mideastweb.org/Middle-East-Encyclopedia/Chador.htm">Chador</a> and both women and men were compelled to dress according to restrictive codes. 
Tens of thousands of opponents, real or imagined, were murdered. The <a href="http://www.mideastweb.org/Middle-East-Encyclopedia/Bahai.htm">Bahai</a> religious minority were deprived of their rights including the right to practice 
their faith. Numerous Bahai were executed, including <a href="http://www.zionism-israel.com/Iran_Bahai.htm" target="n">ten young Bahai female 
schoolteachers, hanged</a> in 1983. Homosexuals were persecuted and hanged. 
Elections would be held, but they would be meaningless. Only Muslim candidates 
could run and candidates could be vetoed by the Supreme Council of religious 
leaders. Four seats for minorities were reserved in the legislature out of a 
total of 270. The Ayatollah had frequently expressed anti-Semitic sentiments, 
but nonetheless ordered that Jews should be treated well. That did not preclude 
periodic hanging of Jews for alleged espionage.  Foreign reading matter and 
films were strictly limited, and the press was censored.  Torture became 
commonplace. Under the law, it was forbidden to execute a virgin. Therefore 
women were "married" to their jailers in a fictitious ceremony and then raped 
before being murdered. This practice continues in contemporary Iran<a target="n" href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1246443842931&amp;pagename=JPArticle%2FShowFull">ref</a> . Pretty young women were reportedly arrested only for that purpose. Non-Shia 
Muslims and other minorities have second class status. A non-Muslim who converts 
will be the sole inheritor of his parents. Through emigration and conversion, 
the number of Jews in Iran has been reduced from 80,000 to 30,000. Other 
minorities reportedly have experienced similar problems. </p> <p>Though the United States tried to hold itself aloof from the revolution, it became 
entangled in the revolution when a group called Muslim Student Followers of the 
Imam's Line held  52 Americans hostage in Tehran's U.S. embassy. The 
embassy staff had failed to follow proper security procedures or had no time to 
do so, exposing a great deal of sensitive communications and records, including 
names of intelligence agents. Khomeini decreed that the Majlis would decide the 
fate of the hostages and the government in effect held them hostage until the end of the term of President Carter. </p> <p>In September of 1980 Iraq attacked Iran. Iraq was supported by the 
US and other countries, and had an advantage despite its much smaller population 
and area. The Iranian army could not get replacements for its American 
equipment, and the regime did not trust the army, which had been a creation of 
the Shah and loyal to the previous government. Instead, Khomeini created the 
Iranian Republic Guard Corps (IRGC) and the <a href="http://www.mideastweb.org/Middle-East-Encyclopedia/Basij.htm">Basij</a> volunteers. Both sides used gas warfare. The Iranians sent their people on 
suicide missions to demine battlefields. The war ended in 1988 in a stalemate. Khomeini 
"drank the cup of poison" and accepted a UN mediated truce, rather than trying 
to reach his goal of ousting Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. The war cost 
about $300 billion and as many as 950,000 casualties. Nonetheless, it 
consolidated popular legitimacy of the regime, which was seen as championing 
Iranian independence against western backed Iraqi aggression.  </p> <p>In early 1989, Khomeini issued a 
<a href="http://www.mideastweb.org/Middle-East-Encyclopedia/Fatwa.htm">fatwa</a> declaring that Muslims had a religious duty to kill  Salman Rushdie, 
because of 
Rushdie's book, The Satanic Verses. Khomeini  claimed it was a blasphemy against the prophet
<a href="http://www.mideastweb.org/Middle-East-Encyclopedia/Muhammad.htm">Muhammad</a>. "The author of the Satanic 
Verses book," said Khomeini, "which is against Islam, the Prophet and the Koran, 
and all those involved in its publication who were aware of its content, are 
sentenced to death. I ask all Muslims to execute them wherever they find them." 
This event caused some Westerners who had supported the 
revolution against the Shah, to reconsider their support of Khomeini. Rushdie 
was not assassinated, but the Japanese translator of his book was murdered. <a target="n" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20020602193856/http://www.nytimes.com/books/99/04/18/specials/rushdie-translator.html">ref</a> </p> <p>Khomeini's  
<a href="http://www.mideastweb.org/Middle-East-Encyclopedia/Fatwa.htm">fatwa</a> against Rushdie 
reflected his philosophy of dealing with "infidels." "If one permits an infidel to continue in his role as a 
corrupter of the earth," he stated, "his moral suffering will be all the 
worse. If one kills the infidel, and this stops him from perpetrating his 
misdeeds, his death will be a blessing to him." </p> <p>Khomeini ruled Iran until his death on June 3, 1989.</p> <h2>Khomeini's Political 
Philosophy </h2> <p>The foundations of Ayatollah Roholla Khomeini's political philosophy are 
given in the book
<a target="n" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.al-islam.org/islamicgovernment/">Hukumat 
e Islami: Velayat e Faqih</a>. 
The essentials may be summarized as follows: </p> <ul><li><p>Islam is a political religion and philosophy of governance by its nature and 
covers all aspects of life.</p></li> <li><p>Those who falsely claim that Islam is only relevant to matters of faith do so 
because they are servants of imperialists. </p></li> <li><p>If Muslim states employed Islamic governance than they would become more 
powerful than their rivals, and that is why imperialists and their servants 
oppose rule by Islamic law.  </p></li> <li><p><a href="http://www.mideastweb.org/Middle-East-Encyclopedia/Sha'aria.htm">Sharia</a>, 
as interpreted by a great scholar, must be the basis of governance, and Khomeini 
is the
	<a href="http://www.mideastweb.org/Middle-East-Encyclopedia/Marj_al-Taqlid.htm">marj al taqlid</a> (model worthy of emulation) an absolute leader who rules by fiat and is the 
	stand-in for the hidden 12th Imam. </p></li> <li><p>Democracy is contrary to Islamic law, which is the rule of God. This  
principle was hidden following for a brief period just before the triumph of the 
	revolution, when Khomeini promised democratic government. </p></li> </ul> <p>Some quotations from Hukumat e Islami:</p> <blockquote><p><span class="txtmn">[From Section 1]</span></p> <p><span class="txtmn">The subject of the 
	government of the jurist (Wilayat Al Faqih) provides us with the opportunity 
	to discuss certain related matters and questions. The governance of the 
	faqih is a subject that in itself elicits immediate assent and has little 
	need of demonstration, for anyone who has some general awareness of the 
	beliefs and ordinances of Islam will unhesitatingly give his assent to the 
	principle of the governance of the faqih as soon as he encounters it; he 
	will recognize it as necessary and self-evident." </span></p> <p>...</p> <p>From the very beginning, the historical movement of Islam has had to 
	contend with the Jews, for it was they who first established anti-Islamic 
	propaganda and engaged in various stratagems, and as you can see, this 
	activity continues down to the present. Later they were joined by other 
	groups, who were in certain respects, more satanic than they. These new 
	groups began their imperialist penetration of the Muslim countries about 
	three hundred years ago, and they regarded it as necessary to work for 
	the extirpation of Islam in order to attain their ultimate goals. It was not 
	their aim to alienate the people from Islam in order to promote Christianity 
	among them, for the imperialists really have no religious belief, Christian 
	or Islamic. Rather, throughout this long historical period, and going back 
	to the Crusades, they felt that the major obstacle in the path of their 
	materialistic ambitions and the chief threat to their political power was 
	nothing but Islam and its ordinances, and the belief of the people in Islam. 
	They therefore plotted and campaigned against Islam by various means. </p> <p>...</p> <p>For example, the servants of imperialism declared that Islam is not a comprehensive religion providing for every aspect of human life and has no laws or ordinances pertaining to society. It has no particular form of government. Islam concerns itself only with rules of ritual purity after menstruation and parturition. It may have a few ethical principles, but it certainly has nothing to say about human life in general and the ordering of society.
</p><p>...</p> <p>Their plan is to keep us backward, to keep us in our present miserable state so they can exploit our riches, our underground wealth, our lands, and our human resources. They want us to remain afflicted and wretched, and our poor to be trapped in their misery. Instead of surrendering to the injunctions of Islam, which provide a solution for the problem of poverty, they and their agents wish to go on living in huge places and enjoy lives of abominable luxury.</p> <p>[From Section 2] </p> The fundamental difference between Islamic government, on the one hand, and constitutional monarchies and republics, on the other, is this: whereas the representatives of the people or the monarch in such regimes engage in legislation, in Islam the legislative power and competence to establish laws belongs exclusively to God Almighty. The Sacred Legislator of Islam is the sole legislative power...<p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR">Do we have no minerals, no natural resources? We have everything, but this 
	parasitism, this embezzlement, this profligacy -- all at the expense of the 
	people and the public treasuryhave reduced us to a wretched state. 
	Otherwise he [the Shah] would not need to go all the way to America and bow 
	down before that ruffians desk, begging for help.            </p> <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR">In addition, 
	superfluous bureaucracies and the system of file-keeping and paper-shuffling 
	that is enforced in them, all of which are totally alien to Islam, impose 
	further expenditures on our national budget not less in quantity than the 
	illicit expenditures of the first category. This administrative system has 
	nothing to do with Islam. These superfluous formalities, which cause our 
	people nothing but expense, trouble, and delay, have no place in Islam. For 
	example, the method established by Islam for enforcing peoples rights, 
	adjudicating disputes, and executing judgments is at once simple, practical, 
	and swift. When the juridical methods of Islam were applied, the sharīah 
	judge in each town, assisted only by two bailiffs and with only a pen and 
	inkpot at his disposal, would swiftly resolve disputes among people and send 
	them about their business. But now the bureaucratic organization of the 
	Ministry of Justice has attained unimaginable proportions, and is, in 
	addition, quite incapable of producing results. </p> <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR">The 
	qualifications essential for the ruler drive directly from the nature and 
	form of Islamic government. In addition to general qualifications like 
	intelligence and administrative ability, there are two other essential 
	qualifications: knowledge of the law and justice...
</p> <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR">After the death 
	of the Prophet  (s), difference arose concerning the identity of the person 
	who was to succeed him, but all the Muslims were in agreement that his 
	successor should be someone knowledgeable and accomplished; there was 
	disagreement only about his identity.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR">It is an 
	established principle that the faqīh has authority over the ruler....</p> <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR">The ruler must 
	also possess excellence in morals and belief; he must be just and untainted 
	by major sins... </p> <p>Thus, the view of the Shīah concerning government and the nature of the 
	persons who should assume rule was clear from the time following the death 
	of the Prophet (s) down to the beginning of the Occultation....</p> <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR">The two 
	qualities of knowledge of the law and justice are present in countless 
	fuqahā of the present age. If they come together, they could establish a 
	government of universal justice in the world. </p> <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR">If a worthy 
	individual possessing these two qualities arises and establishes a 
	government, he will posses the same authority as the Most Noble Messenger 
	(a) in the administration of society, and it will be the duty of all people 
	to obey him.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Deception in the presentation of Khomeini's ideology</h2> <p>It seems clear that the rise to power of Ayatollah Khomeini was based on a 
deceptive presentation of his program. Khomeini and his close circle of 
confidants who initiated the revolution  knew that publicizing the theory 
of the Wilayat Al Faqih would arouse opposition, and so they de-emphasized the 
Velayet e Faqih and seemed to be 
satisfying the desire of the Iranian public for democracy. . Jalal Farsi, a 
famous radical cleric, gave an interview to the Abrar newspaper in which he said 
that Ayatollah Khomeini cheated the West. Khomeini's objective was always the Wilayat Al Faqih, even when he pretended to be concerned with democracy and 
freedom and defending the republic. Farsi was the editor of the speeches by 
Khomeini that were later used in compiling the book

	us, with the same fist that we destroyed the regime we will destroy that 
	group as well. Pay attention to your statements. Repent from your writings. 
	I am warning you that you still have time to repent." -- In a talk at the 
	Fayzieah School, Qom, June 5, 1979</p> <p align="left">"The intellectuals, the writers, those who have information 
	and thoughts, you see some of them take their pens and in the name of 
	democracy they write whatever they want and they cause disagreements. This 
	group of so-called intellectuals has to correct themselves. Whatever we are 
	suffering is from this group of intellectuals and judges. What we are 
	suffering is because of them. -- In a talk in Qom, July 23, 1979</p> <p align="left">"We have to warn these intellectuals that if they don't stop 
	their meddling, they will be crushed. We have treated you gently so that 
	maybe you would stop your evilness, and if you don't stop, we will have the 
	last word. These American sympathizers and others must know that in just a 
	few hours we can throw them in the trashcan of annihilation any day that we 
	wish to do so." -- In a talk to the Iranian people, August 8, 1979</p> <p align="left">"Those who create political fronts must stop their 
	activities. If from the beginning, as in other revolutions in the world, 
	several thousand of these corrupt individuals had been burned and beheaded 
	till the issues were finished, problems would have been solved. We will 
	allow one or more parties to operate if they operate correctly. But we 
	announce that the rest are forbidden. We will no longer allow the same 
	freedom that we used to give, and we cannot allow these parties to continue 
	their activities. According to religious law, we can't give them a grace 
	period. Canonically, it is not correct to give a grace period. We made 
	mistakes when we gave freedom; we can't treat these wild animals gently. We 
	will no longer allow any of their writings to be distributed in the country. 
	We will destroy all their writings. We have to deal with them harshly, and 
	we will deal with them harshly. -- In a meeting with selected Members of 
	Congress, Qom, August 18, 1979</p> <p align="left">"After the revolution the borders were left open. Pens were 
	free, expression was free, political parties were free. Even if these people 
	are not Moslems, it was assumed that at least they are human. But it is 
	clear now that they are foreign puppets. For us the identity of these 
	writers, the identity of these political parties, the identity of these nice 
	and meaningless phrases are now very clear. We will no longer give freedom. 
	These people are not the type who will stop their activities just from 
	advice. We have to deal with them harshly. -- In a talk at the Fayzieah 
	School, Qom, August 19, 1979</p> <p align="left">"Those who are trying to bring corruption and destruction to 
	our country in the name of democracy will be oppressed. They are worse than 
	Bani-Ghorizeh  Jews, and they must be hanged. We will oppress them by 
	God's order and God's call to prayer." -- In a talk at the Fayzieah School, 
	Qom, August 30, 1979</p> <p align="left">"Those who have not voted for the Islamic Republic, it means 
	that they want the previous system. Those who boycott the election so no one 
	votes for the Islamic Republic are seditious. We will treat them like 
	enemies, and we will oppress them. You are enemies that you want to cause 
	trouble. You are enemies that you are conspiring against Islam and against 
	the country. Your comings and goings are controlled. We have been informed 
	that you are in contact with those who want to bring our country back to its 
	previous system. Now that your conspiracy has been proven, we will destroy 
	you all. If you don't stop your evilness, we will mobilize an even higher 
	mobilization, and we will clean out all of you. We will not allow you groups 
	of corrupt people to remain and continue your activities. -- In a message at 
	the end of the month-long Islamic fasting celebration, September 3, 1979</p> <p align="left">"These rotten roots that are now at work will be oppressed, 
	and the country will be cleaned up. After he encountered the Moavieh army, 
	which were even worse than the infidels, and he encountered the khavarej 
	, his Excellency the Imam Ali, the Chief of the Faithful, acted very 
	harshly and destroyed them to the extent that only a few were able to 
	escape." -- In a speech to the families of Iranian Air Force pilots, Qom, 
	September 2, 1979</p> <p align="left">"The day of the khavareg ["outsiders"] is the day that his 
	Excellency the Imam Ali, the Chief of the Faithful, pulled out his sword and 
	cut all these corrupt people just like cancer tumors and killed them all. 
	That day was "Yom-ol lah," the day that God punishes nations by bringing 
	earthquakes on them, bringing floods, bringing storms, and slashing people 
	till they become human. These all are God's day [sic], and these things are 
	related to God." -- In memory of the martyrs of the 17th of Shahriver 
	[September 8th], Qom, September 8, 1979</p> <p align="left">"Do not interrupt the activities. You all have to obey the 
	Islamic Republic. And if you don't, you all will vanish." -- In a speech to 
	Iranian Air Force officers, Isfahan, September 19, 1979</p> <p align="left">"Those who are against us are like cancer tumors that need 
	to be removed surgically; otherwise they will corrupt everything." </p> <p align="left">"These writings, these speeches, these wrong activities, 
	these democratic programs are separations from Islam. All these voices are 
	blasphemy and are atheistic." -- in a talk to the Representatives from 
	Tabriz, Qom, September 19, 1979 </p> <p align="left">"We have to identify those who are not in line with Islam 
	and the Islamic movement by their articles, speeches, and activities. You 
	the clergy, thank God, who have control over the Islamic nation [referring 
	to the Iranian people] have to warn people of the devils who arrange 
	gatherings and lectures. They are all afraid of one thing, which is Islam. 
	They might criticize many things, but the key point is that they are 
	attacking Islam itself. Their pens are the same old bayonets that have 
	become like pens ... [sic]. They all have to understand that as long as 
	there is a pulpit and an altar, and as long as these homily readers [that 
	is, Mullahs] exist, they cannot do anything. To all of you who oppose us, I 
	recommend that you don't gather so much, don't send so many fliers, don't 
	publish so much; have you now become brave enough to stick out your neck? I 
	will slap you on your mouth. You think that you have power? Stop all these 
	words and all this gibberish." -- To a group of clergymen, Qom, October 22, 
	1979</p> <p align="left">"In the revolution that was achieved in Iran, people were 
	screaming that they wanted Islam; these people did not rise up so their 
	country could have democracy." -- In a meeting with the Islamic Republic 
	Television and Radio Committee, Qom, December 10, 1979 
	 
	"These criminals that have been arrested are not accused, but their crimes 
	have been proven. We only have to prove their identity and then kill them 
	all. There is absolutely no need for a trial. No compassion for them will be 
	allowed. We believe that the guilty party does not need a trial and must be 
	killed." -- In a message to the Iranian people, June 30, 1980</p> <p align="left">"People have to learn from the mother who brought her own 
	son to court and then her son was hanged. This is one of the paradigms of 
	Islam, that everyone has to be the same. Children, brothers, kids--if they 
	do not accept advice, introduce them to government officials so that they 
	can receive their punishment ... this is their Islamic responsibility and 
	their faith responsibility. This must be done." -- In a meeting with Islamic 
	Republic police officers, July 24, 1981</p> <p align="left">"This job that you have accomplished, Oh you, woman, that 
	you brought and gave away your son for punishment has become a paradigm in 
	Islam. This is something that everyone must do. It is the responsibility of 
	all Moslems to do the same." --In a meeting with the mother of Mahmoud 
	Tarighol-Islam to announce her as an exemplary mother, Jamaran, August 26, 
	1981</p> <p align="left">"Iran is following a program, and that program is Islam. The 
	same Islam that says if somebody has an association with left or right, that 
	individual is fighting God. He has the intention of fighting God, and his 
	punishment is the punishment that people fighting God will receive. -- In a 
	meeting with coaches and educators, Jamaran, September 19, 1982</p> <p align="left">"Dear students, you must watch the behavior and the 
	activities of your teachers and professors so that if, God forbid, they say 
	something wrong, you see them deviating, right away you must report them to 
	the responsible officials. Teachers and professors, you must be alert to 
	watch your own colleagues to see if some of them are trying to teach 
	deviating thoughts during their lessons to the children of our Islamic 
	nation so that they can be stopped. If this does not work, directly 
	communicate with officials. My dear children, you too take care of one 
	another in the best possible way, and if you observe that some enemies in 
	the appearance of friends or schoolmates are trying to attract your friends, 
	introduce them to the responsible officials, and try to do all these things 
	very secretly. Committed mothers and fathers, watch the comings and goings 
	of your children and observe their activities." -- In a message on the first 
	day of the school year, Qom, September 23, 1982</p> </blockquote> <p>The comparison is instructive, but it is hardly a new phenomenon. The French 
Revolution and the Bolshevik revolution likewise promised democracy and freedom, 
but delivered terror and tyranny. The world was not experienced with political 
upheavals of that type then, despite the precedent of Cromwell. </p> <p>Khomeini came to power in a relatively relative sophisticated country that 
had the benefit of history. The provisional government that invited him to 
return was no doubt acquainted with the
<a target="n" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.al-islam.org/islamicgovernment/">Hukumat 
e Islami: Velayat e Faqi</a>. The philosophy of government expounded there was 
almost indistinguishable in important respects from the fuhrerprinzip of 
Adolf Hitler. It could not possibly permit democracy.   Moreover, in 
the case of the Islamic Republic, it is simply not credible that all the people 
who trusted Khomeini to bring democracy were fooled. Khomeini and his revolution 
had the support of intellectuals and students. They could have read his writings 
and seen his actual views in his book. Unlike the French revolution, Khomeini's 
terror was based on an idea that he had formed in advance. His despotism was 
intentional, rather than being a reaction to circumstances.  It is 
remarkable that in all that time nobody 
thought to consult Khomeini's earlier writings. Moreover, at least outside 
observers described Khomeini and his probable course of action quite accurately even before he took 
power. </p> <h2>Ayatollah Khomeini on sex </h2> <p>Ayatollah Khomeini wrote a Tahrir or exegesis with compilations of 
different rulings. The book, Tahrir ol vasyleh, has been translated into 
English. Following are a few highlights of his views regarding Islamic laws 
regulating sex 
<a target="n" href="http://g33klite.com/index.php/facts/general/299-the-controversial-tahrirolvasyleh-book">ref</a> (we cannot vouch for accuracy): </p> <ul><li><p>"A man can have sexual pleasure from a child as young as a baby. However he 
should not penetrate, sodomising the child is OK. If the man penetrates and 
damages the child then he should be responsible for her subsistence all her 
life. This girl, however does not count as one of his four permanent wives. The 
man will not be eligible to marry the girls sister." - From Khomeini's book, "Tahrir ol vasyleh", 
fourth volume, Darol Elm, Qom, Iran, 1990 Excerpt: Page (1) </p></li> <li><p>"It is better for a girl to marry in such a time when she would begin 
menstruation at her husband's house rather than her father's home. Any father 
marrying his daughter so young will have a permanent place in heaven." - From 
Khomeini's book, "Tahrir ol vasyleh", fourth volume, Darol Elm, Qom, 
Iran, 1990. </p></li> <li><p>"A man can have sex with animals such as sheep, cows, camels and so on. 
However he should kill the animal after he has his orgasm. He should not sell 
the meat to the people in his own village, however selling the meat to the next 
door village should be fine." - From Khomeini's book, "Tahrir ol vasyleh", fourth 
volume, Darol Elm, Qom, Iran, 1990</p></li> <li><p>"If one commits the act of sodomy with a cow, a ewe, or a camel, their urine 
and their excrement become impure, and even their milk may no longer be 
consumed. The animal must then be killed and as quickly as possible and burned." 
- From The little green book, Sayings of Ayatollah Khomeini, Political, 
Philosophical, Social </p></li></ul> <p>Until 2002, it was, in fact, permissible to marry a girl as young as nine 
years of age in Iran without the consent of her parents. A law passed in that 
year required parental consent for marriage of girls under age 13. </p> <p>Ami Isseroff </p> <p>July 23, 2009</p> <p align="left">Synonyms and alternate spellings: </p> <p align="left">Further Information:   <a href="http://mideastweb.org/iranhistory.htm">History of Iran</a> </p> </td> </tr> </table> <p align="center"><ins></ins></p><table border="0" width="100%" dir="ltr" id="table4"><tr><td><p align="center"><ins><a href="http://www.mideastweb.org/Middle-East-Encyclopedia">Encyclopedia of the Middle East Link: http://www.mideastweb.org/Middle-East-Encyclopedia </a></ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Note - This encyclopedia is a work in progress.

</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Spelling - Spelling of words in Middle-Eastern languages is 
often arbitrary. There may be many variants of the same name or word such as Hezbollah, Hizbolla, Hisbolla or 
Husayn and Hussein. There are some conventions for converting words from Semitic languages such as Arabic and Hebrew.  

There are numerous variant renderings of the same Arabic or Hebrew words, such as "Hizbollah," "Hisbulla" etc. It is not possible to find exact equivalents for 
several letters.   </ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Pronunciation - Arabic and 
Hebrew vowels are pronounced differently than in English. "o" is very short. The "a" is usually pronounced like the "a" 
in market, sometimes as the "a" in "Arafat."  The " 'A " is guttural.  " 'H "- 
the 'het ('Hirbeh, 'Hebron, 'Hisbollah') 
designates a sound somewhat similar to the ch in "loch" in Scots pronunciation, but made by touching 
the back of your tongue to the roof of your mouth. The CH should be pronounced like Loch, a more assertive consonant 
than 'het. </ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The "Gh" combination, and sometimes the "G," designate a deep guttural 
sound that Westerners may hear approximately as "r." The "r" sound is always formed with the back of the tongue, and is 
not like the English "r." </ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>More information:

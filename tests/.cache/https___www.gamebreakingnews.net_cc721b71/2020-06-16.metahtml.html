And we can't go back, because an angel with a fiery sword stands in the way; if we want to regain the bliss we felt when we were at one with things, we have to go not back but forward, says Kleist, all the way round the world in fact, and re-enter Paradise through the back door, as it were." &#8230; <a href="https://www.gamebreakingnews.net/2020/05/picture-books-and-video-games-a-backdoor-into-childhood/" class="more-link">[Read more...] <span class="screen-reader-text">about Picture books and video games: a backdoor into&#160;childhood</span></a></p></article><article class="post-74080569 post type-post status-publish format-standard entry"><p>But onto the new stuff: Halo 3 testing should start "within the first few weeks of June," and will include Forge and Theater, as well five campaign missions and plenty of multiplayer maps and playlists. There's also some movement on other games in the MCC, including the addition of its Challenges system, audio fixes for Halo Reach, bug fixes around screen tearing, and secondary key bindings. All those things are getting closer to release and should be in an upcoming flight or release. &#8230; <a href="https://www.gamebreakingnews.net/2020/05/halo-community-update-tracks-the-obscure-cause-of-halo-2-s-worst-launch-bug/" class="more-link">[Read more...] <span class="screen-reader-text">about Halo community update tracks the obscure cause of Halo 2&#8217;s worst launch bug</span></a></p></article><article class="post-74086593 post type-post status-publish format-standard entry"><p>343 have kept a staggering pace in porting the old Halos, with a brief snapshot at Halo 3 and ODST running on PC coming before even Halo 2 Anniversary&#8217;s release earlier this month. So, while there&#8217;s no mention of the jazzy, Nathan Fillon-fronted spin-off in this week&#8217;s post, it&#8217;s not too shocking that there are already plans to roll out the trilogy&#8217;s closing act. Posting in a development update this week, 343 laid out their plans for Halo 3 flighting (testing) within the &#8220;first half&#8221; of June. &#8230; <a href="https://www.gamebreakingnews.net/2020/05/halo-3-makes-its-pc-debut-with-limited-testing-next-month/" class="more-link">[Read more...] <span class="screen-reader-text">about Halo 3 makes its PC debut with limited testing next&#160;month</span></a></p></article><article class="post-74092362 post type-post status-publish format-standard entry"><p>In case there was any doubt, Baldur's Gate 3's new sizzle reel confirms rooms full of fire &#8230; <a href="https://www.gamebreakingnews.net/2020/05/play-half-life-alyx-as-a-more-traditional-shooter-in-this-vr-free-mod/" class="more-link">[Read more...] <span class="screen-reader-text">about Play Half-Life: Alyx as a more traditional shooter in this VR-free&#160;mod</span></a></p></article><article class="post-74092368 post type-post status-publish format-standard entry"><p>The playlist update comes alongside a double XP, double weapon XP and 2X tier progression weekend.

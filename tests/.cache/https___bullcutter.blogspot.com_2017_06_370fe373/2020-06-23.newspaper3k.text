These are short common sense opinions on today's (and yesterday's) news to counter the bulldroppings fed you by the liberal media. Sometimes I don't have URLs to news items, but I will give them to you when I can. Publishers are encouraged to use items from this blog by simply retaining my copyright indicia.

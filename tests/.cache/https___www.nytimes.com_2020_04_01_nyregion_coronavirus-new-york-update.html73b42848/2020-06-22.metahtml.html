Now it&#8217;s here.</h2><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">In March, as the number of coronavirus cases in New York City grew and the death toll mounted, Mayor Bill de Blasio warned that April would be worse. He repeatedly invoked April 5 as a &#8220;demarcation line&#8221; after which the city could expect a huge surge in virus patients.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">On Wednesday, with Mr. de Blasio&#8217;s crucial date just four days away and city data putting the number of virus-related deaths at 1,374, he went into detail about the supplies the city still needed to contend with the coming wave:</p><ul class="css-1le37cb ez3869y0"><li class="css-o74qhc eoqvrfo0"><p class="css-nxfrgc evys1bk0">3.3 million N95 masks, which protect health care workers from exposure to the virus</p></li><li class="css-o74qhc eoqvrfo0"><p class="css-nxfrgc evys1bk0">2.1 million surgical masks</p></li><li class="css-o74qhc eoqvrfo0"><p class="css-nxfrgc evys1bk0">100,000 isolation gowns</p></li><li class="css-o74qhc eoqvrfo0"><p class="css-nxfrgc evys1bk0">400 additional ventilators</p></li></ul><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">To help ensure that supplies go where they are needed, Mr. de Blasio said that James P. O&#8217;Neill, the former police commissioner who is now an executive with Visa, was returning to oversee operations and logistics related to the virus outbreak.</p></p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Mr. de Blasio said New York would continue to have a great need for supplies well after Sunday. By the end of April, he estimated, the health care system would need 65,000 additional hospital beds to accommodate new virus patients, as well as the people to staff them.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">To meet the expected demand, the city&#8217;s public hospital system plans to convert all of its facilities to intensive care units, officials said, adding that supplies and personnel were crucial to increasing the number of I.C.U. beds.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Patients who do not have the virus will be sent to large-scale temporary hospitals, like the one set up at the Javits Convention Center, or to hotels that are being converted into temporary medical facilities. So far, the city had secured 10,000 beds from 20 hotels, officials said.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">&#8220;This goal is within reach,&#8221; Mr. de Blasio said. &#8220;It&#8217;s going to take a herculean effort, but I&#8217;m confident it can be reached.&#8221;</p><p class="css-53u6y8"><h2 class="css-1aoo5yy eoo0vm40" id="link-402e56dd">Nearly 400 New York deaths put the region past 2,000.</h2></p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said early Wednesday that 391 people in New York State had died of the virus since Tuesday, bringing the state total to 1,941 and the total for New York, New Jersey and Connecticut to 2,381.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">As the crisis has grown more dire across the country, Mr. Cuomo&#8217;s message &#8212; delivered at briefings that have become a daily staple of the national news and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/nyregion/governor-andrew-cuomo-coronavirus.html" title="">raised his political profile</a> &#8212; has broadened in perspective.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">On Wednesday, the governor again emphasized the regional coordination between his state, New Jersey and Connecticut, before noting that the virus was spreading more rapidly in other states, including California, Michigan and Florida. </p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">And he urged Americans even in states that had not yet been hit hard by the virus to take it seriously. He cited projections from a group founded by the Gates Foundation that the death toll would reach 16,000 in New York and 93,000 nationwide.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">&#8220;This is not just New York,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If you believe these numbers &#8212; 16,000 deaths in New York &#8212; that means you&#8217;re going to get tens of thousands of deaths outside of New York.&#8221;</p><p class="css-53u6y8"><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Other developments on Wednesday:</p><ul class="css-1le37cb ez3869y0"><li class="css-o74qhc eoqvrfo0"><p class="css-nxfrgc evys1bk0">Confirmed cases in New York State: 83,712, up from 75,795.</p></li><li class="css-o74qhc eoqvrfo0"><p class="css-nxfrgc evys1bk0">Currently hospitalized in New York State: 12,226, up from 10,929.</p></li><li class="css-o74qhc eoqvrfo0"><p class="css-nxfrgc evys1bk0">In intensive care in New York State: 3,022, up from 2,710.</p></li><li class="css-o74qhc eoqvrfo0"><p class="css-nxfrgc evys1bk0">In New Jersey: There were 22,255 cases, up from 18,696, and 355 deaths, up from 267.</p></li><li class="css-o74qhc eoqvrfo0"><p class="css-nxfrgc evys1bk0">In Connecticut: There were 3,557 cases, up from 3,218, and 85 deaths, up from 69.

Mr. Cuomo said that he was prepared to legally require social distancing if necessary, but that it was absurd that even had to consider that.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">&#8220;How reckless and irresponsible and selfish for people not to do it on their own,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I mean what else do you have to know? What else do you have to hear? Who else has to die for you to understand you have a responsibility in this?&#8221;</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">As a start, he said, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/01/nyregion/coronavirus-nyc-playgrounds-closed.html" title="">all of the city&#8217;s playgrounds would be shut down</a>.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Mr. Cuomo said that he had spoken to Mr. de Blasio and Corey Johnson, the City Council speaker, about trying to enforce the social-distancing rules with the help of the police, but that the problem had persisted and more drastic action was necessary.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">The governor&#8217;s announcement came a day after the mayor closed 10 city playgrounds where people had continued to gather in crowds that violated social-distancing rules.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">&#8220;He really thought it was an abundance of caution issue to go ahead and move across the board in terms of playgrounds,&#8221; Mr. de Blasio said of Mr. Cuomo on Monday. &#8220;And I respect that.&#8221;</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">At around 5 p.m. that day, Sammy Frisz was pushing his giggling 22-month-old son on a swing at Mauro Park in Queens, when a city parks employees put a padlock on a nearby gate and told Mr. Frisz he had to leave through a different gate because the playground was being closed.</p><p class="css-53u6y8"><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Mr. Frisz, a municipal worker explained that a family friend who had died of the virus had already exposed Mr. Frisz, his wife and his son. They said they were three days into a 14-day self-quarantine.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Mr. Frisz&#8217;s wife, who asked that her name not be used because of her job, said in a telephone interview that the closing of the playground would make it difficult for her to do her job.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">&#8220;This is the last thing holding our sanity and our ability to keep our jobs together,&#8221; she said. &#8220;If we&#8217;re all cooped up in a little, tiny place, those of us with young children will go crazy, go bonkers, how am I supposed to work from home?&#8221;</p><h2 class="css-1aoo5yy eoo0vm40" id="link-41a80c24">An equipment shortage may soon force hard choices on doctors.</h2></p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">One patient had lymphoma and heart failure. Another was 85 years old with metastatic cancer. A third was 83 and had dementia and lung disease. All were critically ill with the coronavirus, and, a doctor said, all were hooked up to ventilators in recent weeks at a major Manhattan hospital.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">But soon, patients such as those might not receive similar aggressive treatment. As people with the virus overwhelm New York City hospitals, doctors have stepped up pressure on state health officials to give them a rare and unsettling power: the right to withhold care from patients who are not likely to recover.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Dwindling supplies <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/business/coronavirus-ventilator-shortage.html?module=inline" title="">mean there might not be enough ventilators</a> or other items for everyone, and many doctors say they are growing increasingly uneasy with treating every patient equally. They believe medical workers soon might need to make difficult choices about treatment.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">&#8220;Usually, the standard is to intubate and do CPR and do all those things,&#8221; said Dr. Angela Mills, the chief of emergency medicine services at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center. &#8220;There&#8217;s no question about it; that will not most likely be sustainable.&#8221;</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">The problem is a grim and wrenching one, and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/01/nyregion/coronavirus-doctors-patients.html" title="">the experience of doctors in New York could signal what is to come for their colleagues in other states</a>, which have begun dusting off triage plans.</p><p class="css-1sngw6j"><a class="css-1a9ghz5" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/01/nyregion/nyc-coronavirus-cases-map.html"><p class="css-1rha1bf"><h2 class="css-zd32qr">A Month of Coronavirus in New York City: See the Hardest-Hit Areas</h2><p class="css-1uuihdo">New data released by the city shows that lower-income neighborhoods have been most affected by the virus.</p></p></a></p><p class="css-53u6y8"><h2 class="css-1aoo5yy eoo0vm40" id="link-a29bdfb">A New York developer is the friend the president says has the virus.</h2></p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">For another time on Wednesday, President Trump somberly described a personal connection to the coronavirus as he discussed the effects of the pandemic at his daily briefing with his virus task force.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Sometimes he has referred to a friend who has the coronavirus and other times to friends. His aides have repeatedly declined to identify whom the president has been talking about.</p><p class="css-53u6y8"><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">But three people familiar with the matter said he was describing <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/01/us/politics/trump-friend-coronavirus-stanley-chera.html" title="">Stanley Chera, a New York City real-estate developer who has known the president for many years</a> and had decamped to Deal, N.J., a few weeks ago as the coronavirus spread.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">But it was unclear whom else Mr. Trump might have been referring to when he said he has other friends who are also ill.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Mr. Chera, 78, became sick at some point in Deal, and was rushed to New York-Presbyterian/Columbia hospital, according to two of Mr. Chera&#8217;s friends. Two of those friends said Mr. Chera was in a medically induced coma. But it is unclear whether he has tested positive for the coronavirus.</p><h2 class="css-1aoo5yy eoo0vm40" id="link-aa0fa4e">A changing New York, by the numbers.</h2></p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Businesses are closed. Makeshift hospitals are popping up in parks. Parents are plugging into Zoom meetings as their children, sometimes a few feet away, remotely attend school.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Everyday life in the city has been upended by the coronavirus. To help you understand how, here is some data collected from the city&#8217;s toll-free 311 hotline:</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">More than 1,000 social-distancing complaints in just two days. Hardly anyone had even heard of social distancing until a few weeks ago. On Saturday, March 28, the city&#8217;s 311 system recorded its first complaints about people failing to keep six feet from others. Two days later, daily complaints had climbed to 776.</p><section id="styln-faq-coronavirus" class="css-l08pwh interactive-content interactive-size-medium"><p class="g-inlineguide-headline-group">

Bryant, the president and chief science officer of the American Council on Exercise, a nonprofit organization that funds exercise research and certifies fitness professionals. &#8220;In my personal experience,&#8221; he says, &#8220;heart rates are higher at the same relative intensity when you wear a mask.&#8221; Some people also could experience lightheadedness during familiar workouts while masked, says Len Kravitz, a professor of exercise science at the University of New Mexico.</p>

                <h4>What is pandemic paid leave?</h4>
                <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/upshot/coronavirus-paid-leave-guide.html">The coronavirus emergency relief package</a> gives many American workers paid leave if they need to take time off because of the virus. It gives qualified workers two weeks of paid sick leave if they are ill, quarantined or seeking diagnosis or preventive care for coronavirus, or if they are caring for sick family members. It gives 12 weeks of paid leave to people caring for children whose schools are closed or whose child care provider is unavailable because of the coronavirus. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/upshot/coronavirus-paid-leave-guide.html">It is the first time the United States has had widespread federally mandated paid leave,</a> and includes people who don&#8217;t typically get such benefits, like part-time and gig economy workers. But <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/14/opinion/coronavirus-pelosi-sick-leave.html">the measure excludes</a> at least half of private-sector workers, including those at the country&#8217;s largest employers, and gives small employers significant leeway to deny leave.</p>

                <h4>Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?</h4>
                <p>So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5">paper</a> published in April suggests that people are most infectious about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was &#8220;very rare,&#8221;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html#link-1f302e21">but she later walked back that statement.</a></p>

                <h4>What&#8217;s the risk of catching coronavirus from a surface?</h4>
                <p>Touching contaminated objects and then infecting ourselves with the germs is not typically how the virus spreads. But it can happen. A number <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.905.8444&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">of studies</a> of flu, rhinovirus, coronavirus and other microbes have shown that respiratory illnesses, including the new coronavirus, can spread by touching contaminated surfaces, particularly in places like day care centers, offices and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5519164/">hospitals</a>. But a long chain of events has to happen for the disease to spread that way. The best way to protect yourself from coronavirus &#8212; whether it&#8217;s surface transmission or close human contact &#8212; is still social distancing, washing your hands, not touching your face and wearing masks.</p>

Economists had forecast the unemployment rate to increase to as much as 20 percent, after it hit 14.7 percent in April, which was the highest since the government began keeping official statistics after World War II. But the unemployment rate dipped instead, with employers adding 2.5 million jobs, after more than 20 million jobs were lost in April.</p>

This means that more public spaces are available for use and more and more businesses are being allowed to open again. The federal government is largely leaving the decision up to states, and some state leaders are leaving the decision up to local authorities. Even if you aren&#8217;t being told to stay at home, it&#8217;s still a good idea to limit trips outside and your interaction with other people.</p>

                <h4>What are the symptoms of coronavirus?</h4>
                <p>Common symptoms <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html">include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath.</a> Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html">The C.D.C. has also</a> added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.</p>

If possible, choose a window seat. A <a href="http://emoryhealthdigest.emory.edu/issues/2018/spring/from_the_well/germs-on-a-plane/index.html">study from Emory University</a> found that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. (Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.)</p>

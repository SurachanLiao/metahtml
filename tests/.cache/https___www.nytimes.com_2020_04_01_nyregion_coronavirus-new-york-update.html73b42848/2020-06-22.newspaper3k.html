<div><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">At his briefing, Mr. Cuomo expressed frustration with those who continued to ignore social-distancing guidelines in New York City. </p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">He insisted that the city&#8217;s police officers had &#8220;to get more aggressive&#8221; in enforcing the rules. Mr. Cuomo said that he was prepared to legally require social distancing if necessary, but that it was absurd that  even had to consider that.</p><p id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_1_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac"></p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">&#8220;How reckless and irresponsible and selfish for people not to do it on their own,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I mean what else do you have to know? What else do you have to hear? Who else has to die for you to understand you have a responsibility in this?&#8221;</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">As a start, he said, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/01/nyregion/coronavirus-nyc-playgrounds-closed.html" title="">all of the city&#8217;s playgrounds would be shut down</a>.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Mr. Cuomo said that he had spoken to Mr. de Blasio and Corey Johnson, the City Council speaker, about trying to enforce the social-distancing rules with the help of the police, but that the problem had persisted and more drastic action was necessary.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">The governor&#8217;s announcement came a day after the mayor closed 10 city playgrounds where people had continued to gather in crowds that violated social-distancing rules.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">&#8220;He really thought it was an abundance of caution issue to go ahead and move across the board in terms of playgrounds,&#8221; Mr. de Blasio said  of Mr. Cuomo on Monday. &#8220;And I respect that.&#8221;</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">At around 5 p.m. that day, Sammy Frisz was pushing his giggling 22-month-old son on a swing at Mauro Park in Queens, when a city parks employees put a padlock on a nearby gate and told Mr. Frisz he had to leave through a different gate because the playground was being closed.</p></div>

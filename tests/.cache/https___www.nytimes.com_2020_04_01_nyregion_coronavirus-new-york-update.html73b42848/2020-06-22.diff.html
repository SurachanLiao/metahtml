By the end of April, he estimated, the health care system would need 65,000 additional hospital beds to accommodate new virus patients, as well as the people to staff them.</ins></p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0"><ins>To meet the expected demand, the city’s public hospital system plans to convert all of its facilities to intensive care units, officials said, adding that supplies and personnel were crucial to increasing the number of I.C.U. beds.</ins></p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0"><ins>Patients who do not have the virus will be sent to large-scale temporary hospitals, like the one set up at the Javits Convention Center, or to hotels that are being converted into temporary medical facilities.

He cited projections from a group founded by the Gates Foundation that the death toll would reach 16,000 in New York and 93,000 nationwide.</ins></p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0"><ins>“This is not just New York,” he said. “If you believe these numbers — 16,000 deaths in New York — that means you’re going to get tens of thousands of deaths outside of New York.”</ins></p><p class="css-53u6y8"><ins></ins></p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0"><ins>Other developments on Wednesday:</ins></p><ul class="css-1le37cb ez3869y0"><li class="css-o74qhc eoqvrfo0"><p class="css-nxfrgc evys1bk0"><ins>Confirmed cases in New York State: 83,712, up from 75,795.</ins></p></li><li class="css-o74qhc eoqvrfo0"><p class="css-nxfrgc evys1bk0"><ins>Currently hospitalized in New York State: 12,226, up from 10,929.</ins></p></li><li class="css-o74qhc eoqvrfo0"><p class="css-nxfrgc evys1bk0"><ins>In intensive care in New York State: 3,022, up from 2,710.</ins></p></li><li class="css-o74qhc eoqvrfo0"><p class="css-nxfrgc evys1bk0"><ins>In New Jersey: There were 22,255 cases, up from 18,696, and 355 deaths, up from 267.</ins></p></li><li class="css-o74qhc eoqvrfo0"><p class="css-nxfrgc evys1bk0"><ins>In Connecticut: There were 3,557 cases, up from 3,218, and 85 deaths, up from 69.

Mr. Cuomo said that he was prepared to legally require social distancing if necessary, but that it was absurd that even had to consider that.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">“How reckless and irresponsible and selfish for people not to do it on their own,” he said. “I mean what else do you have to know? What else do you have to hear? Who else has to die for you to understand you have a responsibility in this?”</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">As a start, he said, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/01/nyregion/coronavirus-nyc-playgrounds-closed.html" title="">all of the city’s playgrounds would be shut down</a>.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Mr. Cuomo said that he had spoken to Mr. de Blasio and Corey Johnson, the City Council speaker, about trying to enforce the social-distancing rules with the help of the police, but that the problem had persisted and more drastic action was necessary.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">The governor’s announcement came a day after the mayor closed 10 city playgrounds where people had continued to gather in crowds that violated social-distancing rules.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">“He really thought it was an abundance of caution issue to go ahead and move across the board in terms of playgrounds,” Mr. de Blasio said of Mr. Cuomo on Monday. “And I respect that.”</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">At around 5 p.m. that day, Sammy Frisz was pushing his giggling 22-month-old son on a swing at Mauro Park in Queens, when a city parks employees put a padlock on a nearby gate and told Mr. Frisz he had to leave through a different gate because the playground was being closed.</p> <p class="css-53u6y8"><ins></ins></p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0"><ins>Mr. Frisz, a municipal worker explained that a family friend who had died of the virus had already exposed Mr. Frisz, his wife and his son. They said they were three days into a 14-day self-quarantine.</ins></p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0"><ins>Mr. Frisz’s wife, who asked that her name not be used because of her job, said in a telephone interview that the closing of the playground would make it difficult for her to do her job.</ins></p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0"><ins>“This is the last thing holding our sanity and our ability to keep our jobs together,” she said. “If we’re all cooped up in a little, tiny place, those of us with young children will go crazy, go bonkers, how am I supposed to work from home?”</ins></p><h2 class="css-1aoo5yy eoo0vm40" id="link-41a80c24"><ins>An equipment shortage may soon force hard choices on doctors.</ins></h2><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0"><ins>One patient had lymphoma and heart failure. Another was 85 years old with metastatic cancer. A third was 83 and had dementia and lung disease. All were critically ill with the coronavirus, and, a doctor said, all were hooked up to ventilators in recent weeks at a major Manhattan hospital.</ins></p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0"><ins>But soon, patients such as those might not receive similar aggressive treatment. As people with the virus overwhelm New York City hospitals, doctors have stepped up pressure on state health officials to give them a rare and unsettling power: the right to withhold care from patients who are not likely to recover.</ins></p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0"><ins>Dwindling supplies <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/business/coronavirus-ventilator-shortage.html?module=inline" title="">mean there might not be enough ventilators Link: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/business/coronavirus-ventilator-shortage.html?module=inline </a> or other items for everyone, and many doctors say they are growing increasingly uneasy with treating every patient equally.

Link: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/03/travel/how-to-clean-your-airplane-seat-and-space.html </a> Most important: Wash your hands often, and stop touching your face. If possible, choose a window seat. A <a href="http://emoryhealthdigest.emory.edu/issues/2018/spring/from_the_well/germs-on-a-plane/index.html">study from Emory University Link: http://emoryhealthdigest.emory.edu/issues/2018/spring/from_the_well/germs-on-a-plane/index.html </a> found that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. (Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.)</ins></p><ins> </ins></li><ins> </ins></ul><ins> </ins><ul class="g-inlineguide-item-list g-inlineguide-list-circle" id="g-inlineguide-item-list"><li><h4><ins>What should I do if I feel sick?</ins></h4><ins> </ins><p><ins><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/well/what-if-i-have-coronavirus.html">If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, Link: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/well/what-if-i-have-coronavirus.html </a> and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor.

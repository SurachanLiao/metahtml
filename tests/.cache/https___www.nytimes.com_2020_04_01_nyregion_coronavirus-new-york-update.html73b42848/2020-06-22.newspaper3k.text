At his briefing, Mr. Cuomo expressed frustration with those who continued to ignore social-distancing guidelines in New York City.

He insisted that the city’s police officers had “to get more aggressive” in enforcing the rules. Mr. Cuomo said that he was prepared to legally require social distancing if necessary, but that it was absurd that even had to consider that.

“How reckless and irresponsible and selfish for people not to do it on their own,” he said. “I mean what else do you have to know? What else do you have to hear? Who else has to die for you to understand you have a responsibility in this?”

As a start, he said, all of the city’s playgrounds would be shut down.

Mr. Cuomo said that he had spoken to Mr. de Blasio and Corey Johnson, the City Council speaker, about trying to enforce the social-distancing rules with the help of the police, but that the problem had persisted and more drastic action was necessary.

The governor’s announcement came a day after the mayor closed 10 city playgrounds where people had continued to gather in crowds that violated social-distancing rules.

“He really thought it was an abundance of caution issue to go ahead and move across the board in terms of playgrounds,” Mr. de Blasio said of Mr. Cuomo on Monday. “And I respect that.”

At around 5 p.m. that day, Sammy Frisz was pushing his giggling 22-month-old son on a swing at Mauro Park in Queens, when a city parks employees put a padlock on a nearby gate and told Mr. Frisz he had to leave through a different gate because the playground was being closed.

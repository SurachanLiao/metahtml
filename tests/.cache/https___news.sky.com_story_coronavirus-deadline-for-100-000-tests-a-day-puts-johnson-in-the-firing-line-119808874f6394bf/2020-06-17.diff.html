But what matters most is an updated strategy to take us through the exit from lockdown."</p><p>Responding to the report, a Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said testing was "absolutely critical" and capacity had more than doubled within weeks.</p><p>He added: "Our aim as we tackle this virus is to make it easy, fast and simple for any essential worker who needs a test to get a test.</p><p>"In addition to setting up a nationwide network of drive in testing sites, we have introduced home testing kit delivery, deployed mobile testing units operated by the Armed Forces, and built three new 'mega labs' to analyse test samples."</p> <ul class="sdc-news-footer__list sdc-news-footer__list--social"><li class="sdc-news-footer__list-item"><ins><a href="https://www.facebook.com/skynews" target="_blank" class="sdc-news-footer__list-link sdc-news-footer__list-link--facebook">Facebook Link: https://www.facebook.com/skynews </a> </ins></li><ins> </ins><li class="sdc-news-footer__list-item"><ins><a href="https://twitter.com/SkyNews" target="_blank" class="sdc-news-footer__list-link sdc-news-footer__list-link--twitter">Twitter Link: https://twitter.com/SkyNews </a> </ins></li><ins> </ins><li class="sdc-news-footer__list-item"><ins><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/skynews" target="_blank" class="sdc-news-footer__list-link sdc-news-footer__list-link--youtube">YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/user/skynews </a> </ins></li><ins> </ins><li class="sdc-news-footer__list-item"><ins><a href="https://www.instagram.com/skynews/" target="_blank" class="sdc-news-footer__list-link sdc-news-footer__list-link--instagram">Instagram Link: https://www.instagram.com/skynews/ </a> </ins></li><ins> </ins></ul><p class="sdc-news-footer__cell sdc-news-footer__accordion"><ins></ins></p><h4 class="sdc-news-footer__heading"><ins>About Sky News

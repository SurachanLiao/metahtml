But the problem for NYPD officers&#8217; safety goes beyond lacking PPE; it is the failure of our leadership to re-evaluate policing priorities during a pandemic despite a decrease in overall crime and a rapid increase of confirmed COVID-19 cases amongst NYPD.</p><p class="ad-caption-text align-center uppercase">Advertisement</p><p class=""> We recently sent a letter to Commissioner Dermot Shea urging the NYPD drastically reduce unnecessary arrests by increasing the use of verbal warnings, non-criminal citations, and appearance tickets for all low-level offenses. This recommendation is consistent with what has been urged by public health experts as well as the International Association of Chiefs of Police &#8212; the world&#8217;s largest professional association for police leaders. Other police departments have already curtailed low-level arrests and modified protocols to minimize unnecessary contacts that could spread the virus. The NYPD must do the same.</p><p class=""> Truly protecting NYPD officers, and in turn all New Yorkers, requires re-evaluating the methods we use to reach our public health goals. We must decarcerate more rapidly, cease unnecessary arrests for low-level offenses and dated low-level warrants, and rely on public health and medical experts to lead us out of this public health crisis. We simply cannot police our way out of a public health pandemic.

This remarkable woman&#8217;s words and actions provided people facing death with a gentle journey. Dr. Elizabeth Fontana understands that death from coronavirus is a shared trauma; it&#8217;s like a battlefield where those lost leave part of their being with their comrades &#8212; the medics in the field, doctors and nurses at field hospitals, and others. The coronavirus leaves its mark on us and the world we live in. Warren Gross</p><p class=" crd--cnt "> <h2 class="h5 heavy-text"> Easing the pain</h2></p><p class=""> Bayside: Unfortunately, I know of several families who have lost loved ones. I&#8217;ve heard horrible stories of not being able to say goodbye, delayed burials, no church services and the lack of closure without the proper grieving. Dr. Fontana has such an empathetic and kind relationship with the loved ones of those that she and others cared for. To Dr. Fontana and the families of the innocent victims, sorry for your losses. With sympathy and respect. Frank Macchio</p><p class=" crd--cnt "> <h2 class="h5 heavy-text"> Paging Dr. Fontana</h2></p><p class=""> Monroe Township, N.J.: It is amazing that Dr. Fontana was able to reach out to her patients and their families in such a kind and personal way during these difficult and stressful times. I hope she knows what a difference she made in their lives. If I am ever sick, she is the kind of doctor I would want at my bedside. Lorri Thompson</p><p class=" crd--cnt "> <h2 class="h5 heavy-text"> New York legend</h2></p><p class=""> Manhattan: Thanks for your article about the passing of saxophonist Giuseppi Logan (&#8220;Esteemed NYC jazz musician Giuseppi Logan dies of coronavirus: report,&#8221; April 18). I have fond memories of him playing in Tompkins Square Park. He was a pleasure to listen to. Katharine B. Wolpe</p><p class=" crd--cnt "> <h2 class="h5 heavy-text"> Give them a break</h2></p><p class=""> Manhattan: The actions of the Linden Center for Nursing and Rehabilitation nursing home in Brooklyn in handling the remains of deceased residents (&#8220;Lack of dignity at nursing home,&#8221; April 15) comply with the explicit and detailed guidelines issued by the office of chief medical examiner for situations just such as this. We can best support the elderly and frail among us with the compassion and dignity they deserve not by casting blame, but by making sure the federal, state and city governments are making sure the facilities that care for them have the staff, equipment and resources they need to provide proper care, in life and after death. Neil Heyman</p><p class=" crd--cnt "> <h2 class="h5 heavy-text"> Roommates</h2></p><p class=""> Hightstown, N.J.: Regarding the April 19 front-page story &#8220;Trapped&#8221; about Ms. Yoly Sanchez and the 11 people living in her two-bedroom apartment: The thing that I question is, why? Does New York have building codes? If they do, why are they not enforced? Or is enforcement selective and not blind? You cannot say the codes are federal law and ignore them like immigration statutes. Again, why are they not enforced? Simple question. Should not be too hard to answer. Guess it&#8217;s easier to look the other way.

Murphy is favoring big business and special interest groups over the backbone of our economy &#8212; small business. Small mom and pop retailers are closed all over the state, yet the big box retailers can sell the same products that they do. The small retailer is struggling to find a way to not only pay employees but to keep food on their table, and pay vendors for the inventory sitting on their shelves. A small business can control social distancing better than a large one. People want to get back to work and we need to help Main Street, not Wall Street. Why not allow these stores to open with reduced hours of operation? Or allow them to do phone orders with curbside pickup. If not then at the least big-box retailers should be restricted to food items only. Nick Blue</p><p class=" crd--cnt "> <h2 class="h5 heavy-text"> Selective release</h2></p><p class=""> Staten Island: I want to thank Voicer Tony Anastasio for his letter about our medical doctors convicted of non-violent crimes, such as financial malfeasance, who are still in federal prisons and the common criminals who are being set free. I tweeted at Gov. Cuomo on March 25 about this right after he asked health-care professionals to volunteer to help fight the COVID-19 epidemic. I suggested these doctors be released in exchange for a reduction of their sentences. I received no acknowledgment to my tweet.

China started this virus, allowed it to spread and lied about it later, but don&#8217;t call it the &#8220;Chinese Virus&#8221; because that&#8217;s racist. Instead, blame it on the American president! Liberals are thanking their lucky stars for the virus because it gives them something else to bash Trump with. What a thing to cheer for! And to Voicers Norah Mason, Jim Heimbuch and John J. Convery: If those stimulus checks are such a problem for you, you can simply refuse to cash them. But you won&#8217;t, will you?

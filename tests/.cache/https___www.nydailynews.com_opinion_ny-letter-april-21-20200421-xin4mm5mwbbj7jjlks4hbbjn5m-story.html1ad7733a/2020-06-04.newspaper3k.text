Cliffside Park, N.J.: Gov. Murphy is favoring big business and special interest groups over the backbone of our economy â€” small business. Small mom and pop retailers are closed all over the state, yet the big box retailers can sell the same products that they do. The small retailer is struggling to find a way to not only pay employees but to keep food on their table, and pay vendors for the inventory sitting on their shelves. A small business can control social distancing better than a large one. People want to get back to work and we need to help Main Street, not Wall Street. Why not allow these stores to open with reduced hours of operation? Or allow them to do phone orders with curbside pickup. If not then at the least big-box retailers should be restricted to food items only. Nick Blue

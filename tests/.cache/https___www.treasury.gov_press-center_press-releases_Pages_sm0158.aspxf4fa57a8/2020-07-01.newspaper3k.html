<p><p><strong>Washington </strong></p><p>&#8211; Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury&#8217;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) designated 11 entities and individuals for engaging in support of designated Iranian actors or malicious cyber-enabled activity.&#160; The persons sanctioned in today&#8217;s actions include one entity engaging in activities in support of Iran&#8217;s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) ballistic missile program; two Ukraine-based entities providing support to designated airlines, including one affiliated with the IRGC-Qods Force (IRGC-QF); and two Iran-based networks responsible for malicious cyber-enabled attacks against the U.S. financial system.&#160; Today&#8217;s actions were taken pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13382, which targets proliferators of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery and their supporters; E.O. 13224, which targets terrorists and those providing support to terrorists and acts of terrorism; and E.O. 13694, which targets persons engaging in significant malicious cyber-enabled activities.</p></p>
<p><p>&#160;</p></p>
<p><p>&#8220;Treasury will continue to take strong actions to counter Iran&#8217;s provocations, including support for the IRGC-Qods Force and terrorist extremists, the ongoing campaign of violence in Syria, and cyber-attacks meant to destabilize the U.S. financial system,&#8221; said Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin.&#160; &#8220;These sanctions target an Iranian company providing material support to the IRGC&#8217;s ballistic missile program, airlines that support the transport of fighters and weapons into Syria, and hackers who execute cyber-attacks on American financial institutions.&#8221;</p></p>
<p><p>&#160;</p></p>
<p><p>As a result of today&#8217;s actions, all property and interests in property of those designated subject to U.S. jurisdiction are blocked, and U.S. persons are generally prohibited from engaging in transactions with them.&#160; In addition, foreign financial institutions that facilitate significant transactions for, or persons that provide material or certain other support to, the entities and individuals designated today risk exposure to sanctions that could sever their access to the U.S. financial system or block their property and interests in property under U.S. jurisdiction.</p></p>

<p><p><strong>ITSec Team and Mersad Co. Associated Individuals</strong></p></p>
<p><p>&#160;</p></p>
<p><p>OFAC designated private Iranian computer security company ITSec Team pursuant to E.O. 13694 for causing a significant disruption to the availability of a computer or network of computers.&#160; Between approximately December 2011 and December 2012, ITSec Team planned and executed distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks against at least nine large U.S. financial institutions, including top U.S. banks and U.S. stock exchanges.&#160; During that time, ITSec Team performed work on behalf of the Iranian Government, including the IRGC.</p></p>
<p><p>&#160;</p></p>
<p><p>OFAC also designated three Iranian nationals for acting for or on behalf of ITSec Team.&#160; Ahmad Fathi was responsible for supervising and coordinating ITSec Team&#8217;s DDoS attacks against the U.S. financial sector.&#160; Amin Shokohi, a computer hacker who worked for ITSec Team, helped build the botnet that ITSec Team used in its DDoS attacks against U.S. financial institutions.&#160; Hamid Firoozi, a network manager at ITSec Team, procured computer servers for the botnet that ITSec Team used in its DDoS activities targeting the U.S. financial sector.</p></p>
<p><p>&#160;</p></p>
<p><p>Additionally, OFAC today designated four Iranian nationals pursuant to E.O. 13694 for causing a significant disruption to the availability of a computer or network of computers while working for Mersad Co., a private computer security company based in Iran that was affiliated with the IRGC.</p></p>
<p><p>&#160;</p></p>
<p><p>Sadegh Ahmadzadegan was responsible for managing the Mersad Co. botnet, which was used to target 24 corporations in the U.S. financial sector during DDoS attacks in 2012 and 2013.&#160; Sina Keissar, along with others at Mersad Co., placed malicious computer scripts on compromised computers and computer servers within the Mersad Co. botnet that performed several functions during those DDoS attacks against the U.S. financial sector.&#160; Keissar also procured U.S.-based computer servers used by Mersad Co. to access and manipulate the Mersad Co. botnet and performed preliminary testing of the same botnet prior to its use in the DDoS attacks.&#160; Omid Ghaffarinia, along with others at Mersad Co., developed malware and computer scripts, which they installed on the compromised computers and computer servers that constituted the Mersad Co. botnet, which allowed for remote access and control of the compromised computers.&#160; Nader Saedi, along with others at Mersad Co., planned and assisted in the same DDoS attacks.&#160; Saedi wrote computer scripts used to locate and exploit vulnerable servers to help build the Mersad Co. botnet used in the attacks.</p></p>
<p><p>&#160;</p></p>
<p><p>On March 24, 2016, the Department of Justice announced that a grand jury in the Southern District of New York indicted the seven ITSec Team and Mersad Co. associated individuals being designated today. </p></p>

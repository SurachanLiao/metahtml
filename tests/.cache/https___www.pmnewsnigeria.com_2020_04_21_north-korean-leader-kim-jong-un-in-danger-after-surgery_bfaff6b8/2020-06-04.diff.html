Such military events would usually be observed by Kim, but there was no KCNA report on the test at all.</p><p id="jp-relatedposts" class="jp-relatedposts"></p><h3 class="jp-relatedposts-headline">Related</h3> <p class="col-md-10 comment-section"><ins></ins></p><h2><ins>Join The Conversation</ins></h2><ins> </ins><p id="respond" class="comment-respond"><ins></ins></p><h3 id="reply-title" class="comment-reply-title"><ins>What do you think?					<a rel="nofollow" id="cancel-comment-reply-link" href="/2020/04/21/north-korean-leader-kim-jong-un-in-danger-after-surgery/#respond">Cancel reply Link: /2020/04/21/north-korean-leader-kim-jong-un-in-danger-after-surgery/#respond </a> </ins></h3><ins> </ins><p class="akismet_comment_form_privacy_notice"><ins>This site uses Akismet to reduce spam. <a href="https://akismet.com/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Learn how your comment data is processed Link: https://akismet.com/privacy/ </a>.</ins></p><ins> </ins><h2><ins>Latest</ins></h2><ins> </ins><p class="thumbnail headline-list"><ins><a href="https://www.pmnewsnigeria.com/category/entertainment/">Entertainment Link: https://www.pmnewsnigeria.com/category/entertainment/ </a> | 17 mins ago                            </ins></p><p class="caption"><a href="https://www.pmnewsnigeria.com/2020/06/04/hilda-dokubo-suggests-lifetime-sentence-for-rapists/"><h4><ins>Hilda Dokubo suggests lifetime sentence for rapists </ins></h4><ins> Link: https://www.pmnewsnigeria.com/2020/06/04/hilda-dokubo-suggests-lifetime-sentence-for-rapists/ </ins></a><ins> </ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="thumbnail headline-list"><ins><a href="https://www.pmnewsnigeria.com/category/entertainment/">Entertainment Link: https://www.pmnewsnigeria.com/category/entertainment/ </a> | 26 mins ago                            </ins></p><p class="caption"><a href="https://www.pmnewsnigeria.com/2020/06/04/kanye-west-now-richest-musician-in-the-world-forbes/"><h4><ins>Kanye West now richest musician in the world: Forbes </ins></h4><ins> Link: https://www.pmnewsnigeria.com/2020/06/04/kanye-west-now-richest-musician-in-the-world-forbes/ </ins></a><ins> </ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="thumbnail headline-list"><ins><a href="https://www.pmnewsnigeria.com/category/news/">News Link: https://www.pmnewsnigeria.com/category/news/ </a> | 53 mins ago                            </ins></p><p class="caption"><a href="https://www.pmnewsnigeria.com/2020/06/04/tinubu-reacts-to-death-of-ex-ondo-gov-olumilua/"><h4><ins>Tinubu reacts to death of ex-Ondo gov.

<div><p class="view_con_t">North Korean leader Kim Jong-un seems to feel &#8220;extremely nervous&#8221; about the allies&#8217; possible clandestine operation to eliminate him, South Korea&#8217;s intelligence agency told lawmakers Thursday. <br><br>Due to concerns over potential airstrikes and assassination attempts, the young tyrant prefers to move at dawn and uses his subordinates&#8217; cars, such as a Lexus car, not his own Mercedes-Benz 600, the National Intelligence Services told a closed-door parliamentary session, according to Rep. Lee Cheol-woo of the main opposition Liberty Party of Korea, who attended the meeting.&#160;<br><br></p><img alt="North Korean leader Kim Jong-un (Yonhap)" src="http://res.heraldm.com/content/image/2017/06/15/20170615001131_0.jpg"><p class="view_con_caption">North Korean leader Kim Jong-un (Yonhap)</p><p class="view_con_t"><br>South Korea and the US are seeking to establish a special forces team to take out Pyongyang&#8217;s leadership in the event of a contingency. Scheduled to be created by the end of this year, the unit will be tasked with eliminating Kim and paralyzing the North&#8217;s command and control system. <br><br>&#8220;Kim is so engrossed with collecting information about the &#8216;decapitation operation&#8217; through his intelligence agency,&#8221; said Lee, referring to the title of the clandenstie operation targeting Kim.&#160;<br><br>Despite economic hardship in the country, North Korea appears to have inched closer to securing key technology to develop intercontinental ballistic missiles through a series of successful missile tests, the NIS also said. <br><br>Regarding the controversy over a suspected North Korean drone found last week in South Korea, the spy agency said the drone took a total of 551 pictures of the South&#8217;s territory, including a Terminal Altitude Area Defense battery located in Seongju, North Gyeongsang Province. <br><br>The NIS also revealed that a total of six South Korean nationals are currently detained in North Korea, with most of them arrested for engaging in religious activities or helping North Korean defectors. If Korean-Americans are included, the number of detainees is 10, the NIS told the parliament. <br><br>The North Korean leader has reduced his propaganda public activities &#8220;by a significant amount,&#8221; which the NIS said suggests that the young leader has begun to feel confident about his grip on the communist state. <br><br>&#8220;The number of Kim Jong-un&#8217;s public activities was 51, a 32 percent decrease from last year,&#8221; an NIS official was quoted as saying by Rep. Lee.<br><br>&#8220;Since 2013, we have seen a downward trajectory of Kim&#8217;s public activities. We believe that Kim feels very confident (about his leadership). The number shows he has succeeded in grasping power and secured his status in the regime,&#8221; he said. <br><br>The regime has seen a &#8220;significant surge&#8221; in oil prices, as the United Nations has continued to enforce its economic sanctions and China has reduced its supply of crude and refined oil. <br><br>&#8220;North Korea supplies most of its oil to special places. Therefore, the household oil price has increased a lot. The oil price had been set at around 6,000 won ($5.30) per kilogram. The price increased to 20,000 won in May and it stands at around 15,000 won currently,&#8221; the NIS said. <br><br>By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)</p>				</div>

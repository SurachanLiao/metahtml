July 7, 2020 â Additional library branches to reopen

In late July/early August, we will be partially re-opening all library branches, with the exception of the Cornish Library which is closed for ongoing renovations. The libraries will be open for holds pick-up service, telephone reference service, and to return borrowed library materials. The re-opening dates for the additional library facilities and hours of operation will be released in the coming weeks.

Cindy Klassen Recreation Complex and Pan Am Pool to reopen this month

The Cindy Klassen Recreation Complex and Pan Am Pool are expected to re-open on Monday, July 20, 2020. The facilities will operate with limited access to the fitness equipment, walking tracks, and pools. The re-opening of these facilities will build on the systems implemented for outdoor pool operations, including pre-registered bookings for the pool and fitness amenities, reduced capacity, and increased cleaning schedules, among other measures.

More details on how residents can register for swim and fitness blocks at these facilities will be released closer to re-opening.

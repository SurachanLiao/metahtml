You may have noticed I said "my cloudy crystal ball" in an earlier post.... right? I am a strategic thinker... sometimes thinking is based on empirical evidence. You do read .... right?Reported today... discussion about the demilitarization of the Korean peninsula. Use your clicky thing.Certainly you know about Hong Kong and Taiwan and how China feels about reunification... right?Vietnam is becoming an economic threat to China and has fought a long border wall from 1979 to 1990. Economically speaking Vietnam provides an alternate shipping route in the South China Sea. If you think China doesn't want economic control then your head is in the sand. See Spratly Islands. The US has lifted the lethal arms embargo in 2016 for Vietnam.From a recent political review out of University of British Columbia (not bad for a trailer trash redneck)Is China wanting to control Asia? Well, as with any expanding entity; whether it be a virus infecting new hosts or the British empire in the colonial era, China also seeks to expand its influence in the global sphere. However, due to it not being a superpower yet, it seeks to expand in its locality, thus attaining a stable rate of expansion. With Asia being the most populous continent as well as the fastest developing region, China believes that influence over Asia is key in its dream of the “Chinese Century” being attained.So to rephrase the conclusion, “control” may not be the best word to describe China’s vision of Asia. Influence would be a better word for what China aims to do. This is already evident in the way China is handling its foreign relations in which it is placing priority on Asian nations through economic investments and diplomatic meetings.Draw your own conclusions.... like I draw mine.

Over the 8,000-year period up to 1 A.D. it grew to 200 million (some estimate 300 million or even 600, suggesting how imprecise population estimates of early historical periods can be), with a growth rate of under 0.05% per year.</p> <p>A tremendous change occurred with the industrial revolution: whereas<strong> it had taken all of human history until around 1800 for world population to reach one billion</strong>, the second billion was achieved in only 130 years (1930), the third billion in 30 years (1960), the fourth billion in 15 years (1974), and the fifth billion in only 13 years (1987).</p><ul> <li>During the 20th century alone, the population in the world has grown from 1.65 billion to 6 billion. </li> <li>In 1970, there were roughly half as many people in the world as there are now. </li> <li>Because of declining <a href="#growthrate">growth rates</a>, it will now take over 200 years to double again.</li> </ul> <p>Wonder how big was the world's population when you were born? <br> Check out this <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/interactive/2011/oct/24/how-big-worlds-population-born?CMP=twt_gu" target="_blank">simple wizard </a> or this <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-15391515" target="_blank">more elaborated</a> one to find out.</p> <br> <a name="growthrate"></a>  <h2>Growth Rate</h2><p class="chart-header">Yearly Population Growth Rate (%) </p><p id="chart_pop_rate"></p><p>Population in the world is currently (2020) growing at a rate of around <strong>1.05% </strong> per year (down from 1.08% in 2019, 1.10% in 2018, and 1.12% in 2017). The current average population increase is estimated at <strong>81 million people per year</strong>.</p> <p>Annual growth rate reached its peak in the late 1960s, when it was at around 2%. The rate of increase has nearly halved since then, and will continue to decline in the coming years. </p><p>World population will therefore continue to grow in the 21st century, but at a <strong>much slower rate compared to the recent past</strong>. World population has doubled (100% increase) in 40 years from 1959 (3 billion) to 1999 (6 billion). It is now estimated that it will take another nearly 40 years to increase by another 50% to become 9 billion by 2037.</p> <p>The latest <a href="/world-population/world-population-projections/">world population projections</a> indicate that world population will reach 10 billion persons in the year 2057. </p><p align="center" id="worldometers_728x90_incontent_1"></p><a name="table-historical"></a>  <h2>World Population (2020 and historical)</h2> <p><a href="/world-population/world-population-by-year/">View the complete population historical table </a></p>  Year<br> (July 1) PopulationYearly % <br> ChangeYearly<br> ChangeMedian <br>AgeFertility <br>RateDensity <br>(P/Km&#178;)Urban<br> Pop %Urban Population  2020 <strong>7,794,798,739</strong> 1.05 % 81,330,639 30.9 2.47 52 56.2 % 4,378,993,944   2019 <strong>7,713,468,100</strong> 1.08 % 82,377,060 29.8 2.51 52 55.7 % 4,299,438,618  2018 <strong>7,631,091,040</strong> 1.10 % 83,232,115 29.8 2.51 51 55.3 % 4,219,817,318 2017 <strong>7,547,858,925</strong> 1.12 % 83,836,876 29.8 2.51 51 54.9 % 4,140,188,594  2016 <strong>7,464,022,049</strong> 1.14 % 84,224,910 29.8 2.51 50 54.4 % 4,060,652,683  2015 <strong>7,379,797,139</strong> 1.19 % 84,594,707 30 2.52 50 54.0 % 3,981,497,663  2010 <strong>6,956,823,603</strong> 1.24 % 82,983,315 28 2.58 47 51.7 % 3,594,868,146  2005 <strong>6,541,907,027</strong> 1.26 % 79,682,641 27 2.65 44 49.2 % 3,215,905,863  2000 <strong>6,143,493,823</strong> 1.35 % 79,856,169 26 2.78 41 46.7 % 2,868,307,513  1995 <strong>5,744,212,979</strong> 1.52 % 83,396,384 25 3.01 39 44.8 % 2,575,505,235  1990 <strong>5,327,231,061</strong> 1.81 % 91,261,864 24 3.44 36 43.0 % 2,290,228,096  1985 <strong>4,870,921,740</strong> 1.79 % 82,583,645 233.59 33 41.2 % 2,007,939,063  1980 <strong>4,458,003,514</strong> 1.79 % 75,704,582 23 3.86 30 39.3 % 1,754,201,029  1975 <strong>4,079,480,606</strong> 1.97 % 75,808,712 22 4.47 27 37.7 % 1,538,624,994  1970 <strong>3,700,437,046</strong> 2.07 % 72,170,690 224.93 25 36.6 % 1,354,215,496  1965 <strong>3,339,583,597</strong> 1.93 % 60,926,770 22 5.02 22 N.A.

British people stuck in the Philippines will be flown home on four flights, the British Embassy in the country has said.

On 7 April the Philippine Airline flights will leave from airports in Palawan, Cebu, Bohol and Siarago - areas that have been identified as having the highest concentrations of stranded UK tourists. They will connect in Manila, where two planes will fly back to London Heathrow.

Each passenger will need to pay Â£1,000 ($1,227) for the flight package, regardless of where they're flying from. The most vulnerable passengers, including the elderly, people with serious health conditions, or people who are running out of medicine, will be given priority.

Ambassador Daniel Pruce says "many hundreds" of UK nationals are stranded in the Philippines after a number of travel routes out of the country were closed.

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) initially advised stranded tourists to take available commercial flights home - but people have complained that this was impossible, because of cancelled flights, closed airspace in many countries, and the exorbitant cost of the tickets that were available.

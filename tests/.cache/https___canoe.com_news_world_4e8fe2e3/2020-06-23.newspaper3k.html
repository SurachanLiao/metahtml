<div><p>The World Anti-Doping Agency declared Russia&#8217;s scandal-ridden drug-fighting operation back in business Thursday, a decision designed to bring a close to one of sports&#8217; most notorious doping scandals but one bitterly disputed by hundreds of athletes and described as &#8220;treachery&#8221; by the lawyer for the man who exposed the corruption.</p><p>On a 9-2 vote, the executive committee took the advice of the agency&#8217;s compliance review panel and declared RUSADA as having satisfied conditions of reinstatement that were gradually softened over the summer.</p><p>In most tangible ways, the decision doesn&#8217;t change much: RUSADA has been up and running for a while, bringing one of the world&#8217;s largest testing programs back on line with the help of officials from Britain and elsewhere. And Russia&#8217;s Olympic committee was brought back into the fold after the Pyeongchang Olympics, where athletes who could prove they were clean were able to compete as &#8220;Olympic Athletes from Russia.&#8221;</p><p id="pn_video_903004"></p><p>But RUSADA&#8217;s reinstatement now clears the country to again bid for major international events &#8212; although soccer&#8217;s World Cup was held there this summer despite that restriction.</p><p>It also clears a major hurdle for Russia&#8217;s track team to be declared compliant by that sport&#8217;s international governing body, one of the few to take a strong, consistent stand against doping.</p><p>Perhaps most importantly, hundreds of athletes and dozens of world anti-doping leaders see it as a stinging rebuke to the ideal of fair play.</p><p>&#8220;WADA&#8217;s decision to reinstate Russia represents the greatest treachery against clean athletes in Olympic history,&#8221; said Jim Walden, the attorney for Grigory Rodchenkov, the former Moscow lab director who exposed much of the Russian scheme.</p><p>WADA had been telegraphing the move since Sept. 14, when it released the recommendation of its compliance review committee. Olympic champion Beckie Scott resigned from that committee afterward.</p><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m profoundly disappointed,&#8221; Scott said to Canadian broadcaster CBC after the decision. &#8220;I feel this was an opportunity for WADA, and they have dealt a devastating blow to clean sport. I&#8217;m quite dismayed.&#8221;</p><p>Even in Russia, where the news was welcomed, it came with a sense that there&#8217;s still work to be done.</p><p>&#8220;These questions will always follow us,&#8221; said RUSADA CEO Yuri Ganus, whose appointment to the job was part of the housecleaning at the agency that WADA demanded. &#8220;These aren&#8217;t the kind of skeletons which can lie unnoticed in the closet. These are the skeletons which will be banging on the closet door all the time.&#8221;</p><p>The two biggest roadblocks to RUSADA&#8217;s reinstatement involved the country accepting findings from a report by investigator Richard McLaren that concluded the government had engineered the doping scandal to win medals at the Sochi Olympics. It also involved Russia agreeing to hand over a trove of data and samples that could be used to corroborate potential doping violations that stemmed from the cheating.</p><p>Over a summer&#8217;s worth of correspondence between WADA leaders and Russia&#8217;s sports minister about how to bridge the gap, a pattern emerged of WADA backing down from its initial requirements and, at one point, essentially asking Russia what it would be willing to say in a letter designed to satisfy the WADA review committee.</p><p>&#8220;We think that a small addition to the letter, if acceptable to you, could ensure that the letter is well received &#8230; and that a positive recommendation is provided,&#8221; WADA CEO Olivier Niggli wrote to sports minister Pavel Kolobkov in May in a letter obtained by BBC Sport .</p><p>In the end, Russia agreed to accept findings of an IOC-commissioned report that put less onus on the Russian government for the scheme, a move that Rodchenkov said earlier this week was done &#8220;for the pure purpose of protecting their top-level apparatchiks who destroyed the Olympic Games in Sochi.&#8221;</p><p>Russia also agreed to hand over the samples and data by Dec. 31. If it does not, RUSADA will again be declared noncompliant.</p><p>&#8220;Without this pragmatic approach, we would continue with the impasse and the laboratory data could have remained out of our reach indefinitely,&#8221; WADA president Craig Reedie said after Thursday&#8217;s executive committee meeting in Seychelles.</p><p>Critics said reinstating RUSADA before obtaining the data only amounts to accepting another promise from a country that hasn&#8217;t kept many over the five-year course of the scandal.</p><p>Travis Tygart, the CEO for the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, called the decision &#8220;bewildering and inexplicable,&#8221; and urged a full revamping of WADA; Reedie also serves as a member of the IOC, which is one of the many conflicts of interest that bother critics of the agency.</p><p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s be clear: Absolutely nothing will be off the table for how we, the anti-doping community, begin the work of reforming WADA,&#8221; Tygart said.</p><p>Reedie said &#8220;WADA understands that this decision will not please everybody.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Clean athletes were denied places at the Olympic and Paralympic Games, as well as other major events, and others were cheated of medals,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It is entirely understandable that they should be wary about the supposed rehabilitation of offenders.&#8221;</p>		</div>

The ruling party’s claim to legitimacy has its roots in Kim Il Sung’s fight against Korea’s Japanese colonisers and for years the North’s official propaganda has promoted Kim Jong Un’s resemblance to his grandfather, in appearance, manner, and even handwriting.</p><p>But in another departure from normal practice, there appeared to be no outsize basket from Kim before the two men’s giant statues in Pyongyang on Wednesday, when citizens attended to bow before them.</p><p>“This could be part of North Korea’s propaganda effort to distance Kim Jong Un from his grandfather’s and his father’s legacy and highlight his achievements, for what they are,” said Rachel Lee, a former North Korea analyst in the US government.</p><p>Kim has presided over four of the North’s six nuclear tests and overseen a rapid advance in its weapons technology, developing missiles capable of reaching the entire US mainland.</p><p>That has seen his country subjected to multiple UN Security Council sanctions as a result.</p><p>Since 2018, he has taken part in a series of summits with US President Donald Trump and the South’s leader Moon Jae-in, although talks with Washington are currently deadlocked.</p><p>Kim last appeared in state media at the weekend, when he presided over a meeting of the Workers’ Party political bureau on Saturday.</p><p>Lee played down the possibility of his absence being related to coronavirus concerns, saying he had been “quite active in recent weeks”.</p><p>Pyongyang has imposed strict restrictions to try to avoid the disease that emerged in neighbouring China and has since swept the world, at times quarantining thousands of citizens and hundreds of foreigners.</p><p>It insists it has not had a single case, although observers have expressed scepticism.</p></article>

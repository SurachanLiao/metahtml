I think it has something to do with the fact that picture books and video games excel at telling stories from a particular vantage point. It's all a matter of zoom. Their often limited storytelling space privileges 'Big Ideas' over, say, the intricate portraits of life that novels make possible. Perhaps my favourite example of this is Journey - the title alone invokes an aggregate perspective on life. It presents a tale shorn of life's details, a wordless experience where bodies are concealed beneath robes. In Aaron Becker's book of the same name, a girl uses a crayon to draw a door into another world. Becker's Journey is also wordless, and even features a silent encounter with a secondary character who becomes an unexpected source of companionship. It seems that when we tell stories at this altitude, certain ideas crop up time and time again. &#8230; <a href="https://www.gamemax.info/2020/05/picture-books-and-video-games-a-backdoor-into-childhood/" class="more-link">[Read more...] <span class="screen-reader-text">about Picture books and video games: a backdoor into&#160;childhood</span></a></p></article><article class="post-74080569 post type-post status-publish format-standard entry"><p>So what happened with Halo 2? The post first goes through the general steps of finding and fixing a bug, and how every department in a big game studio plays a role. That includes the community team, who interact with players and gather information about reported issues, a dedicated support team that takes reported issues and analyzes them, quality assurance testers, design, production, and engineering. It takes a whole lot of people and a remarkably complex process to nail down a bug and fix it. &#8230; <a href="https://www.gamemax.info/2020/05/halo-community-update-tracks-the-obscure-cause-of-halo-2-s-worst-launch-bug/" class="more-link">[Read more...] <span class="screen-reader-text">about Halo community update tracks the obscure cause of Halo 2&#8217;s worst launch bug</span></a></p></article><article class="post-74086593 post type-post status-publish format-standard entry"><p>343 have kept a staggering pace in porting the old Halos, with a brief snapshot at Halo 3 and ODST running on PC coming before even Halo 2 Anniversary&#8217;s release earlier this month. So, while there&#8217;s no mention of the jazzy, Nathan Fillon-fronted spin-off in this week&#8217;s post, it&#8217;s not too shocking that there are already plans to roll out the trilogy&#8217;s closing act. Posting in a development update this week, 343 laid out their plans for Halo 3 flighting (testing) within the &#8220;first half&#8221; of June. &#8230; <a href="https://www.gamemax.info/2020/05/halo-3-makes-its-pc-debut-with-limited-testing-next-month/" class="more-link">[Read more...] <span class="screen-reader-text">about Halo 3 makes its PC debut with limited testing next&#160;month</span></a></p></article><article class="post-74092362 post type-post status-publish format-standard entry"><p>In case there was any doubt, Baldur's Gate 3's new sizzle reel confirms rooms full of fire &#8230; <a href="https://www.gamemax.info/2020/05/play-half-life-alyx-as-a-more-traditional-shooter-in-this-vr-free-mod/" class="more-link">[Read more...] <span class="screen-reader-text">about Play Half-Life: Alyx as a more traditional shooter in this VR-free&#160;mod</span></a></p></article><article class="post-74092368 post type-post status-publish format-standard entry"><p>The playlist update comes alongside a double XP, double weapon XP and 2X tier progression weekend.

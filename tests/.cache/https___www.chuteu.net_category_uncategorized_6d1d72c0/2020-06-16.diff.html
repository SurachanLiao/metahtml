Baseball America reported earlier this week that the Dodgers will continue to pay their minor leaguers $400 per week past May 31, but it is unclear how long such payments would go. Even if one were to assume that the payments will continue throughout the month of June, however, it‚Äôs worth noting that $400 a week is not a substantial amount of money for players to live on, on which to support families, and on which to train and remain ready to play baseball if and when they are asked to return. ‚Ä¶ <a href="https://www.chuteu.net/2020/05/report-david-price-to-pay-each-dodgers-minor-leaguer-1000-out-of-his-own-pocket/" class="more-link">[Read more...] <span class="screen-reader-text">about Report: David Price to pay each Dodgers minor leaguer $1,000 out of his own pocket</span></a></p></article> <article class="post-74021910 post type-post status-publish format-standard entry"><p><ins>The NBA will reportedly hold the draft after the season. The season reportedly could extend into October. Obviously, not all of these things can be correct. Even within this report. It‚Äôs nearly impossible to envision the draft being 5-7 days after the Finals and after free agency. That‚Äôd almost certainly be too soon to open free agency. ‚Ä¶ <a href="https://www.chuteu.net/2020/05/report-nba-owners-to-discuss-moving-free-agency-ahead-of-draft/" class="more-link">[Read more...] <span class="screen-reader-text">about Report: NBA owners to discuss moving free agency ahead of draft</span> Link: https://www.chuteu.net/2020/05/report-nba-owners-to-discuss-moving-free-agency-ahead-of-draft/ </a></ins></p></article><article class="post-74021913 post type-post status-publish format-standard entry"><p><ins>Michael Jordan claimed he ate an entire pizza himself the night before Game 5 of the 1997 NBA Finals and got food poisoning.

   <div class="newssum">Our burly driver in the baseball cap kept his eyes on the road as my unfailingly suave guide, Ali, chatted away. We'd barely left the holy metropolis of Mashhad, in northeastern Iran, on our way to the small, ancient town of Tus, and already Ali was discoursing on flowers and mystics and philosophers and empire. Other than a quick hello, our driver, perhaps 60, said not a word.

   <div class="newssum">The pandemic and its consequential economic damages may deliver the final blow to many private companies in Iran. However, the private sector is capable of bouncing back and building a sustainable ecosystem if the government eases bureaucracy, including the unnecessary involvement of numerous parallel regulatory bodies belonging to the Justice Ministry, Intelligence Ministry, and the Culture and Islamic Guidance in every aspect of business. Another huge boon would come if the US sanctions are lifted, as they are equally responsible for depressing Iranian businesses and hurting the welfare of ordinary Iranians. -Mohsen Tavakol, Atlantic Council 6/26/20</div>

   <div class="newssum">In 2017, Donald Trump inherited a better position on Iran than any U.S. President over the last four decades, with Iran's nuclear program restrained and an opportunity to build on a historic diplomatic accord. More than two years after Trump threw out the successful diplomatic playbook in favor of so-called &#34;maximum pressure,&#34; it is clear that a Biden administration would inherit a far worse scenario. Under Trump, the U.S. and Iran have only narrowly avoided all-out war on two occasions, Iran's nuclear program is expanding, and Iranian hardliners are exerting increasing control over policy in Tehran. If elected, Biden would need to immediately shift course. -Jamal Abdi & Ryan Costello, Responsible Statecraft 6/24/20</div>

   <div class="newssum">Webinar on Wednesday, June 24, 2020: Since President Trump withdrew from and violated the Iran nuclear deal, tensions with Iran have risen dramatically. The U.S. and Iran have moved to the edge of war twice in the past year, including in January following the airstrike that killed Iranian General Qassem Soleimani. Iran has halted compliance with limits under the nuclear accord, and hardliners have increasingly exerted control over Iranian policy. Still, the framework of the nuclear accord remains intact, and the presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden has pledged to return the U.S. to compliance if Iran does the same. -NIAC 6/22/20</div>

As the virus spread, though, governments elsewhere also proved slow to grasp the threat and other leaders fell ill or were exposed to the virus. Yet the Islamic Republic remains unique in one way: It's dealing with the pandemic while under some of the most damaging sanctions in history, and is trying to leverage the crisis to get them lifted. -Marc Champion & Golnar Motevalli, Bloomberg 6/15/20</div>

   <div class="newssum">Near Eastern thinkers, perhaps as early as al-Ja&#7717;i&#7827;, the eighth century Arab writer and polemicist, have commented on the problem of literary translation, particularly concerning poetry. While al-Ja&#7717;i&#7827; points to broad challenges encountered in translating lyrical poetry, he gives more weight to translation as an end result, characterized by various layers of loss consequent to this linguistic transfer. One implication of reading translation merely as a product is to indict translation as an intellectual enterprise-as often has been done-and place it within the reductionist model of &#34;betrayal&#34; versus &#34;faithfulness.&#34; -Aria Fani, Ajam 5/27/20</div>

   <div class="newssum">Iranian surrealist painter Iran Darrudi has asked her countrymen to share their love of their homeland. Speaking to the Iran-France Friendship Association in an online interview on last Wednesday, the 83-year-old Darrudi said, &#34;Unfortunately, Iran and its history has been consigned to oblivion. However, we cannot deny our identity; we are Iranian and the history shows that this land has been the founder of the world's culture.&#34; 5/11/20</div>

   <div class="newssum">Just a few days after Iran announced its first deaths from COVID-19 in February, the Trump administration's Special Envoy for Iran Brian Hook was asked during a briefing for an update on the Swiss Humanitarian Trade Arrangement (SHTA), a payments channel intended to ease the sale of medicine and medical devices by Swiss companies to Iran. Hook acknowledged that no further transactions had been processed since a pilot transaction involving a $2.55 million sale of medication a month earlier, but insisted that there were &#34;more transactions coming.&#34;Two months later, over 6,000 Iranians have lost their lives to COVID-19, and the Swiss channel has yet to process any further transactions. -Esfandyar Batmanghelidj & Image of Sahil Shah, European Leadership Network 5/6/20</div>

   <div class="newssum">THE SHAMELIS ARE an extraordinarily tight-knit Iranian family. Forty-year-old Amin, the eldest of five brothers, first arrived in California in 2003, and was followed slowly but surely by his parents and siblings. All of them, that is, except for Masoud, who for a decade now has been trying to join the rest of his family in the United States. The situation had been looking hopeful, until the global coronavirus pandemic and a couple strokes of the U.S. president's pen blew it all up. -Felipe De La Hoz, Intercept 4/30/20</div>

Bakhtiari nomads regard such stone statues, locally called 'Bard Shirs' as a symbol of bravery, valor, and characteristics like adroitness at hunting and shooting in war as well as horseback riding on top of the gravestone of that group of people. -Alireza Mohammadi 4/29/20</div>

The &#34;urgent appeal&#34; came in the form of an open letter sent by the groups to Trump, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin calling for curtailing the sanctions regime for the duration of the pandemic. -Common Dreams 04/24/20</div>

This renowned Persian poet died at age 81 in 1020, more than five centuries before Shakespeare was born. Ferdowsi has not only endured for a thousand years but has also defined the very identity and language of his own country - Iran. This is, indeed, a great achievement for a poet or for any person, for that matter. -Rasoul Shams 01/13/20</div>

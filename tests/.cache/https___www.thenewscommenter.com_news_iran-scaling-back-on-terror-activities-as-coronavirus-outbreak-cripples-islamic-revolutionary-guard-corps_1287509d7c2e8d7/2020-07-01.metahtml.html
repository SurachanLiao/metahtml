Recent satellite images show regime authorities digging up mass graves to bury victims some 80 miles south of the capital Tehran.</p>
<p>Iran is &#8220;scaling back&#8221; on terrorist activities in the Middle East due to coronavirus outbreak, the Israel Defense Forces indicated on Monday.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are countries who have gotten it way worse than us with this corona[virus] story, and as a result their activities are at a slower pace,&#8221; IDF Spokesman Hidai Zilberman told reporters without naming Iran.</p>
<p>The confirmation comes amid reports of senior commanders of Iran&#8217;s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), the regime&#8217;s military arm, and the pro-Iranian Lebanese terror militia Hezbollah contracting the virus.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hezbollah members were reportedly infected with the highly transmissible contagion after coming into contact with affected Iranian military officials during a meeting in Beirut last week,&#8221; Israel broadcaster i24News reported.</p>

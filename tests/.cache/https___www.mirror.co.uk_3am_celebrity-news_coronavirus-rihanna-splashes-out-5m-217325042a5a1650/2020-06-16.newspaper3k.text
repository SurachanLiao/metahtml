Rihanna has very generously donated $5million to help fund people on the frontline working to tackle coronavirus.

The Barbadian pop princess' Clara Lionel Foundation announced it will donate $5million to COVID-19 relief efforts.

The huge sum of cash will help communities have medical supplies and equipment as well as access to food across multiple regions, according to the CLF Twitter account.

She's also pledged the money to help the elderly in the US and supporting testing and care facilities in Haiti and Malawi.

Work songstress RiRi set up the non-profit organisation in 2012 in honour of her grandparents Clara and Lionel Braithwaite.

Her website states their aim to develop a vaccine for the killer bug as well as other therapies offered by the foundation in times of need.

CLF's executive director Justine Lucas told TMZ : "Never has it been more important or urgent to protect and prepare marginalized and underserved communities - those who will be hit hardest by this pandemic."

The foundation was primarily formed to improve emergency response programs around the world.

Rihanna's donation has been a huge positive as the global coronavirus pandemic continues to bite.

The UK has seen 233 deaths after a further 53 people had died in England after testing positive for the deadly virus.

Two people have died in Wales and one person has died in Scotland.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson has shut all pubs, nightclubs, bars, restaurants and gyms in order to crackdown on the serious virus.

The global death toll continued to rise with further increases across Spain, Belgium, Germany and Iran and other countries struggling to control the virus.

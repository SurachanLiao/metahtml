Rep. Dan Crenshaw’s (R-TX) life experiences as a Navy SEAL, a Harvard graduate, and an elected member of the House of Representatives serve as the foundation for his new book Fortitude: American Resilience in the Era of Outrage. The book is both biographical and a guide to fighting life’s battles with integrity rather than outrage.

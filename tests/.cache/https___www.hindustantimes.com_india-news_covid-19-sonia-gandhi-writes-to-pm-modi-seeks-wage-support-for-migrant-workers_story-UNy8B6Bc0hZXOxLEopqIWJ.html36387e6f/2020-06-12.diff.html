As the second-largest employer in India, over 44 million construction workers are now faced with a precarious future. Many are stranded in cities and are deprived of their livelihoods due to stringent lockdown measures,” she wrote in her letter to the Prime Minister.</p><p>She referred to the Building and Other Construction Workers (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service) Act, 1996 that provides for various welfare measures for workers and the constitution of state welfare boards and welfare fund.</p><p>“It is reported that the welfare boards collected cess amounting to Rs 49,688.07 crore till March 31, 2019. However, only an amount of Rs 19,379.922 crore had been spent,” said Gandhi, who is also the chairperson of the Congress parliamentary party (CPP).</p><p>She said Canada and several other countries have announced wage subsidy measures as part of their Covid-19 economic response plan.</p><p>More than 600 districts have been placed under lockdown in an effort to stop the coronavirus disease or Covid-19 that has afflicted nearly 500 across India. </p><p>Commercial airlines have been grounded, passenger trains stopped and state governments have also severely curtailed the movement of people except to maintain the supply line of essential commodities services.</p> <p class="subscribed-successfully"><ins><span class="msg">Thank you for subscribing to our daily newsletter.</span> </ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="columnHead mb30"><ins>tags

    Flooding in Somalia raises concern about cholera in the midst of the COVID-19 outbreak
	</h3>
	
<p>14 May 2020 &#226;&#128;&#147; While Somalia deals with one of the world's biggest public health threats from COVID-19, which has so far claimed 52 lives in the country and infected 1219 people in less than 2 months, the country is also facing floods in the north that have killed 24 people and affected over 700 000 people in 24 districts. The flood has also displaced almost 283 000 people. Although all the 6 states have been affected by this flash flood, 3 states &#226;&#128;&#147; Hirshabelle, Jubaland, Southwest and Puntland states &#226;&#128;&#147; are worst affected. The flooding resulted from a sharp rise in the level of the Shabelle river following heavy and incessant rains in Somalia and Ethiopian highlands, which started in late April. As of 10 May, water levels reached 7.93 metres, which are 0.37 metres below the bank's full level of 8.30 metres.</p>

    WHO, IOM raise concern over COVID-19 discrimination against migrants in Yemen
	</h3>
	
<p>10 May 2020 Cairo &#226;&#128;&#147; COVID-19&#226;&#128;&#153;s presence in Yemen was officially confirmed on 10 April. Nearly a month later, Sana&#226;&#128;&#153;a city&#226;&#128;&#153;s first case was announced, that of a Somali refugee. Migrants in the country are being stigmatized as &#226;&#128;&#156;transmitters of disease&#226;&#128;&#157;. Xenophobia and scapegoating campaigns are leading to retaliation against these vulnerable communities, including physical and verbal harassment, forced quarantine, denial of access to health services, movement restrictions, and forced movements to frontline and desert areas, leaving them stranded without food, water and essential services.</p>

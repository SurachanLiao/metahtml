	</h3> <p>14 May 2020 â While Somalia deals with one of the world's biggest public health threats from COVID-19, which has so far claimed 52 lives in the country and infected 1219 people in less than 2 months, the country is also facing floods in the north that have killed 24 people and affected over 700 000 people in 24 districts. The flood has also displaced almost 283 000 people. Although all the 6 states have been affected by this flash flood, 3 states â Hirshabelle, Jubaland, Southwest and Puntland states â are worst affected. The flooding resulted from a sharp rise in the level of the Shabelle river following heavy and incessant rains in Somalia and Ethiopian highlands, which started in late April. As of 10 May, water levels reached 7.93 metres, which are 0.37 metres below the bank's full level of 8.30 metres.</p> <ul class="list"><li><ins><a class="link_external" href="http://www.emro.who.int/somalia/news/somalia-deals-with-flooding-in-the-midst-of-the-covid-19-outbreak-raising-concern-about-an-upsurge-in-cholera-cases.html" target="_new">Read more Link: http://www.emro.who.int/somalia/news/somalia-deals-with-flooding-in-the-midst-of-the-covid-19-outbreak-raising-concern-about-an-upsurge-in-cholera-cases.html </a></ins></li><li><ins><a href="/emergencies/crises/som/en/">More information on Somalia Link: /emergencies/crises/som/en/ </a></ins></li><ins> </ins></ul><ins> </ins><p class="image_credit"><ins>WHO/Somalia</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="inlay_small_color"><ins></ins></p><h3 class="teaser_headline"><ins>WHO, IOM raise concern over COVID-19 discrimination against migrants in Yemen

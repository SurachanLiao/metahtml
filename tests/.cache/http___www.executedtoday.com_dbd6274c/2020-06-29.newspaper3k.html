		<p>On this date in 1938, Zionist terrorist Shlomo Ben-Yosef was hanged by the British.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.executedtoday.com/images/Shlomo_Ben-Yosef.jpg" align="right"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shlomo_Ben-Yosef">Shalom Tabachnik</a> &#8212; to use the name he had from his childhood in the Polish/Russian marches &#8212; emigrated illegally to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_Palestine">British Mandate Palestine</a> and joined the <a href="http://www.executedtoday.com/2008/02/12/1942-avraham-stern/">Irgun</a>.</p>
<p>On April 21, 1938, he and two comrades ambushed an Arab bus and despite failing in their attempt to commit mass murder by forcing it off a mountain road into a chasm, they were tried under British security regulations; one man was acquitted and another death-sentenced but commuted owing to his youth, leaving Shlomo the honor &#8212; for so he insisted of his patriotic martyrdom &#8212; of being the first Jew hanged by the British authorities in Mandatory Palestine.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not be discouraged by my death,&#8221; he <a href="https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=883&amp;dat=19380708&amp;id=cOFOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=XUwDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5226,1762767">wrote to friends</a>. &#8220;It will bring a step nearer the dream of our life &#8212; an independent Jewish state.&#8221;</p>
<p>His death was met by <a href="https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&amp;dat=19380630&amp;id=dzQ1AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=J6YLAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5104,4939600">heavy Jewish protest</a>, and the British officer who hanged him was eventually (in 1942) assassinated in reprisal. Present-day Israel has a number of streets bearing his name.</p>

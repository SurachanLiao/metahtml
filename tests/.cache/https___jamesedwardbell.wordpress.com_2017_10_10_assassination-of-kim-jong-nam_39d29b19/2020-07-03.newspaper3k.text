I just recently read an article on abcnews.go.com , about the assassination of Kim Jong Nam, the half brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in a Malaysian airport. Two Vietnamese women attacked Kim with VX Nerve Agent on their hands and clothing effectively administering a lethal enough dose to prove fatal.

It was very surprising to me that the article stated that experts believe that the murder could somehow be connected to Kim Jong Un feeling that his rule was threatened, and that the lawyers of the two females claim that they believed they were tricked by North Korean Agents and told they were performing a prank on a Hidden Camera TV show.

News outlet, Malaysian Digest recently tweeted about the beginning of the murder trial for the two women.

These women face the death penalty if convicted, so if there is foul play by the North Korean government involved their defense lawyer will have to build a strong case. My reflection on the case so far is that they will have a difficult time doing this because of airport footage that appears to show them “practicing” 2 days before the murder.

I remember briefly hearing about the assassination in February when it occurred, but did not know about the possible involvement of North Korean Agents and Kim Jong Un, or that Kim Jong Nam was estranged to the rest of the family. My interest was now peaked with the possibility of the murder possibly being a set up.

This article for me provided an update on the case, and describe in detail how Kim had 1.4 times the lethal dosage on his face according to Raja Subramaniam who is the head of the Center of Chemical Weapons Analysis in Malaysia. As the trial develops I hope to stay informed and see what the court decides.

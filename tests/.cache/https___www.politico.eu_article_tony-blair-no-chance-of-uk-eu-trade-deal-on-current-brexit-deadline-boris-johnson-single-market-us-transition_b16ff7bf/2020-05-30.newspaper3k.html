                        <h1>Tony Blair: &#8216;No chance&#8217; of UK-EU trade deal on current deadline</h1>

    <p>LONDON &#8212; There is &#8220;no chance&#8221; of the U.K. and the EU concluding a trade deal by the end of 2020 that does not include membership of the single market, according to Tony Blair.</p>
<p>The former U.K. prime minister also said agreeing a trade deal with the United States &#8220;is going to be very difficult&#8221; for Britain.</p><p class="ad-wrapper">
	 
</p>
<p>He made the comments after current PM Boris Johnson vowed to secure a trade deal with the EU by the end of the Brexit transition period and <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/johnson-rejects-case-for-brexit-extension/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">without an extension</a>, meaning a December 2020 deadline.</p>
<p>Speaking at&#160;<a href="https://twitter.com/Reuters/status/1198889654281359362" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Reuters event</a> in London on Monday, Blair argued: &#8220;What has become apparent in the last weeks is that this negotiation has no chance of being concluded in that transition period. None.</p>
<p>&#8220;Except in circumstances where, as Boris Johnson effectively did in respect of Northern Ireland, we concede that Britain stays in the trading system of Europe, the single market.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>The former U.K. prime minister said agreeing a trade deal with the United States &#8220;is going to be very difficult&#8221; for Britain.</p></blockquote>
<p>Blair argued the EU would not allow a neighboring country to diverge from its rules and become a competitor while maintaining continued access to its markets and potentially undermining them.</p>
<p>Johnson and U.S. President Donald Trump have also insisted a transatlantic trade deal can be negotiated quickly, and striking a pact with America has become a central drive of the British government.</p><p>But Blair said U.S. politics was &#8220;deeply divided&#8221; and a trade agreement might struggle to pass Congress. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t hold your breath on a United States-U.K. trade deal. I think it&#8217;s going to be very difficult.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Blair said either a Labour majority or a Conservative majority would be a bad outcome for Britain in the ongoing general election, and advocated tactical voting &#8212; although he insisted he would vote Labour.</p><p class="ad-wrapper">
	 
</p>
<p>&#8220;The truth is: the public aren't convinced either main party deserve to win this election outright,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They're peddling two sets of fantasies; and both, as majority governments, pose a risk it would be unwise for the country to take.&#8221;</p>

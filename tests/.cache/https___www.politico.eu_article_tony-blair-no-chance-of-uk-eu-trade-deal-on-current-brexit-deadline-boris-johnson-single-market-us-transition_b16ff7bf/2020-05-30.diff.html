None.</p> <p>“Except in circumstances where, as Boris Johnson effectively did in respect of Northern Ireland, we concede that Britain stays in the trading system of Europe, the single market.”</p> <blockquote><p>The former U.K. prime minister said agreeing a trade deal with the United States “is going to be very difficult” for Britain.</p></blockquote> <p>Blair argued the EU would not allow a neighboring country to diverge from its rules and become a competitor while maintaining continued access to its markets and potentially undermining them.</p> <p>Johnson and U.S. President Donald Trump have also insisted a transatlantic trade deal can be negotiated quickly, and striking a pact with America has become a central drive of the British government.</p> <p>But Blair said U.S. politics was “deeply divided” and a trade agreement might struggle to pass Congress. “I wouldn’t hold your breath on a United States-U.K. trade deal. I think it’s going to be very difficult.”</p> <p>Elsewhere, Blair said either a Labour majority or a Conservative majority would be a bad outcome for Britain in the ongoing general election, and advocated tactical voting — although he insisted he would vote Labour.</p> <p>“The truth is: the public aren't convinced either main party deserve to win this election outright,” he said. “They're peddling two sets of fantasies; and both, as majority governments, pose a risk it would be unwise for the country to take.”</p> <h3>UK NATIONAL PARLIAMENT ELECTION POLL OF POLLS</h3> <p class="plot-trend-control pop-no-link-check"><ins><a href="#" class="" target="_blank">All					 Link: # </a> <a href="#" class="" target="_blank">2 Years					 Link: # </a> <a href="#" class="active" target="_blank">1 Year					 Link: # </a> <a href="#" class="" target="_blank">6 Months					 Link: # </a> <a href="#" class="active" target="_blank">Kalman Smooth Link: # </a> <a href="#" class="" target="_blank">Kalman Link: # </a> </ins></p> <p>For more polling data from across Europe visit <a href="https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/"><span>POLITICO</span></a><a href="https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/">Poll of Polls</a>.</p> <p class="footer-branding"><ins></ins></p><h2><ins><a href="/" title="Home"><span class="icon-text">More on POLITICO</span> Link: / </a></ins></h2><ins> </ins><p class="copyright"><ins>© 2020 POLITICO SPRL</ins></p><ul class="legal-links"><li><ins><a href="/terms-conditions">Terms of Service Link: /terms-conditions </a></ins></li><ins> </ins><li><ins><a href="/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy Link: /privacy-policy </a></ins></li><ins> </ins></ul><h3><ins>Log In</ins></h3><p><ins>Log in to access content and manage your profile.

Last week, Malaysian prosecutors wrapped up their case against Indonesia’s Siti Aisyah, 25, and Vietnam’s Doan Thi Huong, 29.

The ditzy duo were busted for the brazen assassination of Kim Jong Nam at Kuala Lumpur’s busy airport on Feb. 13, 2017.

Aisyah and Huang are accused of smearing VX nerve agent on Kim’s face at the behest of North Korean intelligence operatives who fled Malaysia.

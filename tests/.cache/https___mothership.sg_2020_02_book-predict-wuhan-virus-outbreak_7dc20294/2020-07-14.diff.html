</p> <p>When Donald Trump was first elected as U.S. President, screengrabs of aÂ Simpsons episode seemingly predicting his presidency were widely circulated online.
</p><p>And now, given that the world is seized by the novel coronavirus, yet another strange parallel has emerged.
</p><p>This time, with a thriller fiction novel by Dean Koontz.
</p><h2>"Wuhan-400" bioweapon</h2> <p>Some photos of Koontz'sÂ Eyes of Darkness have been circulating on Facebook because it mentions a virus called "Wuhan-400".
</p><p>Here's a photo of a page that mentions it:
</p><p>A quick search in <a href="https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=EdKNU1DzdbcC&amp;pg=PT261&amp;dq=wuhan-400&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwif2LWc0djnAhUdyzgGHcOWAXYQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=wuhan-400&amp;f=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Books</a> also yields a portion of the same page:
</p> <p><del><img src="https://static.mothership.sg/1/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-18-at-09.45.00.png" alt="" width="666" height="656" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-446271"> </del></p> <p>The book is about a mother's search for her son that takes her to a military facility where he is held after being accidentally contaminated by micro-organisms from a Wuhan lab.
</p><p>In the book, a Chinese scientist defected to the U.S. with a diskette containing records of Wuhan-400.
</p><p>Wuhan-400 is said to afflict only human beings, and could be used to "wipe out a city of a country".
</p><p>The virus is described to be a bioweapon developed in a lab just outside of the city of Wuhan -- incidentally, the Wuhan Institute of Virology is a real laboratory in Wuhan that exists just outside Wuhan city.
</p><p>Unlike the novel coronavirus, Wuhan-400 has a 100 per cent fatality rate and a remarkably short incubation period of four hours (Covid-19, however has a fatality rate of around 0.2 per cent outside of the Hubei province and an incubation period of two to 14 days).
</p><h2>Previously Gorki-400?</h2> <p>The book was first published in 1981.
</p><p>However, it appears that its earlier versions did not mention "Wuhan-400".
</p><p>Instead, earlier versions of the book that called the virus "Gorki-400" instead, with the bioweapon being developed by Russian, and not Chinese, scientists.
</p><p>It is unclear when exactly this change took place, but it has been suggested that it was revised in the 1990s.
</p> <h2>Coincidences like these not uncommon</h2> <p>Such parallels between fact and fiction can be quite creepy, but such "predictions" aren't actually that uncommon.
</p><p>Hong Kong crime author Chan Ho-kei toldÂ <a href="https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/arts-culture/article/3050481/virus-called-wuhan-400-makes-people-terribly-ill-dean-koontz" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">South China Morning Post</a> that "you can spot prophecies for almost all events".
</p><p>Basically, if you make enough predictions, there are some that are bound to come to pass and have some kind of truth in it.
</p><p>And given the wealth of fictitious stories out there, it is perhaps unsurprising that some stories end up reflecting some kind of "prediction" of future realities.
</p><p>Chan added, âThe probability is low, but not impossible.â

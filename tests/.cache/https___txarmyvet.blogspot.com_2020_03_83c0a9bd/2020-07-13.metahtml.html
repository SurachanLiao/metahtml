The 49-year-old&#160;brother of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced in a tweet Tuesday he tested positive for&#160;COVID-19 after being exposed to people who are infected.&#160;Cuomo has extensively covered&#160;the coronavirus pandemic on the cable news network during his show &#8220;Cuomo Prime Time.&#8221; 
"Sooooo in these difficult times that seem to get more difficult and complicated by the day, I just found out that I am positive for coronavirus. I have been exposed to people in recent days who have subsequently tested positive and I had fever, chills and shortness of breath," Cuomo wrote. 
"I just hope I didn't give it to the kids and Cristina. That would make me feel worse&#160; </p><p> <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2020/03/31/chris-cuomo-tests-positive-coronavirus-covid-19/5094751002/">https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2020/03/31/chris-cuomo-tests-positive-coronavirus-covid-19/5094751002/</a> </p><p> <a href="https://t.co/e9Ym9jeT2R">pic.twitter.com/e9Ym9jeT2R</a>

President Trump called-out CNN White House Correspondent Jim Acosta Monday during a fiery press briefing in Washington, DC; telling the journalist he&#8217;s trying to &#8220;keep the country calm&#8221; despite his &#8220;snarky and nasty questions.&#8221; 
&#8220;What do you have to say to Americans who are upset with you&#8230; That you&#8217;ve downplayed this crisis over the last couple of months&#8230; What do you say to Americans who believe you&#8217;ve got this wrong?&#8221; asked CNN&#8217;s Jim Acosta. 
&#8220;It will go away&#8230; We&#8217;re going to have a great victory. It&#8217;s people like you and CNN that say things like that. It&#8217;s why people just don&#8217;t want to listen to CNN anymore. You could ask a normal question. I want to keep the country calm. I don&#8217;t want panic in the country,&#8221; said President Trump. 
&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to do that. I want to have our country be calm, and strong, and fight, and win. It&#8217;s incredible the job that all these people are doing. I&#8217;m very proud&#160;.......</p><p><a href="https://hannity.com/media-room/trump-to-acosta-its-people-like-you-that-cause-panic-cnn-should-ask-real-questions/">https://hannity.com/media-room/trump-to-acosta-its-people-like-you-that-cause-panic-cn&#8230;</a>

On Tuesday&#8217;s Mark Levin show, support for individual liberty is dead! Mathematical models are flawed, scientists get things wrong and presuming that Americans wouldn't mitigate on their own is erroneous. Using Italy as an example, or China's approach as a model for mitigation is also inappropriate given how unique the U.S is and the steps they took to mitigate since January. Preparedness is our responsibility. Then, fiscal conservatism is dead! We just passed a stimulus bill that isn't stimulating anything. Printing money only attacks our currency because it prompts inflation and weakens our dollar. We must not sacrifice our liberty to fight any virus &#8212; we will beat the virus and we must keep our liberty. Later, if the Democrats had their way we'd still be conducting an impeachment trial with endless witnesses. Yet the Trump Administration was taking the necessary precautions to safeguard America from the Wuhan Chinese virus. Afterward, it's concerning that a lib&#8230;

Good evening my dear friends.




</p><p>
The following BRILLIANT piece was written, and posted earlier by none other than our wonderful friend, and fellow patriot, <a href="https://disqus.com/by/mbt172/" target="_blank">Keebs</a>. This was naturally posted at her own site, <a href="https://www.keebskorner.com/" target="_blank">Keebs Korner</a>, which I HIGHLY recommend visiting if you've never been there before because it's positively fantastic.&#160; Anyway, with her kind permission I'm reprinting it here, though you can also follow the link at the bottom of the article to her site to read it there if you like.</p><p>
Thank you very much Keebs!</p><p>

I&#8217;m going to preface this thread by saying this is&#160;my own&#160;personal opinion&#160;based on what I have seen and experienced. I&#8217;m not looking for people to agree or disagree with me, but am certainly open to your comments. It's just my own perception of what&#8217;s been taking place here and abroad, and asking the questions that I&#8217;m not sure enough of us are asking. I will be backing up my opinion with some articles, tweets and videos I have encountered. There&#8217;s&#8230;

By Alexander G. Markovsky </p><p>
The resurgence of Joe Biden and the inevitable defeat of Bernie Sanders led the pundits to declare that the Democratic Party is rejecting socialism -- a&#160;development all decent men would celebrate if it were true. Yet, in a supreme irony, the Land of the Free dangerously underestimates or underappreciates the ideological nature of the contemporary Democratic Party. Neither education nor life experience has prepared Americans for grasping the Party&#8217;s epochal ideological shift toward the ideology that signifies the total inversion of the Nation&#8217;s historical traditions and values.</p><p>
Every time the Democratic presidential contenders took the stage, whether it was a radical Bernie Sanders or any of the so-called moderates such as Michael Bloomberg, Elizabeth Warren, Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, or Joe Biden,&#160;a frightening sense of d&#233;j&#224; vu set in as those downsized American replicas of&#160;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Trotsky">Leon Trotsky</a>,&#160;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Bukharin">Nikolai Bukharin</a>,&#160;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clara_Zetkin">Clara Zetkin</a>, and&#160;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosa_Luxemburg">Rosa Luxemburg</a>&#160;clearly profess&#8230;

The Dana Show is an award-winning, #1 rated, daily program featured on stations around the country.</p><p>
Dana&#8217;s original brand of young, punk-rock, conservative irreverence has found a fast-growing multi-media audience. She&#8217;s feisty and fearless without being abrasive and shrill.</p><p>
She connects with younger listeners, while still appealing to the core talk demo.</p><p>
Tune in to&#160;The Dana Show&#160;M-F right here at Tex's Place!

The media freaks out that My Pillow&#8217;s CEO talks about God at the press briefing. Dana discusses the latest models and projections for the virus. Restaurants and businesses are adapting to new sales models. State governments are starting to get authoritarian with their stay-at-home orders. Celebrity culture is being ridiculed for trying to stay relevant.

In these days, we need to reduce our self-imposed panic, paranoia, and hysteria. We will, united, defeat COVID-19 and restore our Republic. But, we should begin, now, to ponder what&#160;must&#160;change so that we never find ourselves in this position&#160;ever&#160;again. That means we need to focus on the origin of the coronavirus, Wuhan Province, China. I do not embrace conspiracy theories, and I do not surrender to the premise of coincidences. Why, at this time, did we have this pestilence unleashed from a brutally repressive, communist regime?</p><p>

The relief bill is the largest one-day expansion of government power in U.S. history. </p><p>By Thomas Gallatin </p><p>
As the dust settles following Congress&#8217;s hurried passage of the&#160;<a href="https://patriotpost.us/articles/69507-the-senates-2-dollars-2-cents-trillion-economic-lifeline-2020-03-26">emergency relief package</a>&#160;known as the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, spending details of the 880-page, $2.2 trillion behemoth are now becoming known, and it&#8217;s not a pretty sight. While billions of dollars go for needed virus relief, roughly $600 billion goes into government coffers. It&#8217;s the biggest one-day expansion of government power ever, with the vast majority going to increase the welfare state.</p><p>
It&#8217;s clear that Big Government proponents, especially the Democrats led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi, followed Rahm Emanuel&#8217;s advice and didn&#8217;t let this crisis go to waste. What may be an even greater danger than government expansion is the precedent this crisis action has produced. Now, even more Americans will look first to the government to bail them out of a crisis, costing billions and saddlin&#8230;

Days ago, the U.S. Army sent out an unusual plea to its retired officers and enlisted soldiers: If you served in one of eight high-demand medical specialties, it said, you may be able to "re-join the team" in order to help the service fight the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>
"We need to hear from you STAT!" the message from the Army's head of personnel, Lt. Gen. Thomas Seamands, read.</p><p>
The Army's retirees took that seriously.</p><p>
"We reached out to more than 800,000 retired Soldiers to gauge their willingness to assist with the COVID-19 pandemic response," an Army spokesperson told Military.com Friday. To date, more than 14,000 retirees "representing various specialties" have contacted the service for more information, he said.</p><p>
That comes out to a remarkable response rate of 1.75% -- and that figure may grow considerably. Between Thursday evening and Friday, the pool of respondents increased by 5,000.</p><p>

30 Mar 2020 Military.com|By&#160;<a href="https://www.military.com/author/matthew-cox">Matthew Cox</a> 
The&#160;<a href="http://www.military.com/army" target="_blank">U.S. Army</a>&#160;has suspended its plan to have all soldiers begin taking the new Army Combat&#160;<a href="https://www.military.com/military-fitness">Fitness</a>&#160;Test in October amid widespread gym closures to prevent the spread of the&#160;<a href="https://www.military.com/topics/coronavirus-covid-19">coronavirus</a>. 
Army leaders made the decision late last week to suspend the ACFT start date, as it is unclear when soldiers will have access to the fitness equipment needed to prepare for the more challenging fitness test, Lt. Col. Robin Ochoa told Military.com. 
The Army unveiled its plan to replace the current three-event Army Physical Fitness Test with the six-event ACFT in July 2018, a move that launched a year-long field test involving 60 battalions of soldiers, as well as contract awards for special fitness equipment to administer the new test. The test was set to become a service-wide requirement Oct. 1. 
For now, the official start date has been "suspended until further notice," Ochoa said, explaining that the current APFT "is still the standard so those pas&#8230;

On Monday's Mark Levin Show, state governors have failed us but capitalism has enabled the United States to respond faster than the government could ever have; several large manufacturers have stepped up to produce ventilators, personal protective equipment (PPE) and rapid-results test kits. In fact, the U.S has tested more people than any other country has, as it hit the one million mark today. Then, shame on the critics that blast GM and support a governmental takeover of private industry. It seems the Constitution is something we only apply when it&#8217;s easy. Later, as the fine print of the pork hidden inside the massive stimulus becomes more visible it seems students with no income may be eligible for a $1200 check from the federal government. Afterward, Mark Meckler from the Convention of States movement calls in to discuss the passing of Former Senator Tom Coburn.

Choose life: two simple words that should be rather easy to comprehend, but in these times they seem confusing to some. Here in Texas, we have the organization founded by a white supremacist and racist, Margaret Sanger&#8217;s Planned Parenthood, suing the state of Texas because their clinics were not deemed &#8220;essential.&#8221; Imagine the unthinkable hypocrisy that at a time when we are fighting to save lives, by choosing life, we have an organization wanting to take more lives, innocent lives.

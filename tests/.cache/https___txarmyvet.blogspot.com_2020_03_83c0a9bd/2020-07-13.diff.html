“It will go away… We’re going to have a great victory. It’s people like you and CNN that say things like that. It’s why people just don’t want to listen to CNN anymore. You could ask a normal question. I want to keep the country calm. I don’t want panic in the country,” said President Trump.

Preparedness is our responsibility. Then, fiscal conservatism is dead! We just passed a stimulus bill that isn't stimulating anything. Printing money only attacks our currency because it prompts inflation and weakens our dollar. We must not sacrifice our liberty to fight any virus — we will beat the virus and we must keep our liberty. Later, if the Democrats had their way we'd still be conducting an impeachment trial with endless witnesses.

Army leaders made the decision late last week to suspend the ACFT start date, as it is unclear when soldiers will have access to the fitness equipment needed to prepare for the more challenging fitness test, Lt. Col. Robin Ochoa told Military.com. 
The Army unveiled its plan to replace the current three-event Army Physical Fitness Test with the six-event ACFT in July 2018, a move that launched a year-long field test involving 60 battalions of soldiers, as well as contract awards for special fitness equipment to administer the new test. The test was set to become a service-wide requirement Oct. 1. 
For now, the official start date has been "suspended until further notice," Ochoa said, explaining that the current APFT "is still the standard so those pas…

In fact, the U.S has tested more people than any other country has, as it hit the one million mark today. Then, shame on the critics that blast GM and support a governmental takeover of private industry. It seems the Constitution is something we only apply when it’s easy. Later, as the fine print of the pork hidden inside the massive stimulus becomes more visible it seems students with no income may be eligible for a $1200 check from the federal government. Afterward, Mark Meckler from the Convention of States movement calls in to discuss the passing of Former Senator Tom Coburn.

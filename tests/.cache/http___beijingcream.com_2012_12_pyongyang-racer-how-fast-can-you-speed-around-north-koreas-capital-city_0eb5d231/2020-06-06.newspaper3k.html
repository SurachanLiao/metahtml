<p>Our friends at Koryo Tours have posted an online game called <a href="http://www.koryogroup.com/Pyongyang_racer/racer.html" target="_blank">Pyongyang Racer</a>, which they&#8217;re advertising as the &#8220;first computer game out of North Korea&#8221; (is there any reason to disbelieve it?).&#160;Players race around the &#8220;city of willows&#8221; collecting barrels of fuel and avoiding obstacles such as cars. (True to the Pyongyang I <a href="http://heartofbeijing.blogspot.com/2011/09/trip-to-pyongyang-august-27-30.html" target="_blank">visited last summer</a>, there are few vehicles and very, very clean roads.) You&#8217;ll pass the Arch of Triumph (based of Paris&#8217;s Arc de Triomphe, only bigger), the Victory Monument, the (now-complete!) Ryugyong Hotel, and the Juche Tower, the tallest stone structure in the world &#8212; barely eclipsing the Washington Monument.</p>
<p>The game was developed in the DPRK and commissioned by Koryo, the leading Western tour agency for trips into North Korea. If you&#8217;d like to have a polemics-free discussion about the ethics of DPRK tourism, I&#8217;d be happy to meet you in the comments section.</p>
<p>UPDATE, 12/21, 8:20 pm: The company that produced the game is called <a href="http://www.nosotek.com/ABOUT-US/about-us.html" target="_blank">Nosotek</a>.</p>

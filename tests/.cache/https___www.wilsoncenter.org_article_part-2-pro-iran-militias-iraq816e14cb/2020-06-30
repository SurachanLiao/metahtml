<meta name="description" content="Since 2003, Iranian influence has deepened in Iraq through a wide array of Shiite militias. Several militia leaders and politicians spent years in exile in Tehran during Saddam Hussein’s reign in the 1980s and 1990s. One of Iraq’s most powerful armed groups, the Badr Organization, was formed in 1982 by Iraqi exiles to fight Hussein with the support of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). In turn, Tehran has benefited from its longstanding political, military and financial investments in Iraq. Shiite militias have been institutionalized within Iraq’s armed forces; their leaders have also waded deeper into politics." />

For security reasons, only images from the local domain are allowed." height="16" width="16" class="filter-image-invalid" /></p><p>By spring 2015, the PMF had some <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/markaz/2015/05/27/harnessing-militia-power-lessons-of-the-iraqi-national-guard/">60,000</a> fighters. In November 2016, Iraq’s parliament <a href="https://eng-archive.aawsat.com/theaawsat/news-middle-east/iraq-parliament-passes-law-legalizing-pmf">legalized</a> the PMF, a move supported by Shiites but opposed by Sunnis, many of whom boycotted the vote. The law passed with 170 out of 328 possible votes. The PMF “would constitute something that looks like Iran’s Revolutionary Guard,” Raad al Dahlaki, a Sunni lawmaker, <a href="https://eng-archive.aawsat.com/theaawsat/news-middle-east/iraq-parliament-passes-law-legalizing-pmf">warned</a>. By early 2018, estimates of its strength <a href="https://www.iraqinews.com/features/mp-iraqs-2018-budget-excludes-30-000-mobilization-fighters-payroll/">ranged</a> from under 100,000 to up to 150,000. Not all fighters were registered with the PMF.</p><p>Shiite militias have formed the majority of the PMF <a href="http://rawabetcenter.com/en/?p=1037">brigades</a>, which also include Sunnis, Christians, and Turkmen. The Shiite groups fell into roughly three categories. The first includes militias that have received arms, training and financing from Tehran. Some have pledged allegiance to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The second category includes militias loyal to Grand Ayatollah Sistani. A third category is represented by Saraya al Salam, or the Peace Brigades. It is loyal to Muqatada al Sadr, another Iraqi cleric who has connections to Tehran. The Peace Brigades are the latest incarnation of the Mahdi Army, a militia that received <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/23/world/middleeast/23iran.html?pagewanted=all">weapons</a> from the IRGC and <a href="https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2007/08/mahdi_army_trains_wi.php">training</a> from Iranian and Lebanese Hezbollah <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/14/AR2006081400477.html">agents </a> in the mid-2000s. Many militias are offshoots of the Mahdi Army.</p><p>The PMF played an invaluable role in supplementing Iraq’s armed forces against ISIS, but it has become a source of tension among Iraqis, especially Sunnis and Kurds. “Iranian-backed components frequently seem to pursue their own agenda despite formally reporting to the prime minister,” according to <a href="https://warontherocks.com/2017/12/harnessing-iraqs-deadly-array-armed-groups-isil/">Sarhang Hamasaeed</a>, director of Middle East Programs at the U.S. Institute of Peace. Faleh al Fayadh, Iraq’s national security advisor, is the PMF’s chairman. Abu Mahdi al Muhandis, the deputy commander, has experience leading multiple militias. In October 2017, the PMF constituted the “single biggest danger” to the country’s independence, former U.S. Ambassador to Iraq James Jeffrey <a href="https://www.turkheritage.org/en/events/tho-hosts-panel-on-krg-independence-referendum-and-regional-realities-4753">warned</a>.</p><p>The sectarian nature of Shiite militias has also been a recurring issue. Since 2014, they have set up offices and bases in Sunni <a href="https://warontherocks.com/2017/12/harnessing-iraqs-deadly-array-armed-groups-isil/">areas</a>, increasing the risk of sectarian tensions. Watchdogs, such as <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/07/31/iraq-ban-abusive-militias-mosul-operation">Human Rights Watch</a> and <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/press-releases/2017/01/iraq-end-irresponsible-arms-transfers-fuelling-militia-war-crimes/">Amnesty International</a>, have documented serious human rights violations by several militias against Sunni civilians. (All of the militias profiled below have reportedly committed varying degrees of human rights abuses.)</p><p>The dual military and political role of PMF leaders has also been divisive. “If Iraq faces any danger, I will take up arms and defend it regardless of any political position I may hold,” the head of the Iranian-backed Badr Organization, <a href="http://www.almayadeen.net/episodes/868308/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AA%D8%AE%D8%A7%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%A9---%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%82_02-04-2018">Hadi al Amiri</a>, <a href="http://www.mei.edu/content/io/iranian-backed-pmf-leaders-gearing-elections-while-keeping-military-roles">pledged</a> in April 2018.</p><p>Iran has urged Iraq’s government to preserve the PMF despite significant ISIS losses. In mid-2017, Supreme Leader Khamenei told Iraqi Prime Minister Haidar al Abadi not to weaken or disband the PMF under U.S. pressure. “The Americans oppose the Popular Forces because they want Iraq to lose its main pillar of power,” Khamenei <a href="http://www.mei.edu/content/io/khamenei-abadi-don-t-allow-american-troops-iraq-and-keep-popular-forces">said</a>. In March 2018, Abadi issued a <a href="http://www.mei.edu/content/io/iran-backed-militia-groups-will-receive-full-benefits-under-new-government-decree">decree</a> entitling PMF fighters equivalent salaries and benefits as military personnel under the Ministry of Defense, further enshrining the PMF as a distinct entity.</p><p><strong>May 2018 Elections</strong></p><p>Technically, PMF members cannot participate in politics, Abadi <a href="https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2016/07/iraqs-prime-minister-establishes-popular-mobilization-front-as-a-permanent-independent-military-formation.php">declared</a> in Executive Order 91 in February 2016.

Formed in 1982 in Iran to fight Saddam Hussein, it was initially <a href="https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/shiite-militias-and-iraqs-security-forces">funded, trained, equipped</a> and <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/containing-shiite-militias-the-battle-for-stability-in-iraq/">led</a> by the IRGC. It moved back to Iraq after the U.S. invasion in 2003 and integrated into the new Iraqi government. Its forces <a href="https://www.hudson.org/research/13993-the-origins-and-ascendancy-of-iraq-s-shiite-militias">became</a> the largest faction within state security forces, particularly <a href="https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/shiite-militias-and-iraqs-security-forces">the police</a>. It competed in elections; its leaders joined the new government in cabinet positions. But it maintained its militia.</p><p>Between 2003 and 2011, it occasionally <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/iraqs-shia-militias-the-double-edged-sword-against-isis/">fought</a> U.S. forces. It also engaged in sectarian strife with Sunni rivals. After ISIS swept through northern Iraq in 2014, the Badr Organization—as part of the wider Popular Mobilization Forces—<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/containing-shiite-militias-the-battle-for-stability-in-iraq/">cooperated</a> with American military advisers against the Islamic State. It was a pivotal force fighting Islamic extremism among Sunnis between 2014 and 2017. Badr and its affiliates <a href="http://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/_Saddam_Hussein_(222).jpg%20-%20ISF%20PMF%20Orders%20of%20Battle_0_0.pdf">reportedly </a><a href="http://www.aymennjawad.org/2017/10/hashd-brigade-numbers-index">include </a> the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 9th, 10th, 16th, 21st, 22nd, 23rd, 24th, 27th, 30th, 52nd, 55th, and 110th PMF brigades.</p><p>Badr leader Hadi al Amiri attributed the PMF’s success to Iranian support. “We commend the support of the Islamic Republic,” <a href="http://www.rudaw.net/arabic/middleeast/iraq/281020173">said</a> Amiri in 2017. “In the beginning, the international coalition did not support Iraq. It was only the Islamic Republic of Iran that stood with us in the beginning.”</p><p>The Badr Organization has Tehran’s ongoing military support; its political wing also has close ties to Iran. It has fielded at least <a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2014/11/06/breaking-badr/">10,000</a> fighters, with some estimates going as high as <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/in-iraq-u-s-allies-and-enemies-wait-for-trumps-first-move.html">50,000</a>.</p><p><img alt="Image removed." src="/core/misc/icons/e32700/error.svg" title="This image has been removed.

The Badr Organization has <a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2014/11/06/breaking-badr/">sought</a> to expand Shiite power in the security forces, through Iraqi elections, and by containing Sunni movements.</p><p>The Badr logo resembles the IRGC and Lebanese Hezbollah emblems. An AK-47 is superimposed in front of a globe with a map of Iraq.

As leader of a prominent Shiite party, he is also a potential candidate to become a future prime minister of Iraq.</p><p>Amiri has lauded his ties with Tehran. “There’s nothing to hide…We’re neighbors. What are we going to do? We’re not renting Iraq. We can’t just move somewhere else.” He also <a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2014/11/06/breaking-badr/">described</a> Soleimani as a “friend, a good man and a good fighter.” </p><p><strong><img alt="Image removed." src="/core/misc/icons/e32700/error.svg" title="This image has been removed.

Its first generation of fighters fought alongside Iranian forces against Saddam. It continued to receive weapons, training and funding from Iran after the militia returned to Iraq following the U.S. intervention that ousted Saddam in 2003. <a>It initially </a><a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/cfr/international/slot2_060905.html">vowed</a> to disarm, but its death squads staged sectarian attacks on Sunnis from 2004 to 2006.</p><p>Since 2014, the Badr Organization has been one of the largest wings of the PMF, which still coordinate with Iran’s Qods Force. Its role grew among the forces fighting in Tikrit, Fallujah and Mosul. Amiri was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-iraq/iraqi-forces-try-to-seal-off-islamic-state-around-tikrit-idUSKBN0LZ10Q20150303">reportedly</a> one of two Shiite militia leaders coordinating with Qods Force commander Soleimani during the 2015 battle for Tikrit.

In 2007, it <a href="http://www.meri-k.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/PMF-Report-0.2.pdf">rebranded</a> as the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq. ISCI identified as more nationalist and Iraqi; its politicians <a href="http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/should-iraqs-isci-forces-really-be-considered-good-militias">opposed</a> Iran’s belief in the infallible authority of a supreme leader. But the movement fragmented over relations with Iran. In 2012, the Badr Organization—led by Amiri—<a href="http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/should-iraqs-isci-forces-really-be-considered-good-militias">split</a> from the ISCI to preserve ties with Tehran. </p><p>In 2014, Badr emerged as a prominent political party. It <a href="https://www.swp-berlin.org/fileadmin/contents/products/comments/2017C26_sbg.pdf">won</a> 22 seats in the 328-member parliament and joined the ruling coalition government. It has held various cabinet portfolios, including Interior, Human Rights and Transportation.</p><p>With the fight against ISIS waning, the Badr Organization announced the formation of the Fateh Coalition of Iran-backed Shiite movements –<a href="http://www.mei.edu/content/io/iran-s-militia-allies-gearing-iraq-s-parliamentary-elections">including </a> Asaib Ahl al Haq and Kataib Hezbollah—to run in the May 2018 elections.

Five small armed groups united to form this pro-Iran militia in <a href="http://www.kataibhizbollah.com/statment/1170">2007</a>. In 2009, the U.S. State Department <a href="https://www.state.gov/j/ct/rls/other/des/143209.htm">designated</a> it a terrorist organization with an “anti-Western establishment and jihadist ideology.” The Treasury Department <a href="https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/tg195.aspx">sanctioned</a> the group and its leader, Abu Mahdi al Muhandis. It was the only Iraqi Shiite militia designated a terrorist organization by <a href="https://www.state.gov/j/ct/rls/other/des/123085.htm">U.S. State Department</a>.  </p><p>After the 2011 U.S. withdrawal from Iraq, Kataib Hezbollah dispatched fighters to defend the Assad regime in Syria at the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/22/world/middleeast/iran-and-hezbollahs-support-for-syria-complicates-us-strategy-on-peace-talks.html?mtrref=undefined&gwh=25C36171958F86F3D75EC309BA85FA2B&gwt=pay">behest</a> of Soleimani. Kataib Hezbollah joined the PMF and fought the Sunni extremists after ISIS swept through northern Iraq in 2014.

A fist holding an AK-47 rises from a map of Iraq rifle underneath a Quranic <a href="https://quran.com/9/12?translations=20">verse</a>, “Fight the leaders of disbelief, for indeed, there are no oaths [sacred] to them.”</p><p>One of Kataib Hezbollah’s main objectives is to stem the influence of Baathists, the United States, and Sunni groups, such as ISIS. It rejected the return of U.S. forces to advise the Iraqi Army on confronting ISIS. It <a href="https://www.kataibhizbollah.com/statment/2873">accused</a> the United States of planning to reoccupy Iraq, control its wealth and weaken its Islamic identity. “The enemy of humanity, the U.S., can no longer desecrate Iraqi soil, as the fighters of the Hezbollah Brigades will not allow them to do so,” the group <a href="http://www.kurdistan24.net/en/news/582120a4-c8a0-40f1-a652-a9a46a43b926">warned</a> in December 2017. “The Iraqi government and Council of Representatives need to make a decisive decision about the presence of U.S. troops who should voluntarily withdraw before we force them to flee from the country.”</p><p><strong>Leadership: </strong>Born in 1953, Jamal Jaafar Ibrahimi is better known by his nom de guerre Abu Mahdi al Muhandis.

It has called liberating Jerusalem a “sacred goal” and seeks “relentlessly” to end the occupation of “Zionist and Western” entities. “Our adherence to join the PMF came from our love of defending the homeland and the holy sites,” Walai stated in a 2016 interview. One of the Martyrs Brigade’s main goals is to protect Shiite shrines and mosques worldwide, but it is particularly committed to the Zaynab Shrine in Damascus, Syria.</p><p>KSS has also been outspoken against Saudi Arabia.

Walai, the KSS secretary general, <a href="http://ansaar-alwalaey.com/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%88%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A-%D8%AF%D8%AE%D9%88%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%B4%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%B9%D8%A8%D9%8A-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AA%D8%AE%D8%A7%D8%A8/">said</a> the militia had a right to run because it had helped to prevent the collapse of Iraq’s political system.</p><p>In early 2018, the Fatah Coalition formally aligned with Prime Minister Abadi, but Abadi broke away less than 24 hours later. Khazali framed it as a mutual split for political reasons. “We do not allow ourselves to be part of the corruption system and the rotation of some characters who abused Iraq,” Khazali <a href="https://www.eremnews.com/news/arab-world/1154078">said</a>. “The principle of a peaceful transfer of power must be maintained by free and fair elections. Public money and government influence must not be used to buy votes.”</p><p>As of early April 2018, KSS had two representatives running as candidates in the Fatah Coalition. <a href="http://saidshuhada.com/index.php/bayanat/18486.html">Mahdi Ali al Moussawi al Maksousi</a> was running in the Baghdad governorate and current parliament member <a href="http://saidshuhada.com/index.php/bayanat/18483.html">Faleh Khazali</a> in Basra.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Saraya al Salam </strong></p><p>Muqtada Sadr, a fiery cleric, formed Saraya al Salam, or the Peace Brigades, in June 2014 to counter ISIS. Many of its fighters were previously members of Sadr’s infamous Mahdi Army, a militia that targeted U.S. forces and other Iraqi groups in the mid-2000s. The Peace Brigades make up the PMF’s 313th and 314th <a href="http://www.aymennjawad.org/2017/10/hashd-brigade-numbers-index">brigades</a>.  </p><p>The Peace Brigades—and its previous incarnations—have had a rocky relationship with Iran. In 2007, Sadr <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/dec/19/iraq.usa">fled</a> to the Islamic Republic to avoid arrest by U.S. and Iraqi forces; he claimed he was continuing his religious <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/01/05/AR2011010500724.html">studies</a>. In 2008, he <a href="https://www.thenational.ae/world/mena/iraq-s-sadr-suspends-militia-activity-1.515857">ordered</a> the Mahdi Army to suspend operations after bloody battles with Iraqi security forces and rival factions. Sadr returned to Iraq in early 2011. He increasingly cast himself as an Iraqi nationalist interested in mitigating <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/iraq/2013-02-11/back-black">sectarian</a> tensions. He grew increasingly critical of Iran. By 2016, Tehran had cut off much of its <a href="http://carnegie-mec.org/2017/04/28/popular-mobilization-forces-and-iraq-s-future-pub-68810">support</a> for the group, according to a Sadrist official. The group has reportedly funded itself through donations from a large network of mosques.</p><p>After ISIS captured Mosul, Sadr reconstituted the Mahdi Army, as the Peace Brigades. In June 2014, some 50,000 armed men <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iraq/10916926/Iraq-crisis-Baghdads-Shia-militia-in-defiant-50000-strong-rally-as-Isis-make-further-gains.html">paraded</a> through Baghdad in the group’s biggest show of force since 2008.</p><p><img alt="Image removed." src="/core/misc/icons/e32700/error.svg" title="This image has been removed. For security reasons, only images from the local domain are allowed." height="16" width="16" class="filter-image-invalid" /><strong>Doctrine and Goals: </strong>The Peace Brigades espouses a nationalist vision. Many <a href="http://www.sarayasalam.net/2015/09/blog-post_232.html">articles</a> on the group’s website stress unity across sects, ethnicities and classes. Sadr advocates incorporating all PMF militias into the Iraqi army. In an address to his followers in 2017, Sadr <a href="https://www.iraqinews.com/baghdad-politics/sadr-urges-subject-paramilitary-forces-state-control/">called</a> for “placing weapons within the state’s hands exclusively.”  </p><p>The group <a href="http://www.sarayasalam.net/2015/09/blog-post_232.html">draws</a> heavily on the Shiite dogma to fight oppression, with the martyrdom of Imam Hussain as a model. But the Peace Brigades, unlike some other Shiite militias, does not view Khamenei as its spiritual <a href="https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/perspectives/PE100/PE151/RAND_PE151.pdf">leader</a>. Sadr and his followers have <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/12_17_shiite_militias_in_iraq.pdf">criticized</a> other groups, such as Asaib Ahl al Haq, for prioritizing Iranian interests. The group opposes foreign <a href="http://www.sarayasalam.net/2016/01/blog-post_9.html">intervention</a> in Iraq and Iraqi involvement in other countries, such as Syria. This is a major point of disagreement with Iran and other Shiite militias.</p><p>The Peace Brigades is especially hostile towards the United States, the United Kingdom and Israel, collectively referred to as the “deplorable triad” on its <a href="http://www.sarayasalam.net/2015/09/blog-post_232.html">website</a>.</p><p>The militia’s logo features a dove as well as a fighter holding an Iraqi flag and a rifle.</p><p><strong>Leadership: </strong>Sadr is one of the most powerful figures in Iraq, though he has never held a position in government. Muqtada is the youngest and sole surviving son of Grand Ayatollah Mohammed Sadiq Sadr, who was allegedly assassinated by Saddam Hussein’s agents in 1999. He inherited a large network of charitable institutions. After the 2003 U.S. invasion, Sadr began building a mass following by providing social services to the urban poor. It became known as al Tayyar al Sadri (the Sadrist Movement).</p><p><img alt="Image removed." src="/core/misc/icons/e32700/error.svg" title="This image has been removed. For security reasons, only images from the local domain are allowed." height="16" width="16" class="filter-image-invalid" />In his fiery Friday sermons, Sadr spoke out against the U.S.-led occupation and the new Iraqi Governing Council. The movement called for an Islamic state and enforcement of Islamic law. It <a href="https://www.usip.org/publications/2011/06/iraqs-al-sadr-movement">targeted</a> Internet cafes, liquor stores, shops that sell music and movies, and anything else deemed un-Islamic.</p><p>Sadr, accused by critics of being beholden to Tehran, told <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2008/03/200861505611516526.html">Al Jazeera</a> that he did not always agree with Iran’s Supreme Leader—and had even told Khamenei that he did not approve of Tehran pursuing its “political and military interests” in Iraq.</p><p>Sadr again tested Tehran’s patience in a visit to Saudi Arabia in July 2017. He met with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, one of the region’s most outspoken critics of Iran. “Sadr’s visit demonstrated to Iran — and to Iran’s allies and proxies in Iraq/Sadr’s political rivals — that he not only has options, but he can even push back against Iran and has the power to potentially hurt Iranian interests in Iraq,” according to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/08/10/why-a-controversial-iraqi-shiite-cleric-visited-saudi-arabia/?utm_term=.252e745e2367">Fannar Haddad</a>.</p><p>Sheikh Kadhim al Issawi has been the military commander of the Peace Brigades since it was formed; he was previously chief of security for the Sadrist Movement. A lifelong friend of Sadr, Issawi <a href="https://jamestown.org/brief/shia-popular-mobilization-units-post-islamic-state-iraq-look-peace-brigade-commander-shaykh-kazim-al-issawi/">climbed</a> the ranks of the Mahdi Army and another successor militia, the Promised Day Brigade. As commander of the Peace Brigades, he led operations in Samarra and Amerli against ISIS. Videos of his speeches and tribute <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVrbb4OICnQ">songs</a> have been viewed hundreds of thousands of times on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghctnrltDxg">YouTube</a>.</p><p><strong>Military:</strong> The Peace Brigades <a href="http://carnegie-mec.org/2017/04/28/popular-mobilization-forces-and-iraq-s-future-pub-68810">claim</a>ed more than 100,000 had volunteered to fight, but that it lacked funds and equipment to train them. It <a href="http://www.gppi.net/publications/quick-facts-about-local-and-sub-state-forces/">registered</a> some 3,000 fighters with the PMF, but is estimated to have another <a href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/R44017.pdf">15,000</a> fighters outside of the PMF.</p><p><img alt="Image removed." src="/core/misc/icons/e32700/error.svg" title="This image has been removed. For security reasons, only images from the local domain are allowed." height="16" width="16" class="filter-image-invalid" /></p><p>The Peace Brigades deployed on the front lines against the Islamic State. In 2014, it played a key <a href="http://www.gppi.net/publications/quick-facts-about-local-and-sub-state-forces/">role</a> in stopping the ISIS advance on Samarra, north of Baghdad, recapturing Jurf al Sakhar, a Sunni area south of Baghdad, and <a href="http://www.iraq-businessnews.com/2014/11/15/iraqs-shiite-militias-in-anbar/2/">liberating</a> Heet in western Anbar province. It has also had a <a href="http://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/_Saddam_Hussein_(222).jpg%20-%20ISF%20PMF%20Orders%20of%20Battle_0_0.pdf">presence</a> in Karbala and areas north of Baghdad.</p><p>In February 2015, Sadr <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/iraqi-shiite-cleric-recalls-militiamen-from-fight-against-islamic-state/2015/02/17/9e85321a-b6bb-11e4-bc30-a4e75503948a_story.html?utm_term=.224272c43f3e">recalled</a> the militia from the front lines after <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/sunni-parties-consider-leaving-iraqi-parliament-after-slaying-of-sheik/2015/02/14/7e164a8c-b463-11e4-bf39-5560f3918d4b_story.html">several</a><a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/02/19/irans-shiite-militias-are-running-amok-in-iraq/">reports</a> of other Shiite militias <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-31037426">massacring</a> Sunni civilians. It subsequently played a largely defensive role. In 2018, its main deployment was in Samarra. Tensions with Baghdad <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/amp/International/wireStory/iraqi-pm-orders-probe-killing-officer-checkpoint-53733225">flared</a> in March 2018 when Peace Brigade checkpoint guards fired on an Iraqi Army convoy, killing a brigadier general and two guards.</p><p>After ISIS was defeated in December 2017, Sadr <a href="http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/muqtada-hashd-861713142">called</a> on PMF militias, including his own fighters, to disarm to help the central government impose its control over all of Iraq.</p><p><strong>Political Wing: </strong>The Sadrist Movement, founded in 2003, was initially more of a social movement than a religious or political party. It championed the rights of the Shiites, Iraq’s largest population group long repressed by Sunni rulers. Sadr often played the role of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/16/world/middleeast/radical-cleric-rising-as-a-kingmaker-in-iraqi-politics.html">kingmaker</a> in Iraqi elections. In the 2005 parliamentary elections, the Sadrists ran as part of the United Iraqi Alliance of predominantly Shiite parties, including Dawa and the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, two major players with long-standing <a href="https://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/sr156.pdf">ties</a> to Iran. The coalition won 128 of 275 <a href="http://www.electionguide.org/elections/id/1431/">seats</a>, <a href="https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/us-intervention-iraqi-politics">30</a> of which went to the Sadrists.<strong></strong>In 2006, Sadr used his clout to push through his preferred <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/03/13/jaafari.interview/">candidate</a> for the premiership, Ibrahim al Jaafari, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/16/world/middleeast/radical-cleric-rising-as-a-kingmaker-in-iraqi-politics.html">reportedly</a> threatening civil war among Shiites. In the 2010 parliamentary elections, the Sadrists won 39 <a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2010/08/20/the-king-of-iraq/">seats</a> as part of the National Iraqi Alliance.<strong> </strong>In the 2014 elections, Sadrists secured <a href="http://www.electionguide.org/elections/id/2425/">34 seats</a>, or around 10 percent of parliament.</p><p>For the May 2018 elections, Sadr adopted a bolder strategy—not based on cooperation with pro-Iran militias. He even <a href="http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/muqtada-hashd-861713142">called</a> on the government to prevent PMF leaders from running in the election. To inject “new blood” into politics, he <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2018/04/03/598004675/ahead-of-iraqs-elections-muqtada-al-sadr-reinvents-himself-again">banned</a> all incumbents in his party from running again. Sadr instead allied with the Iraqi Communist Party, a risky move given his religious base. He may have further jeopardized his relationship with Tehran. “We will not allow liberals and communists to govern in Iraq,” Ali Akbar Velayati, the supreme leader’s top advisor for foreign policy, <a href="https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2018/02/iran-iraq-election-velayati.html">warned</a> in February, during a trip to Baghdad.</p><p><em>Garrett Nada is the managing editor of "The Iran Primer" and "The Islamists" websites at the U.S. Institute of Peace.</em></p><p><em>Mattisan Rowan is a program assistant at the U.S. Institute of Peace. </em></p><p><a href="http://iranprimer.usip.org/blog/2018/apr/26/part-1-iran%E2%80%99s-role-iraq">Click here</a> for more information about Iran's role in Iraq. </p><h6>Photo credits: PMF tank unit by Mahmoud Hosseini via <a href="https://newsmedia.tasnimnews.com/Tasnim/Uploaded/Image/1395/04/08/139504081301405308020694.jpg">Tasnim News Agency</a> (CC BY 4.0)</h6></div></div><div class="attribution-block"><div class="attribution-block-inner"><div class="attribution-block-programs"><h3 class="attribution-block-programs-title h5">Related Program</h3><div class="attribution-block-program"><div class="attribution-block-program-header"><div class="attribution-block-program-header-logo"><img src="/themes/custom/wilson/assets/images/program-logos/the-islamists.svg" alt="The Islamists" width="100%" height="auto"></div><h3 class="attribution-block-program-header-name h4">The Islamists</h3></div><p class="attribution-block-program-text">&quot;The Islamists&quot; is a book and website on the origins, evolution, and positions of Islamist movements in the Middle East.

<div><p>"The issue was related to interpolation code that was added in fairly late and is only compiled in PC builds, and unintentionally the dedicated server build. Xbox builds do not compile the interpolation code. One change for interpolation was in a function that gets the camera position of a biped. Players control bipeds. At most, there are four local players, or &#8216;users&#8217;. This function was tweaked so that it would update and read from the interpolation data for the user controlling that biped. However, it was not handling the case where the user controlling the biped did not exist on that machine. So, the user index for non-local bipeds would be -1, which then caused entirely different memory in the interpolation state to be written to and read from. Well, this is further complicated by the fact that this same code path is used by the function that creates a weapon&#8217;s projectiles. Because to do that, the game needs to know where the player&#8217;s&#160;camera&#160;was &#8230; <a href="https://www.gamemaz.info/2020/05/halo-community-update-tracks-the-obscure-cause-of-halo-2-s-worst-launch-bug/" class="more-link">[Read more...] about Halo community update tracks the obscure cause of Halo 2&#8217;s worst launch bug</a></p></div>

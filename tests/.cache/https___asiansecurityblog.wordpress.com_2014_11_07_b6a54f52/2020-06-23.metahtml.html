It was lunatic fun, right? Was he dead? Was his sister in charge? WAS HE REPLACED BY ALIENS?!! Run for the hills! </p><p align="justify">To me, in retrospect, the big story was not KJU&#8217;s disappearance, but the wild, almost lunatic conspiracy-theorizing it unleashed in the West. </p><p align="justify">North Korea is a running punch-line in the West. Kim Jong Il was the villain in Team America. The story that the Norks found a unicorn a few years ago got play for weeks in the US for its sheer laugh value. So this essay was an effort to get a handle on this &#8211; why do Western media feel license to make any wild, preposterous claim they want about North Korea? Where does this bizarre obsession come from? There&#8217;s probably a good MA thesis in here actually if you were serious about it. </p><p align="justify">The following essay was first published by the <a href="http://www.lowyinterpreter.org/post/2014/10/30/What-did-we-learn-from-all-the-Kim-Jong-Un-has-dissappeared-hysteria.aspx?COLLCC=2212766809&amp;">Lowy Institute</a>, and then <a href="http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/north-korea-the-mafia-lessons-the-kim-jong-un-has-11584">picked up by The National Interest</a>. This was the first time I was published by TNI, so that was pretty cool. My thanks to the TNI editor, my friend, <a href="https://twitter.com/GrecianFormula">Harry Kazianis</a>.  </p></article>

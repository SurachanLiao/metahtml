				<p>Looks like Shaun King&#8217;s call for a <a target="_blank" href="https://moonbattery.com/black-lives-matter-tear-down-caucasian-depictions-of-jesus/" rel="noopener noreferrer">war on white Jesus</a> is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8517857/Alaska-Airlines-flight-makes-emergency-landing-Seattle-passenger-threatens-kill-everyone.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">catching on</a> among his fellow white black supremacists:</p>
<blockquote><p>An Alaska Airlines flight was forced to make an emergency landing in Seattle, Washington on Saturday after a passenger threatened to kill everyone on board.</p>
<p>Video footage from the incident shows the man – wearing a face mask &#8211; moving through the cabin of Flight 422 bound for Chicago O&#8217; Hare yelling: &#8216;I will kill everybody on this plane unless you accept Jesus was a black man.&#8217;</p></blockquote>
<p>Everything else about the year 2020 stinks, but at least in-flight entertainment is getting livelier as the country descends into lunacy:</p>
<div align="center"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SLwx7XqxiDk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>Amazingly, the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/crime/alaska-flight-forced-to-return-to-sea-tac-airport-after-man-threatens-passengers-saturday-night/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Seattle Times</a> managed to present this story without mentioning the maniac&#8217;s demand that other passengers believe in a black Jesus, which appears to be the whole point of his outburst. Not satisfied to bury the lead, they excluded it completely, reporting that he was threatening to kill them &#8220;in the name of Jesus.&#8221; The spin: Christians are dangerous lunatics. Yet again we see that the &#8220;mainstream&#8221; liberal media is not a reliable source of information.</p>

<div class="entry">
				<p>When it comes to pathological greed, black supremacists leave even <a target="_blank" href="https://moonbattery.com/teachers-union-holds-reopened-schools-hostage-for-cash/" rel="noopener noreferrer">teachers&#8217; unions</a> in the dust. There having been slavery in this country like there was throughout the world from the dawn of history has already cost us 620,000 lives in the Civil War and the $trillions flushed down the welfare state. But too much is never enough for bullies who encounter little resistance.</p>
<p>Slavery officially ended in the United States 157 years ago, long before anyone alive today had been born — <a target="_blank" href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/washington-secrets/mayors-back-reparations-could-cost-6-2-quadrillion-151m-per-descendant" rel="noopener noreferrer">and yet</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sen. Cory Booker and Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee have introduced legislation to create a commission, the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/40?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22Rep+Jackson+Lee+Sheila+TX18%22%2C%22Rep+Jackson+Lee+Sheila+TX18%22%5D%7D" rel="noopener noreferrer">Commission to Study and Develop Reparation Proposals for African-Americans Act</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>To learn how much this will cost us, we turn to academia, the original driving force behind most moonbattery.</p>
<blockquote><p>A new study from three college professors said that the ultimate cost could be $6.2 quadrillion. Quadrillion comes after trillion, and one quadrillion has 15 zeros.</p>
<p>The study suggests a payment of $151 million each, and the cost to every person would be $18.96 million.</p></blockquote>
<p>The study, &#8220;<a target="_blank" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0034644620926516" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wealth Implications of Slavery and Racial Discrimination for African American Descendants of the Enslaved</a>,&#8221; was published in the <em>Review of Black Political Economy</em>.</p>
<p>Since there is not that much money in existence, the government will have to print it.</p>
<p>Looks like saving for retirement was a waste of time. Once Democrats have sufficient control to inflict their agenda, their <strike>spending</strike> looting spree will reduce the value of American currency until it literally is not worth the paper it is printed on.</p>
<p>Socialists accomplished this level of inflation in Zimbabwe and Venezuela. The socialist Bernie Sanders has <a target="_blank" href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/biden-economic-speech-far-left-policies-pandemic-economy" rel="noopener noreferrer">effectively written</a> Biden&#8217;s economic plan.</p>
<p>Leftists know that wildly excessive spending will eventually produce economic collapse. They believe this to be the shortest path to communism. You can&#8217;t cook a communist omelet without breaking millions of nest eggs.</p>

				<p>Receiving death threats from tolerant liberals is a high honor, yet a simple one to achieve. All you need is decency, a $5 poster board, and guts. Savanah Hernandez shows how it&#8217;s done:</p>
<div align="center">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I get a lot of hate for the sign, but imagine being the person whose actually in the uniform. </p>
<p>Thank you to the police who care about keeping our communities safe.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PoliceLivesMatter?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#PoliceLivesMatter</a> <a href="https://t.co/6q1b4yF5zB">pic.twitter.com/6q1b4yF5zB</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Savanah Hernandez (@sav_says_) <a href="https://twitter.com/sav_says_/status/1282740963971137536?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 13, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Via <a target="_blank" href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/young-conservative-women-stand-liberal-mob-ingraham" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fox News</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Savanah Hernandez, who was targeted by Black Lives Matter protesters when she showed up to a rally with a sign that read “Police Lives Matter,” told “The Ingraham Angle” on Monday that she was “viciously attacked” and has “gotten death threats from people on the left” because they don’t like her message. …</p>
<p>“I went and I stood there, I didn’t chant, I didn’t go infiltrate their rally at all,” Hernandez said. “I stood on a busy street corner and I held up my sign because I wanted police in my city to know that they were supported and I was immediately attacked.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The attacks continued afterward.</p>
<blockquote><p>She noted that since the rally she has received death threats from people on the left, which she said “only emboldens me more to stand up for our police who protect our communities every single day.”</p></blockquote>
<p>That is the only sane response to bullies, since any other reaction will encourage more bullying. Too bad <a target="_blank" href="https://moonbattery.com/washington-redskins-knuckle-under-to-bullies/" rel="noopener noreferrer">the NFL</a> never figured that out.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I am not a spectacular human being, I’m a regular girl … If I can stand up and make big waves with a $5 poster board and a message, then anybody can,” she said in response. “So stand up. Now’s the time to do it.”</p></blockquote>
<p>She couldn&#8217;t be more right. It may be our last chance.</p>

<div class="entry">
				<p>An <a target="_blank" href="https://ammo.com/articles/constitutional-republic-vs-pure-democracy-how-us-election-process-has-changed" rel="noopener noreferrer">interesting piece</a> at Moonbattery.com sponsor Ammo.com on the history of the voting franchise in the USA illustrates our progressive deterioration from a constitutional republic to &#8220;pure&#8221; mob rule democracy steered by a powerful elite. This deterioration will accelerate if today&#8217;s radical Democrats take power. They may be counting on it to make the results of the next election permanent.</p>
<p>One Democrat objective is to <a target="_blank" href="https://moonbattery.com/why-democrats-want-to-abolish-electoral-college/" rel="noopener noreferrer">abolish the Electoral College</a>, which prevents densely populated parts of the country from running roughshod over rural areas.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Electoral College and the Senate allow rural states to have a voice in how the country is run, rather than being totally ruled over by people in urban centers who don’t own guns, can’t grow food, and have never met their neighbors.</p></blockquote>
<p>Imagine the whole country ruled by the sort of moonbats who get elected in the densest population areas, e.g., Bill de Blasio, Eric Garcetti, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and Maxine Waters.</p>
<p>Progressives have already partially neutered the Senate with the 17th Amendment. The Founding Fathers intended Senators to represent their state governments. Now that senators are directly elected, it is debatable whether they even represent their own states. Robert Francis O&#8217;Rourke was nearly elected to the Senate from Texas while primarily representing his <a target="_blank" href="https://moonbattery.com/texas-senate-candidate-beto-orourke-raises-funds-in-tinseltown/" rel="noopener noreferrer">financial base in Hollywood</a>.</p>
<p>Efforts to make voting easier often facilitate voter fraud, which benefits the party more likely to engage in it. This is why Democrats have been pushing for mass mail-in voting.</p>
<blockquote><p>This is just printing up a ton of ballots, sending them out and letting everyone mail them in. There are few, if any, protections in place for preventing people from voting twice, preventing non-registered voters from voting, or preventing illegal aliens from voting. For every person who votes that shouldn’t, a legal voter has their vote cancelled out or nullified.</p></blockquote>
<p>More direct democracy ironically results in less input by voters:</p>
<blockquote><p>The transition to a purer democracy has coincided with greater influence among unofficial kingmakers who control the process while also consolidating greater power in Washington, D.C. In practice, this has meant favoring a bureaucratic elite who effectively act as unelected legislators. Most of the regulations put in place by the alphabet soup of federal agencies aren’t there by statute, but are in fact part of powers delegated to them by the legislature who have abdicated their legislative authority.</p>
<p>What’s more, these unofficial kingmakers are often shadowy figures whose names (to say nothing of their intentions) are mostly unknown. These are not the traditional party bosses who were, in a sense, beholden to their people in the form of having to provide patronage and pork and other tangible results. Rather the new kingmakers of our pure democracy are the mass media, party activists and others with no skin in the game and little in the way of public accountability. Their angle is one entirely of self-interest and not to the broader body politic, to say nothing of future generations.</p></blockquote>

<div class="entry">
				<p>No tradition escapes desecration and/or eradication by moonbats, not even the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue, which will push political correctness to a new extreme of nauseating tastelessness by featuring a guy wearing a bikini and pretending to be a girl. He calls himself <a target="_blank" href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/valentina-sampaio-first-transgender-model-sports-illustrated-swimsuit" rel="noopener noreferrer">Valentina Sampaio</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>On Friday, the 23-year-old Brazilian native confirmed [he] was named a 2020 Rookie for the publication&#8217;s upcoming issue, out July 21.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sampaio has also been used to inject depravity into Victoria&#8217;s Secret &#8220;as its first-ever openly transgender model.&#8221; Whether there were previous transgender models who kept their real gender secret is doubtful.</p>
<p>Still more doubtful is that more than an infinitesimal fraction of the customers buying the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue want to look at pictures of some weird guy posing in a bikini. But business isn&#8217;t about giving customers what they want anymore. It&#8217;s about imperiously rubbing their faces in wokeness, as if we had to buy whatever they put in front of us no matter how much it disgusts us.</p>

				<p>It doesn&#8217;t occur to some people that the purpose of minimum wage is to drive up unemployment, thereby creating more welfare-dependent Democrats. But a head-on collision with reality drives the truth home:</p>

<p>Give it some thought and you don&#8217;t need to lose a job to understand that minimum wage is wrong. We have a fundamental right to enter into voluntary contracts with each other.

<div class="entry">
				<p>Considering that schools may not open in the fall due to liberal obstruction, let&#8217;s try to help out by providing online instruction. Today&#8217;s vocabulary term is <a target="_blank" href="https://nypost.com/2020/07/12/weingarten-no-way-schools-open-this-fall-without-funding/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>extortion</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, said there’s “no way” schools across the country could reopen this fall because of a lack of federal funding. …</p>
<p>The School Superintendent Association estimated that it would cost an average of $1.8 million per school district to adhere to guidelines set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to reopen this fall.</p></blockquote>
<p>As of <a target="_blank" href="https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d18/tables/dt18_214.10.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">2017</a>, there are 13,598 regular school districts in the USA. That comes to $24,476,400,000.00. The greed of teachers&#8217; unions was already legendary. The legend lives on.</p>
<p>Leftists can afford to make outrageous demands, because they don&#8217;t want the schools open anyway.</p>
<p>There is no danger to kids. They are <a target="_blank" href="https://globalnews.ca/video/6653401/covid-19-children-and-young-adults-more-likely-to-die-from-flu-than-from-coronavirus-u-s-surgeon-general/" rel="noopener noreferrer">more likely to die of seasonal flu</a> than Wuhan coronavirus; keeping them at home comes with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/education-52413511" rel="noopener noreferrer">more significant risks</a>. Opening schools in Europe has <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnsnews.com/blog/john-jakubisin/despite-covid-19-many-european-schools-are-already-open-or-will-be-opening-fall" rel="noopener noreferrer">worked out fine</a>.</p>
<p>However, keeping kids out of school helps keep people out of work. That helps keep the economy from recovering. It also helps drag out the mood of crisis and doom that Democrats want to be associated with the current administration. Once they have their figurehead Joe Biden in the White House, then they will be willing to open the schools.</p>
<p>This <a target="_blank" href="https://www.azquotes.com/quote/777230" rel="noopener noreferrer">immortal quote</a> by former President of United Federation of Teachers and American Federation of Teachers Albert Shanke may need to be revised:</p>
<blockquote><p>“When school children start paying union dues, that’s when I’ll start representing the interests of school children.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe all the children need to do is start voting Democrat.</p>

<div class="entry">
				<p>We know it is still a more or less free country so long as Tucker Carlson is still allowed on national television. That probably won&#8217;t be for much longer. They have already taken out his top writer Blake Neff.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2020/07/10/media/tucker-carlson-writer-blake-neff/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gloats CNN:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>The top writer for Fox News host Tucker Carlson has for years been using a pseudonym to post bigoted remarks on an online forum that is a hotbed for racist, sexist, and other offensive content, CNN Business learned [last] week.</p></blockquote>
<p>Neff has been posting on Xoxohth, a message board for law school students, under the pseudonym CharlesXII. Once his identity was discovered, leftists used the information to destroy him per their usual cancel culture tactics.</p>
<blockquote><p>CNN Business contacted Neff for comment Thursday night. After he or someone acting on his behalf passed that email to Fox News spokespeople, a network spokesperson on Friday morning told CNN Business that Neff had resigned. …</p>
<p>In a memo sent to employees Saturday afternoon, after this story was first published, Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott and President Jay Wallace condemned &#8220;horrific racist, misogynistic and homophobic behavior.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The Stasi would approve of CNN&#8217;s methods:</p>
<blockquote><p>After learning of Neff&#8217;s posts on the board through an email from an anonymous tipster, CNN Business was able to positively identify CharlesXII as Neff by reviewing messages he has posted throughout the years on the forum and matching them up with publicly available information about him.</p></blockquote>
<p>CNN SJWs use the threat of doxing to <a target="_blank" href="https://moonbattery.com/cnn-blackmail-threat-of-doxing-used-to-extract-apology-silence-thought-criminal/" rel="noopener noreferrer">terrorize regular people</a> who make fun of them. You could hardly expect them to let a Tucker Carlson writer get away with having anonymously expressed unapproved opinions.</p>
<p>Will they be satisfied with Neff&#8217;s scalp? Hardly. Because Carlson is largely noncompliant with leftist ideology, he has the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.poynter.org/newsletters/2020/and-the-most-watched-cable-news-show-ever-is/" rel="noopener noreferrer">highest rated show in the history of cable news</a>. For the same reason, he must be deplatformed lest he continue to expose the liberal narrative as a malevolent lie.</p>
<p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://t.co/mToY7wSsxv?amp=1" rel="noopener noreferrer">Los Angeles Times</a> confirms it:</p>
<blockquote><p>Neff’s resignation is only likely to heighten the growing controversy surrounding “Tucker Carlson Tonight” and the host’s inflammatory rhetoric on issues of race and immigration. …</p>
<p>According to Nielsen, “Tucker Carlson Tonight” was the most-watched program in cable news during the second quarter with an average audience of 4.33 million viewers a night, but the program has had trouble retaining advertisers over the years as it has become a target of liberal watchdog groups such as Media Matters and Sleeping Giants.</p></blockquote>
<p>Media Matters and Sleeping Giants are the soft tyranny version of government assassins. They identify people who must be silenced and find ways to silence them. Tucker Carlson has a target on his chest.</p>

Giving in to bullies eggs them on to increase their demands. </p>
<p>The Cleveland Indians <a target="_blank" href="https://moonbattery.com/p-c-bullies-claim-chief-wahoos-scalp/" rel="noopener noreferrer">fed Chief Wahoo to the crocodiles</a>. The crocodiles demanded more. Now the Indians <a target="_blank" href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/indians-next-team-change-name-timetable" rel="noopener noreferrer">reportedly</a> will change the name they have had since 1914.</p>
<p>At the risk of belaboring the obvious, this has nothing to do with protecting the feelings of Indians. Having a team named after you is an honor. You won&#8217;t see the Redskins renamed the Washington Moonbats, because you only name teams for something you respect.</p>
<p>What it is about is power. Liberals get an authoritarian thrill out of dictating our <a target="_blank" href="https://moonbattery.com/category/newspeak-dictionary/" rel="noopener noreferrer">vocabulary</a> and every picayune detail of our culture. If people continue to move when they are pushed, the social justice warriors will eventually demand that every team change its name, on whatever nonsensical pretext. Then they will go through and demand each team change its name again.</p>
<p>The naming of sports teams is trivial. Less trivial is that a small minority of bullies can dictate to everyone else without significant resistance. That is how totalitarianism works. Totalitarianism is the gateway to hell on earth.</p>
<p>On tips from Scott D, Bluto, Mr. Freemarket, and Varla.</p>

<p>If only moonbattery could be contained in urban areas. We could evacuate any countermoonbat stragglers from the the cities that have succumbed to leftism and then call in airstrikes. But the poison seeps out to infect the rest of the country, just as it has out of college campuses.</p>

		<h2><a href="https://moonbattery.com/doctors-without-borders-denounced-as-racist/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Doctors Without Borders Denounced as Racist">Doctors Without Borders Denounced as Racist</a></h2>
<div class="entry">
				<p>If no good deed goes unpunished, then Doctors Without Borders is in for a reckoning. Even an organization devoted to providing emergency medical assistance to the Third World can be accused of racism, as we learn from the ultrawoke <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/jul/10/medecins-sans-frontieres-institutionally-racist-medical-charity-colonialism-white-supremacy-msf" rel="noopener noreferrer">Guardian</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The medical NGO Médecins Sans Frontières is institutionally racist and reinforces colonialism and white supremacy in its humanitarian work, according to an internal statement signed by 1,000 current and former members of staff. …</p>
<p>Addressed to senior management and colleagues, the letter calls for an independent investigation into racism within the organisation and for urgent root and branch reform to dismantle “decades of power and paternalism”.</p></blockquote>
<p>Some within Doctors Without Borders have even refused to toe the line regarding black supremacist ideology.</p>
<blockquote><p>The statement follows fierce internal debate about racism and the Black Lives Matter movement. Some staff were angry at a recent statement released by MSF Italy, suggesting it should not use the term “racism” and that “everyone, starting with MSF”, should talk about “all lives matter”.</p></blockquote>
<p>Stating that &#8220;all lives matter&#8221; is now regarded as <a target="_blank" href="https://moonbattery.com/all-lives-matter-used-in-hate-hoax/" rel="noopener noreferrer">hate speech</a>. The penalty ranges from ostracization to <a target="_blank" href="https://moonbattery.com/young-mother-killed-for-saying-all-lives-matter/" rel="noopener noreferrer">death</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>MSF, one of the world’s largest humanitarian organisations, which was awarded the Nobel peace prize in 1999, provides emergency medical services to people in need in poorer countries and conflict zones.</p>
<p>Last year, it employed 65,000 staff, about 90% of whom were hired locally. However, most of its operations are run by European senior managers out of five operational centres in western Europe, with only one, which opened last year in Senegal, located in the global south.</p></blockquote>
<p>That makes it racist.</p>
<blockquote><p>Shaista Aziz, former MSF aid worker and the co-founder of NGO Safe Space, an intersectional feminist platform seeking accountability over #AidToo abuse, said: “This moment of reckoning is massively overdue.” …</p>
<p>Change, Aziz said, “requires brave and bold leadership and it requires a lot of ‘do-gooding’ white people with power to get out of the way”.</p></blockquote>
<p>Fine. White people can get out of the way and let you provide your own medical care. Works for me.</p>

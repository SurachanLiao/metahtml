<p id="caption-attachment-19086" class="wp-caption-text">Kim Jong Un is briefed by Hong Su&#8217;ng-mu during a meeting with nuclear weapons personnel. The event most likely took place at the T&#8217;aeso&#8217;ng (Tae-sung) Machine Factory (Photo: KCTV screen grab).</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-19083" class="wp-caption-text">Image of a mockup of the Nodong missile at T&#8217;aeso&#8217;ng Machine Factory. The image was taken during a 2008 visit by a military delegation from Myanmar.</p>
<p>On March 7, Kim Jong Un <a href="https://nkleadershipwatch.wordpress.com/2016/03/08/kim-jong-un-meets-with-nuclear-weapons-personnel/">visited a facility where he was briefed about the</a> DPRK&#8217;s nuclear weapons the missiles which would serve as their delivery system. &#160;Based on photos of Jong Un&#8217;s visit, it appears that this event took place at the factory showroom at T&#8217;aeso&#8217;ng Machine Factory located between Pyongyang Namp&#8217;o. &#160;The T&#8217;aeso&#8217;ng [Thaesong] Machine Factory is a large complex and a major (and one of the oldest) manufacturer of the DPRK&#8217;s ballistic missiles, generally involved in the assembling the finished product with components produced at other factories in the country. &#160;Much of the manufacturing activity occurs in underground facilities [UGFs] located around the complex.</p>
 
 
<p>Images disseminated by state media of Jong Un&#8217;s visit and briefing with the nuclear weapons personnel d reveal the same interior design and layout as a photo of the T&#8217;aeso&#8217;ng Machine Factory&#8217;s showroom from a 2008 visit by a Myanmar (Burma) military delegation. &#160;The T&#8217;aeso&#8217;ng factory showroom has undergone some renovations since it was last observed over seven years ago. &#160;There are new ideological slogan posters (including Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il quotations) and decorations along the walls. &#160;Fluorescent lights that run along the walls have been removed and overhead lighting was added. &#160;Nevertheless the same structure and layout remains. &#160;Yellow and green beams hang from the ceiling and run the length of the room; these are likely for cranes with which to move the heavy equipment &#160;There is a corrugated metal roof and ceiling, along with white tiled walls (which might be moveable) and a glazed concrete floor.</p>
<p>While imagery of the interior of the T&#8217;aeso&#8217;ng Machine Factory&#8217;s showroom is highly restricted through open source methods, there are other reasons why this Jong Un visit occurred there. &#160;There are only three other facilities within the DPRK (two in the suburbs of Pyongyang and one in Chagang Province) in which it would be appropriate for a Suryo&#8217;ng to inspect missiles and mockups thereof, however T&#8217;aeso&#8217;ng is the only one large enough to be able to accommodate the number of things that were on display during Jong Un&#8217;s visit with the nuclear weapons personnel. &#160;There are also logistical and security reasons why this event occurred at T&#8217;aeso&#8217;ng, among them being it the most convenient locale to which they could bus and chauffeur the dozen or so nuclear weapons officials and researchers who attended Kim Jong Un&#8217;s visit. &#160;Finally,&#160;T&#8217;aeso&#8217;ng is involved in the final assembly of much of the DPRK&#8217;s ballistic missile inventory; note that during his interaction with the country&#8217;s nuclear weapons researchers and managers Kim Jong Un referred both to tactical nuclear weapons (which would include short-range missiles, artillery shells, depth charges) and long-range ballistic missiles, some of which are T&#8217;aso&#8217;ng&#8217;s finished products.</p>

<p>Kim Jong Un visited the T&#8217;aeso&#8217;ng factory one week ago. For external purposes he was there to order a modernization of the complex and encourage its employees during the 70-Day Speed Battle before the convocation of the 7th Party Congress in May. &#160;(Part of the ideological rationale behind this is to show the DPRK&#8217;s population that the machine-building industry which largely contributes to the country&#8217;s arms and munitions sector can use some of their machinery to contribute to the domestic, civilian economy) &#160;And yet, &#160;he was also instructing that T&#8217;aeso&#8217;ng&#8217;s factory managers and chief functionaries prepare for his visit, briefing and demonstration with the leading personnel of the country&#8217;s nuclear weapons.</p>

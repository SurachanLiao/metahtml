For external purposes he was there to order a modernization of the complex and encourage its employees during the 70-Day Speed Battle before the convocation of the 7th Party Congress in May.  (Part of the ideological rationale behind this is to show the DPRK’s population that the machine-building industry which largely contributes to the country’s arms and munitions sector can use some of their machinery to contribute to the domestic, civilian economy)  And yet,  he was also instructing that T’aeso’ng’s factory managers and chief functionaries prepare for his visit, briefing and demonstration with the leading personnel of the country’s nuclear weapons.</p> <p id="jp-relatedposts" class="jp-relatedposts"></p><h3 class="jp-relatedposts-headline">Related</h3> <p class="meta-information"><ins></ins></p><h3><ins>Information</ins></h3><ins> This entry was posted on 03/10/2016 by </ins><ins><a href="https://nkleadershipwatch.wordpress.com/author/nkleadershipwatch/" title="View all posts by nkleadershipwatch" rel="author">nkleadershipwatch Link: https://nkleadershipwatch.wordpress.com/author/nkleadershipwatch/ </a> in </ins><ins><a href="https://nkleadershipwatch.wordpress.com/category/7th-party-congress/70-day-speed-battle-2016/" rel="category tag">70 Day Speed Battle (2016) Link: https://nkleadershipwatch.wordpress.com/category/7th-party-congress/70-day-speed-battle-2016/ </a>, </ins><ins><a href="https://nkleadershipwatch.wordpress.com/category/7th-party-congress/" rel="category tag">7th Party Congress Link: https://nkleadershipwatch.wordpress.com/category/7th-party-congress/ </a>, </ins><ins><a href="https://nkleadershipwatch.wordpress.com/category/korean-workers-party-kwp/central-committee/" rel="category tag">Central Committee Link: https://nkleadershipwatch.wordpress.com/category/korean-workers-party-kwp/central-committee/ </a>, </ins><ins><a href="https://nkleadershipwatch.wordpress.com/category/korean-workers-party-kwp/central-military-committee/" rel="category tag">Central Military Committee Link: https://nkleadershipwatch.wordpress.com/category/korean-workers-party-kwp/central-military-committee/ </a>, </ins><ins><a href="https://nkleadershipwatch.wordpress.com/category/col-gen-kim-rak-gyom-srfc/" rel="category tag">Col.

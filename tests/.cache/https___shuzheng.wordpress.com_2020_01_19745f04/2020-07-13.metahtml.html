					<p>Had the US developed a gene-specific killer virus? (See segment, Exhibit C, Figure 3,4) Because, if it did then&#8230; containing spread of 2019-nCoV = containing spread of anti-China racism.</p>
<p>Is this Anglo-American containment strategy against China &#8212; lining up then directing global hatred for China, Reuters leading the way? It didn&#8217;t work with Taiwan, the South China Sea, the Belt Road Initiative, Africa development, Sri Lanka port, Huawei, Tibet, Xinjiang, the Hong Kong riots. Will it work this time?</p>
<p>*</p>
<h3>Virus = Chinese.</h3>
<h3>THE WESTERN SPREAD OF HATRED FOR CHINESE</h3>
<p>In four exhibits, below shows how the West, such as Reuters, manufacture, stoke, support then distribute &#8216;anti-China&#8217; sentiment.</p>
<p>*</p>
<h3>Exhibit A: Western political agenda, distributing lies</h3>
 
<p>*</p>
<p>On the surface, you&#8217;d think the title true, outbreak was in Wuhan, majority infections and death in China. But read that <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-sentiment/anti-china-sentiment-spreads-abroad-along-with-coronavirus-idUSKBN1ZT1B6">Reuters article</a> again &#8212; carefully.</p>
<ul>
<li>One, it avoid stating the source of the report is America or Europe, that is, Reuters is not spreading racism. By saying Jakarta and Hanoi, it then claims, &#8216;See, those sentiments are in Asia. There we find evidence that virus = Chinese, therefore fighting virus is fighting Chinese.&#8216;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Two, White people in the UK and Europe and in Christian societies birth racism, even genocidally killed for it (it&#8217;s called fascism). Asians don&#8217;t have that mentality. Hence, Reuters is incredulous and said so: It was &#8216;unusual&#8216; (sic) that in,</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Samal Island in the southern Philippines on Thursday banned not just tourists from China but from all countries affected by the coronavirus to the popular beach spot.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, this was apparent. All cases of anti-Chinese sentiment were recorded in US colleges and in Europe. Reuters again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sun Lay Tan, a 41-year-old manager in the creative industries sector, said the man seated next to him in his Paris subway ride changed seat then put a scarf over his mouth. &#8220;That was really shocking,&#8221; said Tan, who was born in France of Chinese and Cambodian origin. &#8220;I felt really stigmatized&#8221;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sun didn&#8217;t say the other passenger changed seats because he looks Chinese, rather he is only likely to have the virus. It was Reuters who invented the lie that the other Parisian rider is racist, like Reuters is racist. If that passenger was indeed racist, then the same logical conclusion has to be applied to Malaysian immigration:</p>
 
<p>But do you read that in Reuters? The Malaysia rejection had 14 passengers and not a lone Parisian whom Reuters deliberately chose out of tens of thousands daily.</p>
<p>In other words, Reuters had no case to report &#8212; even as news &#8212; but it would intentionally make a case for its lies, anyway it wishes, and it does wish that: cultivating hatred for Chinese.</p>
<ul>
<li>Three, inventing facts.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Because your country is beginning (to) spread disease&#8230;we do not accept to serve the guest from China,&#8221; read a sign in English outside the Danang Riverside hotel in the central Vietnamese city of the same name. Authorities later told the hotel to remove the sign, its manager said in a Facebook post.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why is a hotel sign, written in the English, not Chinese, and Twitter tweets (eg. &#8220;Stop eating bats,&#8221; said one Twitter user in Thailand &#8212; and the Twitter user writing in English is therefore Thai?) the basis of determining anti-Chinese racism in Asia because note the following: (a) anonymity, a person writing in English could be Anglo-Saxon and not Thai-speaking; anybody with a phone and a wifi connection can say anything under the sun today, (b) that authorities actually called out the Reuters invention as a lie &#8212; &#8220;remove&#8221; it! says the Viet authority, but Reuters proceed instead to distribute that racism worldwide.</p>
<p>This is what Reuters said afterwards, and which foretells its racist-political agenda in fomenting inter-ethnic hatred in Asia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Vietnam, which was under Chinese occupation centuries ago and contests Beijing&#8217;s sweeping maritime claims in the South China Sea, has particularly fraught relations with China.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So eager was it in its agenda, Reuters will invent facts. Fraught? Is that a fact? What is a fraught relations? Contest, yes. But occupation? Centuries ago? When the country known today as Vietnam hadn&#8217;t existed, not even as a sovereign and independent modern state political entity, with no borders to boot?</p>
<p>That language and writing style and method is what is meant by inserting a nugget of news into a political propaganda: Only 1 percent needs to be true and the whole statement will be accepted as true. Anglophone novelists use that method in fiction writing to lure you into believing the story.</p>
<p>*</p>
<h3>Exhibit B: Sowing disinformation, fear 
</h3>
 
 
<p>This is how <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/wuhan-virus-china-american-student-trapped-apocalypse--12368408">Reuters manufactured</a> &#8212; literally &#8212; a personal fear which was subsequently re-sold by <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/wuhan-virus-china-american-student-trapped-apocalypse--12368408">Singapore&#8217;s CNA</a> as if China had deliberately set up a Western foreigner to incarcerate and that the case is reflection of authoritarian China. This is how Reuters began:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>WUHAN: For almost a week, 21-year-old American-born college student Nicholas Schneider has been trying and failing to find a way out of Wuhan, China, the quarantined city at the heart of a fast-spreading coronavirus outbreak.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See Reuters stoking it with the phrases: &#8216;apocalypse&#8216; (sic!), &#8216;trying and failing&#8216; and &#8216;finding a way out&#8216; when that actually means breaking the quarantine. Does that motherfucker of a kid even know what is an &#8216;apocalypse&#8217;?</p>
<p>See Reuters total reliance on a stupid Yankee kid for the misinformation. It is like using a single anonymous tweet or a Facebook post as irrefutable proof supporting its political agenda and its racism spread. They call such a report of &#8216;human interest&#8217;, so human that only Western human counts as more important than the rest of world, especially Chinese, and Muslims and blacks and browns.</p>
<p>See the re-affirmation into the bias and prejudices of Reuters with Schneider&#8217;s self-centeredness, crying for mother, willing to risk the health and lives of his entire family and all America to get out?</p>
<p>See how Reuters deliberately ignores with both context and empirical evidences that would have otherwise contradicted its agenda, that (a) 25 million Chinese accept the quarantine as necessary, and that (b) thousands outside Wuhan have volunteered to enter the city &#8212; not forced, because how do you force a nurse to look after the sick?</p>
<p>*</p>
<h3>Exhibit C: Sowing, inventing lies</h3>
 
<p>Figure #1</p>
 
<p>Figure #2 (This and above, <a href="https://news.qq.com/zt2020/page/feiyan.htm?from=singlemessage">available here</a>, in Chinese only.)</p>
 
 
<p>Figure 3, continued to Figure 4, above. (Note a thing about SARS: overwhelmingly it is Chinese who die from the virus and the West seems resistant to it although in the US there are 13 million flu cases and 6,600 deaths.) 
</p>
<p>*</p>
 
<p>Figure 5</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Those charts and tables above not merely give comparison &#8212; because what does that serve? But they permit you to distinguished truth from facts (those are different concepts): 2019 nCoV is not so widespread and fatal, meaning China is doing great work curbing it.</p>
<p>Either SARS was far more lethal but race-specific (see Figures 3, 4) or that medical technology has vastly improved and Chinese efficacy has helped matters. The epidemic will end; it always does (Fig.5); the problem is in the interim.</p>
<p>Numbers on their own, independently, and without context, do lie.</p>
<p>A week ago ago fatality rate was under 3% in China alone, less globally, today it is still under 3 percent. And note especially the cases cured, Figure #1, third column, 171 full recovery. Those could have ended up in the fourth column, number of deaths. Yet the number of cured cases is never, never, never, never reported. Ask yourself, Why not?</p>
<p>Or compare Chinese fatalities to other, such as <a href="https://shuzheng.wordpress.com/2020/01/24/west-canada-employ-germ-warfare-against-china-update-lying-facts/">US deaths from flu infections</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Last year alone, the US CDC reported 1.2 million flu cases and more than 42,000 deaths.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this, below, is in <a href="https://thehill.com/changing-america/well-being/longevity/480089-coronavirus-sparks-panic-as-flu-poses-greater-threat-to">2020 in America with 15 million infections and 140,000 hospitalization</a> so far. Read about it anywhere? Reuters? Mkini?</p>
<p>*</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Compared to US cases, coronavirus is &#8220;trivial, a blip, no comparison.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, why the Press and western fixation if not hatred for China? To cut off its legs and its economic and trade relations with the rest of the world as the US Congress, the State and Defence departments have vouched &#8212; not once, not twice but since 2016?</p>
 
 
 
<p>Is the US and the West, Reuters leading the propaganda, setting the stage to blame China for future virus infections and deaths?</p>
 
<p>*</p>
<h3>Exhibit D: Outright racism branding 
</h3>
 
<p>*</p>
<p>Conclusion:</p>
<p>One could go on and on &#8212; but you get the point. Riding on news of the virus is this insidious Western and Anglophile, particular Press, attempts that push out nuggets of &#8216;news and views&#8217; (sic) inserted into hatred and into anti-Chinese racism. Isn&#8217;t that &#8216;fake news&#8217;?</p>
<p>The West is not above spreading hatred and not especially mass murder. Their genocidal record is legendary, from Canada to Peru, from India to Australia and from Nazi Germany and Hiroshima to present Middle East.</p>
<p>But the West gets away with it for its racist dissemination today for two reasons: (a) claiming Freedom of the Press and (b) its writing technique and style, unlike the brusque and in-your-face Twitter, YouTube and Facebook postings few believe wholeheartedly and even fewer will take only with a grain of salt. The methods at Reuters and Mkini are identical in use during the Hong Kong riots.</p>
<p>Those methods are copied by pro-US newspapers, such as below.</p>
<p>For Chinese-fluent readers: &#35531;&#32048;&#35712;&#22294;&#20839;&#25991;&#23383;&#12290;</p>

<h3>Urgent Note to friends, compatriots outside China</h3>
<p>If you are going to donate to Wuhan hospitals, visit your local hospital first. Check with them and get international specifications on the protective gear for flu and other highly infectious viruses? This is the stuff in short supply.</p>
<p>Last few days (see clip below), Wuhan got 40 million tonnes and most can&#8217;t be used in isolation, critical wards and during surgical procedures. But, thank you anyway. The hospital will redistribute the supplies to patients and residents.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a lot of good people who are led astray 
That believe true love is dead 
But I&#8217;ll tell you somethin&#8217;, brother 
When you&#8217;re dealin&#8217; with your feelings 
It&#8217;s tough to keep a level head 
And it&#8217;s hard to imagine 
How the flames of passion 
Will burn &#8217;til your soul will melt 
And it&#8217;ll spread like a cancer 
But you&#8217;re gonna have to answer 
To your heart and the Bible Belt</p>

					<h3>Western attempts to bring China to its knees&#8230;

<p>(Update below: Western chemical warfare in Syria, then staged it with Press publicity to blame the Syria government.)</p>
 
<p>The arrest of a Canadian and wife bringing into China, 2013, vials of bacteria. Both worked for a US laboratory. See (dated) <a href="http://finance.people.com.cn/BIG5/n/2013/0408/c1004-21048781.html">news report</a>, in Chinese.</p>
<p>*</p>
 
<p>*</p>
<p>For seven months US-backed and financed pro-democrat politicians and their Black Shirt stormtroopers rioted and, in the above, firebombed the Bank of China. Their demand: Hong Kong end all ties and relationships with the Mainland, declare independence and pledge allegiance to America. Or else&#8230;</p>
<p>*</p>
 
<p>*</p>
<p>Two IED bombs planted by pro-US Black Shirts in Hong Kong exploded at the Shenzhen-Hong Kong immigration checkpoint. A third bomb failed to detonate. The Democrats&#8217; demand: Shut down the city or they will kill more people.</p>
<p>Below, a designated hospital building in Hong Kong, intended as an isolation unit for 2019-nCoV patients, was firebombed the same day as the explosions, Jan 28.</p>
<p>Even though paid for with dollars, Made-in-Hong Kong bombs are cumbersome and slow. Sometimes they don&#8217;t explode and there are so many Chinese to kill.

</p>
<h3>When riots in HK don&#8217;t work, plant germs</h3>
<p>&#8230;in the heart of China.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>A Brief History of biological warfare against Chinese (Excerpts from sources: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1200679/">Report on Biological warfare and bioterrorism</a>; <a href="http://cup.columbia.edu/book/hidden-atrocities/9780231183529">Jeanne Guillemin&#8217;s Hidden Atrocities;</a> The Telegraph, 2010 Jun, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/northkorea/7811949/Did-the-US-wage-germ-warfare-in-Korea.html">US wage germ warfare in Korea</a>.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Japan conducted biological weapons research from approximately 1932 until the end of World War II. The program was under the direction of Shiro Ishii (1932&#8211;1942) and Kitano Misaji (1942&#8211;1945). Several military units existed for research and development of biological warfare. The center of the Japanese biowarfare program was known as &#8220;Unit 731&#8221; and was located in Manchuria near the town of Pingfan. The Japanese program consisted of more than 150 buildings in Pingfan, 5 satellite camps, and a staff of more than 3000 scientists. Organisms and diseases of interest to the Japanese program were B. anthracis, Neisseria meningitidis, Vibrio cholerae, Shigella spp, and Yersiniapestis. More than 10,000 prisoners are believed to have died as a result of experimental infection during the Japanese program between 1932 and 1945.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In addition to the experiments conducted on prisoners in the camps of Unit 731, the Japanese military developed plague as a biological weapon by allowing laboratory fleas to feed on plague infected rats (<a class=" bibr popnode" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1200679/#B14">14</a>). On several occasions, the fleas were released from aircraft over Chinese cities to initiate plague epidemics. However, the Japanese had not adequately prepared, trained, or equipped their own military personnel for the hazards of biological weapons. An attack on the city of Changteh in 1941 reportedly led to approximately 10,000 casualties due to biological weapons.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In the aftermath of World War II, the Allied intent to bring Axis crimes to light led to both the Nuremberg trials and their counterpart in Tokyo, the International Military Tribunal of the Far East. Yet the Tokyo Trial failed to prosecute imperial Japanese leaders for the worst of war crimes: inhumane medical experimentation, including vivisection and open-air pathogen and chemical tests, which rivaled Nazi atrocities, as well as mass attacks using plague, anthrax, and cholera that killed thousands of Chinese civilians.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>During the Korean War, the Soviet Union, China, and North Korea accused the USA of using agents of biological warfare against North Korea (1, 18). In later years the USA admitted that it had the capability of producing such weapons, although it denied having used them. However, the credibility of the USA was undermined by its failure to ratify the Geneva Protocol of 1925, by public acknowledgment of its own offensive biological warfare program, and by suspicions of collaboration with former Unit 731 scientists. &#8230; Washington decision makers, supported by the American occupation leader, General Douglas MacArthur, sought to acquire Japan&#8217;s biological-warfare expertise to gain an advantage over the Soviet Union, suspected of developing both biological and nuclear weapons. Ultimately, U.S. national-security goals left the victims of Unit 731 without vindication.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>One afternoon in early March, 1952, Yun Chang Bin was walking home from school when he saw Chinese troops on their hands and knees in the fields. Standing close to the same spot today, he indicates with a sweep of his hand where they were collecting small objects from the frozen ground. &#8216;There were about 30 or 40 of the Chinese volunteer troops spread out across the field,&#8217; Yun, now 72, says. &#8216;They were wearing masks and gloves and some of them had brooms. They were sweeping up something from the ground and others were picking it up and putting it on a fire.&#8217; Curious, Yun approached the soldiers and asked some of the adults who had gathered what was going on. He recalls being told, &#8216;They are catching flies. They came out of the bombs dropped by the American bastards.&#8217; The bombs, Yun explained, had opened &#8211; rather than detonated, as conventional weapons would have done &#8211; after hitting the ground and released thousands of insects, the like of which Yun had never seen before. &#8230;</li>
</ul>
<p>Even before Chinese troops had entered the fray in October 1950, the US Joint Chiefs of Staff had authorised the use of atomic weapons against targets within China if their troops became embroiled in the conflict. And even though the famously aggressive Gen Douglas MacArthur argued for their use, President Truman withheld permission. Historians argue that a nuclear detonation, impossible to conceal from the eyes of the world, would have increased tensions between East and West, but a more insidious form of warfare would have been relatively easy to carry out, and much simpler to dismiss as enemy disinformation.</p>

<ul>
<li id="__p22">Reports regarding offensive research repeatedly occurred in the 1960s and 1970s, although officially the Soviet Union claimed not to possess any biological or chemical weapons. Other allegations occurred during the post-World War II period:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>The Chinese alleged that the USA caused a cholera epidemic in Hong Kong in 1961.</li>
<li>In 1969, Egypt accused the &#8220;imperialistic aggressors&#8221; of using biological weapons in the Middle East, specifically causing an epidemic of cholera in Iraq in 1966</li>
</ol>

<p>THE DAY THEY DROPPED BOMBS THAT DON&#8217;T EXPLODE</p>
<p><span class="caption">Koreans Yun Chang Bin and Un Tong Sik recall a time during the Korean War when US Air Force planes dropped bombs that won&#8217;t explode but cracked open to release insects. Days later, a disease spread silently in the village and farms. Both their fathers died as a result. But most were Chinese volunteer soldiers who were ensconced in the village waiting for the US advance, helped by British and Australian troops.</span></p>
<p><span class="caption">This was the same tactic the Japanese used at the closing stages of WWII, dropping canisters in Fujian, Jiangxi and Zheijiang. These released rats and fleas bearing bubonic plague. </span></p>
<p><span class="caption">Personal disclosure: Three members of my family, two generations prior, died from the germ warfare with painful buboes on the thighs and groins as big as ping pong balls. Half the village population was exterminated especially because, at war time, there was no medical help, no doctors, nothing. Jews killed by Germans or Palestinians by Jews &#8212; a bullet in the head or gas into the lungs &#8212; had a faster death than Chinese. 
</span></p>
<p>Today, the preferred Western germ attack specie is called, virus. Perhaps because it spreads easier and faster, therefore killing more. They are 1.4 billion to kill, you see, so what would be the most effective &#8212; using Jho Low-Wharton and <a href="https://twitter.com/yeobeeyin?lang=en">Yeo Bee Yin</a>&#8216;s cost-benefit analysis?</p>
<p>*</p>
 
<p>THE DANISH BANALITY OF EVIL</p>
<p>Even Denmark has signed up with the Germans and the Americans to kill Chinese. Must be in their common Aryan blood. With blood, reason is unnecessary. Killing Jews didn&#8217;t need a reason. (To understand that, listen to <a href="https://youtu.be/wmBSIQ1lkOA">Hannah Arendt&#8217;s &#8216;final speech&#8217;:</a> &#8220;The greatest evil in the world is committed by men without motives, without wicked hearts.) Being Jew is good enough to be killed. So, too, being Chinese today.</p>
<p>This hatred for and pogrom against Chinese (previously, Japan, Indonesia, Malaysia) is so widespread that it breeds in US colleges, especially among students who want to be &#8216;journalists&#8217;. See, for example, the Anglophile <a href="https://twitter.com/hui_wingting?lang=en">Frances Hui</a>. Or in Malaysia, <a href="http://lifeofaannie.blogspot.com/">Lady Annie</a>.</p>

<h3>UPDATE: WUHAN </h3>
<p>Below, the new Wuhan virus hospital, three days after breaking ground. Originally it was intended for 1,000 beds. Now, 1,600 beds, with no change to schedule for completion date Feb. 1, Saturday, then to receive patients on Feb. 3. Only the Chinese can do it, No?</p>
 
 
<p>The hospital on Wednesday night of Jan 29.</p>
<p>*</p>
<h3>UPDATE: HUANGGANG</h3>
<p>The new 1,000-bed Dabie Mountain Regional Medical Center has opened to patients just 48 hours after workers and volunteers refitted an empty building in the city of Huanggang, population 9 million. Like Wuhan nearby to the west, Huanggang is also under quarantine.</p>

<p>This is how a &#8216;dear&#8217; reader reached this website, searching for: &#8220;biblical comments about ncov virus 2020&#8220;. Biblical comments? Yes, of course, fire, brimstone and the flu. I wonder if that wandering King of Jews Jesus ever had the flu.</p>

					<h3>Statistics Update</h3>
 
<p>China cases only. Left to right: Confirmed cases, suspected, cured cases, deaths. (See <a href="https://shuzheng.wordpress.com/2020/01/28/annies-prayer-inside-wuhan-steven-virus-gan-qa-update-virus-news/">this for explanation</a>.)</p>
<h3>*</h3>
<p>HOW THE WEST TURNED HEALTH INTO A FREEDOM ISSUE, LIKE HK RIOTS</p>
<p>Anglophile Hong Kong, its &#8216;pro-democrat&#8217; politicians and Black Shirt stormtroopers have, like fascists in the West and America, turned this epidemic into a political and racial issue:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8216;Unless Chinese are prohibited from Hong Kong, they will kill more people.&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As proof of their intent, they exploded three IED devices (below) at the Shenzhen-HK immigration checkpoint, Jan 28.</p>
<p>Also see this: <a href="https://shuzheng.wordpress.com/2020/01/24/west-canada-employ-germ-warfare-against-china-update-lying-facts/">The West wages germ warfare on China</a>. And see bottom of post about Denmark: Using the virus to spread hatred against and to attack China.</p>
<p>In Malaysia, a person who spreads fake news is <a href="https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/508743">arrested</a>. In Hong Kong, nobody, not even the police, dare touch those who spread hatred and lies. Fake news, but actually published in the mass media, namely US-funded Apple Daily, say for example 112,000 people are dead in Wuhan and 2.8 million are infected, but that the information is suppressed by a tyrannical, commie government in China. This &#8216;news&#8217; is redistributed over WhatsApp and online chat forums, sowing terror, heightening demands on the HK government, a motherfucking useless thing, to shut down the city completely. This is the exact, same xenophobic and fascist object of the riots, of Joshua Wong, Claudia Bowring and other fellow travellers, both in the Press and in political, establishment circles. (See endnote.)</p>
<p>Hence, thousands of fake news turn up daily on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, WhatsApp, and on dedicated &#8216;Yellow&#8217; political websites, all protected by &#8216;pro-democrat&#8217; politicians who say that any attempt at police investigation to curb this &#8216;freedom of expression&#8217; or to close such a website is an act against human rights and freedom, therefore subject to individual US sanctions under recently passed Congressional law.</p>
<p>In other words, the start of the HK riots in the name of human rights and freedom has now led to this situation: utter lawlessness. This is the same fraudulent argument packaged into so-called &#8216;news&#8217;, although that&#8217;s faked, are then promoted and distributed under the banner of free Press on behalf of US democracy and freedom by US-financed Steven Gan, Mkini, Reuters, CNN et al.</p>
<p>Make sense?</p>
 
<p>Endnote: Democracies, America in particular, make up the biggest culprit in suppressing news. Trump lied therefore spread fake news that nobody was injured or died in the Iran missile attack; now we know about 50 were hurt, of who 10 suffered severe head concussions. Flu had infected 13 million with 6,600 deaths in the first month of this year (<a href="https://shuzheng.wordpress.com/2020/01/24/west-canada-employ-germ-warfare-against-china-update-lying-facts/">see this</a>). Read about it from Reuters or Mkini?</p>
<p>So far the received wisdom is that if Steven Gan doesn&#8217;t report an event then China is suppressing news. Wrong. Flip the argument around. The refusal by Anglophile Press to report (on America, for example) represents fake news. It is fake in its fraudulent behavior, and that against its own ethics, to state the facts.</p>
 
 
<h3>***</h3>
 
<p>*</p>
<p>SARS 2003 distribution pattern: It lasted four months, beginning-to-end, Feb to Jun. Apply the same argument to the current 2019-nCOV, you can replicate nearly the same timeline and fluctuations though not necessarily the same numbers. Doing that you know the present epidemic should wear out by May or even one or two months earlier given that medical technology has improved and the SARS experience had offered lessons. Therefore? Don&#8217;t be misled, alarmed or put off by the rising numbers of infections and death: we are in the first month stage (March in the chart above).</p>
<p>*</p>
<h3>VIRAL INFORMATION</h3>
<h3>WITHOUT THE NEWS &amp; VIEWS</h3>
<p>Here are the takeaway points in the interview with <span class="style-scope yt-formatted-string" dir="auto">Rolf Hilgenfeld, <span class="st">L&#252;beck</span> University, Germany (clip below):</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Virus epidemics don&#8217;t last forever. At some point, typically a few months, the virus exhaust itself and this nasty business will die a quiet death. This is not, heaven forbid, Steven Gan&#8217;s &#8216;view&#8217; point or Internet opinion from unemployable, freelance YouTube motherfuckers. It is an empirical, historical fact. (Chart above.)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The current coronavirus is 82 percent genome-identical with SARS. The implications of that are as follows:</li>
</ul>
<p>1. it becomes easier to identify the protease structure in 2019-nCoV and thereby create, by copying, a vaccine or a treatment drug;</p>
<p>2. Wuhan hospitals can go straight away, and are doing so, to use protease inhibitors for treatment, that is a combo of anti-HIV and anti-Hepatitis C drugs, both been applied previously on SARS patients. (Protease is a low class of proteins. Inhibitors are so-called because these drugs, originally developed not for coronavirus treatment, are used to inhibit, that is, prevent replication of the protein/protease base in the virus. No replication, no rebirth, no protein, no life, no virus. It&#8217;s all very karmic.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Some other types of anti-coronavirus drugs are available but not in sufficient, mass-use quantities. The immediate problem is to have as many of these drugs ahead of any outbreak. But, to have the drug ready, ahead of the virus is like predicting the characteristics of the bird before egg is hatched: How do you know what might come out of the egg found in the barn? How do you know the next virus? Because if you&#8217;d, you would be god, able to see in advance its crystal-like protease structure and in spite of its mutation. This is not a chicken-egg problem. Science, medical treatment in particular, is always a post-hoc phenomenon and not mental massage from arguments among stupid Yankee and Hongkie democrat politician-motherfuckers make with their spittle and verbiage about freedom and democracy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Listen to the interview, below. You&#8217;d understand more, get more information about virus, origin, spread, tracking and remedy than a million hours reading trash in Reuters or Guardian or Mkini or listening for hours to Canadian and Australian yada, yada fart.</p>
 
<p>*</p>
 
<p>*</p>
<p>Where is the damn cause?</p>
 
<p><span class="style-scope yt-formatted-string" dir="auto">Above, samples from Wuhan&#8217;s Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market show the same nucleic acid as the 2019-nCoV strain, according to the National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention. This shows an association (similar nucleic acid) of parallel facts simultaneously coexisting between the market and the 2019-nCoV epidemic, an event sometimes called &#8216;phenomenological correlation&#8217;, phenomenological coming from the philosophical discipline called phenomenology (Husserl, Hegel, Frege). 
</span></p>
<p>The samples didn&#8217;t show that the market virus caused the epidemic nor is the market virus the parent gene of the 2019-nCoV because if they sampled from, say, a similar market in Guangdong or Timbuktu they just might find the same nuclei acid. (Here is a sliver of evidence on the above, a piece of news suppressed: &#8216;<a href="http://malaysiansmustknowthetruth.blogspot.com/2020/01/global-panic-as-tour-bus-driver-in.html">TOUR BUS DRIVER IN JAPAN WHO HAS NOT VISITED WUHAN GETS CORONAVIRUS</a>&#8216;)</p>
<p><span class="style-scope yt-formatted-string" dir="auto">Correlation is not empirical evidence of causality. A causal relationship, and a direct one at that, happens when I bring a hammer down on an egg, it shatters into a thousand pieces. My action caused the egg&#8217;s destruction, not the hammer, because the same result could be had with a karate chop. 
</span></p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Xi Jinping is personally in charge.</p>
 
<p>*</p>

<p>*</p>
 
<p>The name of the Danish newspaper is Jyllands-Posten. Remember its infamy?</p>
<h3>THE STINK CALLED DENMARK</h3>
<p>With freedom of the Press and with human rights, they can do no wrong and suffer no consequences in the same way their &#8216;like-minded&#8217; in Hong Kong terrorize the street, beat up people, torch the shops and set alight passers-by with complete impunity.</p>
<p>Almost certainly the editors of Jyllands-Posten find something heroic and noble in these Hong Kong rioters: there is safety in numbers. If a thousand come out every night to wreck and destroy the city, then so many can&#8217;t be wrong. No, they are the Chosen Ones.</p>
<p>Almost certainly, therefore, the editors are doing that for the Black Shirt rioters of Hong Kong who yesterday, Jan. 28, exploded three IED devices near the Shenzhen-Hong Kong immigration checkpoint, after which also threatened to blow up the innocent unless the government ban all mainland Chinese, never mind where-from, from entering because of the virus. Does that make sense to you?</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Is this anymore a surprise? No. For some reason, China&#8217;s existence whether in good times or in bad, the West has something about China to spit on, as if the Chinese had stolen things from them or Chinese had gone around detonating bombs under their beds and in their schools.</p>
<p>Of course, they did say this is Press freedom and that the depiction is merely satire, as if they find it funny thousands are dying and as if there is no other way to depict the humanitarian crisis China faces. Instead, they will politicize it: using the flag isn&#8217;t just a political act of condemnation but it was also a message to the world that China exports death.</p>
<p>Small wonder the Islamists hate White people and want to kill Danish and Germans and Americans, indeed any White guy who, never mind if they won&#8217;t help, but that they had never learned to respect other people. In the name of freedom, they have no common decency, a moral bottom line much less, their God being declared dead and all. Freedom enables them to threw around abuses and insults as they like; after all, their governments can&#8217;t touch them. Freedom and human rights are entitlements that must include, or it is not freedom, to instigate hatred and death.</p>
<p>Does that make sense to you?</p>
<p>The world seen from Denmark is a biblical voodoo formulation regurgitated in Shakespearean illusions of black or white. Believe and all these things shall be given unto you: On the one side is the belief in Jesus, Truth, Justice, Love, Joy, Freedom, Freud, Jyllands-Posten, Hillary Clinton and, on the other, Demons, Lucifer, Guilt, Darkness, Totalitarianism, Stalin. No choices are necessary. The editors of Jyllands-Posten know before they were born which side they are on so that it would be doing their side a favor if they put down the opposite one. If there is no Soviet Union as demon, China is an approximate replacement &#8212; and an inferior side anyway, inferior not only in the intellect but also in our skin color, the chopsticks we use, the music we play, the architecture in our buildings, all of which are today revealed in the cruel, silent death we bring to the world.</p>
<p>The thinking has already been done for Danish editors, the line drawn clearly 300, 400 years ago when White Europeans discover that their side is not alone in this world and so couldn&#8217;t leave other peoples alone. &#8220;Go forth, be fruitful and multiply,&#8221; they were commanded.</p>
<p>But, why do they do it? For the same reason German and Danish Aryans have no qualms to shoot and gassed 4 million Jews. The Jews were on the wrong side of Jyllands-Posten. Their racism haven&#8217;t gone away, only passed on to the German inheritors in such persons as foreign minister <span class="st">Heiko Maas, feting Hong Kong fascist radicals in Joshua Wong and others. The Joshuas are on their Jesus, freedom&#8217;s side, those Anglophiles colonized in the mind and heart. Another political short hand term for the side of Jyllands-Posten is called fascism.</span></p>
<p>Still want to believe, like Steven Gan and Rais Hussin and Lady Annie do, that White people are clever, generous and Christian? That the Islamists have no justification, none at all, to kill as many White people as they can lay their hands on?</p>
<p>But, we are more patient than the Islamists. Wait, we say: Wait till you&#8217;re ready. Wait till the conditions are ripe. Payback time will come, invariably. It&#8217;s in the nature of things.</p>

<h1>DISINFECTING HONGKIES</h1>
<p>*</p>
<p><a href="http://lifeofaannie.blogspot.com/">Lady Annie</a> likes prayers and believes in them. In times like this, she ought to pray &#8212; double time &#8212; particularly for her &#8216;Freedom Fighters of Hong Kong&#8217;.</p>
<p>But, pray to who? Well&#8230; anyone, really. Here&#8217;s a Christian suggestion&#8230;</p>
<p>ANNIE&#8217;S PRAYER</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Jesus, May all the Yellow politicians of Anglophile Hong Kong, their entire families, mothers, fathers, wives, husbands, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters, their hangers-on, their <a href="https://twitter.com/RamyInocencio/status/1124706371390312448">LGBT partners, motherfuckers</a>, their <a href="https://twitter.com/RamyInocencio">Twitter and Facebook followers</a>, their Press and Blogspot propagandists &#8212; <a href="http://lifeofaannie.blogspot.com/2020/01/things-not-to-do-as-you-celebrate-cny.html">excluding me Lady Annie</a>, Dear Lord, and please remember that &#8212; but not forgetting, of course, their Black Shirt cockroaches be dead. May they be dead, their corpses littered like a thousand stinking, putrefying dead rats on Mongkok streets when this thing is over. Amen.

<p>The Update</p>
<h3>When the virus is the news, Mkini the carrier 
</h3>
 
<p>Mkini, Reuters, others, helped by Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube have been concocting news on Hong Kong the last seven months. There was never a day without fraudulent information &#8212; a nugget of news stuck into a mass of what&#8217;s essentially propaganda. (For eg, you see the propaganda permanently lodged on the front of <a href="http://lifeofaannie.blogspot.com/">Lady Annie&#8217;s website</a>.) Almost second nature to Anglophile editors, the method is very effective.</p>
<p>It is the stuff of what&#8217;s called fiction writing, only 10 percent, or 1, have to be true and the entire book of fiction is believed to be true. 
</p>
<p>In the present information dissemination on the coronavirus, the viral method is the same as the virus spread: stick a poisoned seed into someone, typically the fake bundled into a sliver of news, then letting it grow and spread from there.</p>
<p>As in the reports on the HK riots, the target is the same: China.</p>
<p>What on earth did we Chinese did to them in their previous lives, or had we stolen from them in the present?</p>
<p>*</p>
<h3>STEVIE&#8217;S FAKE NEWS AND VIEWS</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/508523">Banning Chinese</a>?</p>
<p>Yes, please. And not only that. Prohibit all trade with China &#8212; today, and forever. After that, ban all Malaysians from going to China, end all flights.</p>
<p>Indeed, organize another online petition, promoted by Free Press <a href="https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/508523">Malaysiakini</a>, signed by all Malaysians, with Steven Gan leading the way, to pass a law that declares for the next 50 years all Chinese persona non-grata and all trade illegal, including but not restricted to Mandarin oranges.</p>
<p>Please include those travelling with passports from Hong Kong and remember to headline the petition with the rotating slogans</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;Fight for Freedom&#8221;,</li>
<li>&#8220;Liberate Hong Kong, Revolution of our Times,&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;Five Demands, Not One Less,&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;Speak Truth to Power,&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;News and Views.&#8221;</li>

<p>We Chinese swear we won&#8217;t object. Not only that, we&#8217;ll post said petition for Stevie on QQ, WeChat, Baidu.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/508570">Viral fake news</a>, Stevie?</p>
<p>Malaysiakini is chief purveyor and originator of fake news on China. I have lost count the number of cases Mkini has made up or had distributed on behalf of others, typically Harapan politicians, starting with Mahathir Mohamad, Rais Hussin and Yeo Bee Yin. And that statement isn&#8217;t an opinion; it is a matter of empirical fact.</p>
<p>You know what is an empirical fact, Stevie Anglophile boy?</p>

<h1>EIGHT QUESTIONS 
</h1>
<p>*</p>
<p>If you want to know about the virus <span class="ILfuVd NA6bn c3biWd"><span class="e24Kjd">2019-nCoV</span></span>, and can&#8217;t read Chinese, where do you go? To Steven &#8216;Speak Truth to Power&#8217; Gan and to &#8216;News and Views&#8217; Malaysiakini?</p>
<p>Which then raises the question, why? Why do you think Mkini is the go-to place? It&#8217;s reliable? Or, Steven Gan speaks truth to power? Why do you think he &#8216;speaks truth to power&#8217;? Because he said so? Because he&#8217;s the next prophet? Because he knows what is truth and you don&#8217;t? Why would you think that? Where do you think Stevie gets his information? From Reuters? And where did Reuters get their information? From &#8216;reliable hospital sources&#8217; who work cleaning toilets in Tanjung Rambutan? Or is it that hospital sources in the orderlies at Universiti Hospital?</p>
<p>You get the point&#8230;.</p>
<p>Really, it is time: Malaysian news consumers should learn to be smart instead of being so gullible and trusting, all because some Aussie fucker named Steven Gan said he speaks &#8216;truth to power&#8217;. What if he next says, he is the new prophet Mohammad, sent from Gabriel angel, and you will kneel before him and offer your daughters for his Anglophile prick?</p>
<p>As it stands, there are enough stupid motherfuckers on the Net to last anyone a million lifetimes.</p>
<p>But&#8230; search no more.</p>
<p>Below is what you need to know, in Q and A format. The information is derived from clinical sources in Wuhan. Clinical means and refers to actual interviews with the infected (and not Mkini-type invented &#8216;hospital sources&#8217; garbage). That description includes the results from treatment, collated from hundreds of patient in several hospitals, spread over two weeks, then tabulated in a database.</p>
<p>Originally culled from Wuhan hospitals, the information was passed on and deposited on QQ and Baidu, then <a href="https://beyondnews852.com/20200124/63121/">reproduced here</a>, but in Chinese. I shall translate only a few relevant points. Where I have added further information, it is stated.</p>

<p>Eight key questions on the new coronavirus</p>
 
<p>1. <span class="tlid-translation translation" lang="en"><span class="" title="">Person-to-person transmissions were found in two categories, named &#8220;Limited&#8221; and &#8220;Persistent&#8221;</span></span></p>
<p><span class="" title="">Academician Zhong Nanshan is leader of a high-level expert group from the National Health and Medical Commission. On January 20 he disclosed, for the first time, that the coronavirus transmits from person to person. Clinical investigations conducted by the team on an existing patient population revealed that the infection followed two distinct transmission routes: 
</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span title="">Limited transmission <span class="tlid-translation translation" lang="en"><span class="" title="">(above image, left side)</span></span>: This </span><span class="" title="">refers to a situation when the primary, first-stage infection is accidental. (My note: We don&#8217;t know who is the original host/carrier, but let&#8217;s call him/her the primary infection Person A.) From that initial infection the virus does not immediately pass on to others who Person A comes into contact. Likewise, if Person B picks up the virus from A, only one in several persons in contact with B is likely to be infected. 
</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span title="">Case example of a limited transmission: A Japanese patient being treated for pneumonia in a Wuhan hospital on New Year&#8217;s Day was infected. While the virus was in incubation, h</span><span title="">e returned to Japan, arriving January 6th. Four days later on Jan 10th, he went to a hospital in Japan for treatment of the new virus infection. On Jan 16th he was confirmed to be carrying the virus. This meant that in the two weeks to Jan 16th, the Japanese had come in contact with </span><span title="">hundreds of people, including persons in Japan. Yet, to-date, not a single person has come forward with the symptoms of the infection.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span title="">Persistent transmission (image, right side): This is a high-risk transmission. </span><span title="">A single carrier can infect two, these two spreading to four in a determined, predictable geometric progression. 
</span></li>
</ul>
<p>(My note: What does two transmission routes say about the virus and its transmission properties, such as its ability to stay alive when outside the host? Does this reflect virus genetic differences, or carrier resistance? Does this reflect the fact that some strains have retained their original genetic sequence, unmutated, thereby limiting the efficiency to jump from person-to-person? Team experts will have to research into these varied aspects for some clear answers. Also see Question/Answer No. 8) </p>

<p><span class="tlid-translation translation" lang="en"><span class="" title="">3. Which mask should I buy?</span></span></p>
<p><span class="" title="">From a microbiological standpoint, the best choice is a compliant, non-breathing anti-particulate mask, but this mask is sultry when worn.</span> <span class="" title="">Where the risk of pathogen infection is high, choose a medical surgical mask.</span></p>
<p><span title="">Medical surgical masks have standard requirements: bacterial filtration efficiency and particle filtration efficiency. Although the mask cannot effectively block aerosols, it can prevent infection from spread of droplets, and this is sufficient.</span></p>
<p><span title="">Other than picking the right mask, wear it properly. </span><span title="">Read carefully the wearing instructions on the package and confirm for tightness.</span> <span title="">If you wear glasses and fog appears on the lenses, then the mask is not worn properly.</span></p>

<p><span title="">This remains the most likely conclusion because the first cases were found in a wild-animal market, and there were also infections of </span><span title="">other vertebrates.</span></p>

<p><span class="" title="">Continue to accept all normal deliveries a</span><span title="">lthough the virus can survive for a period of time after leaving the host.

<p><span title="">At home or in offices, leave windows open.

<p><span class="tlid-translation translation" lang="en"><span class="" title="">8. Where do we go from here?</span></span></p>
<p><span class="" title="">Once the virus is lodged in the human body, mutation will continue in the host and with that transmission of the virus. Genetic mutation has the purpose of increasing the survival chances of the virus through increased virulence and infection capability. P</span><span title="">revention and control of virus spread are most critical at this juncture.</span></p>
<p><span class="" title="">Plan ahead, stay away from wild game, avoid crowds, and take precautions with protective wear. </span><span class="" title="">Fewer the people are infected, the less likely the virus can spread, thereby limiting its ability to multiply by mutating into a pathogenic human strain.</span> <span class="" title="">Protecting yourself, you also protect family, friends, and everyone else.</span></p>
<p>(My notes: Darwin&#8217;s natural selection theory explains the above clearer. Begin with the idea that life always demand to find a way. In Hegel, it&#8217;s called Will to Life. Hence, flowers bloom in deserts. Birds show up seemingly from nowhere when you plant trees around your house. The trouble with this and other viruses is that they kill their hosts, us humans. Killing the hosts, kill themselves, an antithetical notion to life finding its way. At the rate of killing the hosts, the virus, as a life form, will be extinct. But, in natural selection, this problem, plus its short life span, is counteract by genetic mutation, the purpose being to birth at a faster rate, adapt to new hosts when they jump hosts, thereby to ensure its survival. Medical science aims to severe one of those chain links.)</p>

<p>In medical technology, a virus has first to be isolated, that is, separated from other bacteria. This is easier said than done, a process analogous to finding a needle in a haystack. But it was achieved on Jan. 10, after which the genetic sequence of the virus was mapped out. With this genetic sequence, it was therefore possible to say if a patient is infected or not infected. Another 10 days was needed to develop and produce a standard test kit that you see in the clip above. By which time, we were into Jan 22, two days or three before the Spring New Year. Factory production and shipments took another day or two, depending on distance.</p>
<p>Without the test kit, the alternative virus identification procedure typically in use is laborious and time consuming, patient by patient, sample by sample then sent to a laboratory. With the standardized test kit, testing is in-situ, the results available within two hours, so it was possible to mass check all suspected cases. All of this goes to explain the spike in virus cases these past two, three days.</p>
<p>Instead of understanding the rather basic medical science, reporters and editors in the past two days churn out garbage and irrationality like the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Australians &#8216;don&#8217;t know what we&#8217;re up against&#8217; (Sky News, Australia),</li>
<li>China coronavirus death toll jumps despite lockdowns (DW, Germany),</li>
<li>China instigates &#8216;unprecedented&#8217; lockdown (ABC, Australia),</li>
<li class="style-scope ytd-rich-grid-video-renderer">Coronavirus Is Worse Than You&#8217;ve Been Told (PeakP, USA).</li>
</ul>
<p>We Chinese know why, of course, they are doing this: It&#8217;s called racism because notice all of them come from the White, western world, with Anglophile Hong Kong closely behind and from whence you <a href="https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/508570">read this</a>. One Hongkie even spread the news, via Apple Daily, that 90,000 have died and the &#8216;communist regime&#8217; is suppressing the news.</p>
<p>Especially in a medical emergency, White people and Anglophiles won&#8217;t pass the opportunity to undermine China&#8217;s reputation in the world, its credibility and standing, and generally to spit at us.</p>
<p>The only thing left and waiting done is to label the viral outbreak as a consequence of a dictatorial, commie, one-party rule in China. But, we&#8217;ll leave that to BBC, CNN, Reuters and Steven Gan to make that stick.</p>

					<h3>An Answer to Killing the Virus?</h3>
<p>Viruses in themselves don&#8217;t kill. We know that from the cold and sneeze we get. In the case of the <span class="ILfuVd NA6bn c3biWd"><span class="e24Kjd">2019-nCoV</span></span>, its main problem is the multiplication and spread inside the cells, thick like sugar coagulation in condensed milk, and so starving cells of oxygen in blood and rendering the organs, heart, lungs, almost fatigue and impotent. The result is respiratory and/or heart failure, the latter most common among the old.</p>
<p>Another analogy to the above description in virus deaths is this: Mental impotence from daily inundation of Malaysiakini US-style propaganda by news. It actually switches off your critical cognition. You become a zombie and can&#8217;t tell which part that is news and the part propaganda that&#8217;s intended to sway your feelings. You die reading, more limpid than Stevie&#8217;s dick.</p>
<p>Conventional treatment of virus has largely been passive, more upper class than treating cold, with injections of anti-viral drugs coupled with respiratory support. After which it is to wait &#8212; until the viruses die inside the body, I suppose. The most common trouble is that, while waiting, the heart or lungs or both fail, usually from a combination of overwork and that they themselves had been poisoned.</p>
<p>Doctors in Wuhan may have make a breakthrough: using extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, ECMO in short.</p>
<p>The principle in its development and use is straightforward. Wiki&#8217;s definition of ECMO-use is this: &#8220;prolonged cardiac and respiratory support to persons whose heart and lungs are unable to provide an adequate amount of gas exchange or perfusion to sustain life.&#8221; (See, in baby cases, <a href="https://amsect.smithbucklin.com/JECT/PDFs/1979_volume11/issue1/ject_1979_v11_n1_bartlett.pdf">Bartlett, Fong, et al,</a> UC Irvine, 1979).</p>
<p>That statement alone should suggest to you that ECMO is largely used in two common situations</p>
<ul>
<li>(a) in cardiac-bypass surgeries, such as before or after a heart attack, and</li>
<li>(b) for new-born babies whose hearts and/or lungs aren&#8217;t strong to keep baby going. (You see this from tubes protruding into hospital incubators.)</li>
</ul>
<p>But, the uses in those cases say little about:</p>
<ul>
<li>(a) what does that do for patients with heart and lungs as strong as a bull, and</li>
<li>(b) what about the virus?</li>
</ul>
<p>We don&#8217;t have definitive answers to those questions. But they have since been resolved from a trial ECMO treatment producing the following a posteriori outcome (= inductive conclusion derived from after the event/fact):</p>
<ul>
<li>By taking over the role of the heart and lungs, ECMO pumps oxygenated blood into the heart for redistribution to the body, and this blood is uncontaminated by the virus;</li>
<li>Bypassing the lungs for oxygen, cells are not regulated in the amount of oxygen intake. Instead, they work overtime like a kitchen sponge with the resulting effect, though unintended, of actually drowning the viruses in gas before they can multiply. (Recall that white blood cells have no defense or offense against these viruses.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Images below show simplified, schematic and photographic representations of the ECMO machine treatment.</p>
 
 
<p>*</p>
<p>The case (clip below) of the Hong Kong man in the Wuhan hospital is instructive. He was in hospital for two weeks, and his condition seemingly deteriorated beyond recovery. It was at this moment they tried ECMO and viola!</p>
<p>There was an earlier case of full recovery in Zhejiang province (next clip), but Hongkie is, as far as we know, the first from ECMO treatment. Here though are some problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>(a) hundreds of these machines are needed at the same time since (i) the patient has to be plugged into the machine for an extended period, as you might expect, but (ii) no patient can wait for treatment and this machine isn&#8217;t commonly available because it&#8217;s been so rarely used,</li>
<li>(b) specialized training is required to operate it &#8212; a jumble of pressure pumps, tubes, gauges, membranes, gas tanks, blood bags&#8230;. Using it requires a hybrid of engineering, technical and medical knowledge, and</li>
<li>(c) blood, tankfuls of matching blood type, to service hundreds of patients simultaneously.</li>
</ul>
<p>Wuhan, ECMO recovery</p>
 
<p>Zhejiang recovery.</p>

<p>Official name of coronavirus: <span class="ILfuVd NA6bn c3biWd"><span class="e24Kjd">2019-nCoV</span></span></p>
<p>The site above also provides numbers for emergency assistance and response if you need help in China (have someone who can speak Mandarin, taxi driver for example or colleague). The fatality rate is under 3 in 100 cases, far lower than the 6.5% of 13 million flu cases detected in the US and 6,600 deaths but go unreported.</p>
<p>If in China, carry on as usual, there is no need to be unduly worried, only take precautions, wear a mask outside home, prefer medical mask, take daily doses of Vitamin C, 1-2 tablets, keep your throat wet by constantly taking sips of water, preferably every 15 minutes or thereabouts (the virus travel in dry conditions). If you feel unwell, with high temperature, report immediately to the nearest hospital. All hospitals have portable test kits and the test result is known within an hour. Incubation is 12 to 14 days, after which fever symptoms show.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t be intimidated by news reports, or fooled, by the English language media which, without exception, are anti-China and want to capitalize on its misfortune. Keep the statistics below in perspective; recall that China&#8217;s land area is over 4 time zones, almost 7,000 km north to south at the farthest ends, population 1.4 billion and receives 143 million visitors yearly.</p>

<p>I was <a href="https://shuzheng.wordpress.com/2020/01/25/china-to-build-1000-bed-virus-hospital-in-6-days/">wrong</a>. We are not building one hospital but two, the first with 1,000 beds. The second, also 1,000 beds, as spare.</p>
<p>*</p>
 
<h3>WE ARE MOBILIZED!</h3>
<p>The coronavirus infection is testing us as a nation, as a people, and the government in an emergency situation:&#160; When war breaks out, when we are attacked, as it is now, how will we respond? That scenario is identical to present circumstances.</p>
<p>The qualities of our responses are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>unity of purpose,</li>
<li>speed and discipline,</li>
<li>efficiency and quality.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We have the technology, the money, and the resources so that for all the above to happen, sacrifice (we are never short on volunteers) and dedication must be added to the mix. Soon enough we will know the results of this fight.</p>
<p>But, here&#8217;s the problem: as in a war, we can&#8217;t afford to fail.</p>
 
<p>The PLA army has joined in and flying into Wuhan from throughout the country.</p>
 
<p>Test kits, medicine, food, drinking water are well-stocked and guaranteed to Wuhan and Huanggang. As their duty to the nation, other suppliers have promised not to hike prices or hoard, and have instead send word to the farms and factories: this is an emergency, produce more, the nation will take all that you have!</p>
 
<p>Another batch of military medics and logistic teams from yet another province.</p>
 
<p>University medic and private practitioners in Guangdong have volunteered to enter Wuhan. Transport organized.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Below: These are cartons of medical masks donated by the public, actually overseas Chinese. A group of persons had gotten together, come up with the money, bought the stuff, then shipped them off except that the commercial flight can&#8217;t make it to Hubei. So, another group in China picked up the consignment, fly it off to the city nearest Wuhan, from where it will be taken by cargo truck with special permission. All told, the transport costs is way more expensive than the masks. Shit!</p>
 
<p>*</p>
<p>Someone saw the thing below on a Guangdong highway. I kid you not.</p>
<p> *</p>
<p>Hubei, Central China. Wuhan is the largest city but Xiangyang is the better known among us Chinese.</p>

<p>THE DAY HAS COME, MY DEAR</p>

<p>Fake news on the virus: There are plenty go round in Hong Kong, but guess who leads in the fraud and forgery? And why? Answers to both, see bottom of posts.</p>

<p>Images below: compare and contrast.</p>
 
<p>Top half of image, Anglophile nurses in Hong Kong threatening to strike if they are not immediately given an additional 16.5% cash incentive to look after infected patients. These are the same people who riot on the streets and spread fake news about China. They are also the <a href="http://lifeofaannie.blogspot.com/">Lady Annies</a> and the <a href="https://about.malaysiakini.com/people/steven-gan/">Stevie Gans</a> of Malaysia: All smiles in front, money behind.</p>
<p>Bottom half of image, mainland Chinese nurses who have volunteered to go to Wuhan to look after patients for an indefinite period without any promises of material rewards.</p>

<h3>LOOK WHO MAKES FAKE NEWS</h3>
<p>How Steven Gan&#8217;s Free Press lead the way in inventing stories, distributing racism.</p>
<p>Like US-sponsored Mkini, they will never stop maligning us (clip below). At the root of which is their Anglophile, anti-Chinese racism and bigotry, and themselves feeling superior over us.</p>
<p>Fake news have always set up China as a target. And Steven Gan says &#8216;social media&#8217; leads in fake news?</p>
<p>But who blaze the path for them, and why? Answer, mainstream media. Answer, bigotry and spreading anti-Chinese hatred.</p>
<p>Hatred is today weaponized in the Free Press as a tool to incite violence and murder across borders. You see plenty of it coming out Hong Kong &#8212; everyday from June 2019 to the present.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/508421">Infected oranges</a>, Stevie? With Reuters, CNN, BBC, and others, Stevie the motherfucker did worse: instigating not only the overthrow of Hong Kong government but for the killing of policemen after publishing and distributing false allegations &#8212; and knowing them to be false &#8212; that police were brutalizing people and China is suppressing &#8216;democracy&#8217;. You see the same CIA fingerprint in numerous media reports.</p>
<p>And that is also the same theme which CNN (clip below) manufactures and sell &#8212; that is, distributing and re-selling lies and bigotry.</p>

<p>*</p>
<p>There have been half a dozen national epidemic germ cases in China, and the most recent two have their origin strains from abroad.</p>
<p>#1 Swine Fever</p>
 
<p>*</p>
<p>#2 Present Coronavirus Flu </p>
<p>The coronavirus in China has a fatality rate of 2.25 percent out of every 100 confirmed cases. In comparison, the death rates from flu in the US (see further below) are 6.0-to-6.9 percent, that is, three times deadlier.</p>
<p>Yet&#8230; the media silence!</p>
 
 
<p>*</p>
<h1>6,600 US Deaths of US Flu</h1>
<p>Yet, you will never know (see below)&#8230;</p>
 
 
<p>*</p>
<p>You have to look very hard to find even a single news reports on 6,600 flu deaths in the USA so far this year. (A local <a href="https://www.wbbjtv.com/2020/01/21/separate-strains-cause-twist-in-fight-against-flu/">US county report here</a>.) Why so hard in an Internet age? And given especially the epidemic in the US has worldwide repercussions.</p>
<p>Last year alone, the US CDC reported 1.2 million cases and more than 42,000 deaths. Did the flu strains in China come from the USA? Was it deliberately planted? How? Who imported it? (See the Chinese news clip at top of this post. In Chinese.)</p>
<p>China is working round the clock and everyone is mobilized to deal with the problem, including spread of correct, verifiable and true information.</p>
<p>*</p>
 
<p>*</p>
<p>For above, <a href="https://www.contagionlive.com/news/cdc-reports-13-million-flu-cases-thus-far-in-201920-season">go here</a>. The 13 million US infections and 6,600 US deaths reported covers only the first 3 weeks of 2020. In spite of its pandemic scale, you never read about it &#8212; not even from WHO.</p>
<p>In contrast, 700 odd cases in China are reported by Reuters, Malaysiakini, BBC, NYT, etc as if China is culprit-in-chief, as if it breeds and export germs, and as if it is the end of the world.</p>
<p>Is the American and Anglophone Press preparing for the day to blame China for the millions of infections and deaths in the US? And, heaven forbid, the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Below is a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-51194651">BBC sample of US germ warfare, with the Anglophile Press driving the narrative: it&#8217;s &#8216;China virus&#8217;</a>. 
</p>
<p>*</p>
 
<p>*</p>
<p>Now, compare the headline and report above to the one below when the first Anglo-American Press reports on Hong Kong China, appeared in June 2019.</p>
<p>Again, it is about China mainland &#8212; not Hong Kong China &#8212; although the extradition bill had next to nothing to do with mainland China and its proposal and legislative passage are legally restricted to Hong Kong only, that is, it is a wholly local affair.</p>
<p>This time, though, the western media campaign has to do with mainland Chinese lives directly, and so they are playing it to the hilt. If a million Chinese died tomorrow from the flu, imagine how they would frame that and how they would set the tone.</p>
<p>The West couldn&#8217;t do regime change in China as it successful did in Ukraine, Georgia, Libya, Iraq, Malaysia, and most of Latin America. With the western desire to squash China remaining, squashing it like an ant, but against its size and sophistication, and against the deep-rooted loyalty of the Chinese, then the methods employed would have no moral limits &#8212; and no holds barred.</p>
<p>If you think the above assessment is an exaggeration, recall not just the intensity and duration of the Hong Kong riots, their Anglophile media coverage, but also the following:</p>

<p>Reproduced below from &#8216;<a href="https://www.contagionlive.com/news/cdc-reports-13-million-flu-cases-thus-far-in-201920-season">Contagion Live&#8217;, dated Jan 22</a>. Note though the report entirely dismisses the continuing spread of US flu, with 1.2 million cases in 2019 going up to 13 million in three weeks. Something does not come out of nothing.</p>
<p>Yet, the world&#8217;s Anglophile media say nothing, focusing all their attention on China and China only. Why?</p>
<p>Is the US a boiling cauldron of viruses? Why has the US turned itself into a virus-strain pool? 
</p>
<p>*</p>
<h3 class="detailTitle">CDC Reports 13 Million Flu Cases Thus Far in 2019-20 Season</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has released data from the second week of the 2020 influenza season. The FluView report, which includes data for the week ending January 11, 2020, indicates that influenza activity remains high, but severity is not considered high at this point in the season.</p>
<p>At this point in the season, CDC estimates indicate that there have been 13 million influenza illnesses, 120,000 hospitalizations, and 6600 flu-related deaths.</p>
<p>The CDC notes that the number of respiratory specimens that tested positive for the flu at clinical laboratories decreased over the past week from 23.6% to 22.9%. Visits to clinicians for influenza-like illness also decreased from 5.7% last week to 4.7% this week; however, activity for all US regions remain above baseline. In fact, 34 jurisdictions are experiencing high influenza-like illness activity.</p>
<p>The percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia and influenza also increased from 6.0% to 6.9%, but remains below the epidemic threshold</p>
<p>According to the report, the overall rate of influenza-associated hospitalization increased to 1.9 per 100,000. The highest rate of hospitalization has been observed among adults aged &#8805;65 (47.6 per 100,000 population), followed by children aged 0-4 years (34.4 per 100,000 population) and adults aged 50-64 years (23.2 per 100,000 population).</p>
<p>Although influenza B/Victoria viruses have been the national predominant virus this season, new data reveal that during recent weeks equal numbers of B/Victoria and A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses have been reported.</p>
<p>This past week 7 new influenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported, bringing the seasonal total to 39. According to the FluView report, 28 deaths were linked to B viruses&#8212;5 of which had their lineage determined and were B/Victoria viruses&#8212;and the other 11 deaths were associated with A viruses, 6 of which were A(H1N1)pdm09 virus-associated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, [B viruses] seems to be taking a higher toll on very young children, more so than in previous years,&#8221; Aaron E. Glatt, MD, a spokesperson for the Infectious Diseases Society of America told Contagion&#174;. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that that&#8217;s something that will continue or it&#8217;s something that is intrinsically more dangerous to children. It&#8217;s possible that they haven&#8217;t been exposed to as much influenza B in their short lives. Even if they&#8217;re relatively young, they may have seen some influenza A beforehand, and therefore, it&#8217;s something that their body has somewhat been prepared for.&#8221;</p>

<p>Postscript</p>
<h3>Propaganda is Lying over a Fact</h3>
 
<p>Above is another example of using the virus in the Anglo-American anti-China campaigns: The clip is titled &#8216;deadly virus&#8217; although the fatality rate is 4-to-5 in every 200, or 2.25 percent for confirmed infections, compared to 6-to-6.9 percent for comparable flu virus infections in the US currently. (See above.)</p>
<p>The Australian media (in the clip above) may be factual &#8212; yes, &#8216;deadly&#8217; because people do die from the virus &#8212; but it is lying about the truth because, taking the 2.25 percent fatality rate, all those who died from the infection were older than 60 and previously had serious illnesses, therefore physically vulnerable. This also means that a hundred out of a hundred others infected, whether by this virus or others, including children, will live.</p>
<p>The world has known few other vilest creatures than the Anglophone reporter, wanting to fix China.</p>
<p>Interpreted differently, therefore, the virus is nothing to sneeze about. But why is China so concerned and has quarantined 20 million? Answer: America&#8217;s determination to destroy China and kill Chinese, the direct proof of which is in the top clip above.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll not let it happen! We&#8217;ll deal with the outbreak at its roots, not only to isolate the problem but, hopefully, also to find a cure and establish, precisely, its true origins so that this cannot be used again to harm our people en masse &#8212; ever.</p>
<p>The international repercussions are just as severe, destroying China&#8217;s standing among friends while the Anglo-American Press portrays China as an exporter of death. This is an Internet task which China has no control. A solution to both the misinformation and the lies is to fix the problem at home.</p>

<h3>To Friends of China:</h3>
<h3>Chunjie &#26149;&#33410; Greetings</h3>
<p>Our people are coping as best as we can. Following are some greeting notes I was asked to pass on to Friends of China worldwide:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
<p>Quarantine: No bus, no train, no planes, no cars, no nothing, little money&#8230; but plenty of time to wait and play mahjong. Or make Harbin buns.</p>

<li class="sidebox"><h2>Erich Maria Remarque</h2>			<p>"No," he said quickly. "Never. Stay friends? Try to grow a small rose garden on the ashes of broken feelings? No, this will never work for you and me. It happens only after small affairs and it looks fake. Love should not be spoiled by friendship." 
* 
No one can become stranger than the person you once loved. 
* 
How clumsy a person behaves when he is truly in love! How quickly his self-confidence fades! And how lonely he feels; all his praised experience seems to be gone, just like fog, and he feels so weak and helpless. 
* 
Love cannot stand explanations. It requires actions. Love wants to be eternal. That is the source of the torture it causes us. 
* 
"I have always thought a woman should not tell a man she is in love with him. Her shining and happy eyes should bear witness to that." 
* 
"You have to break your principles sometimes. Otherwise they bring you no joy." 
* 
"Whatever you can&#8217;t get always seems better than whatever you have. This is the romance and the stupidity of our life." 
* 
"Nothing&#8217;s lost yet," I said. "You only lose someone when he&#8217;s dead." 
* 
Quotes from: 'Three Comrades', 'Triumphal Arch', 'All Quiet On the Western Front' and 'Life on Loan'.</p>

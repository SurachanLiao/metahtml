Baseball America reported earlier this week that the Dodgers will continue to pay their minor leaguers $400 per week past May 31, but it is unclear how long such payments would go. Even if one were to assume that the payments will continue throughout the month of June, however, it&#8217;s worth noting that $400 a week is not a substantial amount of money for players to live on, on which to support families, and on which to train and remain ready to play baseball if and when they are asked to return. &#8230; <a href="https://www.cubird.com/2020/05/report-david-price-to-pay-each-dodgers-minor-leaguer-1000-out-of-his-own-pocket/" class="more-link">[Read more...] <span class="screen-reader-text">about Report: David Price to pay each Dodgers minor leaguer $1,000 out of his own pocket</span></a></p></article><article class="post-74021910 post type-post status-publish format-standard entry"><p>The NBA will reportedly hold the draft after the season. The season reportedly could extend into October. Obviously, not all of these things can be correct. Even within this report. It&#8217;s nearly impossible to envision the draft being 5-7 days after the Finals and after free agency. That&#8217;d almost certainly be too soon to open free agency. &#8230; <a href="https://www.cubird.com/2020/05/report-nba-owners-to-discuss-moving-free-agency-ahead-of-draft/" class="more-link">[Read more...] <span class="screen-reader-text">about Report: NBA owners to discuss moving free agency ahead of draft</span></a></p></article><article class="post-74021913 post type-post status-publish format-standard entry"><p>I think because what they were doing was going up to Park City, in the mountains, in the ski area to stay. That&#8217;s where they stayed. So, they had to practice in Salt Lake City. They kept coming in and out, in and out. And I think it was altitude sickness. The symptoms that he had fit that much more than anything else that he had. &#8230; <a href="https://www.cubird.com/2020/05/sam-smith-calls-michael-jordans-poison-pizza-story-complete-nonsense/" class="more-link">[Read more...] <span class="screen-reader-text">about Sam Smith calls Michael Jordan&#8217;s poison-pizza story &#8216;complete nonsense&#8217;</span></a></p></article><article class="post-74021916 post type-post status-publish format-standard entry"><p>As much as you pray for George family, gotta also pray for the police officer(s) who were involved in this evil.

Everybody is going to hear everything, and that is going to be very different from most nights when coaches have to go to hand signals because it&#8217;s too loud just to call out a play. It&#8217;s going to lead to some awkward and tense moments. &#8230; <a href="https://www.cubird.com/2020/05/scott-foster-says-its-going-to-be-different-officiating-without-fans-in-building/" class="more-link">[Read more...] <span class="screen-reader-text">about Scott Foster says it&#8217;s going to be different officiating without fans in building</span></a></p></article></main>

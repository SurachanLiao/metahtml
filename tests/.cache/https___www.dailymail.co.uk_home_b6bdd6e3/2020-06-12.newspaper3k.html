            The Prime Minister (pictured today) said the Met Police have made 'hundreds' of arrests following attacks on officers, building and statues in the past ten days as Scotland Yard said they will go on 'the front foot' to tackle violent protesters after Home Secretary Priti Patel read them the 'riot act' over their tactics. In a stark warning, Mr Johnson said: 'We should not support a protest, which in all probability looking at what has happened before, is going to end in deliberate and calculated violence. He said a 'growing minority' of troublemakers had 'hijacked' the BLM protests 'as a pretext to attack the police, to cause violence and to cause damage to public property'. It came after he blasted 'absurd and shameful' attacks on the statue of Sir Winston Churchill and said the UK 'cannot lie about its history' as Sadiq Khan was accused of 'surrendering' the capital's streets 'to the mob' after he ordered the boarding up of the monument to Britain's greatest prime minister (top left) and the nearby Cenotaph (inset). This afternoon statues of Gandhi and Nelson Mandela are expected to be boarded up while Abraham Lincoln has been fenced off (bottom left).

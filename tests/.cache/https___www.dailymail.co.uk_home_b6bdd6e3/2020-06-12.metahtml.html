      <p>
        
        The show of defiance comes despite the&#160;Prime Minister&#160;warning a 'growing minority' of 'extremists' have hijacked the BLM cause.Police officers were booed as they moved in to detain two of the protesters in Hyde Park after activists defied the Prime Minister's instructions. Around 20 officers moved through large crowds of peaceful protesters sitting on the grass to seize a pair of demonstrators and escort them to nearby police vans. The BLM protest, which had been brought forward to today to avoid clashes with right wing activists, began at Hyde Park this afternoon at 2pm and is due to head to Parliament later today. Statues and war memorials in Westminster have been boarded up to prevent any vandalism or damage from protesters.

    <a href="/news/article-8414625/Britain-announces-just-84-Covid-19-deaths-lowest-increase-Friday-March-20.html">Infection R rate has risen ABOVE one in the South West of England - meaning the disease is spreading - as Britain announces 202 more Covid-19 deaths in the lowest increase on a Friday since March 20</a>
  </h2>
   
  
    <p>
      
      Today's death figure marks the lowest rise on a Friday since March 20, three days before the country went into lockdown, when there were just 36 coronavirus fatalities. But in a worrying development, the Government today admitted that the virus's reproduction rate has now risen to above one in at least one part of the country. Official figures indicate the 'R'&#160;is between 0.8 and 1.0 across England (right) -&#160;slightly higher than for the UK as a whole, where it remains between 0.7 and 0.9. But the&#160;Government Office for Science estimates the R is between&#160;0.8 and 1.1 in the&#160; South West and it could have already passed the critical threshold of one.

  </h2>
   
  
    
     <p>
       
       Hero workmen and a Deliveroo driver tackled and pinned a knifeman to the floor after a rabbi was stabbed in a shocking daylight attack in London today. Rabbi Alter Yaakov Schlesinger, in his 50s, was queuing outside a Nat West bank branch on Stoke Newington High Street, Hackney, before he was attacked. Witnesses say a man in his 40s, said to be of south Asian descent, ran off a bus and set upon the rabbi with a large knife just before 11am. The rabbi was stabbed multiple times, including in the head, before the alleged attacker was tackled by two workmen and a Deliveroo driver. He was pinned to the ground by the group-of-three, which including two Jewish builders, for seven minutes before police arrived. The alleged attacker was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. Though police said they were not treating the incident as terror-related, witnesses allege that the rabbi was the target of a hate crime.

    </h2>
    <p class="articletext">
         
        
        <p>
            
            The Prime Minister (pictured today) said the Met Police have made 'hundreds' of arrests following attacks on officers, building and statues in the past ten days as Scotland Yard said they will go on 'the front foot' to tackle violent protesters after Home Secretary Priti Patel read them the 'riot act' over their tactics. In a stark warning, Mr Johnson said: 'We should not support a protest, which in all probability looking at what has happened before, is going to end in deliberate and calculated violence. He said a 'growing minority' of troublemakers had 'hijacked' the BLM protests 'as a pretext to attack the police, to cause violence and to cause damage to public property'. It came after he blasted 'absurd and shameful' attacks on the statue of Sir Winston Churchill and said the UK 'cannot lie about its history' as Sadiq Khan was accused of 'surrendering' the capital's streets 'to the mob' after he ordered the boarding up of the monument to Britain's greatest prime minister (top left) and the nearby Cenotaph (inset). This afternoon statues of Gandhi and Nelson Mandela are expected to be boarded up while Abraham Lincoln has been fenced off (bottom left).

            Melania Trump used her position as first lady to renegotiate her pre-nup with Donald Trump, ensured Barron would treated the same as the eldest Trump children, and has had plastic surgery, a new book reveals. 'The Art of Her Deal: The Untold Story of Melania Trump,' by Washington Post reporter Mary Jordan, 'draws an unprecedented portrait of the first lady' based on interviews with more than 100 people in five countries. Out on Tuesday, excerpts from the 286-page book appeared in The Washington Post on Friday, confirming a longtime rumor that Melania renegotiated her martial agreement with Donald Trump before she moved into the White House after he won the presidency.

Mulroney was fired by CTV and department store Hudson Bay then took to Instagram on Thursday night to say she was stepping back from all work engagements. In a statement to DailyMail.com on Friday, an GMA spokeswoman said: 'As Jessica Mulroney said last night, she is stepping away from her professional engagements and that includes Good Morning America. She will no longer appear on our show.' Mulroney threatened Sasha Exeter with a lawsuit after Exeter publicly revealed that they'd been embroiled in a private war of words over racism.

            Britain's high streets are preparing for a manic Monday as some of Britain's biggest chains have revealed their plans to throw open their doors once again and kick-start town and city centres across the country in the wake of the coronavirus lockdown. Major high street retailers such as Primark, John Lewis, and JD Sports are all set to reopen on Monday after the government finally gave the green light for shops to reopen as the country eases back to life before the draconian lockdown measures were introduced. But shoppers will no doubt recognise changes when the shops reopen on Monday. Primark, which is reopening 153 of its stores from 15 June, has today released pictures showing what shoppers will face at its store in the Westfield Shopping Centre in London. Marks and Spencer will also be opening all 25 of its clothing outlet stores in England from Monday, while 260&#160;clothing spaces within M&amp;S stores that also sell food will also reopen

Brent had the highest overall rate with 210.9 deaths per 100,000 population, followed by Newham (197) and Hackney (183). Middlesbrough (169 deaths per 100,000), Hertsmere in Hertfordshire (162) and Salford, Manchester (160) have suffered the three highest death rates outside of London as the epidemic shifts north.

            Two women who attacked police at a lockdown house party have been jailed, following a physical altercation which saw an officer threatened with the possible transfer of coronavirus. Officers found blaring noise and drunk partygoers when they arrived at some flats in Eastbourne, East Sussex, in April. But when they tried to break up the gathering, things turned violent, with one woman telling an officer: 'I have got corona, watch out.' Millie Robinson (left) and Bayleigh Meadows (right) - both 21 - pleaded guilty to assaulting police at the party and appeared at Lewes Crown Court for sentencing.

       Suffolk Police have issued a public apology after two officers stopped a middle-aged black couple and demanded they show their IDs because they were 'driving a motor vehicle on a road'. Footage of the incident, in which one officer apparently accuses the couple of 'jumping on the bandwagon' of the Black Lives Matter protests, sparked outrage on social media. Ingrid Antoine-Oniyoke, 47, and her husband Falil Oniyoke, 50, were stopped in Ipswich on Tuesday after 'glancing' at a police car parked near Mrs Antoine-Oniyoke's mother's house.

     <p>
       
       Comedian Ricky Gervais has skewered a group of celebrities who are receiving backlash for taking part in a PSA on white privilege that has been described as 'cringe-inducing' - three months after Gal Gadot and other celebs were mocked for singing Imagine. 'Terrible lack of diversity in this video,' Gervais joked on Thursday, re-tweeting the two-minute video that features white celebs such as Sarah Paulson, Aaron Paul, Aly Raisman, Ilana Glazer, Stanley Tucci and many more taking responsibility for perpetuating racism in their lives, vowing to take action, which has drawn backlash from many on social media. Confluential Content, a production company that produces OWN's Black Love and Sony's The Perfect Guy, teamed up with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) for the video, officially titled I Take Responsibility.

            Olga Shirnina from Moscow, Russia, said a series of photos, bought to life and posted to her 23,000 followers, were removed by Facebook for breaching 'Community Standards'. One photo shows a striking picture of a side profile of Nazi leader Adolf Hitler dressed in a black suit at a New Year's reception (inset), and another shows the iconic scene of Russian Soviet soldiers lifting the 'Red Banner' over the Reichstag on 2 May 1945 (centre) as they celebrated their victory in the Battle of Berlin. Olga, a world expert in transforming historic black and white images into colour, said the first picture to be removed was a portrait of Hermann Goering (right), one of the most powerful figures in the Nazi Party. Other colourised images include Soviet hero Natalya Meklin-Kravtsova (left), a flight commander in the 46th Taman Guards Night Bomber Aviation Regiment, who flew 980 night missions by the end of the war.

    </h2>
    <p class="articletext">
         
        
        <p>
            
            Members of the Scouting movement (pictured left and bottom right) have today braved the wind and rain to salute a statue dedicated to the group's founder Robert Baden-Powell as council workers began boarding it up (pictured top right) in a bid to protect it from protesters. Civic chiefs had previously agreed to take down the 5ft tall bronze statue in Poole Quay amid fears it would be targeted by Black Lives Matter supporters. But the proposal sparked an angry backlash from Scout leaders and members of the public who sought to protect it, including from two former Scouts, who camped overnight to ensure it wasn't touched by council workmen or protests. A petition to save the statue has also attracted more than 25,000 signatures. Last night bosses at Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council put 24-hour security in place to protect the statute. It came after Lord Powell's statue featured on a website called 'Topple The Racists', which includes a hit-list of 78 statues and monuments that 'celebrate slavery and racism'. The website claims Lord Baden-Powell had homophobic views and Nazi sympathies.

            The toppled statue of Edward Colston (pictured right and inset), which was torn down and dumped into water by anti-racism protesters, contained a 125-year-old magazine signed by men who first put it up, it has been revealed. After being fished-out from Bristol Harbour, where it was thrown into by protesters on Sunday, museum workers began a clean-up job on the statue of the 17th century slave trader. But the team from M Shed, the museum which will now house the statue, which they say will not be cleaned of the graffiti sprayed on by protesters, discovered 'two surprising additions'. One was a bike tyre, which emerged with the statue as it was pulled from the harbour. The other item, however, was of a historical interest. Inside the coat tails of the statue, the team found a magazine from 1895 called 'Tit Bits' (pictured left) -&#160;a British weekly magazine founded by an early father of popular journalism George Newnes and which gave rise to modern newspapers such as the Daily Mail.

    </h2>
    <p class="articletext">
         
        
        <p>
            
            The funeral, for Albert Joseph Harper, who died aged 47, took place on Wednesday morning at Portfield Cemetery, in Chichester, West Sussex. Mourners were seen gathering at Mr Harper's graveside (main) in breach of social distancing rules banning more than ten people at funerals. They had travelled around three miles from nearby Marsh Lane along the usually-busy A27, which had to be closed for 30 minutes by police because some members of the funeral cortege were walking in the road. A Highway Maintenance truck carried a giant photo as well as flower arrangements (bottom right), while some family members were seen standing up through the sun roof of a car as it formed part of the cortege. The cortege was led by a converted Rolls-Royce Phantom VII (inset and top right) which was once owned by Simon Cowell and was being used as the hearse. The car, which was once fitted out with a champagne bar, TV screens and sheepskin rugs, would ordinarily cost around &#163;300,000 if bought new but its conversion into a hearse reportedly cost &#163;500,000.

  </h2>
   
  
    
     <p>
       
       An Australian woman has shocked the internet with a video of herself using a carrot peeler in a very non-traditional way (right), and even chefs are flawed by the approach.Liv Dalton uploaded footage of herself holding the vegetable to TikTok, moving the peeler up and down the carrot with the blade slicing it from both sides. Ordinarily people would start at the tip or base of the carrot and move the peeler in the opposite direction, before bringing it back up to start again. The process can be slow and laborious, but Miss Dalton's approach would take the average home cook half the time to get the job done.

       The five-bed property in Colgate, West Sussex (left, bottom left inset, and bottom right), which contains a gym, 50ft pool, five bathrooms, underfloor heating and a sauna, was built by businessman Clinton Dall, 56. It is thought that self-made millionaire Mr Dall let the home to filming companies, including for a Peter Andre music video and the Ryan Reynolds BT ads. However, the property - which cost over &#163;1million to make after Mr Dall knocked down a farmhouse-style home in 2015 - was also used as the set for the French-made porn film Lesbian Games for These Three Stewardesses (top right).

       The car chase happened after two thieves raided a jewellery shop in Norway's capital city of Oslo in broad daylight. Dressed head-to-toe in black, one robber, still wearing a helmet, barges their way into the shop while pointing a gun at terrified staff as the other parks the moped outside. Dashcam footage shows police racing the robbers down as they are given the green light to run the thieves over to detain them.

            The one-bedroom flat (pictured left is the living room, right is the bedroom and balcony) was once owned by 'cheeky cockney' character actor Harry Fowler (inset), who graced British screens for more than 60 years before his death in January 2012,&#160;aged 85. Harry, best known for his part in the 1960s sitcom The Army Game, which followed peacetime soldiers as they found ways to dodge duty and pursue easy money, was a genuine rags-to-riches star. He&#160;was a teenage newspaper seller living in London in 1942 when he was discovered by a film producer that heard him talking on the local radio about&#160;his life in the British capital during the Blitz.

            Cat, a 21-month-old feline from Thailand,&#160;has white fur on one side of her face and grey on the other, prompting her owner, Eve, to joke that she looks like Batman villain Harvey Dent, AKA Two-Face. The moggy, who is a Persian Scottish Fold cross-breed, loves to chew toilet roll (left) and has even chosen a rather unusual best friend - a cockroach (top centre). And she's racked up more than 1,300 followers on Instagram thanks to her unique looks.

       A man armed with a Taser who was defending himself against another individual who told him to&#160; 'stay out of this block'&#160; intersection in downtown San Diego earlier this month - only to help him up afterward. Video that was uploaded to social media on June 1 showed the incident which took place at the intersection of Market Street and Eighth Avenue. In the clip, a man wearing a gray shirt and camo military shorts is seen approaching another man in a threatening manner, though it is not clear what precipitated the interaction. The man in the black shirt is warned to 'stay out of this block.'

  </h2>
   
  
    
     <p>
       
       This is the hilarious moment a plumber falls into a flowerbed outside a customer's home after tripping on a plant pot. Ricky Cooper, 42, from Stevenage, Hertfordshire, stepped backwards onto a plant pot and fell off the doorstep after knocking on the front door. He escaped the fall with only minor cuts and bruising.

       Juno, who lives in Florida, is filmed lying stretched out on a soft blue blanket happily wagging his tail. Underneath his brown body, a bump can be seen. 'You're laying on the baby,' a voice is heard, as Juno looks over, not moving a muscle.You got to get off the baby! You cannot lay on the baby!' Juno's owner says. She moves his back legs, letting the camera see 'the baby,' which turns out to be a cat.

  </h2>
   
  
    
     <p>
       
       Chris Lee from LA posted his bag-replacing technique on TikTok on May 31. He tells viewers not to put a fresh back in with the bottom of the bag directly in the bin. Instead, he turns the bag upside down over the bargain bin and punches down the middle. It's unclear what, exactly, is different about the results of doing it this way, though Chris claims there is 'no air' in the bin. The video has already been watched over 700,000 times.

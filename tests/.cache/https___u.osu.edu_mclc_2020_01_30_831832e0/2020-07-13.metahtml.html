The center of the epidemic, and still the location of around a third of the cases, is Wuhan, in the central province of Hubei. Other cases have rapidly sprung up worldwide&#8212;but the transmission of paranoia and inaccurate information has managed to keep pace.</p><p>There is still plenty unknown about the virus, but researchers say it shares similarities to Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)&#8212;two infectious diseases that have emerged in recent decades but that have been managed. While concerns inside China are serious and travel restrictions have been imposed across much of the country, public health officials stress there is no need for panic, especially not in the West where the risk of transmission remains low.</p><p>That hasn&#8217;t stopped an outbreak of nonsense and conspiracy theories.

Users on WeChat, Weibo and many other platforms have shared stories, photos, video, or simply vented their rage at what many see as the inadequacy of the government&#8217;s response, particularly at the early stages of the outbreak.</p><p>And as communities across China mobilize against the spread of the disease, they are naturally exercising one very creative (and often revealing) aspect of the country&#8217;s political culture &#8211; the ubiquitous &#8220;slogan,&#8221; or&#160;bi&#257;oy&#468;&#160;(&#26631;&#35821;). &#160;Such slogans, which may deal with local or national policy issues as well as the personal &#8212; everything from (in the past) the one-child policy, to pushing basic social mores (like caring for one&#8217;s parents), to protests over the forced demolition of one&#8217;s home &#8212; are generally very simple in structure, direct (or even crude) and easy to understand. <a href="https://u.osu.edu/mclc/2020/01/30/outbreak-of-slogans/#more-32364" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a></p></article><article id="post-32367" class="post-32367 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-environment category-society"><p>Source: LARB China Channel (1/27/20)

(Wikicommons)</p><p>On January 17, I went to pick up a friend at the Hankou train station in my hometown Wuhan. She was the only one wearing a face mask. At the time, the official line was that everything was under control, that the spread could be prevented. &#8220;The Huanan Seafood Market is only two blocks away,&#8221; I said to her, teasingly. In an all-night restaurant, the glass tanks were swimming with life. We ate noodles with crab legs. The streets were as packed as ever, with drunk revelers trying to call cabs after their year-end company parties. A man doubled over to vomit, while a young woman patted him on the back and said, &#8220;Ready for another round, honey?&#8221;</p><p>A week ago the panic was still confined to health-conscious retirees, who always worry about seasonal illnesses. It didn&#8217;t prompt them to wear face masks or use hand sanitizer more regularly, it just gave them a new reason to get on young people&#8217;s case: don&#8217;t go out, drink plenty of water. There were also the perennial conspiracy theorists, who doubted official news yet didn&#8217;t provide more reliable information. To most of us, not wearing a mask seemed reasonable and logical. After all, who wanted to be associated with paranoid old folks and crackpots? <a href="https://u.osu.edu/mclc/2020/01/30/they-shut-down-the-city/#more-32367" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a></p></article></section></div>

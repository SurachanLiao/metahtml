But New York Times bestselling author Jerry Oppenheimer writes that Wintour has long been thought of the same way, dating back to her teens in London. Her one and only black friend Vivienne Lasky described Wintour's petty jealousies and extreme cattiness, and was 'harshly critical and sarcastic'. Lasky said: 'Anna really cared about appearances. She would point out another girl and say, ''My God, look how fat, she is. Look at her horrible, curly hair'''. Alex Walker, a highly respected editor at Anna's father's paper, the Evening Standard, remembered Anna as an 'absolute monster.' Former Vogue editor Andre Leon Talley said he was left with 'huge emotional and psychological scars' from his many years of friendship with Wintour. In the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests, Wintour admitted Vogue has been 'hurtful and intolerant' and not done enough to promote black staffers.

The plaintiffs, three men including DC street pastor Rich Penkoski (right) allege that the 'Black Lives Matter' mural painted on 16th Street conveys that black people are the favored race of the city. They demanded three murals be erected in its place reading 'Blue Lives Matter' for police, 'Green Lives Matter' for the National Guard and 'All Lives Matter'. In the complaint, the men allege renaming the street outside Lafayette Square 'Black Lives Matter Plaza' (inset) shows bias for one race. They suggested it be removed or that another street be renamed 'Jesus is the answer Plaza.'

Photos show both homes now have trampolines, a basketball hoop and pools, while Brad has installed a four-person swing set and Angie has added fun pool toys. This comes as reports say the pair are getting along much better after agreeing on a new set-up for their six kids, Maddox, 18, Pax, 16, Zahara, 15, Shiloh, 14 and twins Vivienne and Knox, 11. A source told Entertainment Tonight last week: 'He and Angie have been getting along so much better since the custody rules have been worked out. They have come so far'.

One photo shows a striking picture of a side profile of Nazi leader Adolf Hitler dressed in a black suit at a New Year's reception (inset), and another shows the iconic scene of Russian Soviet soldiers lifting the 'Red Banner' over the Reichstag on 2 May 1945 (centre) as they celebrated their victory in the Battle of Berlin. Olga, a world expert in transforming historic black and white images into colour, said the first picture to be removed was a portrait of Hermann Goering (right), one of the most powerful figures in the Nazi Party. Other colourised images include Soviet hero Natalya Meklin-Kravtsova (left), a flight commander in the 46th Taman Guards Night Bomber Aviation Regiment, who flew 980 night missions by the end of the war.

Twenty had broken the 14-day visitor quarantine while Tylea Fuhrmann, 42, was arrested for breaking an emergency order on vacation rentals - making them the largest group detained for flouting Governor David Ige's virus rules. Carbon Nation members were kicked out of Panama, Costa Rica and Nicaragua back in December after being branded a 'threat to national security'. Cult leader Bishop, who refers to himself as 'The Messiah Demigod' and 'Master Chief', set up the cult in 2016 which believes in nudism, polygamy, defecating at the base of trees and requires all members to hand over all their money and credit cards.

And now - nearly a century after the tomb of 'Boy King' Tutankhamun was uncovered (a view of the northern wall of the tomb, showing life-size statues of Tutankhamun, bottom right) - the incredible scenes can be seen in full colour for the first time (Carter and his team removing the wall between the Antechamber and Burial Chamber, bottom, left and centre). The ancient Egyptian pharaoh's intact tomb (precious artefact is removed using a pulley system, top right) was found on November 4, 1922, by Carter. And the pictures bring vividly to life the discovery of the final resting place of Tutankhamun, who ruled Egypt around 1334-1325BC, and is said to have died when he was about 18. Pictured top right, inset: Hussein Abdul-Rasoul, who discovered the steps leading to the tomb, wearing a pectoral pendant that belonged to Tutankhamun, and left, centre: Egyptian archaeological workers excavating in the Valley of the Kings.

Ordinarily people would start at the tip or base of the carrot and move the peeler in the opposite direction, before bringing it back up to start again. The process can be slow and laborious, but Miss Dalton's approach would take the average home cook half the time to get the job done.

Following the revolution and a national referendum, Khomeini became the country's Supreme Leader&#8212;a position created in the constitution as the highest ranking political and religious authority of the nation&#8212;until his death.</p><p>Khomeini was a marja ("source of emulation", also known as a Grand Ayatollah) in Twelver Shi'a Islam and like other senior shi'a clerics has written many books, but is most famous for his political role. In his writings and preachings he expanded the Shi'a Usuli theory of velayat-e faqih, the "guardianship of the jurisconsult (clerical authority)" to include theocratic political rule by the Islamic jurists.</p><p>He is the author of more than 40 books mainly on mysticism, philosophy, and Islamic jurisprudence most of which were written before revolution. After his death, a book of poetry was published under his name. He was arrested in 1963 for 10 months and banished in 1964 for near 15 years for his speeches against the Capitulation (treaty) approved by the Shah regime.</p><p class="wiki_more"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruhollah_Khomeini" target="_blank">FULL ARTICLE AT WIKIPEDIA.ORG</a></p><p>This article is licensed under the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_the_GNU_Free_Documentation_License" target="_blank">GNU Free Documentation License</a>.</p><p>It uses material from the Wikipedia article

There’s no de­fin­i­tive proof yet that Gilead’s remde­sivir works as a treat­ment for 2019-nCov, but re­searchers in Chi­na clear­ly con­sid­er it promis­ing enough to have ap­plied for a patent on its use to com­bat the coro­n­avirus virus out­break stem­ming from Wuhan.

Amid world­wide vig­i­lance over what many fear is be­com­ing a pan­dem­ic, sci­en­tists from the Wuhan In­sti­tute of Vi­rol­o­gy and Na­tion­al En­gi­neer­ing Re­search Cen­ter for the Emer­gency Drug said they have test­ed a to­tal of sev­en drugs in vit­ro — and found remde­sivir and the malar­ia treat­ment chloro­quine most ef­fec­tive against the nov­el coro­n­avirus.

In a state­ment, the in­sti­tu­tions al­so dis­closed that they filed a patent ap­pli­ca­tion on Jan­u­ary 21, days be­fore Gilead first an­nounced it’s dust­ing off the nu­cle­o­side ana­log — which failed to make the cut as an Ebo­la drug — to test against the new virus.

While ex­perts have in­di­cat­ed that a patent is un­like­ly to be grant­ed, the move high­lights grow­ing con­fi­dence in remde­sivir in the midst of a glob­al race to hunt an­ti­bod­ies and ther­a­pies for 2019-nCoV, for which there is no ap­proved treat­ment. The high­ly con­ta­gious virus has killed more than 490, most­ly in Chi­na.

The up­date al­so comes as the FDA is­sued its first Emer­gency Use Au­tho­riza­tion (EUA) since the De­part­ment of Health and Hu­man Ser­vices de­clared a pub­lic health emer­gency in the US on Jan­u­ary 31. The EUA means that the 2019-nCoV di­ag­nos­tic pan­el that’s been in use at CDC labs can now be used at any CDC-qual­i­fied lab across the coun­try.

Gilead — which has been in a patent dis­pute with the US gov­ern­ment over its HIV fran­chise — didn’t an­swer di­rect­ly whether it knew about the patent fil­ing be­fore the an­nounce­ment or what it thought about the Chi­nese re­searchers’ grounds.

Gilead in­vent­ed remde­sivir and has patent­ed it in Chi­na, in­clud­ing fil­ing patent ap­pli­ca­tions for use on coro­n­avirus­es. We are aware of re­ports of the Wuhan In­sti­tute for Vi­rol­o­gy’s patent ap­pli­ca­tion. Our fo­cus at this time, is on rapid­ly de­ter­min­ing the po­ten­tial for remde­sivir as a treat­ment for 2019-nCoV and ac­cel­er­at­ing man­u­fac­tur­ing in an­tic­i­pa­tion of po­ten­tial fu­ture sup­ply needs.

Af­ter US doc­tors re­port­ed us­ing remde­sivir as part of the reg­i­men for the first do­mes­tic case of 2019-nCoV, Gilead said it’s work­ing with Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties to start a ran­dom­ized con­trolled tri­al.

Nine tri­als are al­ready un­der­way to eval­u­ate dif­fer­ent com­bi­na­tions of al­ready ap­proved an­tivi­rals and cor­ti­cos­teroids, Bio­Cen­tu­ry not­ed, in­clud­ing HIV drugs such as Ab­b­Vie’s Kale­tra/Alu­via and Gilead’s De­scovy.

Remde­sivir, on the oth­er hand, is an ex­per­i­men­tal com­pound that’s been test­ed in hu­man tri­als. In a Q4 earn­ings call, Gilead CEO Daniel O’Day in­di­cat­ed that it may be de­ployed as an emer­gency treat­ment. In re­sponse to a ques­tion about man­u­fac­tur­ing prepa­ra­tions in the event that they need to scale up pro­duc­tion quick­ly, he had this to re­port:

In terms of man­u­fac­tur­ing, our team has re­al­ly been work­ing night and day, it’s been very im­pres­sive to watch this team over the past cou­ple of weeks re­al­ly ramp up to the ex­tent that we can. Our ca­pac­i­ty is go­ing up every day. We’re look­ing at all the op­tions we have ex­pect­ing to be pre­pared for what may come. Ob­vi­ous­ly we are wait­ing for da­ta, both in vit­ro and then in peo­ple to en­sure that the drug ac­tu­al­ly works. And it’s im­por­tant just for every­one to keep that in mind that this is still in­ves­ti­ga­tion­al and we are still wait­ing for more da­ta to know. But at risk, we are in­vest­ing pret­ty heav­i­ly to make sure that we’re pre­pared as best as we can.

Around the same time, some in vit­ro da­ta were be­ing pub­lished on Na­ture as a let­ter to the ed­i­tor.

“No­tably, two com­pounds remde­sivir (EC50 = 0.77 μM; CC50 > 100 μM; SI > 129.87) and chloro­quine (EC50 = 1.13 μM; CC50 > 100 μM, SI > 88.50) po­tent­ly blocked virus in­fec­tion at low-mi­cro­mo­lar con­cen­tra­tion and showed high SI,” they wrote.

Giv­en its po­ten­tial, the Wuhan In­sti­tute of Vi­rol­o­gy said in a state­ment, it’s ap­plied for a patent in Chi­na and plans to dis­trib­ute to oth­er coun­tries via the Patent Co­op­er­a­tion Treaty. But should “the rel­e­vant over­seas com­pa­ny” be will­ing to con­tribute to the out­break con­trol, they would tem­porar­i­ly sus­pend ex­er­cise of their patent rights.

But ex­perts in­ter­viewed by lo­cal me­dia point out that the ap­pli­ca­tion may not go through. Not on­ly does Gilead hold the foun­da­tion­al patent to the drug, but it al­so ap­plied for one to cov­er remde­sivir’s use in coro­n­avirus­es back in 2016 — which didn’t spec­i­fy but could ar­guably in­clude this new strain.

The high­ly con­ta­gious virus has killed more than 490, most­ly in Chi­na.</p> <p>The up­date al­so comes as the FDA <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-takes-significant-step-coronavirus-response-efforts-issues-emergency-use-authorization-first" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">is­sued</a> its first Emer­gency Use Au­tho­riza­tion (EUA) since the De­part­ment of Health and Hu­man Ser­vices de­clared a pub­lic health emer­gency in the US on Jan­u­ary 31. The EUA means that the 2019-nCoV di­ag­nos­tic pan­el that’s been in use at CDC labs can now be used at any CDC-qual­i­fied lab across the coun­try.</p> <p>Gilead — which has been in a patent <a href="https://endpts.com/gilead-claims-truvada-patents-in-hhs-complaint-are-invalid/">dis­pute</a> with the US gov­ern­ment over its HIV fran­chise — didn’t an­swer di­rect­ly whether it knew about the patent fil­ing be­fore the an­nounce­ment or what it thought about the Chi­nese re­searchers’ grounds.</p> <blockquote><p>Gilead in­vent­ed remde­sivir and has patent­ed it in Chi­na, in­clud­ing fil­ing patent ap­pli­ca­tions for use on coro­n­avirus­es. We are aware of re­ports of the Wuhan In­sti­tute for Vi­rol­o­gy’s patent ap­pli­ca­tion. Our fo­cus at this time, is on rapid­ly de­ter­min­ing the po­ten­tial for remde­sivir as a treat­ment for 2019-nCoV and ac­cel­er­at­ing man­u­fac­tur­ing in an­tic­i­pa­tion of po­ten­tial fu­ture sup­ply needs.</p></blockquote> <p>Af­ter US doc­tors <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">re­port­ed</a> us­ing remde­sivir as part of the reg­i­men for the first do­mes­tic case of 2019-nCoV, Gilead said it’s work­ing with Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties to start a ran­dom­ized con­trolled tri­al.</p> <p>Nine tri­als are al­ready un­der­way to eval­u­ate dif­fer­ent com­bi­na­tions of al­ready ap­proved an­tivi­rals and cor­ti­cos­teroids, Bio­Cen­tu­ry <a href="https://www.biocentury.com/article/304368" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">not­ed</a>, in­clud­ing HIV drugs such as <a href="https://endpts.com/abbvie-donates-1m-of-the-hiv-drug-that-china-is-now-using-to-contain-coronavirus-outbreak/">Ab­b­Vie’s</a> Kale­tra/Alu­via and Gilead’s De­scovy.</p> <p>Remde­sivir, on the oth­er hand, is an ex­per­i­men­tal com­pound that’s been test­ed in hu­man tri­als. In a Q4 earn­ings call, Gilead CEO Daniel O’Day in­di­cat­ed that it may be de­ployed as an emer­gency treat­ment. In re­sponse to a ques­tion about man­u­fac­tur­ing prepa­ra­tions in the event that they need to scale up pro­duc­tion quick­ly, he had this to re­port:</p> <blockquote><p>In terms of man­u­fac­tur­ing, our team has re­al­ly been work­ing night and day, it’s been very im­pres­sive to watch this team over the past cou­ple of weeks re­al­ly ramp up to the ex­tent that we can. Our ca­pac­i­ty is go­ing up every day. We’re look­ing at all the op­tions we have ex­pect­ing to be pre­pared for what may come.</p> <p>Ob­vi­ous­ly we are wait­ing for da­ta, both in vit­ro and then in peo­ple to en­sure that the drug ac­tu­al­ly works. And it’s im­por­tant just for every­one to keep that in mind that this is still in­ves­ti­ga­tion­al and we are still wait­ing for more da­ta to know. But at risk, we are in­vest­ing pret­ty heav­i­ly to make sure that we’re pre­pared as best as we can.</p></blockquote> <p>Around the same time, some in vit­ro da­ta were be­ing <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-0282-0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">pub­lished</a> on Na­ture as a let­ter to the ed­i­tor.</p> <p>“No­tably, two com­pounds remde­sivir (EC50 = 0.77 μM; CC50 &gt; 100 μM; SI &gt; 129.87) and chloro­quine (EC50 = 1.13 μM; CC50 &gt; 100 μM, SI &gt; 88.50) po­tent­ly blocked virus in­fec­tion at low-mi­cro­mo­lar con­cen­tra­tion and showed high SI,” they wrote.</p> <p>Giv­en its po­ten­tial, the Wuhan In­sti­tute of Vi­rol­o­gy said in a state­ment, it’s ap­plied for a patent in Chi­na and plans to dis­trib­ute to oth­er coun­tries via the Patent Co­op­er­a­tion Treaty. But should “the rel­e­vant over­seas com­pa­ny” be will­ing to con­tribute to the out­break con­trol, they would tem­porar­i­ly sus­pend ex­er­cise of their patent rights.</p> <p>But ex­perts in­ter­viewed by <a href="https://m.21jingji.com/article/20200205/herald/5aff07af6c82edc3d81453b77f6fcae2.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">lo­cal me­dia</a> point out that the ap­pli­ca­tion may not go through. Not on­ly does Gilead hold the foun­da­tion­al patent to the drug, but it al­so ap­plied for one to cov­er remde­sivir’s use in coro­n­avirus­es back in 2016 — which didn’t spec­i­fy but could ar­guably in­clude this new strain.</p> <h3 class="epn_section_title"><ins>AUTHOR</ins></h3><ins> </ins><h3><ins><a href="https://endpts.com/author/amber-tong/" title="See all stories by Amber Tong">Amber Tong Link: https://endpts.com/author/amber-tong/ </a></ins></h3><ins> </ins><h4><ins>Editor</ins></h4><ins> </ins><p class="epn_left"><ins><a href="mailto:amber@endpointsnews.com" class="epn_mail">amber@endpointsnews.com Link: mailto:amber@endpointsnews.com </a> <a href="https://twitter.com/AmberTongPW" title="Find Amber Tong on Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" class="epn_twitter">@AmberTongPW Link: https://twitter.com/AmberTongPW </a> </ins></p> </article>

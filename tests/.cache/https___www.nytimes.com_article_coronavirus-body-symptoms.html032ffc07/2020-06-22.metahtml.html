Here is what medical experts and researchers have learned so far about the progression of the infection caused by this new coronavirus &#8212; and what they still don&#8217;t know.</p><h2 class="css-1aoo5yy eoo0vm40" id="link-1df0ef8c">How does this coronavirus cause infection?</h2><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">The virus is spread through droplets transmitted into the air from coughing or sneezing, which people nearby can take in through their nose, mouth or eyes. The viral particles in these droplets travel quickly to the back of your nasal passages and to the mucous membranes in the back of your throat, attaching to a particular receptor in cells, beginning there.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Coronavirus particles have spiked proteins sticking out from their surfaces, and these spikes hook onto cell membranes, allowing the virus&#8217;s genetic material to enter the human cell.</p></p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">That genetic material proceeds to &#8220;hijack the metabolism of the cell and say, in effect, &#8216;Don&#8217;t do your usual job. Your job now is to help me multiply and make the virus,&#8217;&#8221; said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville.</p><p class="css-1sngw6j"><a class="css-1a9ghz5" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/11/science/how-coronavirus-hijacks-your-cells.html"><p class="css-1rha1bf"><h2 class="css-zd32qr">How Coronavirus Hijacks Your Cells</h2><p class="css-1uuihdo">The intricate journey of the virus that causes Covid-19.</p></p></a></p><p class="css-53u6y8"><h2 class="css-1aoo5yy eoo0vm40" id="link-ecb2fe4">How does that process cause respiratory problems?</h2><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">As copies of the virus multiply, they burst out and infect neighboring cells. The symptoms often start in the back of the throat with a sore throat and a dry cough.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">The virus then &#8220;crawls progressively down the bronchial tubes,&#8221; Dr. Schaffner said. When the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/08/health/coronavirus-covid-lungs-ventilators.html" title="">virus reaches the lungs</a>, their mucous membranes become inflamed. That can damage the alveoli or lung sacs and they have to work harder to carry out their function of supplying oxygen to the blood that circulates throughout our body and removing carbon dioxide from the blood so that it can be exhaled.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">&#8220;If you get swelling there, it makes it that much more difficult for oxygen to swim across the mucous membrane,&#8221; said Dr. Amy Compton-Phillips, the chief clinical officer for the Providence Health System, which included the hospital in Everett, Wash., that had the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/what-it-was-like-for-doctors-and-nurses-at-an-everett-hospital-to-treat-the-nations-first-novel-coronavirus-patient/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">first reported case of coronavirus in the United States</a>, in January.</p></p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">The swelling and the impaired flow of oxygen can cause those areas in the lungs to fill with fluid, pus and dead cells. Pneumonia, an infection in the lung, can occur.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Some people have so much trouble breathing they need to be put on a ventilator. In the worst cases, known as Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, the lungs fill with so much fluid that no amount of breathing support can help, and the patient dies.</p><p class="css-53u6y8"><h2 class="css-1aoo5yy eoo0vm40" id="link-70655793">What trajectory does the virus take in the lungs?</h2><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Dr. Shu-Yuan Xiao, a professor of pathology at the University of Chicago School of Medicine has examined pathology reports on coronavirus patients in China. He said the virus appears to start in peripheral areas on both sides of the lung and can take a while to reach the upper respiratory tract, the trachea and other central airways.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Dr. Xiao, who also serves as the director of the Center For Pathology and Molecular Diagnostics at Wuhan University, said that pattern helps explain why in Wuhan, where the outbreak began, many of the earliest cases were not identified immediately.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">The initial testing regimen in many Chinese hospitals did not always detect infection in the peripheral lungs, so some people with symptoms were sent home without treatment.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">&#8220;They&#8217;d either go to other hospitals to seek treatment or stay home and infect their family,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That&#8217;s one of the reasons there was such a wide spread.&#8221;</p></p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">A <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/10.1148/radiol.2020200463" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recent study from a team led by researchers at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai</a> found that more than half of 121 patients in China had normal CT scans early in their disease. That study and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.iaslc.org/Portals/0/PIIS1556086420301325.pdf?ver=2020-03-02-221057-703" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">work by Dr. Xiao</a> show that as the disease progresses, CT scans show &#8220;ground glass opacities,&#8221; a kind of hazy veil in parts of the lung that are evident in many types of viral respiratory infections. Those opaque areas can scatter and thicken in places as the illness worsens, creating what radiologists call a &#8220;crazy paving&#8221; pattern on the scan.</p><p class="css-53u6y8"><h2 class="css-1aoo5yy eoo0vm40" id="link-febd62d">Are the lungs the only part of the body affected?</h2><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Not necessarily. Dr. Compton-Phillips said the infection can spread through the mucous membranes, from the nose down to the rectum.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">So while the virus appears to zero in on the lungs, it may also be able to infect cells in the gastrointestinal system, experts say. This may be why some patients have symptoms like diarrhea or indigestion. The virus can also get into the bloodstream, Dr. Schaffner said.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">The <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/faq.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that RNA from the new coronavirus has been detected in blood and stool specimens</a>, but that it&#8217;s unclear whether infectious virus can persist in blood or stool.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Bone marrow and organs like the liver can become inflamed too, said Dr. George Diaz, section leader for infectious diseases at Providence Regional Medical Center in Everett, Wash., whose team <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/what-it-was-like-for-doctors-and-nurses-at-an-everett-hospital-to-treat-the-nations-first-novel-coronavirus-patient/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">treated the first U.S. coronavirus patient</a>. There may also be some inflammation in small blood vessels, as happened with SARS, the viral outbreak in 2002 and 2003.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">&#8220;The virus will actually land on organs like the heart, the kidney, the liver, and may cause some direct damage to those organs,&#8221; Dr. Schaffner said. As the body&#8217;s immune system shifts into high gear to battle the infection, the resulting inflammation may cause those organs to malfunction, he said.</p></p><p class="css-53u6y8"><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">As a result, some patients may endure damage that is inflicted not just by the virus, but by their own immune system as it rages to combat the infection.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Experts have not yet documented whether the virus can affect the brain. But scientists who studied SARS have reported some evidence that <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2493326/#__ffn_sectitle" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the SARS virus could infiltrate the brain in some patients</a>. Given the similarity between SARS and Covid-19, the infection caused by the new coronavirus, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jmv.25728" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a paper published last month in the Journal of Medical Virology</a> argued that the possibility that the new coronavirus might be able to infect some nerve cells should not be ruled out.</p><h2 class="css-1aoo5yy eoo0vm40" id="link-350b9ed9">Why do some people get very ill but most don&#8217;t?</h2><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">About 80 percent of people infected with the new coronavirus have relatively mild symptoms. But about 20 percent of people become more seriously ill and in about 2 percent of patients in China, which has had the most cases, the disease has been fatal.</p><section id="styln-faq-coronavirus" class="css-l08pwh interactive-content interactive-size-medium"><p class="g-inlineguide-headline-group">

Bryant, the president and chief science officer of the American Council on Exercise, a nonprofit organization that funds exercise research and certifies fitness professionals. &#8220;In my personal experience,&#8221; he says, &#8220;heart rates are higher at the same relative intensity when you wear a mask.&#8221; Some people also could experience lightheadedness during familiar workouts while masked, says Len Kravitz, a professor of exercise science at the University of New Mexico.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/upshot/coronavirus-paid-leave-guide.html">The coronavirus emergency relief package</a> gives many American workers paid leave if they need to take time off because of the virus. It gives qualified workers two weeks of paid sick leave if they are ill, quarantined or seeking diagnosis or preventive care for coronavirus, or if they are caring for sick family members. It gives 12 weeks of paid leave to people caring for children whose schools are closed or whose child care provider is unavailable because of the coronavirus. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/upshot/coronavirus-paid-leave-guide.html">It is the first time the United States has had widespread federally mandated paid leave,</a> and includes people who don&#8217;t typically get such benefits, like part-time and gig economy workers. But <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/14/opinion/coronavirus-pelosi-sick-leave.html">the measure excludes</a> at least half of private-sector workers, including those at the country&#8217;s largest employers, and gives small employers significant leeway to deny leave.</p>

                <h4>Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?</h4>
                <p>So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5">paper</a> published in April suggests that people are most infectious about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was &#8220;very rare,&#8221;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html#link-1f302e21">but she later walked back that statement.</a></p>

                <h4>What&#8217;s the risk of catching coronavirus from a surface?</h4>
                <p>Touching contaminated objects and then infecting ourselves with the germs is not typically how the virus spreads. But it can happen. A number <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.905.8444&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">of studies</a> of flu, rhinovirus, coronavirus and other microbes have shown that respiratory illnesses, including the new coronavirus, can spread by touching contaminated surfaces, particularly in places like day care centers, offices and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5519164/">hospitals</a>. But a long chain of events has to happen for the disease to spread that way. The best way to protect yourself from coronavirus &#8212; whether it&#8217;s surface transmission or close human contact &#8212; is still social distancing, washing your hands, not touching your face and wearing masks.</p>

Economists had forecast the unemployment rate to increase to as much as 20 percent, after it hit 14.7 percent in April, which was the highest since the government began keeping official statistics after World War II. But the unemployment rate dipped instead, with employers adding 2.5 million jobs, after more than 20 million jobs were lost in April.</p>

This means that more public spaces are available for use and more and more businesses are being allowed to open again. The federal government is largely leaving the decision up to states, and some state leaders are leaving the decision up to local authorities.

If possible, choose a window seat. A <a href="http://emoryhealthdigest.emory.edu/issues/2018/spring/from_the_well/germs-on-a-plane/index.html">study from Emory University</a> found that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. (Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.)</p>

Neither patient&#8217;s lung cancer was advanced enough to kill them, he said.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">One of those patients, an 84-year-old woman with diabetes, died from pneumonia caused by coronavirus, Dr. Xiao said the records showed.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">The other patient, a 73-year-old man, was somewhat healthier, with a history of hypertension that he had managed well for 20 years. Dr. Xiao said the man had successful surgery to remove a lung tumor, was discharged, and nine days later returned to the hospital because he had a fever and cough that was determined to be coronavirus.</p></p><p class="css-53u6y8"><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Dr. Xiao said that the man had almost certainly been infected during his first stay in the hospital, since other patients in his post-surgical recovery room were later found to have coronavirus. Like many other cases, it took the man days to show respiratory symptoms.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">The man recovered after 20 days in the hospital&#8217;s infectious disease unit. Experts say that when patients like that recover, it is often because the supportive care &#8212; fluids, breathing support, and other treatment &#8212; allows them to outlast the worst effects of the inflammation caused by the virus.</p><h2 class="css-1aoo5yy eoo0vm40" id="link-31bb0bb9">What do scientists still not know about coronavirus patients?</h2><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">A lot. Although the illness resembles SARS in many respects and has elements in common with influenza and pneumonia, the course a patient&#8217;s coronavirus will take is not yet fully understood.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Some patients can remain stable for over a week and then suddenly develop pneumonia, Dr. Diaz said. Some patients seem to recover but then develop symptoms again.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Dr. Xiao said that some patients in China recovered but got sick again, apparently because they had damaged and vulnerable lung tissue that was subsequently attacked by bacteria in their body. Some of those patients ended up dying from a bacterial infection, not the virus. But that didn&#8217;t appear to cause the majority of deaths, he said.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Other cases have been tragic mysteries. Dr. Xiao said he personally knew a man and woman who got infected, but seemed to be improving. Then the man deteriorated and was hospitalized.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">&#8220;He was in I.C.U., getting oxygen, and he texted his wife that he was getting better, he had good appetite and so on,&#8221; Dr. Xiao said. &#8220;But then in the late afternoon, she stopped receiving texts from him. She didn&#8217;t know what was going on. And by 10 p.m., she got a notice from the hospital that he had passed.&#8221;</p></p></section></article>

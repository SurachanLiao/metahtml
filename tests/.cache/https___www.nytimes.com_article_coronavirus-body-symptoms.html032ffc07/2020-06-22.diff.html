Here is what medical experts and researchers have learned so far about the progression of the infection caused by this new coronavirus — and what they still don’t know.</ins></p><h2 class="css-1aoo5yy eoo0vm40" id="link-1df0ef8c"><ins>How does this coronavirus cause infection?</ins></h2><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0"><ins>The virus is spread through droplets transmitted into the air from coughing or sneezing, which people nearby can take in through their nose, mouth or eyes. The viral particles in these droplets travel quickly to the back of your nasal passages and to the mucous membranes in the back of your throat, attaching to a particular receptor in cells, beginning there.</ins></p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0"><ins>Coronavirus particles have spiked proteins sticking out from their surfaces, and these spikes hook onto cell membranes, allowing the virus’s genetic material to enter the human cell.</ins></p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0"><ins>That genetic material proceeds to “hijack the metabolism of the cell and say, in effect, ‘Don’t do your usual job. Your job now is to help me multiply and make the virus,’” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville.</ins></p><p class="css-1sngw6j"><a class="css-1a9ghz5" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/11/science/how-coronavirus-hijacks-your-cells.html"><p class="css-1rha1bf"><ins></ins></p><h2 class="css-zd32qr"><ins>How Coronavirus Hijacks Your Cells</ins></h2><p class="css-1uuihdo"><ins>The intricate journey of the virus that causes Covid-19.</ins></p><ins> Link: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/11/science/how-coronavirus-hijacks-your-cells.html </ins></a></p><p class="css-53u6y8"><ins></ins></p><h2 class="css-1aoo5yy eoo0vm40" id="link-ecb2fe4"><ins>How does that process cause respiratory problems?</ins></h2><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0"><ins>As copies of the virus multiply, they burst out and infect neighboring cells. The symptoms often start in the back of the throat with a sore throat and a dry cough.</ins></p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0"><ins>The virus then “crawls progressively down the bronchial tubes,” Dr. Schaffner said. When the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/08/health/coronavirus-covid-lungs-ventilators.html" title="">virus reaches the lungs Link: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/08/health/coronavirus-covid-lungs-ventilators.html </a>, their mucous membranes become inflamed. That can damage the alveoli or lung sacs and they have to work harder to carry out their function of supplying oxygen to the blood that circulates throughout our body and removing carbon dioxide from the blood so that it can be exhaled.</ins></p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0"><ins>“If you get swelling there, it makes it that much more difficult for oxygen to swim across the mucous membrane,” said Dr. Amy Compton-Phillips, the chief clinical officer for the Providence Health System, which included the hospital in Everett, Wash., that had the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/what-it-was-like-for-doctors-and-nurses-at-an-everett-hospital-to-treat-the-nations-first-novel-coronavirus-patient/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">first reported case of coronavirus in the United States Link: https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/what-it-was-like-for-doctors-and-nurses-at-an-everett-hospital-to-treat-the-nations-first-novel-coronavirus-patient/ </a>, in January.</ins></p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0"><ins>The swelling and the impaired flow of oxygen can cause those areas in the lungs to fill with fluid, pus and dead cells. Pneumonia, an infection in the lung, can occur.</ins></p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0"><ins>Some people have so much trouble breathing they need to be put on a ventilator. In the worst cases, known as Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, the lungs fill with so much fluid that no amount of breathing support can help, and the patient dies.</ins></p><p class="css-53u6y8"><ins></ins></p><h2 class="css-1aoo5yy eoo0vm40" id="link-70655793"><ins>What trajectory does the virus take in the lungs?</ins></h2><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0"><ins>Dr. Shu-Yuan Xiao, a professor of pathology at the University of Chicago School of Medicine has examined pathology reports on coronavirus patients in China. He said the virus appears to start in peripheral areas on both sides of the lung and can take a while to reach the upper respiratory tract, the trachea and other central airways.</ins></p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0"><ins>Dr. Xiao, who also serves as the director of the Center For Pathology and Molecular Diagnostics at Wuhan University, said that pattern helps explain why in Wuhan, where the outbreak began, many of the earliest cases were not identified immediately.</ins></p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0"><ins>The initial testing regimen in many Chinese hospitals did not always detect infection in the peripheral lungs, so some people with symptoms were sent home without treatment.</ins></p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0"><ins>“They’d either go to other hospitals to seek treatment or stay home and infect their family,” he said. “That’s one of the reasons there was such a wide spread.”</ins></p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0"><ins>A <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/10.1148/radiol.2020200463" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recent study from a team led by researchers at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Link: https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/10.1148/radiol.2020200463 </a> found that more than half of 121 patients in China had normal CT scans early in their disease. That study and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.iaslc.org/Portals/0/PIIS1556086420301325.pdf?ver=2020-03-02-221057-703" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">work by Dr. Xiao Link: https://www.iaslc.org/Portals/0/PIIS1556086420301325.pdf?ver=2020-03-02-221057-703 </a> show that as the disease progresses, CT scans show “ground glass opacities,” a kind of hazy veil in parts of the lung that are evident in many types of viral respiratory infections. Those opaque areas can scatter and thicken in places as the illness worsens, creating what radiologists call a “crazy paving” pattern on the scan.</ins></p><p class="css-53u6y8"><ins></ins></p><h2 class="css-1aoo5yy eoo0vm40" id="link-febd62d"><ins>Are the lungs the only part of the body affected?</ins></h2><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0"><ins>Not necessarily. Dr. Compton-Phillips said the infection can spread through the mucous membranes, from the nose down to the rectum.</ins></p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0"><ins>So while the virus appears to zero in on the lungs, it may also be able to infect cells in the gastrointestinal system, experts say. This may be why some patients have symptoms like diarrhea or indigestion. The virus can also get into the bloodstream, Dr. Schaffner said.</ins></p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0"><ins>The <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/faq.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that RNA from the new coronavirus has been detected in blood and stool specimens Link: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/faq.html </a>, but that it’s unclear whether infectious virus can persist in blood or stool.</ins></p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0"><ins>Bone marrow and organs like the liver can become inflamed too, said Dr. George Diaz, section leader for infectious diseases at Providence Regional Medical Center in Everett, Wash., whose team <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/what-it-was-like-for-doctors-and-nurses-at-an-everett-hospital-to-treat-the-nations-first-novel-coronavirus-patient/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">treated the first U.S. coronavirus patient Link: https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/what-it-was-like-for-doctors-and-nurses-at-an-everett-hospital-to-treat-the-nations-first-novel-coronavirus-patient/ </a>. There may also be some inflammation in small blood vessels, as happened with SARS, the viral outbreak in 2002 and 2003.</ins></p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0"><ins>“The virus will actually land on organs like the heart, the kidney, the liver, and may cause some direct damage to those organs,” Dr. Schaffner said. As the body’s immune system shifts into high gear to battle the infection, the resulting inflammation may cause those organs to malfunction, he said.</ins></p><p class="css-53u6y8"><ins></ins></p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0"><ins>As a result, some patients may endure damage that is inflicted not just by the virus, but by their own immune system as it rages to combat the infection.</ins></p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0"><ins>Experts have not yet documented whether the virus can affect the brain. But scientists who studied SARS have reported some evidence that <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2493326/#__ffn_sectitle" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the SARS virus could infiltrate the brain in some patients Link: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2493326/#__ffn_sectitle </a>.

Some patients seem to recover but then develop symptoms again.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Dr. Xiao said that some patients in China recovered but got sick again, apparently because they had damaged and vulnerable lung tissue that was subsequently attacked by bacteria in their body. Some of those patients ended up dying from a bacterial infection, not the virus. But that didn’t appear to cause the majority of deaths, he said.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Other cases have been tragic mysteries. Dr. Xiao said he personally knew a man and woman who got infected, but seemed to be improving. Then the man deteriorated and was hospitalized.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">“He was in I.C.U., getting oxygen, and he texted his wife that he was getting better, he had good appetite and so on,” Dr. Xiao said. “But then in the late afternoon, she stopped receiving texts from him. She didn’t know what was going on. And by 10 p.m., she got a notice from the hospital that he had passed.”</p></section></article>

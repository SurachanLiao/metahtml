<div><p>In an unprecedented move, the United States designated Iran&#8217;s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and the Quds Force, the extraterritorial branch of the IRGC, as a terrorist organization on Monday. It is the first time that the U.S. has designated another nation&#8217;s army as a terrorist group.</p>
<p>&#8220;The IRGC is the Iranian government&#8217;s primary means of directing and implementing its global terrorist campaign,&#8221; the White House <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-president-designation-islamic-revolutionary-guard-corps-foreign-terrorist-organization/">said</a> in a statement, explaining the decision which is seen as part of the Trump administration&#8217;s &#8220;maximum pressure&#8221; campaign against the Islamic Republic that saw the U.S. withdrawing from the 2015 nuclear accord and the reimposition of sanctions.</p>
<p>&#8220;This action will significantly expand the scope and scale of our maximum pressure on the Iranian regime,&#8221; the statement notes. &#8220;It makes crystal clear the risks of conducting business with, or providing support to, the IRGC. If you are doing business with the IRGC, you will be bankrolling terrorism.&#8221;</p>
<p>The White House said the Trump administration would &#8220;continue to increase financial pressure and raise the costs on the Iranian regime for its support of terrorist activity until it abandons its malign and outlaw behavior.&#8221;</p>
<p>More than 970 Iranian entities and individuals affiliated with the IRGC were already under U.S. sanctions. The State Department designated the IRGC for sanctions in 2007 due to &#8220;proliferation activities and support for terrorism&#8221; and has described it as Iran&#8217;s &#8220;primary arm for executing its policy of supporting terrorist and insurgent groups.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to the control it exerts over Iran&#8217;s economy, the IRGC supports terror groups and militias throughout the world through its Quds Force, which is commanded by Gen. Qassem Suleimani. IRGC-Quds Forces have been reported in Syria supporting the regime of Bashar al-Assad and work closely with the Lebanon-based terrorist group Hezbollah. The Quds Force is also behind many of the brutal Shiite militias that are fighting in Iraq and Yemen.</p>
<p>Iran <a href="https://en.radiofarda.com/a/iran-guards-commander-threatens-u-s-forces-if-irgc-is-designated-a-terror-group/29866460.html">warned</a> Sunday that it could respond in kind, listing the U.S. military as a terror organization. &#8220;If the U.S. takes this step and endangers our national security we will take reciprocal measures, based on the policies of the Islamic Republic,&#8221; said IRGC Chief Commander Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari. In October 2017, President Hassan Rouhani told his cabinet that, &#8220;If the U.S. makes the next mistake and adopts a measure against the IRGC, it will be the worst mistake.&#8221;</p>

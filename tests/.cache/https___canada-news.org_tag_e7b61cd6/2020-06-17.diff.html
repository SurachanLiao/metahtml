But leaks were found in the roof of the $107 million building shortly after completion. <a href="https://edmonton.ctvnews.ca/council-to-discuss-4m-increase-for-delayed-police-detachment-1.4628461">The roof was patched last fall, causing the budget to balloon by $4 million.</a></p><p>This past January, inspectors found 22 more leaks in the roof.</p><p>“It’s beautiful, it’s ready to open, but the roof is leaking, that’s frustrating,” said Coun. Bev Esslinger.</p><p>A report will go before city council next week to replace the entire roof, at a cost of $8 million, which the city would have to borrow.</p><p>“I’d rather not spend a penny of it, but at the same time to have a facility that I can’t use,” Esslinger said. “Seems ridiculous.”</p><p>The project was approved in 2012, before the current area councillor Jon Dziadyk was elected.</p><p>“It’s a beautiful building, I love it,” he said.</p><p>“The Police need and deserve a facility like this, perhaps the roof shouldn’t have been so elaborate in the first place.”</p><p>The building will replace the existing police station in northwest Edmonton, which doesn’t have any holding cells. The new building also has a training facility. Currently, the police department is renting gym space in Griesbach for training.</p><p>“Maybe we should have been a bit more modest and then this building would be up and running right now with the police actually in it.”</p><p>“I’m sure after this we’ll have a discussion about what could have happened differently, should we have designed it like that, at this stage, it’s figure out how to move forward,” said Esslinger.</p><p>The city has taken the original contractors to court. Councillors expect a settlement will cover the cost of the initial repairs and the new roof.</p><p>The city will choose from two possible designs for the new roof, more information about those options is expected to be revealed on Monday, as well as a timeline for the project. </p></article> <p><del>With files from CTV News Edmonton’s Jeremy Thompson</del></p><del> </del><p><del><a href="https://edmonton.ctvnews.ca/8m-price-tag-for-new-roof-for-nw-police-station-city-suing-contractor-1.4931592">Source Link: https://edmonton.ctvnews.ca/8m-price-tag-for-new-roof-for-nw-police-station-city-suing-contractor-1.4931592 </a></del></p>

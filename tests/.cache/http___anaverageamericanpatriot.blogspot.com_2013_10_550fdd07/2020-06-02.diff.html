 we too are considered their enemy along with Israel as we seem to be

 is a good thing and I agree with it but if they truly consider 
themselves protectors of the people of the Levant they would be 
protectors of all the downtrodden in the middle east. They should be the
 protectors of Palestine when they are done with Syria. I do not think 
it is a bad thing that they are in Syria. However when the job is done 
they should move on to help Palestinians. Palestinians are truly of the 
Levant.</span></ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins><span class="tl">Muslims
 of Palestine are largely descendants of Christians and Jews of the 
southern Levant. The Southern Levant roughly encompasses Palestine, the 
West Bank, the Gaza Strip, along with the modern sovereign states of 
Israel, Jordan and the southern parts of Lebanon and Syria. We are 
talking all the way back to prehistoric times people. As we know, the big powers Iran, Russia, and the United States are fighting a proxy war in Syria. </span><span class="tl">The
 realities on the ground are that Iran "PERSIA" is influencing and 
interfering everywhere they possibly can in order to stop what they 
think is the US getting its way. It has nothing to do with doing the 
right thing for Syria as a whole. It has everything to do with keeping 
the US, the West, and Arabs from having events in Syria go their way and
 not the way of Iran, Russia, China and the rest of their allies. This
 is all about the future direction of the entire middle east. The goal 
absolutely is to be the country who decides which direction the new 
Middle East (dis)order will take. Bush started it by attacking Iraq to 
get into the middle east to destabilize it and start the new middle east
 order the idiot said God told him to do now it will be up to Iran and 
Saudi Arabia (Al Qaeda?) at least up front fight it out whether this 
goes the Iranian Shiite way or the Saudi Arabian Sunni way and do not 
forget Israel! You know I firmly 
believe and have said so a million times by now that since 9/11 
everything was construed to allow Bush to gain the power he needed to 
prosecute his new order not just in the Middle East but on the entire 
world! He diverted from Afghanistan to get back into the Middle East 
with the goal of setting up a larger safety zone for Israel and going 
after Iran. Both will fail! It has long been my contention that coming 
to Israel's aid once they attack Iran will be our in to Iran but with 
Iran, the Gulf, Syria, and everything else who knows what will happen 
first.  We must contain this to the 
middle east and keep it from turning into WW3. This must be a middle 
east fight and problem or the entire world is in dire trouble and we 
have too much already as we try to move successfully through the 21st 
century. I am afraid we are failing our children in every regard. </span></ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>James Joiner</ins></p><p><ins>Gardner, Ma</ins></p><p><ins><a href="http://anaverageamericanpatriot.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">http://anaverageamericanpatriot.blogspot.com Link: http://anaverageamericanpatriot.blogspot.com/ </a></ins></p><ins> </ins></span><ins> </ins><p class="post-footer-line post-footer-line-1"><ins><span class="post-author vcard">Posted by

 a damn what anyone says. Bush, Cheney, and their Democratization 
program in an already historically unstable middle east set all of this 
and more in motion! The hell on earth Bush created for Iraqi’s 
will engulf the entire Middle East before it encompasses the entire 
world if we can not contain it. Under Bush we broke a long standing 
tradition of not adding fuel to the Middle East fire by supplying 
weapons. We are now, including advanced weaponry and missile defence 
systems. The Middle East breakdown Bush started armed and funded is 
continuing under Obama. This up to now proxy war in the middle east is

We and Bush knew it would erupt into total civil war before he
 ignored all good advice to the contrary and attacked Iraq to get back 
into the middle east to help Iran and look for a reason to go after 
Syria, Iran, and others. Well you see how that is going. 
<span>Bush
 started this civil war he knew would be the result of his illegal 
attack on Iraq so he could get back in to the middle east to help 
Israel. </span> </span></ins></p><p><ins></ins></p><p><ins><span><span><span>It will not be stopped and before Bush's illegal attack he was warned of this. He as you know ignored all good advice.</span></span></span></ins></p><ins> </ins><ins><span><span><span><span>Bush
 still swears this was a success and history will vindicate him. Iraq's 
breakdown that he guaranteed with his illegal attack will spread 
throughout the middle east. Now it will be aided by Syria's breakdown 
spreading throughout the middle east. Turkey is already preparing to go 
into Syria after Turkish, Iraqi, and Syrian Kurds forming up and 
attacking from Syria. The total middle east breakdown we have seen 
coming and talked about from day one is fast approaching.</span></span> <span><span>The
 breakdown Sunni against Shiite against Kurd was guaranteed the day Bush
 ignored all good advice to the contrary and attacked Iraq. It was 
guaranteed as soon as we left whether we left today or were stupid 
enough to hang around longer as Republican nominees are wrongly 
criticizing Obama for not doing. From Iraq it will spread throughout the
 entire middle east compliments of Bush not Obama.</span><span>The
 International Committee of the Red Cross, in a report titled "Iraq: No 
Let-up in the Humanitarian Crisis," writes, "Despite limited 
improvements in security in some areas, armed violence is still having a
 disastrous impact. Civilians continue to be killed in the hostilities. 
"The injured often do not receive adequate medical care. Nothing has 
changed people except in some cases to get worse. </span><span>Millions
 of people have been forced to rely on insufficient supplies of 
poor-quality water as water and sewage systems suffer from a lack of 
maintenance and a shortage of engineers." "Nothing has changed people 
but we are leaving them to their own demise and it will spread through 
the entire middle east."</span><span>Both Amnesty and the Red Cross slam the Iraqi government for failing to grapple with the critical needs of their populations. </span><span>The
 two reports cited a litany of concerns that will not be corrected, 
including severe widespread poverty, a lack of food and water, and 
broken families left to scrounge for whatever they can find to get by. 
Both reports described a situation that shows no sign of clear 
improvement. Many women "have been forced to wear Islamic dress or 
targeted for abduction, rape or killing. That is not to speak of the 
more than 2 million permanent nomads because of Bush's and Obama's. </span><span>If
 Bush had stayed in Afghanistan as he should have instead of diverting 
from the war on terror to attack Iraq so he could start implementing his
 new middle east order, Iraq may still have a Dictator but they would 
have security, electricity, water, fuel, and a lot more than they have 
now or will have in the future. We will never be able to bring services 
anywhere close to the level they were at when Saddam was in power. It is
 laughable to think that anyone thought they would be better post 
Saddam.</span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>James Joiner</span><span>Gardner, Ma</span><span><a href="http://anaverageamericanpatriot.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">http://anaverageamericanpatriot.blogspot.com  Link: http://anaverageamericanpatriot.blogspot.com/ </a></span></span> </span> </span></span></span> </ins><p class="post-footer-line post-footer-line-1"><ins><span class="post-author vcard">Posted by

 is all about the future direction of the entire middle east. The goal 
absolutely is to be the country who decides which direction the new 
Middle East (dis)order will take. Bush started it by attacking Iraq to 
get into the middle east to destabilize it and start the new middle east
 order the idiot said God told him to do now it will be up to Iran and 
Saudi Arabia (Al Qaeda?) at least up front fight it out whether this 
goes the Iranian Shiite way or the Saudi Arabian Sunni way and do not

started it by attacking Iraq to get into the middle east to destabilize

 now it will be up to Iran and Saudi Arabia at least up front fight it 
out whether this goes the Iranian Shiite way or the Saudi Arabian Sunni

been using Lebanon and now Syria as their battlefront, up to now they 
have been able to avoid direct confrontation. Iran has pumped millions 
of dollars in supplies and arms into Lebanon and Syria much to the 
consternation of her suffering people while Saudi Arabia has been 
supporting the Palestinian Authority. So far there has been no 
direct confrontation. However I absolutely see what I have been warning 
about since Bush diverted from Afghanistan to attack Iraq and get back 
in the middle east to create a new middle east (dis)order! I do not give
 a damn what anyone says. Bush, Cheney, and their Democratization 
program in an already historically unstable middle east set all of this 
and more in motion! The hell on earth Bush created for Iraqi’s 
will engulf the entire Middle East before it encompasses the entire 
world if we can not contain it. Under Bush we broke a long standing 
tradition of not adding fuel to the Middle East fire by supplying 
weapons. We are now, including advanced weaponry and missile defence 
systems. The Middle East breakdown Bush started armed and funded is 
continuing under Obama. This up to now proxy war in the middle east is 
under way.  You know I firmly believe and have said so a million 
times by now that since 9/11 everything was construed to allow Bush to 
gain the power he needed to prosecute his new order not just in the 
Middle East but on the entire world! He diverted from Afghanistan to get
 back into the Middle East with the goal of setting up a larger safety 
zone for Israel and going after Iran. Both will fail! It has long been 
my contention that coming to Israel's aid once they attack Iran will be 
our in to Iran but with Iran, the Gulf, Syria, and everything else who 
knows what will happen first.  We must contain this to the middle
 east and keep it from turning into WW3. This must be a middle east 
fight and problem or the entire world is in dire trouble and we have too
 much already as we try to move successfully through the 21st century. I
 am afraid we are failing our children in every regard.

weapons. We are now, including advanced weaponry and missile defence 
systems. The Middle East breakdown Bush started armed and funded is 
continuing under Obama. This up to now proxy war in the middle east is 
under way.  You know I firmly believe and have said so a million 
times by now that since 9/11 everything was construed to allow Bush to 
gain the power he needed to prosecute his new order not just in the 
Middle East but on the entire world! He diverted from Afghanistan to get
 back into the Middle East with the goal of setting up a larger safety 
zone for Israel and going after Iran. Both will fail! It has long been 
my contention that coming to Israel's aid once they attack Iran will be 
our in to Iran but with Iran, the Gulf, Syria, and everything else who 
knows what will happen first.  We must contain this to the middle
 east and keep it from turning into WW3. This must be a middle east 
fight and problem or the entire world is in dire trouble and we have too
 much already as we try to move successfully through the 21st century. I
 am afraid we are failing our children in every regard.

 reprint this at this time because I am currently experiencing
 problems with this issue. First I want to say that as you read this you
 will see too why it is no surprise who is really in charge. You will 
also understand why President Lincoln and President Kennedy were 
assassinated. Anyway we hear every day how low the bank rates are and 
offers from everyone and their brother to refinance your mortgage at a 
lower rate and for maybe no cost. Well!</ins></p><p><ins>It has been over a month of phone calls now and we are still having a 
problem finding a bank who will do a Refi for us because we do not owe 
enough money to make it worth their while. I was under the misconceived 
impression that it behooved any bank to lower your rate but boy was I 
wrong. Our current bank will not cooperate with us and is trying 
everything under the sun to keep us feeding their inflated rate but we 
are out of there. </ins></p><p><ins>The final straw for me was when they said closing costs would be 7 to 9 
thousand, for a 46 thousand dollar loan get real! I finally talked to a 
woman at one agency who finally spoke the truth. She used my standard 
line and that is that we do not matter. She said the Federal Reserve 
does not represent us they work for and represent the banks.</ins></p><p><ins>That led me to dig this up as she was right and we are so screwed. This 
is sobering and reaffirms what I was being told. I am just so peeved at 
this lie we are living they call a Democracy. This is all disquieting 
but give this a quick glance.</ins></p><p><ins>This was sent to me with no Author by someone more than in the know but I
 will leave that alone.Read it and weep, I am wanting to say every 
expletive in the world as once you hear this it makes 100% common sense 
and we are powerless? I do not know who the Author is but this is 
frightening, sobering, debilitating, and frustrating, what do we do 
about it? Pay particular attention to all of it, Google whatever you 
want. Man am I peeved with this set up they call a Democracy. SOB!</ins></p><p><ins>1) If we paid off our debts, our problems would be solved. Wrong. Wrong.
 Wrong. The banks wrote the Federal Reserve Act in secret. They said you
 would not be allowed to have money unless you first went into debt. In 
fact when you pay off a loan, the bank cancels money supply. So if we 
all paid off our debts including the government debt, we would have no 
money and the economy would collapse. We would all be reduced to barter.</ins></p><p><ins>2) The bankers who wrote The Federal Reserve Act in 1913 knowingly 
engineered a Fatal Debt Bomb into the legislation. This is true. When 
you go to a bank to get a loan, the banker created ten thousand dollars 
in new money by entering that amount onto a checking account. Notice 
that if you signed a note for simple interest at 10%, you will owe the 
banker $11,000 in one year’s time. He only created $10,000 so how do you
 pay him back the principal plus interest? Good question. What he does 
is to create more money through more loans so there is enough money to 
pay the note plus interest.</ins></p><p><ins>This means that the total amount of debts in the society are growing at a
 compound rate. Bankers have known since the Babylonians that unchecked 
exponential growth of unpayable debts will destroy any nation with a 
Debt Bomb. This is what is happening to America and the world today. 
Michael Hudson wrote about the Babylonian solution. They developed a 
formula that told them how long this rising tide of Unpayable Debt could
 grow before they had to cancel all the debts and start over again.</ins></p><p><ins>Let me repeat that the bankers have known this for over 4,000 years. But
 they have made sure that you know nothing of it because they want to 
foreclose on you and your nation so they can but everything for pennies 
on the dollar in bankruptcy proceedings.</ins></p><p><ins>The Russian demographer Borisov tells us that the bankers starved 
millions of Americans to death in the 1930s rather than allow people to 
understand the Babylonian solution. The Bible writers copied this 
concept when they wrote of the Jubilee cancellation of debt.</ins></p><p><ins>3) The Federal Reserve Act was written to transfer wealth from us to the
 bankers through the creation of a Debt Based money system. This is 
true. President Lincoln had created Greenbacks without borrowing money 
from the banks so there was no national debt and no interest on the 
debt. Lincoln simply printed the money and spent it into circulation.</ins></p><p><ins>There is absolutely no reason to have a national debt except to collect 
interest on a fictional debt. Why give the power to create money to the 
banks when government alone according to the Constitution is supposed to
 coin money? I will tell you why. The banks want to bring back slavery. 
They want you to become an indentured servant who inherits a national 
debt that is unpayable. They want to reduce you to slavery,</ins></p><p><ins>Any politician or pundit who does not understand this is either stupid or lying.</ins></p><p><ins>I should point out that President Kennedy issued Executive Order 11110 
which directed the Mint to issue US Banknotes to replace Federal Reserve
 Notes. These JFK Banknotes were to be debt free as were Lincoln’s 
Greenbacks. They were withdrawn from circulation after his 
assassination. JFK was murdered on the 53rd anniversary of the secret 
meeting of the bankers on November 22nd, 1910 in a private rail-car that
 took them to Jekyll Island. Bankers like to do things on the 
anniversary of an important date to make sure you understand that 
monetary reform carries a death penalty.</ins></p><p><ins>4) All we have to do to solve our economic woes is to balance the 
budget. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. All those knuckleheads need to listen and 
learn. The Gross National Product is the total sales of a country. 
Economists write it as a formula Where GNP = C + I + G or GNP equals 
Consumption plus Investment plus Government spending. The total GNP is 
currently 14 trillion dollars. Suppose we balance the budget by cutting 
spending two trillion dollars. That would mean we subtract two trillion 
from G and our new GNP is reduced to 12 trillion dollars which means 
that one seventh of the American economy would disappear overnight. That
 would send us instantly into a worse economic blight than the first 
Great Depression. Currently the states owe the federal government almost
 100 billion dollars for extended unemployment benefits.</ins></p><p><ins>A man was recently explaining to his young daughter that we have no 
bread lines like they did in the 1930s because we have almost 49 million
 people on Food Stamps. Suppose we cut off unemployment extended 
benefits and Food stamps to make a down payment on that two trillion 
dollar budget cut. America would have nationwide food riots. 90% of all 
black children are on Food Stamps. I do not know the figures for 
Hispanics. But there would be no grocery stores in major cities that 
would not escape the riots.</ins></p><p><ins>If you hear someone talking of cuts, tell them to eliminate Unpayable 
Debts and interest on the national debt by bringing back non-interest 
bearing debt free Greenbacks. Then they can cut out the five foreign 
wars and remove our troops from at least 100 foreign nations. Then they 
can seize the assets of the banks that stole over 27 trillion dollars 
from us during the Banker Bailouts.</ins></p><p><ins>5) Fiat currencies always fail. What we need is a gold standard. Wrong. 
Wrong. Wrong. Presidents Lincoln and Kennedy had fiat currencies that 
were successful. And only ended with their assassination. The Isle of 
Guernsey and the American colonies both had fiat currencies that were 
successful.</ins></p><p><ins>The Italians had a gold currency that failed in 1348. The bankers loaned
 out more money than they had on deposit. This is called fractional 
reserve banking. Usually a bank will loan out nine times what it has on 
deposit. The Italian banks in Venice were unable to meet demands for 
gold from their depositors.</ins></p><p><ins>Currently, the risk manager at JP Morgan has two thousand dollars in 
risk for every dollar in deposits. I think this is an underestimate. </ins></p><p><ins>6) America could go onto the gold standard because we have all that gold
 at Fort Knox. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. America has gold plated tungsten 
bars at Fort Knox. And the banks leased our gold and sold it four or 
five times to keep themselves from going bankrupt.</ins></p><p><ins>The gold was stolen by the Rothschild s and their friends. If we went 
back to the gold standard, we would be entering slavery to the 
Rothschild network because they would have all the gold money. The 
Rothschild s financed the Jewish trade in African slaves. Ask a black 
man how well that Rothschild slavery worked out for him.</ins></p><p><ins>I personally own silver because I expect this fractional reserve debt 
based monetary scheme to collapse very soon. I would use a gold exchange
 standard to get things going. But I could manage a monetary system with
 Greenbacks if Zionists and morons on welfare were not allowed to vote.</ins></p><p><ins>7) All we need to do to balance our trade deficit is to cut wages by 
devaluing the dollar so we can become more competitive. Wrong. Wrong. 
Wrong. Steve Keen is an Australian economist who says we need to 
increase wages so debts become payable. Unpayable debts lead directly to
 slavery. The US dollar eleven years ago was worth $1.20 when measured 
against a basket of six currencies. Today the US dollar is worth almost 
75 cents. This has not created one job in the past decade. What it has 
done was raise the price of oil so everything costs more to produce.</ins></p><p><ins>In China factory workers are lucky to make a dollar an hour. They work 
72 hours a week. They get no overtime and have no benefits. The Chinese 
workers do not make enough money to ride those Mag Lev fast rail trains 
you have read about. Suppose we cut American wages in half? Would that 
create jobs? No. We have been cutting wages since 1970 and we have fewer
 jobs today than then. It never worked in the past. No reason to believe
 it will work now.</ins></p><p><ins>To make the debts easier to pay we need to raise wages. To do that we 
have to stop issuing a million Green card work permits for legal 
immigrants. And we need to send back a few million illegal immigrants to
 open jobs for millions of unemployed Americans. But to create jobs we 
need new industries. We need to protect those industries with a 25% 
tariff. We need to create new jobs in computers, materials science, 
bio-engineering, aviation and energy by releasing the Top Secret 
research that is held in government labs. We could collect royalties 
from American industries employing American citizens. We could lease 
these patents to foreign competitors but we need a tariff to protect 
American jobs.</ins></p><p><ins>We made America prosperous by repealing the Glass Steagall Act and by 
allowing Credit Default Swaps to remain unregulated. Wrong. Wrong. 
Wrong. The bankers passed NAFTA and the WTO in 1994 so they could send 
11 million jobs and 43,000 manufacturing plants overseas. They created 
the illusion of prosperity under Clinton by pumping up real estate and 
the stock market. The stock market was deliberately crashed in 2000 so 
the Zionists could elect George W Bush President because they wanted 
lots of wars for Israel. When the stock market failed, the Zionists 
created the subprime lending bubble on top of the already existing 
housing bubble.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="post-footer-line post-footer-line-2"><ins>They loaned money to people who had no means of paying 
the loans. That did not matter. Some mortgages were sold as many as five
 times in Mortgage Backed Securities. When these loans failed, the banks
 collected on their Credit Default Swap insurance. There were no 
reserves set aside to pay losses. That did not matter. The bankers had 
the taxpayers pay out 27 trillion dollars in Bailouts to cover their 
frauds and keep the banking criminals out of jail. When the Europeans 
threatened a run on the American banks if they were not compensate for 
the trash Wall Street sold them, Ben Bernanke created 12.3 trillion 
dollars in new money and use it to but 6.3 trillion dollars in 
fraudulent bonds.</ins></p><p><ins>Glass Steagall was passed in 1933 and forbade investment banks from 
becoming commercial banks so the depositors are not exposed to 
speculative risks. With the repeal of Glass Steagall Jamie Dimon at JP 
Morgan was allowed to sell 80 trillion dollars in Credit Default Swaps 
betting that interest rates will not go up. If interest rates do go up, 
there will be worldwide Depression. Jamie Dimon isn’t worried about it 
because he probably knows when the Zionists will start World War III.</ins></p><p><ins>This is not a free market. It is criminality on a grand scale.</ins></p><p><ins>9) We have a moral obligation to pay our national debt. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong.</ins></p><p><ins>Jim Willie pointed out to Max Kaiser that in the 1990s under beloved 
leaders Bill Clinton and George H W Bush the Treasury sold 2.2 trillion 
dollars more in Treasury bonds than were required to fund the deficit. 
That money was pocketed by the banks who now expect you to pay them back
 for the money they stole plus the interest. Catherine Austin Fitts has 
been telling us for years that the government allows the banks to steal 
billions of dollars every week from government spending which we are not
 allowed to audit.</ins></p><p><ins>We owe the banks nothing. We need to take back what they have stolen.</ins></p><p><ins>I also need to make this point about money creation. When a bank makes a
 loan, they are creating money by adding credits to a bank account. They
 are not lending you Mrs. Jones life savings. What they are doing is 
creating money. Money is a claim against our right to purchase goods and
 services. If we increase the money supply, then we are all in a sense 
bearing a burden by the diminished purchasing power of our money. But 
only bankers are allowed to participate in the benefits of granting a 
loan. I don’t think so. Cancel the debts and seize all of the banker’s 
wealth. And that of their co-conspirators. We ought not to suffer 
because the bankers killed our Presidents.</ins></p><p><ins>James Joiner</ins></p><p><ins>Gardner, Ma</ins></p><p><ins><a href="http://www.blogger.com/goog_1656417830">http://anaverageamericanpatriot.blogspot.com  Link: http://www.blogger.com/goog_1656417830 </a></ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="post-footer-line post-footer-line-1"><ins><span class="post-author vcard">Posted by

 are several components of the sudden shift in the world’s energy 
supply, but the prime mover is a resurgence of US oil and gas 
production, particularly the unlocking of new reserves of oil and gas 
found in shale rock. The widespread adoption of techniques such as 
hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling has made those reserves 
much more accessible, and, in the case of natural gas, resulted in a 
vast glut that has sent prices plunging. The report predicted that the 
United States would overtake Russia as the leading producer of natural

 do not like Fracking or horizontal drilling but imagine the United 
States as the worlds leading gas And oil exporter? Instability is roiling world oil markets, 
and Americans are paying $3.50 a gallon for gas. And oil shale fever is 
again rising in the geologic region known as the Piceance Basin, part of
 the Green River Formation that stretches across the rugged plains of 
northwestern Colorado and parts of Wyoming and Utah. 
There
 is no dispute that a thousand feet below the isolated ranch country 
here on Colorado's western slope lie almost unimaginable oil riches. 
It's locked in sedimentary rock -- essentially immature oil that given a
 few million years under heat and pressure would produce pools of oil 
easy to extract. The 
Energy Department and private industry estimate that a trillion barrels 
are here in Colorado -- about the same amount as the entire world's 
known reserves of conventional oil. The entire Green River Formation 
might hold as much as 2 trillion barrels. As
 it has before, shale oil holds out the hope of a USA no longer 
dependent on foreign oil. Shell Oil is engaged in a multi year test of a
 new technology for extracting the oil. Previous efforts that were 
uneconomical and environmentally destructive entailed mining the rock, 
crushing it and heating it above ground to release the oil.</span></span></ins><p><ins></ins></p><p><ins><span><span>From
 what I have seen already we are destroying peoples food and water

 the ground. Everywhere fracking goes on earthquakes are showing up

is no ones fault of course, it is natural my rear.</span></span></ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins></ins></p><p><ins><span><span>To
 me for the people to think there is any plus at all at our becoming

 you know will never happen because it is not in the interest of oil 
companies. As they do now, whenever something good or bad happens that 
may or may not even affect the industry they raise prices. The world as a

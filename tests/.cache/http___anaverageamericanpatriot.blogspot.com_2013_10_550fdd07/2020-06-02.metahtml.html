 "We will not let them get away with it because they want to target us,"
 a senior FSA commander said on condition of anonymity after members of 
the Islamic State of Iraq and Levant killed Kamal Hamami on Thursday.</a><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/07/12/us-syria-crisis-idUSBRE96B08A20130712" target="_blank">"We
 are going to wipe the floor with them," he said. Hamami, also known by 
his nom de guerre, Abu Bassir al-Ladkani, is one of the top 30 figures 
on the FSA's Supreme Military Command.His killing highlights how the 
West's vision of a future, democratic Syria is unraveling.</a> The total middle east breakdown progresses, Iraq, Syria, and Egypt are just the beginning. <a class="tt" href="http://www.blogger.com/null" target="_blank">Syrian
 rebels, al-Qaida fighters battle in Aleppo:  Activists say Syrian

northern city of Aleppo.</a><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/syrian-rebels-al-qaida-fighters-battle-aleppo-111700047.html" target="_blank">The
 checkpoint is the only gateway between rebel-held eastern districts and
 the city's western areas, controlled by President Bashar Assad's 
troops. Earlier this week, al-Qaida-linked militants seized the 
checkpoint and closed it for several days, cutting the flow of food 
supplies to the city and triggering the confrontation.</a></span></p><p>

<span>Killing
 their fellow "rebels" is counterproductive and destructive to their 
cause of taking Assad down.They should take out their sectarian strife&#8217;s
 later. Concentrate on defeating Assad then turn back on each other 
later. I just do not understand any lack of common sense.</span></p><p>




<p>
<p>
<p>
<span>There
 is time to kill each other later. They are going to have to rid the 
middle east of those trying to control it to enforce their idea of a new
 middle east order. This is barely beginning.</span></p>

<p>
<span><span class="tl">Okay
 we too are considered their enemy along with Israel as we seem to be 
every ones in the middle east who wants us off their land. With that 
said I don't know if  they are not abusing the good name of the Levant. 
Al- Nusra was first heard of in 2011 and was formed to remove Bashar Al 
Assad from power for killing the Sunni  rebels.</span></span></p>
<span>
 
 
<p>
<span class="tl">That
 is a good thing and I agree with it but if they truly consider 
themselves protectors of the people of the Levant they would be 
protectors of all the downtrodden in the middle east. They should be the
 protectors of Palestine when they are done with Syria. I do not think 
it is a bad thing that they are in Syria. However when the job is done 
they should move on to help Palestinians. Palestinians are truly of the 
Levant.</span></p>
 
 
<p>
<span class="tl">Muslims
 of Palestine are largely descendants of Christians and Jews of the 
southern Levant. The Southern Levant roughly encompasses Palestine, the 
West Bank, the Gaza Strip, along with the modern sovereign states of 
Israel, Jordan and the southern parts of Lebanon and Syria. We are 
talking all the way back to prehistoric times people. As we know, the big powers Iran, Russia, and the United States are fighting a proxy war in Syria. </span><span class="tl">The
 realities on the ground are that Iran "PERSIA"&#160;is influencing and 
interfering everywhere they possibly can in order to stop what they 
think is the US getting its way. It has nothing to do with doing the 
right thing for Syria as a whole. It has everything to do with keeping 
the US, the West, and Arabs from having events in Syria go their way and
 not the way of Iran, Russia, China and the rest of their allies. This
 is all about the future direction of the entire middle east. The goal 
absolutely is to be the country who decides which direction the new 
Middle East (dis)order will take. Bush started it by attacking Iraq to 
get into the middle east to destabilize it and start the new middle east
 order the idiot said God told him to do now it will be up to Iran and 
Saudi Arabia (Al Qaeda?) at least up front fight it out whether this 
goes the Iranian Shiite way or the Saudi Arabian Sunni way and do not 
forget Israel! You know I firmly 
believe and have said so a million times by now that since 9/11 
everything was construed to allow Bush to gain the power he needed to 
prosecute his new order not just in the Middle East but on the entire 
world! He diverted from Afghanistan to get back into the Middle East 
with the goal of setting up a larger safety zone for Israel and going 
after Iran. Both will fail! It has long been my contention that coming 
to Israel's aid once they attack Iran will be our in to Iran but with 
Iran, the Gulf, Syria, and everything else who knows what will happen 
first.  We must contain this to the 
middle east and keep it from turning into WW3. This must be a middle 
east fight and problem or the entire world is in dire trouble and we 
have too much already as we try to move successfully through the 21st 
century. I am afraid we are failing our children in every regard. </span></p>

 Arab world remained reliant on the U.S. as the region&#8217;s policeman of

military action, two years into a Syrian conflict that the U.N. says has
 killed more than 100,000 people.</a></span> 
<span> This is not going to stop until the proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia comes out in the open. <a href="http://anaverageamericanpatriot.blogspot.com/2011/04/saudi-iranian-neo-cold-war.html" target="_blank">Remember the Saudi Iranian Neo cold war?</a> It is soon to be out in the open and go virile!<a href="http://anaverageamericanpatriot.blogspot.com/2011/01/iran-saudi-arabian-proxy-war-in-iraq.html" target="_blank">Remember the Iran Saudi proxy war in Iraq gaining steam?</a><a href="http://anaverageamericanpatriot.blogspot.com/2010/06/saudi-arabias-ulterior-motive-in.html" target="_blank">Remember the Saudi's opened their air so Israel could attack Iran</a></span>

out whether this goes the Iranian Shiite way or the Saudi Arabian Sunni

been using Lebanon and now Syria as their battlefront, up to now they 
have been able to avoid direct confrontation. Iran has pumped millions 
of dollars in supplies and arms into Lebanon and Syria much to the 
consternation of her suffering people while Saudi Arabia has been 
supporting the Palestinian Authority. So far there has been no 
direct confrontation. However I absolutely see what I have been warning 
about since Bush diverted from Afghanistan to attack Iraq and get back 
in the middle east to create a new middle east (dis)order! I do not give
 a damn what anyone says. Bush, Cheney, and their Democratization 
program in an already historically unstable middle east set all of this 
and more in motion! The hell on earth Bush created for Iraqi&#8217;s 
will engulf the entire Middle East before it encompasses the entire 
world if we can not contain it. Under Bush we broke a long standing 
tradition of not adding fuel to the Middle East fire by supplying 
weapons. We are now, including advanced weaponry and missile defence 
systems. The Middle East breakdown Bush started armed and funded is 
continuing under Obama. This up to now proxy war in the middle east is 
under way.  You know I firmly believe and have said so a million

 It does not take a damn military or political expert. We and Bush knew it would erupt into total civil war before he
 ignored all good advice to the contrary and attacked Iraq to get back 
into the middle east to help Iran and look for a reason to go after 
Syria, Iran, and others. Well you see how that is going. 
<span> Bush
 started this civil war he knew would be the result of his illegal 
attack on Iraq so he could get back in to the middle east to help 
Israel.&#160;</span> 


</span></p><p>

<p>
<span><span><span>It will not be stopped and before Bush's illegal attack he was warned of this. He as you know ignored all good advice.</span></span></span></p>

<span><span>



 
<span><span>Bush
 still swears this was a success and history will vindicate him. Iraq's 
breakdown that he guaranteed with his illegal attack will spread 
throughout the middle east. Now it will be aided by Syria's breakdown 
spreading throughout the middle east. Turkey is already preparing to go 
into Syria after Turkish, Iraqi, and Syrian Kurds forming up and 
attacking from Syria. The total middle east breakdown we have seen 
coming and talked about from day one is fast approaching.</span></span> 

<span>
<span>The
 breakdown Sunni against Shiite against Kurd was guaranteed the day Bush
 ignored all good advice to the contrary and attacked Iraq. It was 
guaranteed as soon as we left whether we left today or were stupid 
enough to hang around longer as Republican nominees are wrongly 
criticizing Obama for not doing. From Iraq it will spread throughout the
 entire middle east compliments of Bush not Obama.</span><span>The
 International Committee of the Red Cross, in a report titled "Iraq: No 
Let-up in the Humanitarian Crisis," writes, "Despite limited 
improvements in security in some areas, armed violence is still having a
 disastrous impact. Civilians continue to be killed in the hostilities. 
"The injured often do not receive adequate medical care. Nothing has 
changed people except in some cases to get worse. </span><span>Millions
 of people have been forced to rely on insufficient supplies of 
poor-quality water as water and sewage systems suffer from a lack of 
maintenance and a shortage of engineers." "Nothing has changed people 
but we are leaving them to their own demise and it will spread through 
the entire middle east."</span><span>Both Amnesty and the Red Cross slam the Iraqi government for failing to grapple with the critical needs of their populations. </span><span>The
 two reports cited a litany of concerns that will not be corrected, 
including severe widespread poverty, a lack of food and water, and 
broken families left to scrounge for whatever they can find to get by. 
Both reports described a situation that shows no sign of clear 
improvement. Many women "have been forced to wear Islamic dress or 
targeted for abduction, rape or killing. That is not to speak of the 
more than 2 million permanent nomads because of Bush's and Obama's. </span><span>If
 Bush had stayed in Afghanistan as he should have instead of diverting 
from the war on terror to attack Iraq so he could start implementing his
 new middle east order, Iraq may still have a Dictator but they would 
have security, electricity, water, fuel, and a lot more than they have 
now or will have in the future. We will never be able to bring services 
anywhere close to the level they were at when Saddam was in power. It is
 laughable to think that anyone thought they would be better post 
Saddam.</span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span> James Joiner</span><span>Gardner, Ma</span><span><a href="http://anaverageamericanpatriot.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">http://anaverageamericanpatriot.blogspot.com </a></span></span>

</h3>

 


 
 
 

<p>
Repost in response to renewed interest in our Federal reserve and banking system: I will limit this to  only the statements about our Banking
 system then follow it by the statements as to why and who for the 
Federal reserve system was really set up by and for and if it did not 
make sense before it will now. </p>
<p>
The individual is handicapped by coming face to face with a conspiracy 
so monstrous he cannot believe it exists. - J Edgar Hoover</p><p>
The real rulers of Washington are Invisible and exercise power from 
behind the scenes. - Justice Felix Frankfurter - US Supreme Court 
Justice</p><p>
* "The real menace of our republic is this invisible government which 
like a giant octopus sprawls its slimy length over city, state and 
nation. Like the octopus of real life, it operates under cover of a self
 created screen....At the head of this octopus are the Rockefeller 
Standard Oil interests and a small group of powerful banking houses 
generally referred to as international bankers. The little coterie of 
powerful international bankers virtually run the United States 
government for their own selfish purposes. They practically control both
 political parties." New York City Mayor John F. Hylan, 1922</p><p>
The real truth of the matter is, as you and I know that a financial 
element in the large centers has OWNED the Government of the U.S. since 
the days of Andrew Jackson." (History points to the last truly honorable
 and incorruptible American President as "Old Hickory") - FDR to Col. E.
 Mandell House 11/21/1933</p><p>
"Give me control of a Nation's money and I care not who makes the laws." - Mayer Amschel Bauer (Rothschild)</p><p>
"The Trilateralist Commission is international ...(and)...is intended to
 be the vehicle for multinational consolidation of the commercial and 
banking interests by seizing CONTROL of the political government of the 
United States. The Trilateralist Commission represents a skillful, 
coordinated effort to seize Control and consolidate the four centers of 
power: Political - Monetary - Intellectual - and Ecclesiastical." - 
Barry Goldwater , U.S. Senator AZ. "With No Apologies"</p><p>
"We shall have World Government. Whether or not we like it. The only 
Question is whether World Government will be achieved by conquest or 
consent." - James Paul Warburg , Foreign agent for the Rothschild 
dynasty - Major Player in the Federal Reserve act scam / Feb. 17, 1950 
speaking before the U.S. Senate.</p><p>
"We are grateful to the Washington Post, the NY Times, Time Magazine, 
and other great publications whose directors have attended our meetings,
 and respected their promises of discretion for almost 40 years. It 
would have been impossible for us to develop OUR PLAN for the world if 
we had been subjected to the lights of publicity during those years. 
But, the world is now more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a
 World Government. The supranational sovereignty of an intellectual 
ELITE and World Bankers is surely preferable to the netional auto
 - determination practiced in past centuries." - David Rockefeller CFR 
Kingpin, Founder of the Trilateral Commission, NOW Godfather / June 1991</p><p>
"It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our 
Banking and Monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be a
 Revolution before tomorrow morning." - Henry Ford</p><p>
"We can't be so fixated on our desire to preserve the rights of ordinary Americans" - Bill Clinton 1993</p> 
<p class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-18351104567048837">
*"We are on the verge of a Global transformation. All we need is the 
right major crisis and the nations will accept the New World Order." - 
David Rockefeller</p><p>
"For more than a century, ideological extremists at either end of the 
political spectrum have seized upon well-publicized incidents to attack 
the Rockefeller family for the inordinate influence they claim we wield 
over American political and economic institutions. Some even believe we 
are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the 
United States, characterizing my family and me as 'internationalists' 
and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more 
integrated global political and economic structure - one world, if you 
will. If that's the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it." - 
David Rockefeller, Memoirs , 2002</p><p>
"We have come to be one of the worst ruled, one of the most completely 
controlled and dominated Governments in the world - no longer a 
Government of free opinion, no longer a Government by conviction and 
vote of the majority, but a Government by the opinion and duress of 
small groups of dominant men." - Woodrow Wilson [U.S. President during 
World War I]</p><p>
"The drive of the Rockefellers and their allies is to create a one-world
 government combining super capitalism and Communism under the same 
tent, all under their control.... Do I mean conspiracy? Yes I do. I am 
convinced there is such a plot, international in scope, generations old 
in planning, and incredibly evil in intent." Congressman Larry P. 
McDonald, 1976, killed in the Korean Airlines 747 that was shot down by 
the Soviets</p><p>
"The governments of the present day have to deal not merely with other 
governments, with emperors, kings and ministers, but also with the 
secret societies which have everywhere their unscrupulous agents, and 
can at the last moment upset all the governments' plans. " British Prime
 Minister Benjamin Disraeli, 1876. <a href="http://anaverageamericanpatriot.blogspot.com/2011/04/telling-and-very-scary-quotes-by-great.html">If you want to see them here they are wholly disconcerting but here</a> </p><p>
Now that will allow you to put this Federal Reserve set up into its 
undeniable perspective. However to save space I will merely add the link
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Federal_Reserve_System"> Here</a></p><p>
Now what do you think?</p><p>

 is all about the future direction of the entire middle east. The goal 
absolutely is to be the country who decides which direction the new 
Middle East (dis)order will take. Bush started it by attacking Iraq to 
get into the middle east to destabilize it and start the new middle east
 order the idiot said God told him to do now it will be up to Iran and 
Saudi Arabia (Al Qaeda?) at least up front fight it out whether this 
goes the Iranian Shiite way or the Saudi Arabian Sunni way and do not 
forget Israel! The goal absolutely is to be the country who 
decides which direction the new middle east (dis)order will take. Bush 
started it by attacking Iraq to get into the middle east to destabilize 
it and start the new middle east order the idiot said God told him to do
 now it will be up to Iran and Saudi Arabia at least up front fight it 
out whether this goes the Iranian Shiite way or the Saudi Arabian Sunni 
way and do not forget Israel! Both Iran and Saudi Arabia have 
been using Lebanon and now Syria as their battlefront, up to now they 
have been able to avoid direct confrontation. Iran has pumped millions 
of dollars in supplies and arms into Lebanon and Syria much to the 
consternation of her suffering people while Saudi Arabia has been 
supporting the Palestinian Authority. So far there has been no 
direct confrontation. However I absolutely see what I have been warning 
about since Bush diverted from Afghanistan to attack Iraq and get back 
in the middle east to create a new middle east (dis)order! I do not give
 a damn what anyone says. Bush, Cheney, and their Democratization 
program in an already historically unstable middle east set all of this 
and more in motion! The hell on earth Bush created for Iraqi&#8217;s 
will engulf the entire Middle East before it encompasses the entire 
world if we can not contain it. Under Bush we broke a long standing 
tradition of not adding fuel to the Middle East fire by supplying 
weapons. We are now, including advanced weaponry and missile defence 
systems. The Middle East breakdown Bush started armed and funded is 
continuing under Obama. This up to now proxy war in the middle east is 
under way.  You know I firmly believe and have said so a million 
times by now that since 9/11 everything was construed to allow Bush to 
gain the power he needed to prosecute his new order not just in the 
Middle East but on the entire world! He diverted from Afghanistan to get
 back into the Middle East with the goal of setting up a larger safety 
zone for Israel and going after Iran. Both will fail! It has long been 
my contention that coming to Israel's aid once they attack Iran will be 
our in to Iran but with Iran, the Gulf, Syria, and everything else who 
knows what will happen first.  We must contain this to the middle
 east and keep it from turning into WW3. This must be a middle east 
fight and problem or the entire world is in dire trouble and we have too
 much already as we try to move successfully through the 21st century. I
 am afraid we are failing our children in every regard. James Joiner Gardner, Ma<a href="http://anaverageamericanpatriot.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">http://anaverageamericanpatriot.blogspot.com </a></span></span>

 is all about the future direction of the entire middle east. The goal 
absolutely is to be the country who decides which direction the new 
Middle East (dis)order will take. Bush started it by attacking Iraq to 
get into the middle east to destabilize it and start the new middle east
 order the idiot said God told him to do now it will be up to Iran and 
Saudi Arabia (Al Qaeda?) at least up front fight it out whether this 
goes the Iranian Shiite way or the Saudi Arabian Sunni way and do not 
forget Israel! The goal absolutely is to be the country who 
decides which direction the new middle east (dis)order will take. Bush 
started it by attacking Iraq to get into the middle east to destabilize 
it and start the new middle east order the idiot said God told him to do
 now it will be up to Iran and Saudi Arabia at least up front fight it 
out whether this goes the Iranian Shiite way or the Saudi Arabian Sunni 
way and do not forget Israel! Both Iran and Saudi Arabia have 
been using Lebanon and now Syria as their battlefront, up to now they 
have been able to avoid direct confrontation. Iran has pumped millions 
of dollars in supplies and arms into Lebanon and Syria much to the 
consternation of her suffering people while Saudi Arabia has been 
supporting the Palestinian Authority. So far there has been no 
direct confrontation. However I absolutely see what I have been warning 
about since Bush diverted from Afghanistan to attack Iraq and get back 
in the middle east to create a new middle east (dis)order! I do not give
 a damn what anyone says. Bush, Cheney, and their Democratization 
program in an already historically unstable middle east set all of this 
and more in motion! The hell on earth Bush created for Iraqi&#8217;s 
will engulf the entire Middle East before it encompasses the entire 
world if we can not contain it. Under Bush we broke a long standing 
tradition of not adding fuel to the Middle East fire by supplying 
weapons. We are now, including advanced weaponry and missile defence 
systems. The Middle East breakdown Bush started armed and funded is 
continuing under Obama. This up to now proxy war in the middle east is 
under way.  You know I firmly believe and have said so a million 
times by now that since 9/11 everything was construed to allow Bush to 
gain the power he needed to prosecute his new order not just in the 
Middle East but on the entire world! He diverted from Afghanistan to get
 back into the Middle East with the goal of setting up a larger safety 
zone for Israel and going after Iran. Both will fail! It has long been 
my contention that coming to Israel's aid once they attack Iran will be 
our in to Iran but with Iran, the Gulf, Syria, and everything else who 
knows what will happen first.  We must contain this to the middle
 east and keep it from turning into WW3. This must be a middle east 
fight and problem or the entire world is in dire trouble and we have too
 much already as we try to move successfully through the 21st century. I
 am afraid we are failing our children in every regard. James Joiner Gardner, Ma<a href="http://anaverageamericanpatriot.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">http://anaverageamericanpatriot.blogspot.com </a></span>

<a href="http://anaverageamericanpatriot.blogspot.com/2013/10/nine-myths-and-misconceptions-about.html">Nine Myths And Misconceptions About Money That Can Literally Kill You</a>
</h3>

 


 
 
<p>
I noticed a lot of talk about the Federal reserve of late but I chose to
 reprint this at this time because I am currently experiencing
 problems with this issue. First I want to say that as you read this you
 will see too why it is no surprise who is really in charge. You will 
also understand why President Lincoln and President Kennedy were 
assassinated. Anyway we hear every day how low the bank rates are and 
offers from everyone and their brother to refinance your mortgage at a 
lower rate and for maybe no cost. Well!</p><p>
It has been over a month of phone calls now and we are still having a 
problem finding a bank who will do a Refi for us because we do not owe 
enough money to make it worth their while. I was under the misconceived 
impression that it behooved any bank to lower your rate but boy was I 
wrong. Our current bank will not cooperate with us and is trying 
everything under the sun to keep us feeding their inflated rate but we 
are out of there. </p><p>
The final straw for me was when they said closing costs would be 7 to 9 
thousand, for a 46 thousand dollar loan get real! I finally talked to a 
woman at one agency who finally spoke the truth. She used my standard 
line and that is that we do not matter. She said the Federal Reserve 
does not represent us they work for and represent the banks.</p><p>
That led me to dig this up as she was right and we are so screwed. This 
is sobering and reaffirms what I was being told. I am just so peeved at 
this lie we are living they call a Democracy. This is all disquieting 
but give this a quick glance.</p><p>
This was sent to me with no Author by someone more than in the know but I
 will leave that alone.Read it and weep, I am wanting to say every 
expletive in the world as once you hear this it makes 100% common sense 
and we are powerless? I do not know who the Author is but this is 
frightening, sobering, debilitating, and frustrating, what do we do 
about it? Pay particular attention to all of it, Google whatever you 
want. Man am I peeved with this set up they call a Democracy. SOB!</p><p>
1) If we paid off our debts, our problems would be solved. Wrong. Wrong.
 Wrong. The banks wrote the Federal Reserve Act in secret. They said you
 would not be allowed to have money unless you first went into debt. In 
fact when you pay off a loan, the bank cancels money supply. So if we 
all paid off our debts including the government debt, we would have no 
money and the economy would collapse. We would all be reduced to barter.</p><p>
2) The bankers who wrote The Federal Reserve Act in 1913 knowingly 
engineered a Fatal Debt Bomb into the legislation. This is true. When 
you go to a bank to get a loan, the banker created ten thousand dollars 
in new money by entering that amount onto a checking account. Notice 
that if you signed a note for simple interest at 10%, you will owe the 
banker $11,000 in one year&#8217;s time. He only created $10,000 so how do you
 pay him back the principal plus interest? Good question. What he does 
is to create more money through more loans so there is enough money to 
pay the note plus interest.</p><p>
This means that the total amount of debts in the society are growing at a
 compound rate. Bankers have known since the Babylonians that unchecked 
exponential growth of unpayable debts will destroy any nation with a 
Debt Bomb. This is what is happening to America and the world today. 
Michael Hudson wrote about the Babylonian solution. They developed a 
formula that told them how long this rising tide of Unpayable Debt could
 grow before they had to cancel all the debts and start over again.</p><p>
Let me repeat that the bankers have known this for over 4,000 years. But
 they have made sure that you know nothing of it because they want to 
foreclose on you and your nation so they can but everything for pennies 
on the dollar in bankruptcy proceedings.</p><p>
The Russian demographer Borisov tells us that the bankers starved 
millions of Americans to death in the 1930s rather than allow people to 
understand the Babylonian solution. The Bible writers copied this 
concept when they wrote of the Jubilee cancellation of debt.</p><p>
3) The Federal Reserve Act was written to transfer wealth from us to the
 bankers through the creation of a Debt Based money system. This is 
true. President Lincoln had created Greenbacks without borrowing money 
from the banks so there was no national debt and no interest on the 
debt. Lincoln simply printed the money and spent it into circulation.</p><p>
There is absolutely no reason to have a national debt except to collect 
interest on a fictional debt. Why give the power to create money to the 
banks when government alone according to the Constitution is supposed to
 coin money? I will tell you why. The banks want to bring back slavery. 
They want you to become an indentured servant who inherits a national 
debt that is unpayable. They want to reduce you to slavery,</p><p>
Any politician or pundit who does not understand this is either stupid or lying.</p><p>
I should point out that President Kennedy issued Executive Order 11110 
which directed the Mint to issue US Banknotes to replace Federal Reserve
 Notes. These JFK Banknotes were to be debt free as were Lincoln&#8217;s 
Greenbacks. They were withdrawn from circulation after his 
assassination. JFK was murdered on the 53rd anniversary of the secret 
meeting of the bankers on November 22nd, 1910 in a private rail-car that
 took them to Jekyll Island. Bankers like to do things on the 
anniversary of an important date to make sure you understand that 
monetary reform carries a death penalty.</p><p>
4) All we have to do to solve our economic woes is to balance the 
budget. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. All those knuckleheads need to listen and 
learn. The Gross National Product is the total sales of a country. 
Economists write it as a formula Where GNP = C + I + G or GNP equals 
Consumption plus Investment plus Government spending. The total GNP is 
currently 14 trillion dollars. Suppose we balance the budget by cutting 
spending two trillion dollars. That would mean we subtract two trillion 
from G and our new GNP is reduced to 12 trillion dollars which means 
that one seventh of the American economy would disappear overnight. That
 would send us instantly into a worse economic blight than the first 
Great Depression. Currently the states owe the federal government almost
 100 billion dollars for extended unemployment benefits.</p><p>
A man was recently explaining to his young daughter that we have no 
bread lines like they did in the 1930s because we have almost 49 million
 people on Food Stamps. Suppose we cut off unemployment extended 
benefits and Food stamps to make a down payment on that two trillion 
dollar budget cut. America would have nationwide food riots. 90% of all 
black children are on Food Stamps. I do not know the figures for 
Hispanics. But there would be no grocery stores in major cities that 
would not escape the riots.</p><p>
If you hear someone talking of cuts, tell them to eliminate Unpayable 
Debts and interest on the national debt by bringing back non-interest 
bearing debt free Greenbacks. Then they can cut out the five foreign 
wars and remove our troops from at least 100 foreign nations. Then they 
can seize the assets of the banks that stole over 27 trillion dollars 
from us during the Banker Bailouts.</p><p>
5) Fiat currencies always fail. What we need is a gold standard. Wrong. 
Wrong. Wrong. Presidents Lincoln and Kennedy had fiat currencies that 
were successful. And only ended with their assassination. The Isle of 
Guernsey and the American colonies both had fiat currencies that were 
successful.</p><p>
The Italians had a gold currency that failed in 1348. The bankers loaned
 out more money than they had on deposit. This is called fractional 
reserve banking. Usually a bank will loan out nine times what it has on 
deposit. The Italian banks in Venice were unable to meet demands for 
gold from their depositors.</p><p>
Currently, the risk manager at JP Morgan has two thousand dollars in 
risk for every dollar in deposits. I think this is an underestimate. </p><p>
6) America could go onto the gold standard because we have all that gold
 at Fort Knox. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. America has gold plated tungsten 
bars at Fort Knox. And the banks leased our gold and sold it four or 
five times to keep themselves from going bankrupt.</p><p>
The gold was stolen by the Rothschild s and their friends. If we went 
back to the gold standard, we would be entering slavery to the 
Rothschild network because they would have all the gold money. The 
Rothschild s financed the Jewish trade in African slaves. Ask a black 
man how well that Rothschild slavery worked out for him.</p><p>
I personally own silver because I expect this fractional reserve debt 
based monetary scheme to collapse very soon. I would use a gold exchange
 standard to get things going. But I could manage a monetary system with
 Greenbacks if Zionists and morons on welfare were not allowed to vote.</p><p>
7) All we need to do to balance our trade deficit is to cut wages by 
devaluing the dollar so we can become more competitive. Wrong. Wrong. 
Wrong. Steve Keen is an Australian economist who says we need to 
increase wages so debts become payable. Unpayable debts lead directly to
 slavery. The US dollar eleven years ago was worth $1.20 when measured 
against a basket of six currencies. Today the US dollar is worth almost 
75 cents. This has not created one job in the past decade. What it has 
done was raise the price of oil so everything costs more to produce.</p><p>
In China factory workers are lucky to make a dollar an hour. They work 
72 hours a week. They get no overtime and have no benefits. The Chinese 
workers do not make enough money to ride those Mag Lev fast rail trains 
you have read about. Suppose we cut American wages in half? Would that 
create jobs? No. We have been cutting wages since 1970 and we have fewer
 jobs today than then. It never worked in the past. No reason to believe
 it will work now.</p><p>
To make the debts easier to pay we need to raise wages. To do that we 
have to stop issuing a million Green card work permits for legal 
immigrants. And we need to send back a few million illegal immigrants to
 open jobs for millions of unemployed Americans. But to create jobs we 
need new industries. We need to protect those industries with a 25% 
tariff. We need to create new jobs in computers, materials science, 
bio-engineering, aviation and energy by releasing the Top Secret 
research that is held in government labs. We could collect royalties 
from American industries employing American citizens. We could lease 
these patents to foreign competitors but we need a tariff to protect 
American jobs.</p><p>
We made America prosperous by repealing the Glass Steagall Act and by 
allowing Credit Default Swaps to remain unregulated. Wrong. Wrong. 
Wrong. The bankers passed NAFTA and the WTO in 1994 so they could send 
11 million jobs and 43,000 manufacturing plants overseas. They created 
the illusion of prosperity under Clinton by pumping up real estate and 
the stock market. The stock market was deliberately crashed in 2000 so 
the Zionists could elect George W Bush President because they wanted 
lots of wars for Israel. When the stock market failed, the Zionists 
created the subprime lending bubble on top of the already existing 
housing bubble.</p>
 
<p class="post-footer-line post-footer-line-2">
They loaned money to people who had no means of paying 
the loans. That did not matter. Some mortgages were sold as many as five
 times in Mortgage Backed Securities. When these loans failed, the banks
 collected on their Credit Default Swap insurance. There were no 
reserves set aside to pay losses. That did not matter. The bankers had 
the taxpayers pay out 27 trillion dollars in Bailouts to cover their 
frauds and keep the banking criminals out of jail. When the Europeans 
threatened a run on the American banks if they were not compensate for 
the trash Wall Street sold them, Ben Bernanke created 12.3 trillion 
dollars in new money and use it to but 6.3 trillion dollars in 
fraudulent bonds.</p><p>
Glass Steagall was passed in 1933 and forbade investment banks from 
becoming commercial banks so the depositors are not exposed to 
speculative risks. With the repeal of Glass Steagall Jamie Dimon at JP 
Morgan was allowed to sell 80 trillion dollars in Credit Default Swaps 
betting that interest rates will not go up. If interest rates do go up, 
there will be worldwide Depression. Jamie Dimon isn&#8217;t worried about it 
because he probably knows when the Zionists will start World War III.</p><p>
This is not a free market. It is criminality on a grand scale.</p><p>
9) We have a moral obligation to pay our national debt. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong.</p><p>
Jim Willie pointed out to Max Kaiser that in the 1990s under beloved 
leaders Bill Clinton and George H W Bush the Treasury sold 2.2 trillion 
dollars more in Treasury bonds than were required to fund the deficit. 
That money was pocketed by the banks who now expect you to pay them back
 for the money they stole plus the interest. Catherine Austin Fitts has 
been telling us for years that the government allows the banks to steal 
billions of dollars every week from government spending which we are not
 allowed to audit.</p><p>
We owe the banks nothing. We need to take back what they have stolen.</p><p>
I also need to make this point about money creation. When a bank makes a
 loan, they are creating money by adding credits to a bank account. They
 are not lending you Mrs. Jones life savings. What they are doing is 
creating money. Money is a claim against our right to purchase goods and
 services. If we increase the money supply, then we are all in a sense 
bearing a burden by the diminished purchasing power of our money. But 
only bankers are allowed to participate in the benefits of granting a 
loan. I don&#8217;t think so. Cancel the debts and seize all of the banker&#8217;s 
wealth. And that of their co-conspirators. We ought not to suffer 
because the bankers killed our Presidents.</p><p>

 The Sunni rebels now apparently feel strong enough to take the fight 
back across the border, hitting at Hezbollah&#8217;s heartland. The rocket

The Western, Turkish and Gulf-supported coalition regards itself as the 
political leadership of the rebel side in the war; the Arab League and a
 number of Western states recognize it as the legitimate leadership of 
Syria.&#160;</a></span></span></span></span></p>

<p>
<span><span><span><a href="http://www.jpost.com/Features/Front-Lines/Behind-The-Lines-Hezbollah-turns-eastwards-310317" target="_blank"><span><span>The
 statement included a confirmation of rebel responsibility for the 
rocket attack and noted that the attack came in response to weeks of 
Hezbollah assaults on villages across the border. The statement included
 a demand that the Lebanese government &#8220;exert control over its borders 
and put an immediate stop to Hezbollah&#8217;s military operations on Syrian 
territory.&#8221;</span></span></a></span></span></span></p>


</p>
<p>
<span><span>Hezbollah
 will not stop and will not be cowed. In many instances they have even 
taken the lead in trying to turn around the successes of the rebels. 
Islamists on both sides of which Al Nusra on one side and Hezbollah on 
the other, will and are holding a leading role in the fighting.</span></span></p>
 
 
<p>
<span><span><span>Those involved will get this total middle east breakdown to the next level.</span></span></span></p>
 
 
<p>
<span><span><span>As
 a whole the so called civilized Nations of the world are bound and 
determined to start another world war they all mistakenly think they 
will win. Russia China, Iran, they are all responsible for creating this
 civil war.</span></span></span></p>
 
<p>
<span><span><span>From
 the beginning of the chaos in Syria we have been saying that Iran more 
specifically the IRG (Iran Revolutionary Guard) was in Syria helping if 
not leading the way in trying to quell the uprising along with 
Hezbollah.</span></span></span></p>
 
 
<p>
<span><span><span>You know Bashar's <span>best</span>
 friend Iran is dictating that this slaughter is a necessity though 
Syria knows how to brutalize its people all to well. Iran will not allow
 a Democracy at her doorstep further isolating her. </span></span></span></p>
 
<p>
<span><span><span>'Iran building militias in Syria in case Assad falls': The <span>Post</span>
 quoted a senior Obama administration official as saying that Iran was 
backing as many as 50,000 militiamen. &#8220;The immediate intention seems to 
be to support the Syrian regime. But it&#8217;s important for Iran to have a 
force in Syria that is reliable and can be counted on,&#8221; the official 
stated. </span></span></span></p>
</p><p>

<p>
<span><span><span>Now
 that we know how involved Russia, Iran and Hezbollah are in the 
slaughtering that is going on around the country that is beginning to 
look like the beginning of their fight not nearing the end.You have to 
be very concerned about what is happening in Syria especially.&#160;</span></span></span></p>
 

<p class="post-body entry-content">
<span><span><span>Russia,
 China, Hezbollah, and Iran are not going to allow Syria to fall to 
Democracy. What we saw after the voter fraud in Iran was mild compared 
to what the IRG will do if this movement spreads to Iran. I really wish 
Bashar would step down but Iran is the elephant in the room any way you 
look at it. The total middle east breakdown we have written about 
numerous times is well under way. We can only hope we keep it from 
erupting into WW3.<span class="text14"><span class="text14">By 
attacking and defeating Iraq we freed Iran up to pursue her version of 
new middle East order by interfering wherever she could while Bush was 
doing the same thing with his Middle East Democratization program. I 
think you can see how successful Bush and Cheney were with chaos 
creating Middle East Democracy program but you are barely seeing the 
results they created in Iran. The goal absolutely is to be the 
country who decides which direction the new Middle East (dis)order will 
take. Bush started it by attacking Iraq to get into the middle east to 
destabilize it and start the new middle east order the idiot said God 
told him to do now it will be up to Iran and Saudi Arabia at least up 
front to fight it out whether this goes the Iranian Shiite way or the 
Saudi Arabian Sunni way and do not forget Israel!</span></span></span></span><span><span> James Joiner Gardner, Ma<a href="http://anaverageamericanpatriot.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">http://anaverageamericanpatriot.blogspot.com</a></span></span></span> </p>

as the Aphrodite in Cyprus and the Leviathan and Tamar in Israel. In the
 meantime, negotiations are under way to resolve the frozen Cyprus issue
 between the Greek and Turkish sides, and reports suggest that all 
interested sides have put natural gas on the table.</a>

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic_fracturing_by_country%20%20Hydraulic%20fracturing">China
 completed its first horizontal shale gas well in 2011. A global shale 
gas study by the US Energy Information Administration said China's 
technically recoverable shale gas reserves were almost 50% higher than 
those of the number two nation, the United States.[7]</a> 
<span>The
 Pandora's box of energy independence has been opened. To a growth and 
energy starving world it will not be closed. You see what is still on 
going in the Gulf of Mexico, you saw Chernobyl, you know a small part of
 the horrible damage Fukishima is doing around the world, These are a 
tiny part of the damage we are doing with our technology.</span> 
<span> China
 is already one of the most polluted countries in the world. China is 
home to our medical and computer waste dump.The areas housing them are 
dead zones and entrance not allowed. In addition China at last check was
 building one coal fired power plant per month. This is all undder so 
called control. You see what we have done to the earth while under 
control, imagine the caustic conditions when everyone does what they 
want. Hell it can be argued that, that is what underhandedly goes on 
now.</span>

Birol noted, for example, that Middle Eastern oil once bound for the 
United States would probably be rerouted to China. US-mined coal, facing
 declining demand in its home market, is already heading to Europe and 
China instead. </a>

<span><span><a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2012/11/13/top-oil-producer-report-says/SUXn644IY1VqNZaS7rTFRN/story.html" target="_blank">There
 are several components of the sudden shift in the world&#8217;s energy 
supply, but the prime mover is a resurgence of US oil and gas 
production, particularly the unlocking of new reserves of oil and gas 
found in shale rock. The widespread adoption of techniques such as 
hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling has made those reserves 
much more accessible, and, in the case of natural gas, resulted in a 
vast glut that has sent prices plunging. The report predicted that the 
United States would overtake Russia as the leading producer of natural 
gas in 2015.</a></span></span></p>
 
 
 
 
<span><span>

I
 do not like Fracking or horizontal drilling but imagine the United 
States as the worlds leading gas And oil exporter? Instability is roiling world oil markets, 
and Americans are paying $3.50 a gallon for gas. And oil shale fever is 
again rising in the geologic region known as the Piceance Basin, part of
 the Green River Formation that stretches across the rugged plains of 
northwestern Colorado and parts of Wyoming and Utah. 
There
 is no dispute that a thousand feet below the isolated ranch country 
here on Colorado's western slope lie almost unimaginable oil riches. 
It's locked in sedimentary rock -- essentially immature oil that given a
 few million years under heat and pressure would produce pools of oil 
easy to extract. The 
Energy Department and private industry estimate that a trillion barrels 
are here in Colorado -- about the same amount as the entire world's 
known reserves of conventional oil. The entire Green River Formation 
might hold as much as 2 trillion barrels. As
 it has before, shale oil holds out the hope of a USA no longer 
dependent on foreign oil. Shell Oil is engaged in a multi year test of a
 new technology for extracting the oil. Previous efforts that were 
uneconomical and environmentally destructive entailed mining the rock, 
crushing it and heating it above ground to release the oil.</span></span></p><p>
<p>
<span><span>From
 what I have seen already we are destroying peoples food and water 
sources making them dependent on who? and grossly destabilizing
 the ground. Everywhere fracking goes on earthquakes are showing up 
regardless of the fact that there was no earthquakes in the past and it 
is no ones fault of course, it is natural my rear.</span></span></p>
 
 
</p><p>
<p>
<span><span>To
 me for the people to think there is any plus at all at our becoming 
energy independent they would want to see the price at the pump go 
down.&#160;</span></span></p>
 
 
<p>
<span><span>That

 you know will never happen because it is not in the interest of oil 
companies. As they do now, whenever something good or bad happens that 
may or may not even affect the industry they raise prices. The world as a
 whole have become mice living and running on a clogged and polluted 
wheel never to get off till we die. James Joiner Gardner Ma<a href="http://anaverageamericanpatriot.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">http://anaverageamericanpatriot.blogspot.com</a></span></span>

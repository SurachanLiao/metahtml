A second official cited by CNN said the intelligence&#160;about Kim's health was&#160;credible. The official acknowledged it was hard to assess how seriously ill he may be.&#160;&#160;</p><img class="gnt_em_img_i" alt="North Korean leader Kim Jong Un attends a politburo meeting of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea on April 11 in Pyongyang."><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong class="gnt_ar_b_al">South Korea:&#160;</strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2020/04/14/north-korea-fires-missiles-ground-and-air-south-korea-military/2987647001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">North Korea fires barrage of missiles from ground and air</a></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The North Korean leader's health has long been a focus of speculation. He's a heavy smoker and is obese. However, North Korea is one of the world's most secretive nations and information about its leader is extremely difficult to verify. Even his age is a matter of dispute, although most analysts think he's probably 36.&#160;</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-news-world-2" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">CNN's report late Monday followed&#160;a story in a Seoul-based website named&#160;<a href="https://www.dailynk.com/english/source-kim-jong-un-recently-received-heart-surgery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Daily NK</a>&#160;run by North Korean defectors. It reported that the North Korean leader had undergone heart surgery on April 12 and is recuperating at a villa outside the capital, Pyongyang. Daily NK's story is based on a single source inside North Korea.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Media reports&#160;about North Korea and its leadership have previously turned out to be inaccurate. Speculation about Kim Jong Un's health has increased in recent days partly because he skipped a recent commemoration connected to the nation's founding.</p><p class="gnt_em_vt"></p><p class="gnt_em_vb gnt_em_vb__te"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">North Korean state media has not addressed Kim's health. The state-run Korean Central News Agency released a photo of him, dated April 11, which it said shows&#160;Kim attending a politburo meeting of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea in Pyongyang. However, neither the content nor the date of the photo could be independently verified.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">North Korea&#160;is one of only a handful of nations to refuse to report data about coronavirus infections.

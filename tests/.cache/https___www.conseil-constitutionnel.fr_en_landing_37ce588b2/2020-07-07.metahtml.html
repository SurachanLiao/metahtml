<article class="landing landing--type-home-multi landing--view-mode-full"><p>The Constitutional Council was established by the Constitution of the Fifth Republic adopted on 4 October 1958. It is a court vested with various powers, including in particular the review of the constitutionality of legislation. The Constitutional Council is not a supreme court that is hierarchically superior to the Conseil d'&#201;tat or the Cour de Cassation.</p><p><a href="/en/general-overview">General Overview</a></p><p><a href="/en/annual-reports">Annual Reports</a></p><p><a href="https://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/sites/default/files/as/root/bank_mm/visite_virtuelle/index.html">Virtual Tour</a></p><p class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item">Members</p><p>The Constitutional Council is comprised of nine members who are appointed for nine-year terms.

It currently has sixteen titles, one hundred and four articles (one transitional) and a Preamble. It does not therefore limit itself to organising public powers, their role and their relationships, as the Preamble refers directly and explicitly to three other fundamental texts: the Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen of 26 August 1789, the Preamble of the Constitution of 27 October 1946 (the Constitution of the Fourth French Republic) and the 2004 Charter for the Environment.</p><p><a href="/en/constitution-of-4-october-1958">Find out more</a></p><p class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item">Case-law</p><p>Decisions are served on the parties and published in the Journal officiel of the French Republic (series "Laws and Decrees") along with, for conformity decisions, the text referred from Parliament (from 1983 onwards) and the observations of the Government (from 1995 onwards).

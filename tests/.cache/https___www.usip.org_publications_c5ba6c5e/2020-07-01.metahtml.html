Chairman Abdullah added that the government&#8217;s negotiating team will be inclusive and represent common values in talks with the Taliban. The team &#8220;will be diverse and represent all walks of life,&#8221; Abdullah said. Afghans and analysts have expressed concern that without an inclusive negotiating team, the country&#8217;s hard-won, democratic gains could be compromised for the sake of a deal with the Taliban. </p><p class="meta">Type:

Meanwhile, USIP&#8217;s Keith Mines says the country is at a &#8220;tragic impasse, and that impasse is entirely political,&#8221; as both Juan Guaid&#243; and Nicol&#225;s Maduro maintain their respective claims to power.</p><p class="meta">Type:

</p></article><article class="summary"><p>Countries worldwide that suffer or risk violent conflicts face a new hazard amid the COVID-19 pandemic: governments&#8217; use of the disease as a pretext to curtail democratic freedoms and punish opposition. As COVID has spread across Africa, Zimbabwe is emerging as one of the countries most vulnerable to the disease&#8212;and most illustrative of its threat to peace and democratization efforts on the continent. Two and a half years after a military coup installed President Emmerson Mnangagwa, his government has used the health crisis to arrest members of the opposition and journalists, and divert humanitarian aid to ruling party supporters.</p><p class="meta">Type:

</p></article><article class="summary"><p>For decades, Iran has vexed the international community. It introduced Islam as a form of governance in 1979 and has supported militants abroad and defied international norms. In May 2018, the Trump administration withdrew from the 2015 nuclear agreement negotiated by six world powers and Iran. The administration argued that the deal did not adequately curb Tehran&#8217;s nuclear program or address its missile program, human rights abuses, and support for terror.</p><p class="meta">Type:

</p></article><article class="summary"><p>Southeast Asia has emerged as the regional fulcrum of strategic competition between the United States and China in the Indo-Pacific, with both the Washington and Beijing aggressively competing for influence in the 10 countries that comprise the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. This attention is well-placed, as the decisions that these countries make shape power dynamics in the broader region, influence global norms from internet governance to minority rights, and are determining along which lines the world&#8217;s most dynamic regional economy integrates.</p><p class="meta">Type:

</p></article><article class="summary"><p>North Korea&#8217;s demolition this week of an inter-Korean liaison office that symbolized North-South cooperation marks a new spike in tensions between the countries, and in North Korean frustration with the United States. It was the latest in a string of inflammatory rhetoric and actions directed at Seoul and Washington since the failure of the February 2019 summit in Hanoi between President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. The building&#8217;s demolition renews strains over North Korea&#8217;s ongoing development of a nuclear weapons arsenal, the corresponding global sanctions against Pyongyang&#8217;s illicit behavior and the 67-year failure to formalize a peace treaty following the Korean War. USIP analysts Patricia Kim and Frank Aum discuss the latest downturn.</p><p class="meta">Type:

</p></article><article class="summary"><p>After nearly a decade of civil war and strife, Syria&#8217;s long-troubled economy is in tatters with spiraling hyperinflation, food shortages, and widespread unemployment. The Syrian pound has less than a fifth of the currency&#8217;s value from this time last year. These economic woes have led to new protests in areas long controlled by the regime. Amid this economic turmoil, the U.S. Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act comes into force today, targeted at key internal and external pillars of support for the Assad regime. USIP&#8217;s Mona Yacoubian looks at what led to the economic collapse, how the regime is responding to the protests, and the implications of the new U.S. sanctions.</p><p class="meta">Type:

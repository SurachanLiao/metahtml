<h2 class="has-text-align-center">Harvard Epidemiologist Calls Wuhan Virus &#8220;Thermonuclear Pandemic Level Bad&#8221;</h2>



<p>WUHAN VIRUS THERMONUCLEAR PANDEMIC &#8211; A Harvard epidemiologist published his analysis of the Wuhan coronavirus and called it &#8220;Thermonuclear Pandemic Level Bad&#8221;.</p>



<p>Dr. Eric Feigl-Ding, an epidemiologist from Harvard published his alarming analysis of the <a href="https://philnews.ph/2020/01/24/virologist-who-helped-fight-sars-says-wuhan-coronavirus-is-10x-worse/">Wuhan coronavirus outbreak</a> on Twitter.</p>



<p>He added that the new coronavirus scored a 3.8 in the reproductive R0 value. That meant the virus was &#8220;thermonuclear pandemic level bad&#8221;.</p>



<p>In addition, he said that with that high of a basic reproduction number (R_0), 72-75% of transmissions must be prevented by control measures for infections to stop growing.</p>



<p>Following this, Dr. Feigl-Ding stated that his team&#8217;s estimation of identified infections in Wuhan is at a mere 5%. Also, by February, he said the number of infected would get substantially larger.</p>
 




<p>In his following tweets, he emphasized that the travel restriction to and from Wuhan are unlikely to be effective in halting the transmission. He added that the epidemic outside of Wuhan would only be reduced by 24.9%.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>A basic reproductive number for this 2019-nCoV outbreak is higher compared to other emergent coronaviruses, suggesting that containment or control of this pathogen may be substantially more difficult.&#8221;!!!! </p>  Dr. Eric Feigl-Ding  </blockquote>



<p>Meanwhile, the 8th tweet in his thread was deleted for unknown reasons. However, <a href="https://disrn.com/news/harvard-epidemiologist-says-coronavirus-is-thermonuclear-pandemic-level-bad?fbclid=IwAR1GhHZQDCwn5MWfTovGWfaF2d25J8g4pFxcAgBcENfPlrwT4R5-F6GK5kU">DISRN</a> managed to take a screenshot of his deleted tweet.</p>



<p>In his 9th tweet about the virus, he began to express major concerns about the state of the outbreak. He mentioned that even with a 99% quarantine of Wuhan, the virus&#8217; spread won&#8217;t be reduced by even 1/3rd in the next two weeks.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>I really hate to be the epidemiologist who has to admit this, but we are potentially faced with possibly an unchecked pandemic that the world has not seen since the 1918 Spanish Influenza. </p>   Dr. Eric Feigl-Ding   </blockquote>

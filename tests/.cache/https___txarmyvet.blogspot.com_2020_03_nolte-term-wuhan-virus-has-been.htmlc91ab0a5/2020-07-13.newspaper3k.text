Although far-left outlets like CNN have been describing the coronavirus as “Wuhan” for

, that description is now being described as racist by members of the left-wing media.

Nevermind that the Asian media have used the term “Wuhan virus,” an NBC News reporter still tweeted Monday, “FYI: Calling #COVID19 the ‘Wuhan Virus’ is racist.”

The far-left Media Matters is accusing Fox News and Vice President Mike Pence of “try[ing] to rebrand coronavirus as ‘the Wuhan virus.’”

Naturally, many of our oh-so elite elites in the Blue Checkmark Mafia agree…

Desperate Trump supporters are trying to label COVID-19 the Wuhan virus to distract from the fact that the Trump administration's failures have increased the danger here in the U.S. It's childish, but it has the advantage of also invoking racist tropes. They like that. https://t.co/FdxttJqnBt March 9, 2020

The stupidity, the ignorance behind this is simply astounding, but unfortunately, not at all surprising anymore.

Naming a virus after the location from where it likely originated, using that as a shorthand, goes back decades.

“Wuhan” was first discovered in Wuhan, China.

Ebola was named after a river close to where an outbreak took place in Africa.

Lyme disease was named after a Connecticut town experienced an outbreak in 1975.

The Zika virus was named after a forest in Uganda in 1947, where scientists discovered what it was.

The Marburg virus was first discovered in Marburg, Germany.

The West Nile virus is what causes West Nile fever… guess where

Did you know Legionnaires’ disease is named that because the first notable outbreak killed off a bunch of legionnaires in attendance at an American Legion convention in Philadelphia back in 1976?

So we literally have decades of precedent in naming diseases after where they were first discovered, including a town in lily-white Connecticut. Good heaven, we have a disease named after a bunch of white, middle-aged legionnaires — but “Wuhan” is now racist.

Need I add that “Wuhan” is not even a race?

And that anti-science thinking is why Trump won the presidency.

there, and how many of them have the money to push lawmakers (who
don’t require much pushing) into making laws that are USELESS for
reducing gun violence, but actually cost many people their lives
through not being able to defend themselves against ILLEGALLY armed
criminals and crazies. They’re aware of this, but they keep pushing
these INSANE gun laws that keep getting passed by ignorant
legislators. You don’t defend yourself by DISARMING yourself. And
keeping honest people (who obey laws) disarmed in the face of the
ease with which criminals (who don’t obey laws) get their guns is
criminal in itself, and CONTRIBUTES to gun violence. This is REALITY.
But these fools ignore it. Gun control, the way it is now known,
KILLS more people than do ILLEGAL guns in the hands of criminals, by
itself. I can’t believe there are so many STUPID people out there
who ignore this REALITY.

had the MOST mass killings in the country in 2019. That should tell
the anti-gun fools something, but it won’t. They look at studies
like that which came out from Johns Hopkins that show NO EFFECT on
gun crime for their highly touted background check laws and ignore
the truth, making excuses for the stats that don’t include the
reality that background checks, like all their other anti-gun laws,
just don’t work. The biggest reason gun crime is so rampant IS
their anti-gun laws, which only serve to give law-breakers an easier
life because it keeps their intended targets defenseless against
their ILLEGAL guns. Previously, I have been confounded by their
complete ignorance of the fact than NONE of their laws work as
intended. Then I look at the real result of their laws—defenseless
law-abiding people who do obey them, and I see that’s what they
really want. A defenseless population they can push around at will.
If that is the intended result, they’re working perfectly. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>(<a href="https://flagandcross.com/report-california-had-most-mass-slayings-in-2019-state-also-has-strictest-gun-control/">Flag and Cross Link: https://flagandcross.com/report-california-had-most-mass-slayings-in-2019-state-also-has-strictest-gun-control/ </a>)</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="post-footer-line post-footer-line-1"><ins><span class="post-author vcard">Posted by

four cities with the toughest gun laws in the nation, put us THIRD in
the WORLD in murders. Without those cities added, we’re 4th

that’s FACT. But a fact IGNORED by those incompetent politicians
who make laws that do nothing but present ILLEGALLY armed criminals
with more unarmed citizens than they can rob or murder. These are
hard facts. You’d think the people why SAY they want to “curb gun

elsewhere than on the guns themselves. Guns, without evil hands
holding them, can do NOTHING. They need to make laws to “Curb”
the PEOPLE who USE those guns for evil purposes by giving them longer
sentences for using guns to commit crimes. Don’t ban the use of
guns for honest people who OBEY laws by MAKING laws to disarm them.
But these incompetent politicians ignore reality and continue to make
more and more USELESS laws that kill innocent people by disarming

eliminate guns entirely from the world, and that to do so will
eliminate violent crime. The real evidence shows absolutely that
anti-gun laws have never worked to prevent “gun crime” and,
instead, INCREASE it by disarming the law-abiding, making them
defenseless against those who use ILLEGAL guns to victimize them. But
they ignore that and continue to insist on making even more of the
useless, unenforceable anti-gun laws, while people die because of
them. And it’s not just those I call “anti-gun fools.” It
includes politicians who buy their silly notions and make those laws.
It is the news media that promotes “gun control” that controls
nothing. And nothing ever dents their “stone brains” with logic.
They have bought this silliness as if it were real, and they just
can’t see anything that denies it. They blame the guns, period.
Never mind finding out why so many people want to victimize people,
with, or without guns. It just does not get through to their little
brains. We keep showing them the evidence and they keep ignoring it,
while continuing to make their stupid laws that just get more people
killed. Everything I’ve written above, I’ve written before, but
it’s as if I’ve never written a word, to them. (Just common

who riot and declare they are “coming to the burbs to take what’s

people having guns for self-defense) will stop the crooks from
seeking out illicit gun dealers who sell their guns out of the trunk

these fools from making their useless laws that do nothing but give
ILLEGALLY-armed criminals a steady stream of unarmed VICTIMS; which
makes crime rates rise, and, more importantly, makes the number of

his gun in self defense for himself or for others? We’re going to
make cops afraid to use their guns, even when their lives are
threatened, and that’s going to cost cop lives, and incidentally,
the lives of those they are supposed to be protecting. There’s a
move afoot to disarm the cops, and what we’re doing today
accomplishes that, by making them afraid to use their guns for fear
of being fired, and worse, imprisoned themselves, together with the
very people they have put there. The killing of George Floyd was NOT
“righteous.” He was NOT fighting. He was already “under
control,” but then had THREE cops put him down and kneel upon him,
one with his knee on his neck, killing him. In Atlanta it is not
quite so clear. This subject was actively fighting, and getting the
better of several cops. He had stolen one of their stun guns and was
using it on one of the cops. That stun gun could be a deadly weapon
in the right circumstances. And then there’s the fact that he could
have taken that cop’s gun while he was “out of it” from the
stun gun and killed one of the other cops. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>The
knee-jerk action of the mayor in firing that cop within hours was an
overreaction. If she files charges against the cop that will be a
tragedy.

Just try and argue
LOGICALLY against their pet ideas like putting locks on guns in
locked gun safes in the house so when an ILLEGALLY-armed criminal
comes calling you’ll never be able to get your gun into action
quickly enough to keep him from shooting you with his ILLEGAL gun. Of
course, his gun is not subject to such STUPID laws because he doesn’t
OBEY laws. Of course, that makes your gun USELESS, which is their
goal, anyway. Or their propensity for “registering” all guns so
the government will know where they are, and who owns them when they
get ready to come calling and confiscate (steal) them. They get angry
because they know they can’t ANSWER your logic. So they just walk
away in a huff after calling you nasty, vile names. Names that would
have gotten them shot 100 years ago (which was a GOOD thing). Fools
like that ALWAYS get angry when people attempt to confront them with

he’s shooting at the cops with a full-auto Machine gun. Which
paints a very different picture of what happens in reality. The
instance of crooks using machine guns is only in the imaginations of
the writers and “prop masters” of those shows. Most criminals
can’t even afford a machine gun, much less use it properly. The
only way they even get one is to steal it—which is not inhibited in
the least by anti-gun laws. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>T</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>hey’re
shown spraying bullets in all directions while those “intrepid
cops” patiently wait until they have to change clips, then kill him
with one shot. Yeah, right. Fanciful thinking. The fact is, most
criminals are lucky to have a “Saturday Night Special” which
today is a 9mm Glock, or something like it. It’s very rare when
they have a gun anything like a machine gun. The idea of a cri</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>m</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>inal
walking around with a machine gun under his coat is ludicrous, but
the TV writers don’t care. Gunmen spraying bullets everywhere is
very exciting, and it builds viewership. So they continue to write
their scripts that way, and nobody can stop </span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>them</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>.
It IS “fiction,” after all. But it does present a very twisted
picture of what real cops are up against. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>And

an abysmally stupid idea this is! Only total stupid politicians would
go along with this stupid idea. You don’t protect yourself by
getting rid of the very people and things that defend you. The same
is true of one of the best defensive tools, a gun. Getting rid of the
cops on one bad idea, but getting rid of guns just compounds the
error. Guns are like fire. They can help you or hurt you, depending
on how they are used. But if you eliminate them, they can neither
help NOR hurt you. Getting rid of the cops and getting rid of the
guns are both getting rid of your ability to defend yourself, and
that is the main goal of those who want to get rid of both. To leave
you completely defenseless against those who do not get rid of their
guns so they can more easily victimize you at will, without worrying
about your ability to defend yourself. Those who push such ideas are
those who will be the ones coming at you to victimize you, one way or
another, later. And I include politicians in that. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>In
any case, getting rid of then cops is one of the stupidest ideas to
come down the pike. The cops are the first and last line of defense
for you. Fear of the cops is the only thing that limits the criminals
in what they think they can do to you. It’s what keeps them “at
bay.” And punishes them when they come to victimize you. (Just
common sense)</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="post-footer-line post-footer-line-1"><ins><span class="post-author vcard">Posted by

UNARMED military personnel and killed a few, before some ARMED men
from OUTSIDE the base came in and dealt with him. The MINUTES between
the time that fool started killing innocent military personnel and

on other military bases, making them DEFENSELESS against such fools.
They immediately told other military personnel they didn’t care if
they got murdered. These are people who are RESPONSIBLE users of

carrying of firearms by base personnel when you KNOW that makes them
prime targets for those deranged people who want to kill a few of
them for whatever deranged reason they have in mind? The action by

“definition” of child includes young adults up to 19 years of
age. Most of which are gang members and are shooting back, adding to
the total. His figures also include suicides as well as homicides.
What he is doing shows plainly that he KNOWS he is lying about “gun
control,” and doesn’t care. He paints himself as a “brave
advocate of public safety who is not afraid of the gun lobby.” As
if the gun lobby is going to actually physically attack him. As with
most anti-gun fools, he wants us to think that, just because they
have guns, they will use them on people like him, so his opposition
to the “gun lobby” is a “dangerous position.” </span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>This

quote a fanciful number inflated by misleading the figures, and tout

figures that include “children” up to 17, many of which are
shooting each other. Even so, that brings the number of “children’s

news. Others disgust me. This one, by Gary Markstein, is one of the
worst I’ve ever seen. In it, he shows a guy listing the names of
every thug and criminal ever accosted by the cops on a wall, in 3”
letters to fill up the wall faster. The list includes everybody ever
accosted by the police for any reason, claiming police abuse of
power. In those, he includes black men shot and killed by the cops
for any reason. Good shoots, bad shoots, self defense shoots, where
the cops are dodging bullets sent their way by the bad guys. Also
included are instances of “suicide by cop.” The obvious intent of
this carton is to “fan the flames” and make things look worse
than they really are. And it does a good job of it. The latest
shooting in Atlanta, GA, is billed as “being because he was
sleeping in a Wendy’s drive-up line, asking if that should get him
a death sentence, which is a serious twist of the facts. He got
killed because he was fighting the cops, taking their weapons and
using them on them. He could have “Tased” one of the cops with
his own stun gun, taken his gun, and shot a cop with it. He was in
the act of shooting a cop with that stun gun when shot. They’re
saying he only resisted because he was afraid of being handcuffed,
remembering that George Floyd was handcuffed when murdered by a cop,
which is only a guess. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I’d
like to see a similar cartoon listing the names of all the cops
killed by thugs, both from hiding, and while resisting arrest. The
names probably wouldn’t fit on just one wall.

those law-abiding people were to be armed, they’d “go nuts” and
“shoot up the countryside.” Which completely ignores the fact
that the law-breakers DO. I tell them and tell them that law-abiding
people with guns can stop crimes. Well, it happened again in Chicago,
fergawdsakes! Several carjackers tried to jack the car driven by a
woman when her husband, who was one of the few legal “concealed
carriers” in Chicago, began firing on them, causing all but one of
them to run. He held him for the cops, who found and arrested others
later. This AGAIN proves my contention that law-abiding armed people
can do what the cops can’t do, because they are THERE when it
happens. They do not “arrive later” like the cops, who can then
only document the crime and MAYBE later catch the criminals, AFTER
they have maybe killed their victim. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Th
sorry thing is that there are so many stupid people making and
enforcing laws and getting people killed. We need to “vote the
fools out!” Gun crime is actually going down, as more and more
people are allowed to carry guns for self defense. Now gangs only
kill one person a day in Chicago. Not a success story, but a step in
the right direction.

Oh, not necessarily all those who count
themselves as Dumocrats and vote that way. Most of them are just not
paying attention, and vote the way they’re told. And the Dumocrats
are ready and willing to tell them how to vote. First of all, the
Dumocrats are socialists, which, in itself, is stupid. Anybody who
really LOOKS at socialism wants no part of it, unless they’re
promoting it to gain power over others. It’s a system BASED on the
theft of the fruits of production of new wealth from the producers,
for the benefit of those who, for whatever reason, do NOT produce,
but only consume. And then there are the silly ideas they promote,
such as that there are more than 2 sexes. They insist on it in the
face of biological proof that it would be impossible.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="western"><ins><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>They
say sex is “assigned” at birth, which is false. It is DISCOVERED
at birth by observing which of TWO sex organs the baby has. Nothing
else can “assign” a sex, no matter how much they protest. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>They
c</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>laim,
transsexualism (where a man dresses like a woman and pretends to be a
woman, or likewise a woman dresses like a man and pretends to be a
man), is a different sex, but it is NOT. It is a mental aberration.
</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>They
claim bigotry if men pretending to be women aren’t allowed to
compete against real women in sports, and even SUE to get their way.
Too often liberal judges agree with them and they prevail. But that
doesn’t make it so. As Ayn Rand said, “A is A.” A can never be
B. It is foolishness to try and make it B</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="western"><ins><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Just
as it is foolish to try and say there are more than 2 sexes. They try
and convince us of other foolish things including believing they can
stop violent crime by eliminating guns—which is an impossibility.
Especially in this country, where we have the Second amendment
guaranteeing the fact that we have the inalienable RIGHT to “bear
arms.” Even so, the millions of ILLEGAL guns out there makes it an
impossibility. Even if that were possible, violent crime would
continue, just using something else as a weapon, as they did before
guns were invented. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>They
try and convince is that “there are no absolutes” so they will not
be bound by an absolute. But their very statement SAYING there are no
absolutes is a “statement of an absolute.” They refuse to believe
it and continue to insist they are right. Stupid.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>(Just

How he ever got to be president is a
shame, and an insult to the electorate. He is a racist and a Muslim
who hates Christians and Christianity. That is proven by his own
words. Yes, he as a right to be Muslim, but that doesn’t give him a

in our system. Such people should be barred from politics and I’m

before they’re ALLOWED to run for office and if they’re found to
be an advocate of un-American ideas that should be brought out, not
necessarily by their opponents, but by the publishing of the vetting
results. Obama had been actively working to destroy this country as
we know it as long as he has been alive, and people needed to know
that BEFORE he was elected. He says this country is racist when it is
Obama and his ilk that ARE racist.

of impeachment” to the Senate after making many noises about the
“need for speed,” is that she wants assurance that it will be a
“fair trial.” I think she should have thought about that before
those boring, useless, “investigations” in the House, where they
denied President Trump any kind of means to defend himself, and
“slammed through” their “articles” without any kind of proof
of any wrongdoing on his part. She has no room to talk at all when it
comes to “fairness” after that dismal performance. I think the
real reason she is holding onto her “articles” is so she can hold
them over Trump’s head during the upcoming election, hoping to ruin
his chances for re-election. But is is NOT going to happen. The
amazing increase in his donations is ample evidence that the American
people have already made up their minds, on the basis of FACTS, not
suppositions and innuendo. They are GOING TO re-elect him, in spite
of everything this bimbo can do. They elected him to get rid of the

other spaces. I’m really getting tired of writing the same things
over and over while being routinely ignored by the anti-gun fools.
But I’m going to continue, in hopes that somebody will take my
words seriously and cause them to stop making their useless,
unen</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>f</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>orceable

while the law-breakers just ignore them and get their guns illegally.
A popular anti-gun law is the “background check,” which doesn’t
do a single thing to stop people from killing people with guns, but
just allows the cops MAYBE to apprehend the shooter—IF—the
shooter got his gun legally, which most law-breakers—who ARE the
problem—do NOT. In any case, it only would do anything AFTER the
shooting happens and usually somebody is dead. “Gun-free zones”
have NEVER stopped a single shooting in their “zones.” In fact,
criminals and potential mass shooters SEEK THEM OUT because they
figure they can be pretty sure the law-abiding there will not be
armed, and thus will be defenseless. EVERY mass shooting has happened
IN a “gun-free zone” for that reason. Meanwhile criminals, who
just want to rob and kill people, do it more often than not in a
gun-free zone. I could go on and on, but I won’t. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>don’t want to bore anybody. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>In
any case, maybe repeating myself will cement these things in the
minds of people who read this blog so they can cogently argue against
the misnamed “gun control” laws.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>(Just common sense)</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="post-footer-line post-footer-line-1"><ins><span class="post-author vcard">Posted by

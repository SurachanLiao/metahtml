</ins></p><p class=""><ins>The American Iranian Council is deeply concerned about the recent outbreak of violence in the Gulf of Oman and state of escalating tensions in the region.  Although relations between the United States of America and the Islamic Republic of Iran have been poor since the Iranian Revolution in 1979, the current situation is among the worst AIC has seen since we began our work twenty-six years ago, and risks breaking out into a fully armed regional conflict.  </ins></p><p class=""><ins>The Council urges both the U.S. and Iran to contemplate the policies they have enacted that have led to this dangerous crossroads, and also to consider the deep responsibility they bear to their citizens and the world in ensuring that a peaceful off-ramp for the current tensions be secured.</ins></p><p class=""><ins>Last year, the AIC expressed grave concern about the United States’ decision to withdraw from the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) without <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/29/us/politics/kim-jong-trump.html">evidence  Link: https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/29/us/politics/kim-jong-trump.html </a>of Iranian non-compliance and/or the support of other signatories.  At the time, we labeled this decision not just <a href="http://www.us-iran.org/news/2018/5/8/aic-statement-on-president-trumps-decision-to-withdraw-from-the-jcpoa">provocative but potentially militaristic Link: http://www.us-iran.org/news/2018/5/8/aic-statement-on-president-trumps-decision-to-withdraw-from-the-jcpoa </a> and moreover, inconsistent with the values of moral leadership and the rule of law that America has long championed.  In the Council’s view this withdrawal was the most significant action leading to the current tensions. Other, more recent moves Washington has made against Tehran, including <a href="http://www.us-iran.org/resources/2019/5/15/media-guide-us-designation-of-the-islamic-revolutionary-guard-corps-as-a-terrorist-organization">designating  Link: http://www.us-iran.org/resources/2019/5/15/media-guide-us-designation-of-the-islamic-revolutionary-guard-corps-as-a-terrorist-organization </a>Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist group and the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-48404141">deployment  Link: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-48404141 </a>of additional U.S. military equipment and personnel to the Middle East without the support of its <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/14/politics/us-iran-warns-against-conflict/index.html">allies Link: https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/14/politics/us-iran-warns-against-conflict/index.html </a> and to the alarm of many in <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/05/democrats-and-republicans-odds-iran-intelligence/589771/">Congress Link: https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/05/democrats-and-republicans-odds-iran-intelligence/589771/ </a>, have only further stoked tensions while accomplishing little to change Iran’s regional activities</ins></p><p class="summary-metadata summary-metadata--primary"><ins>Jun 15, 2019

</ins></p><p><ins>After a long break, Iran Chat is back and we felt this year’s series should begin with a deep dive into the current state of US-Iran relations, focusing on the very real and growing possibility of war with Iran.    To help sort through all the recent news and issues concerning US-Iran relations, we spoke with journalist Jim Lobe.  He served as chief of the Washington DC bureau of Inter Press Service from 1980 to 1985 and again from 1989 to 2016.  Currently he is an Associate Fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies where he directs LobeLog, an award-winning web blog focused on foreign policy, featuring posts by expert contributors on a variety of global issues, with an emphasis on US policy towards the Middle East.    Recently, he co-wrote an article for Lobelog entitled War Against Iran Becoming Ever More Likely.  We discuss his rationale for this assessment during our conversation.  </ins></p><p><ins>Listen here or on iTunes:  <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/americaniranians-podcast/id1152417924">https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/americaniranians-podcast/id1152417924 Link: https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/americaniranians-podcast/id1152417924 </a> </ins></p><p class="summary-metadata summary-metadata--primary"><ins>Feb 15, 2019

</ins></p><p class=""><ins>By Research Associate Zahra Ladha</ins></p><p class=""><ins>Following the 1979 revolution and Iran’s appearance on the world stage as a regional power, the political class in Iran quickly achieved notoriety for what has been deemed to be their incendiary rhetoric and aggressive stance against the West. As a result, over the years, many an op-ed and think piece dissecting speeches and comments made by the Iranian government have been written. However, time and time again in the analysis of Iranian political discourse, a lack of understanding of Persian culture alongside outright mistranslations of these speeches have been exploited to exacerbate existing political tensions between Washington and Tehran. Over the past year, much has been made of the physical engagement between Iran and the US which many claim has brought the two countries to the brink of war. In comparison, there has been little focus on the effect of the war waged against Iran in the US media. This phenomenon which has historically relied on deliberate mistranslations of the words of Iranian leaders, has a seen a significant re-emergence under the Trump Administration. The most notable of these instances is, of course, the infamously mistranslated ‘wipe Israel off the face of the earth’ quote attributed to then president Ahmadinejad which, as well as exponentially increasing regional tensions, has been repeatedly used to justify the nuclear sanctions against Iran. However, US President Donald Trump’s three years in office has seen the continued use several older mistranslations such as the ‘Death to America’ chant, with several new additions such as the recent mistranslated ‘the White House is mentally retarded’ comment ascribed to President Rouhani, in order to strengthen the pro-war faction on Capitol Hill.</ins></p><p class="summary-metadata summary-metadata--primary"><ins>Jan 23, 2020

<div><p class="MittleresRaster1-Akzent21CxSpFirst"><span>Hilden, Germany, and Germantown, Maryland, February 26, 2020 &#8211;</span><span> QIAGEN (NYSE: QGEN; Frankfurt Prime Standard: QIA) today announced it has shipped its newly developed QIAstat-Dx Respiratory Panel 2019-nCoV test kit to four hospitals in China for evaluation. The new kit detects the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and adds rapid Sample to Insight syndromic testing to QIAGEN&#8217;s portfolio of molecular testing solutions in the public health emergency. QIAGEN is also in the process of shipping QIAstat-Dx testing kits to public health institutions in other regions, including Europe, South-East Asia, and the Middle East. </span></p><p class="MittleresRaster1-Akzent21CxSpMiddle"><span>Since January QIAGEN has been providing instruments and consumables to support detection of the virus in China and other markets. Official protocols for SARS-CoV-2 detection include QIAGEN extraction kits, reagents and instruments for real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) workflows. Customers also are deploying QIAsymphony modular instruments and NeuMoDx integrated PCR systems to automate higher-throughput processing of their laboratory-developed tests for SARS-CoV-2.</span></p><p><span>&#8220;Our dedicated task force has moved very fast to develop and make available the QIAstat-Dx respiratory panel with SARS-CoV-2 detection. We are partnering closely with authorities and customers around the world to bring rapid, accurate diagnosis to the fight against this deadly infectious disease,&#8221; said Thierry Bernard, Interim CEO of QIAGEN and Senior Vice President, Head of the Molecular Diagnostics Business Area. &#8220;As we have in past health crises such as SARS and the swine flu, QIAGEN is working hard to deliver better, faster testing solutions for hospitals and public health institutions to aid in the effort to monitor and bring the outbreak under control. Our employees&#8217; extraordinary response embodies QIAGEN&#8217;s core mission to make improvements in life possible.&#8221;</span></p><p class="MittleresRaster1-Akzent21CxSpLast"><span>The QIAstat-Dx system was introduced in Europe in 2018 as a CE-product and cleared by the </span><span>Food and Drug Administration (FDA) </span><span>in the United States in mid-2019. It enables fast, cost-effective and easy-to-use syndromic testing with novel Sample to Insight workflows. The system streamlines molecular testing from end to end. A technician simply loads a clinical sample (such as a swab) into a single-use QIAstat-Dx cartridge and places it in the analyzer. QIAGEN chemistries for sample processing and analysis are built in, and the QIAstat-Dx instrument delivers results in about one hour.</span></p><p class="MittleresRaster1-Akzent21CxSpFirst"><span>New QIAstat-Dx testing solution for SARS-CoV-2</span></p><p><span>The </span><span>QIAstat-Dx Respiratory </span><span>2019-nCoV Panel <span>is a new version of the existing QIAstat-Dx Respiratory Panel for differential analysis of 21 viral and bacterial pathogens in respiratory syndromes. </span></span><span>Once the SARS-CoV-2 genome was sequenced in January, QIAGEN developed two highly sensitive assays to detect SARS-CoV-2 targeting ORF1b and the E gene. The addition of these targets provides parallel tools for combined detection of the novel coronavirus with increased sensitivity.</span></p><p><span>The expanded QIAstat-Dx panel is currently being evaluated at the Bichat-Claude Bernard Hospital in Paris. &#8220;After more than a year of experience using the existing QIAstat-Dx Respiratory Panel to evaluate patients coming into our Emergency Department with respiratory syndromes, we are evaluating the new panel with SARS-CoV-2 against RT-PCR testing using WHO recommended protocols. The QIAstat-Dx solution can provide results in about one hour, with high sensitivity and specificity and minimal hands-on time for hospital or laboratory personnel,&#8221; said Dr. Benoit Visseaux, Associate Professor of Virology at Bichat-Claude Bernard Hospital in Paris.</span></p><p><span>Amid the rapidly evolving response to the coronavirus outbreak, the regulatory status of t</span><span>he </span><span>QIAstat-Dx Respiratory Panel will vary by location. QIAGEN will apply for emergency authorization for marketing of the new panel from the U.S., the Korean KCDC/MFDS, and FDA and China&#8217;s National Medical Products Administration (NMPA); the panel will be available with CE-IVD marking in Europe and other markets.</span></p><p><span>Multiple other QIAGEN testing solutions for SARS-CoV-2</span></p><p><span>QIAGEN has moved quickly on several fronts to provide molecular testing solutions to researchers working to counter the international threat from the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Building on its strong position and experience in molecular testing for infectious diseases, QIAGEN is providing a variety of solutions:</span></p><ul>
    <li><span>Enabling laboratory-developed tests (LDTs) &#8211; extraction kits, PCR enzymes and instruments, supporting in-house testing by laboratories and public health institutions. CDC guidelines for RT-PCR testing list QIAGEN&#8217;s EZ1 DSP Virus kits, which run on EZ1 Advanced workstations, and QIAamp DSP Viral RNA Mini kits, which can be automated on QIAcube instruments. Chinese authorities and the Berlin Charit&#232; protocol also include QIAGEN consumables. </span></li>
    <li><span>Mid- and high-throughput automation &#8211; QIAsymphony modular systems for sample preparation and PCR analysis, as well as NeuMoDx 96 and 288 systems for fully integrated PCR analysis, enabling customers to implement higher-throughput solutions for laboratory-developed RT-PCR tests. QIAGEN recently started placing NeuMoDx systems in China, for use in with LDTs in SARS-CoV-2 testing.</span></li>
    <li><span>Additional real-time PCR tests &#8211; two new RT-PCR tests for detection of SARS-CoV-2 have been developed at QIAGEN sites in China and the United States and will be available for Research Use Only. The company is investigating potential emergency use options for the automated PCR-based test solutions.</span></li>

<p><i>Expeditions with MCUP</i>&#160;is an online academic journal&#160;that offers authors a forum for the debate of trending domestic and international topics.&#160;<i>Expeditions with MCUP&#160;</i>will have all the&#160;advantages of a scholarly journal,&#160;including peer review and expert editing,&#160;but&#160;in a shorter time frame than a traditional print journal. Our authors will discuss the full spectrum of themes within the context of national security, international relations, and geopolitics as they apply to and impact the Department of Defense, the Department of the Navy, and the U.S. Marine Corps directly and indirectly.</p>

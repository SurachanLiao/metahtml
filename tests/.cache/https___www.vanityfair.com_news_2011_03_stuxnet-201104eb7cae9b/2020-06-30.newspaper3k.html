<div><p class="has-dropcap">To Schouwenberg and many others, Stuxnet appears to be the product of a more sophisticated and expensive development process than any other piece of malware that has become publicly known. A Symantec strategist estimated that as many as 30 different people helped write it. Programmers&#8217; coding styles are as distinctive as writers&#8217; prose styles. One expert estimated that the worm&#8217;s development took at least six months. Once Stuxnet was released into the wild, other technicians would have maintained the command-and-control servers in Denmark and Malaysia to which Stuxnet phoned home to report its current locations and seek updates.</p><p>Most curious, there were two major variants of the worm. The earliest versions of it, which appear to have been released in the summer of 2009, were extremely sophisticated in some ways but fairly primitive in others, compared with the newer version, which seems to have first circulated in March 2010. A third variant, containing minor improvements, appeared in April. In Schouwenberg&#8217;s view, this may mean that the authors thought Stuxnet wasn&#8217;t moving fast enough, or had not hit its target, so they created a more aggressive delivery mechanism. The authors, he thinks, weighed the risk of discovery against the risk of a mission failure and chose the former.</p><p class="inline-recirc-wrapper inline-recirc-observer-target-3 viewport-monitor-anchor"></p><p>There seemed no end to the odd surprises that Stuxnet had to offer. In a July 15 posting, Alexander Gostev, who wrote Kaspersky Lab&#8217;s blog on the worm, mysteriously quoted from a botanical entry in Wikipedia: &#8220;Myrtus (myrtle) is a genus of one or two species of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Why the sudden foray into botany?,&#8221; Gostev asked. His answer: &#8220;Because the rootkit driver code contains the following string: b:\myrtus\src\objfre_w2k_x86\i386\guava.pdb.&#8221; Gostev went on to raise the specter of a &#8220;Project &#8216;Myrtus&#8217; &#8221; and added portentously: &#8220;To be continued?&#8221; Although Gostev never returned to his musings on Stuxnet&#8217;s botanical allusion, he had planted a seed that would very quickly sprout.</p><p>At the end of July, just before Eugene Kaspersky came home from the volcanoes, Schouwenberg started trying to persuade a writer from The New York Times to cover Stuxnet. Without specific information on the source or the target, though, the topic was a nonstarter. Then, on September 16, an industrial-control-systems-security expert in Hamburg made a sensational blog posting about Stuxnet, whose deployment he would soon dub &#8220;operation myrtus.&#8221; And he was pretty sure he knew what the myrtle reference signified. The man had never been quoted in a newspaper before, but he was about to shift the global conversation about Stuxnet in a radically new direction.</p><p>Self-Directed Stealth Drone</p><p class="has-dropcap">&#8216;Am I crazy, or am I a genius?&#8221; The question would not leave Ralph Langner alone. He was having trouble sleeping. Sometimes he thought the C.I.A. was watching him. Langner, a voluble man of 52, is built like a whippet, with short hair neatly parted to the side. His Hamburg-based company is a big name in the small world of industrial-control-systems security, and counts some of Germany&#8217;s largest automotive and chemical corporations among its clients. Langner had been reverse engineering the payload of Stuxnet throughout August, and he was the first analyst to announce that it contained two components that he called &#8220;warheads.&#8221; Langner had come to believe that Stuxnet was aimed at Iran&#8217;s nuclear program. Iran has been suspected of trying to build a nuclear bomb for several years, and in 2003 it failed to disclose details regarding uranium-enrichment centrifuges to inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency. Western governments have been trying to stop Iran&#8217;s nuclear program ever since, using diplomatic pressure, trade embargoes, and covert operations.</p><p>Stuxnet had initially grabbed the tech world&#8217;s attention as a hack of the Windows operating system&#8212;a virus that exploited an unknown vulnerability. This was like learning that someone had found his way into your house, and figuring out how they got inside. Next, Frank Boldewin had discovered what valuables the intruder was after&#8212;programmable-logic controllers. Specifically, the target was P.L.C.&#8217;s made by the German engineering conglomerate Siemens. Finally, Langner figured out the rudiments of what Stuxnet&#8217;s payload did&#8212;that is, how the intruder went about his work. When Stuxnet moves into a computer, it attempts to spread to every machine on that computer&#8217;s network and to find out whether any are running Siemens software. If the answer is no, Stuxnet becomes a useless, inert feature on the network. If the answer is yes, the worm checks to see whether the machine is connected to a P.L.C. or waits until it is. Then it fingerprints the P.L.C. and the physical components connected to the controller, looking for a particular kind of machinery. If Stuxnet finds the piece of machinery it is looking for, it checks to see if that component is operating under certain conditions. If it is, Stuxnet injects its own rogue code into the controller, to change the way the machinery works. And even as it sabotages its target system, it fools the machine&#8217;s digital safety system into reading as if everything were normal.</p></div>

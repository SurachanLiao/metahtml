Kim was absent from North Korea’s most important annual holiday on April 15, raising speculation about his well-being.</p><p>South Korean news website the Daily NK claimed earlier on Monday night that Kim was ‘mostly-recovered’ from the procedure.

North Korea’s highly-secretive government has yet to comment on Kim’s alleged illness, or issue any sort of statement through its state-controlled media. </p><p>The nuclear-capable dictatorship has not reported any cases of coronavirus, and has scaled back its frequent displays of power in a bid to stop the potential spread of Covid-19. Neither South Korea nor the United States have offered an on-the-record comment on Kim’s health.  </p> <del><a id="share-item-10092593-250" class="anchor"></a></del><a class="share-item share-item-facebook btn" title="Share this on Facebook"><p class="icon icon-facebook"><del></del></p></a><a class="share-item share-item-twitter btn" target="_blank" title="Share this on Twitter" rel="noopener"><p class="icon icon-twitter"><del></del></p></a><a class="share-item share-item-pinterest btn" target="_blank" title="Share this on Pinterest" rel="noopener"><p class="icon icon-pinterest"><del></del></p></a><del> </del><del><img width="540" height="381" src="https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/themes/metro-parent/img/fallback.png" alt="U.S. President Donald Trump meets with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un at the demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas, in Panmunjom, South Korea, June 30, 2019.

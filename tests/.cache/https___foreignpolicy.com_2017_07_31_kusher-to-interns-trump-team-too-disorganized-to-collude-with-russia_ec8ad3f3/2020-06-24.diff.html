But Trump Jr. says the meeting wasn’t valuable, and Kushner later said he didn’t even read the emails about the meeting and left early. </span></p><p><span>President Trump has said that “most people would have taken that meeting,” which he described as “opposition research.”</span></p><p><span>After his talk, Kushner answered questions from interns on issues including the investigation into the Trump campaign’s potential ties to Russia and his SF-86 clearance forms.</span></p><p><span>“We don’t know where it’s going,” he said, when asked about <span> <ins>special</ins> </span> <del>special</del> counsel </span><span>Robert Mueller’s investigation into the Trump campaign’s possible collusion with Russia.</span></p><p><span>Kushner also downplayed his failure to report more than a hundred instances of foreign travel and contacts with foreign officials on his security clearance forms, which he updated twice to include meetings with Russian officials. “There are 127 pages on the SF-86, but there are only two you guys have to worry about,” he said. “Make sure you guys keep track of where you travel.” </span></p><p><span>Kushner said he didn’t track contacts because he didn’t expect to get into politics, though he worked on his father-in-law’s campaign from the early stages. </span></p><p><span>He also bragged about the release of an Egyptian-American charity worker who had been trapped in Cairo. The worker, Aya Hijazi, was freed when President Trump publicly embraced autocratic President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. </span></p><p><span>Kushner said they made a “great deal” with Sisi, who had “basically destroyed the Muslim Brotherhood,” by taking him aside and asking for a better arrangement. </span></p><p><span>The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</span></p><p><span>Before the lecture, the intern director warned those present not to leak the contents of the speech, which was given off the record. The director had apparently heard rumors that attendees wanted to livestream the event or hand off notes to their congressional offices to leak to journalists. </span></p><p><span>“I’m a lot more comfortable talking to you guys today ’cause there isn’t any press,” Kushner said.</span></p></article> <p><del>Photo credit: WIN McNAMEE/Getty Images</del></p><del> </del><p><del></del></p>

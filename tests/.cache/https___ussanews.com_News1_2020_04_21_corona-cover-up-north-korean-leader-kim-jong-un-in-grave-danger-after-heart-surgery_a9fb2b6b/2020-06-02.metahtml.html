The villagers who met under the village tree could also hang their politicians to the tree. It is terrible to contemplate how few politicians are hanged. &#8212;G. K.

Mueller headed the FBI Criminal Division at the time of the <a href="https://newswithviews.com/barr-and-mueller-eradicating-our-fourth-amendment-rights/">Ruby Ridge killings</a> and was infuriated that members of Congress and public officials dared complain about the FBI sniper shooting Vicki Weaver in the head while she held her 10-month-old baby.</p><p>In August of 1992 when the Ruby Ridge siege occurred, AG Barr was in charge.

Barr&#8217;s youth career goal was to head the CIA. See my previous article, <a href="http://www.jdpendry.com/2019/09/10/ag-william-barr-cia-asset-and-deep-state-impresario/">AG William Barr, CIA Asset and Deep State Impresario</a>.</p><p>In the final pages of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Compromised-Clinton-Bush-Terry-Reed-ebook/dp/B075JP2BR5/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&amp;keywords=compromised&amp;qid=1591048459&amp;sr=8-2">Compromised</a>, Terry Reed writes that in 1992, several years after working with CIA-connected Robert Johnson,&#160;he made the &#8220;miraculous find&#8221; that &#8220;Robert Johnson&#8221; was also William P. Barr. Reed&#8217;s CIA contact, William Barr, known at that time by his alias Robert Johnson, told Reed that Attorney General Edwin Meese had appointed Michael Fitzhugh to be US Attorney in Western Arkansas, and that he would stonewall any investigation into the Mena, Arkansas drug-related activities. This obstruction of justice by Justice Department officials did occur.</p><p>Don&#8217;t forget Edwin Meese&#8217;s involvement in the <a href="https://www.wired.com/1993/01/inslaw/">Inslaw/Promis software</a> theft by the federal government.</p><p>When George H.W. Bush became CIA Director in 1976, Barr joined the CIA&#8217;s &#8220;legal office&#8221; and Bush&#8217;s inner circle, and worked alongside Bush&#8217;s longtime CIA enforcers Theodore &#8220;Ted&#8221; Shackley, Felix Rodriguez, Thomas Clines, and others, several of whom were likely involved with the Bay of Pigs/John F. Kennedy assassination, and numerous southeast Asian operations, from the Phoenix Program to Golden Triangle narco-trafficking.</p><p>The Church Committee was a U.S. Senate select committee in 1975 that investigated abuses by the Central Intelligence Agency, National Security Agency, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Internal Revenue Service.Barr stonewalled and destroyed the Committee investigations into CIA abuses.</p><p><a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP77M00144R000800070004-6.pdf">A memo uncovered</a>&#160;in the Central Intelligence Agency&#8217;s declassified archives shows that during his time at the CIA&#8217;s Office of Legislative Council, current AG Barr drafted letters calling for the end of the moratorium on destroying records imposed on the Agency ahead of the&#160;<a href="https://www.muckrock.com/tags/church-committee/">Church Committee hearings</a>.&#160; We need to keep the docs showing the evil of the CIA, but Barr wants them destroyed.</p><p>And President George H.

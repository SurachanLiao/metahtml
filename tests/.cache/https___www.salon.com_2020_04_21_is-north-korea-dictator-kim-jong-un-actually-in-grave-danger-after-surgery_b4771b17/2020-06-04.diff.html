The highly-secretive country is by design difficult to penetrate — for outsiders and its own citizens alike.

A source from inside the regime reportedly said the North Korean leader had been experiencing cardiovascular difficulty for a few months as a result of obesity and heavy smoking but "worsened after repeated visits to Mount Paektu."</span></p><p><span>Kim's recent trips to Paektu — the dynasty's sacred volcano on the Chinese border — were heavily publicized within the country, including Putin-esque </span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-50655693"><span><span>photographs</span></span></a><span>and </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtEE9lOWfAY"><span><span>video</span></span></a><span>of the 36-year-old dictator riding a stallion up the snow-covered slopes.</span></p><p><span>North Korea watchers raised questions about Kim's health on April 14. He failed to show for a cruise missile demonstration as part of his grandfather's birthday festivities, and state media did not cover the launch at all. Kim also did not pay a birthday visit to his grandfather's mausoleum the next day, an act which Cheong Seong-chang, director of the Center for North Korean Studies at the Sejong Institute in South Korea told the New York Times was "the closest thing to blasphemy in the North" and "all but unthinkable."</span></p><p id="salon_auto_video"><span class="proper-caption">Advertisement:</span></p><p><span>"It is reasonable to think that there is something temporarily wrong with his health, although it may stretch things too much if we say his life is in danger," Cheong said.</span></p><p><span>A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman told Reuters that the government knew of the reports but would not say whether it has any more information.</span></p><p><span>North Korea also tried to tamp down the news, claiming Tuesday morning through government news agency Yonhap that Kim just sent a birthday letter to Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel.</span></p> <p class="proper-caption"><del>Advertisement:</del></p> <p><span>The confusion is useful to the weak regime, but it frustrates outside observers, who can </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/09/world/asia/in-kim-jong-uns-absence-rumors-about-him-swirl-in-north-korea.html"><span><span>get lost in rumors</span></span></a><span>about torture, grisly executions and military development.

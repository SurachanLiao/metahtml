<div><p>An elderly Queens man walked free from jail and won&#8217;t face criminal charges for tagging along with his bank-robbing son during an attempted heist, authorities said yesterday.</p>
<p>  There&#8217;s no evidence that Anthony Scimone Sr., 89, an ailing grandfather from Jackson Heights, had any role in his 47-year-old son&#8217;s stickup of the Ridgewood Savings Bank in Flushing, according to a spokesman for Queens DA Richard Brown.</p>
<p>  Even if there were any evidence against the elder Scimone, who is suffering from Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, prosecutors believe he would be declared mentally incompetent to stand trial, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>  Cops busted father and son moments after Anthony Scimone Jr. allegedly knocked off the Parsons Boulevard bank. With his father in the getaway car&#8217;s passenger seat, the younger Scimone tried to flee, but drove their 1992 Oldsmobile Cutlass into an oncoming NYPD cruiser.</p>
<p>  Cops hauled the elder Scimone to jail with his son before releasing him early yesterday.</p>
<p>  Family members said he is not able to care for himself.</p>
<p>  While they were happy the octogenarian is in the clear, they&#8217;re steamed at the younger Scimone for putting his dad in harm&#8217;s way.</p>
<p>  Scimone Jr. was ordered held on $80,000 bail last night, charged in four separate robberies.</p>
<p>  Marie Cipriano, daughter of Anthony Sr. and sister of the suspect, said, &#8220;I&#8217;m upset because I can&#8217;t believe that he&#8217;d [Anthony Jr.] do something like this. I&#8217;m in total shock.&#8221; </p>

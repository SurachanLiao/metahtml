<p class="snippet-item r-snippetized">
A 24-year-old mother was killed by a Black Lives Matter mob in Indianapolis last week, allegedly for saying &#8220;All Lives Matter.&#8221;
Unlike Charlottesville, or any violence from the right, this killing was reported so quietly that barely anyone even noticed. 
Jessica Doty Whitaker was shot and killed following an altercation with Black Lives Matter thugs who were upset that she and her fiance had said &#8220;All Lives Matter&#8221; last Sunday. 
&#8220;According to the victim&#8217;s family, the shooting started with an argument over Black Lives Matter and language. Eventually the two sides separated and walked away from each other, until witnesses claim the killer opened fire from a nearby bridge and ran away,&#8221; &#8220;It was squashed and they went up the hill and left we thought, but they were sitting on St. Claire waiting for us to come under the bridge and that&#8217;s when she got shot,&#8221; the victim&#8217;s fianc&#233; Jose Ramirez told the station.</p><p>
Her grandfather posted on Facebook that &#8220;multiple black assailants&#8221; shot her in the he&#8230;

EASTERN OKLAHOMA&#8212;The Supreme Court decided this week that half of Oklahoma is Native American land.&#160;Failed presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren was seen soon after in the newly formed Eastern Oklahoma Autonomous Zone with an authentic tomahawk and bow purchased in a gift shop, declaring herself to be the warlord of the area. 
"We must overthrow the palefaces," she said in an address to her people, who looked both confused and annoyed. "This is no longer part of the colonizers' United States of America -- we are an autonomous collective." The U.S. senator then instructed the Native Americans to build "wigwams" along the borders of their newly formed territory to keep out the "white man with his fire sticks." 
"Wigwams aren't even -- you know what, never mind," said one chieftain. "Knock yourself out, lady." 
Warren began planting a garden with signs that read "Indigenous Peoples and Her Plant Allies Only," b&#8230;

2 slain police officers 'never had a chance' in Texas shooting, chief says</p><p> 
Two police officers&#160;who were responding to a disturbance call&#160;were killed Saturday in a South Texas town after a suspect met the officers&#160;at the door and shot them, police say. 
The&#160;shooting happened so quickly that "our officers did not draw their weapons, did not fire, never stood a chance &#8211; never had a chance,"&#160;<a class="gnt_ar_b_a" href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?v=300829621108178&amp;ref=watch_permalink" rel="noopener" target="_blank">McAllen, Texas, Police Chief Victor Rodriguez said in a statement to the media</a>.&#160; 
The police department learned about the fatal shooting when other officers stopped by the scene to do a routine check, Rodriguez said. 
The officers were responding to reports of a violent disturbance, Rodriguez said.&#160;"They were doing their job. That is what we are supposed to do." 
The officers approached the door of the residence after meeting people outside the house who reported that a disturbance or assaults were occurring inside,&#160;Rodriguez said. 
The McAllen police officers were shot on the &#8230;

If you needed another reason to get out of the major cities while you still can &#8211; before the Democrat Left ensures they collapse completely with their insane &#8216;criminal justice reform&#8217; policies &#8211; here&#8217;s one.</p><p>
You may recall in recent weeks reading about a well-to-do St. Louis couple who were forced to defend their home and property against a large group of Black Lives Matter &#8216;protesters&#8217; after they busted through a gate and traipsed onto private land.</p><p>
The couple &#8211; lawyer Mark McCloskey and his wife Patricia &#8211; were having dinner on their balcony when the mob broke in and, as they have told multiple media outlets, they only armed themselves after they were directly threatened.</p><p>
By people who had&#160;broken&#160;onto their&#160;private&#160;property.</p><p>
Well, because she&#8217;s a Left-wing activist first and a prosecutor second, St. Louis prosecutor Kim Gardner vowed at the time that she would investigate the actions and behavior not of the BLM property violators but of the&#160;McCloskeys.</p><p>

Dr. Robert Epstein, the senior research psychologist at the American Institute for Behavioral Research and Technology, joined Breitbart News&#8217; Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow on Breitbart News Daily to discuss how Google hopes to shift 10 percent of the voting public away from Trump to fulfill a company executive&#8217;s stated goal of making populism nothing more than a &#8220;blip in history.&#8221;</p><p>
Dr. Robert Epstein, the senior research psychologist at the American Institute for Behavioral Research and Technology, appeared on Breitbart News Daily alongside host and Breitbart News Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow to discuss how Silicon Valley companies manipulate algorithm to suppress content.</p><p>

Discussing Google&#8217;s efforts to suppress conservative content, Marlow states: &#8220;None of this is gonna come as a surprise to this audience but I don&#8217;t think a lot of people by and large understand exactly how much they can manipulate you, Google can, with just a slight tweak to search results or search sug&#8230;

People that wear a mask in their car unfortunately get made fun of by bystanders all the time. Little do they know that driving alone in your car during pandemic times is one of the most dangerous activities you can take part in.

Good morning my friends.</p><p>
I want to share something with you, and perhaps motivate you to help me meet the enemy where they exist. Specifically, you all may remember that I recently published this article about <a href="https://txarmyvet.blogspot.com/2020/07/antifa-is-posting-videos-on-social.html" target="_blank">ANTIFA posting video to social media</a> on how to smash windows, cut seatbelts, and rip people from their cars who don't capitulate to their protests.</p><p>
Several folks complained that these things shouldn't be allowed to stand, and asked why things like posts from Candace Owens, Dan Bongino, etc get censored while allowing this crap to stand.</p><p>
I stated that the tweet should be reported, and most responses I got from our community were to the effect that y'all don't want a Twitter account, hate how they treat us etc. That's all perfectly true and understandable, HOWEVER I said, I maintain a Twitter account to reach out to our elected officials, get news and information from President Trump himself, and to take the fight to the enemy.</p><p>
I reported that ANTIFA Tweet. Her&#8230;

By  ROBERT KRAYCHIK               </p><p>
Historian Victor Davis Hanson proposed several measures to address left-wing political corruption across academia, offering his remarks on last Friday&#8217;s edition of SiriusXM&#8217;s Breitbart News Tonight with host Rebecca Mansour.</p><p>
Hanson reflected on standard leftist academic characterizations of Western Civilization. He said, &#8220;Today&#8217;s student works a couple of hours a day to help pay the cost [of schooling]. They have big debt and they&#8217;re at school six or seven hours [per day], and then they have an hour or two at home. That used to be history, literature, math, science, physics. It&#8217;s not anymore. Believe me, I&#8217;m in the university. It is gender studies, peace studies, and to the degree that it is history, it is how the Europeans raped Africa or destroyed it. That&#8217;s what they&#8217;re getting.&#8221;</p><p>
Hanson continued, &#8220;If you want a long-term solution to that indoctrination, you have to address that, and how do you address that when they control universities? The facu&#8230;

The president said Stone&#8217;s 40-month prison term was &#8220;unjust.&#8221;

Stone, a longtime Republican operative, was the seventh person to be convicted of crimes in former special counsel Robert Mueller&#8217;s investigation. The Justice Department revised its original sentencing guidelines of seven to nine years in prison after the president called it a &#8220;miscarriage of justice,&#8221; prompting several feder&#8230;

Radical Muslima Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) on Tuesday called for the dismantling of the US economy and political systems.</p><p>
The crazed Marxist lawmaker called for capitalism to be destroyed in the name of social justice.</p><p>
Democrat Ilhan Omar: &#8220;As long as our economy and political systems prioritize profit without considering who is profiting, who is being shut out, we will perpetuate this inequality so we cannot stop at the criminal justice system. We must begin the work of dismantling the whole system of oppression wherever we find it.&#8221;</p><p>
On Thursday Somali-born human rights activist and former European politician Ayann Hirsi Ali responded to Rep. Omar.</p><p>
Hirsi Ali has been speaking out for women&#8217;s rights in the Middle East for decades now.</p><p>
Hirsi Ali ripped the radical Democrat Ilhan Omar.</p><p>
Ayaan Hirsi Ali: &#8220;She&#8217;s in Congress &#8212; the United States Congress and she is saying &#8216;Why don&#8217;t we dismantle the whole thing?&#8217; &#8230; It makes you wonder. Why flee from Mogadishu, why fl&#8230;

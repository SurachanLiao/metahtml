Unlike Charlottesville, or any violence from the right, this killing was reported so quietly that barely anyone even noticed. 
Jessica Doty Whitaker was shot and killed following an altercation with Black Lives Matter thugs who were upset that she and her fiance had said “All Lives Matter” last Sunday. 
“According to the victim’s family, the shooting started with an argument over Black Lives Matter and language. Eventually the two sides separated and walked away from each other, until witnesses claim the killer opened fire from a nearby bridge and ran away,” “It was squashed and they went up the hill and left we thought, but they were sitting on St. Claire waiting for us to come under the bridge and that’s when she got shot,” the victim’s fiancé Jose Ramirez told the station.</ins></p><p><ins>Her grandfather posted on Facebook that “multiple black assailants” shot her in the he…

"We must overthrow the palefaces," she said in an address to her people, who looked both confused and annoyed. "This is no longer part of the colonizers' United States of America -- we are an autonomous collective." The U.S. senator then instructed the Native Americans to build "wigwams" along the borders of their newly formed territory to keep out the "white man with his fire sticks." 
"Wigwams aren't even -- you know what, never mind," said one chieftain. "Knock yourself out, lady."

Because since ascending to the throne in 2012, Supreme Commander Kim Jong Un has put on  nearly 100 pounds. </p></article><article><p>Last week, Donald Trump  told Reuters he would have &#226;&#128;&#156;no problem&#226;&#128;&#157; speaking with Kim Jong-Un, the fellow follicular innovator  he once praised as &#226;&#128;&#156;pretty amazing.&#226;&#128;&#157; Unfortunately for Trump, North Korea isn&#226;&#128;&#153;t sure it can trust a guy who just makes shit up.</p></article><article><p>On Monday,  the Associated Press reports, North Korea expelled three BBC journalists for allegedly insulting the country&#226;&#128;&#153;s dignity, shortly before the authoritarian state&#226;&#128;&#153;s first congress in 36 years bestowed a new title upon Kim Jong Un: &#226;&#128;&#156;Party chairman.&#226;&#128;&#157;</p></article><article><p>North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un has ordered his country&#226;&#128;&#153;s nuclear arsenal to be ready for pre-emptive use &#226;&#128;&#156;at any time,&#226;&#128;&#157;  Agence France-Presse reports.

Security Council approved stringent new sanctions on Pyongyang last week, and South Korea passed new human rights legislation.</p></article><article><p>North Korea confirmed on Sunday that it launched a satellite into space in the early morning, calling the move &#226;&#128;&#156;peaceful,&#226;&#128;&#157; despite no one believing that for a second.</p></article><article><p>Donald Trump, a man who could be  called equally as fascist as  many a dictator who came before him, has a new hero&#226;&#128;&#148;or, rather, a new supreme leader. </p></article><article><p>Humble Shining Sun Who Lights Our Path, Honorable Leader Kim Jong Un, has put North Korea  on war footing over South Korea&#226;&#128;&#153;s outrageous imperialist puppeteer provocations.

Raise high your fists against the hostile animalistic imperialist!</p></article><article><p>A little over a week ago, North Korea claimed to have successfully launched a ballistic missile from an undersea submarine. Such a launch would have been a major step forward for the hermit country, if it had actually happened. But according to German aerospace experts, the photos supposedly proving North Korea&#226;&#128;&#153;s technological prowess only proved that, once again, North Korea is shit at Photoshop.</p></article><article><p>According to South Korea&#226;&#128;&#153;s chief spy agency, the head of North Korea&#226;&#128;&#153;s military was publicly executed by anti-aircraft gun late last month for disobeying Kim Jong Un and falling asleep during a meeting,  the BBC reports.</p></article><article><p>Kim Jong-un  has withdrawn from reported plans to attend a World War II anniversary celebration in Moscow, according to a Kremlin rep.

His limp of mysterious provenance was also back, along with a cane that only fuels speculation that the head of the totalitarian regime is unwell. </p></article><article><p>North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un is reportedly furious about  a Chinese viral video that photoshops him into all manner of ridiculous scenarios: dancing, brawling, riding a pig, frolicking with Osama Bin Laden, and generally being made a laughingstock by Obama and Putin.</p></article><article><p>Kim Jong-un limped his way on stage at his grandfather's memorial ceremony today. It's not clear what his injury is &#226;&#128;&#148; maybe he's just being dramatic &#226;&#128;&#148; but it's surprising that state TV captured his apparent weakness. </p></article><article><p>In a bid to  distract from its nuclear weapons program, North Korea announced it will send cheerleaders to South Korea.

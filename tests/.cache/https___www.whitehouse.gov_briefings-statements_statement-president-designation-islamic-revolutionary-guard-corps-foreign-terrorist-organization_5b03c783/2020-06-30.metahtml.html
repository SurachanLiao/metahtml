<main id="main-content"><p>Today, I am formally announcing my Administration&#8217;s plan to designate Iran&#8217;s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), including its Qods Force, as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) under Section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act.&#160; This unprecedented step, led by the Department of State, recognizes the reality that Iran is not only a State Sponsor of Terrorism, but that the IRGC actively participates in, finances, and promotes terrorism as a tool of statecraft.&#160; The IRGC is the Iranian government&#8217;s primary means of directing and implementing its global terrorist campaign.</p><p>This designation will be the first time that the United States has ever named a part of another government as a FTO.&#160; It underscores the fact that Iran&#8217;s actions are fundamentally different from those of other governments. &#160;This action will significantly expand the scope and scale of our maximum pressure on the Iranian regime. &#160;It makes crystal clear the risks of conducting business with, or providing support to, the IRGC.&#160; If you are doing business with the IRGC, you will be bankrolling terrorism.</p><p>This action sends a clear message to Tehran that its support for terrorism has serious consequences. &#160;We will continue to increase financial pressure and raise the costs on the Iranian regime for its support of terrorist activity until it abandons its malign and outlaw behavior.</p></main>

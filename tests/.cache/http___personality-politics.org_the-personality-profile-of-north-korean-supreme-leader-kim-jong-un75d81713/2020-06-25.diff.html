Considering the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea counts among the most totalitarian of contemporary regimes, one would think it would be a simple matter to assess the personal psychology of its supreme leader, Kim Jong-un.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>Not so. It has proven extraordinarily difficult to find reliable information pertaining to Kim’s personal psychology. The first obstacle is the secrecy surrounding the Kim dynasty, exacerbated by the state-sponsored cult of personality and deification of the Kim family. Second, and equally problematic, is the tendency of news reports and media commentary to conflate regime behavior and Kim’s personal traits. Thus, characterizations of Kim as “erratic” or “unstable” tend to be spurious attributions of regime behavior to the person of Kim Jong-un.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>The Unit for the Study of Personality in Politics’ first study of Kim Jong-un – completed in April 2013, a year after Kim assumed the mantle of chairman of the Workers’ Party of Korea and supreme leader of the DPRK – found him to be generally congenial and cooperative, with no indication of remarkable aggressive tendencies or an unstable personality.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>A follow-up study conducted four years later in spring 2017, in the wake of increasingly bellicose rhetoric and escalating military provocations on the part of the North Korean regime, specifically searched for evidence that could link this aggression to Kim’s personal attributes. Kim was found, at most, to have only a moderate predisposition to aggressive behavior.</del></p><del> </del><p><del><img class="alignnone wp-image-3218 size-full" src="http://personality-politics.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Kim-Jong-Un-pie-chart.png" alt="Kim Jong Un pie chart" width="697" height="493"></del></p><del> </del><p><del>Specifically, Kim Jong-un’s score of 10 on MIDC scale 1A (Dominant) – a measure of aggressiveness – is modest compared with recent U.S. presidents (Donald Trump, 17; George W. Bush, 11; Bill Clinton, 7; Barack Obama, 7).</del></p><del> </del><p><del>Moreover, Kim Jong-un’s score of 5 on MIDC scale 4 (Accommodating) – a measure of cooperativeness – is comparable to those of recent U.S. presidents (Barack Obama, 5; Bill Clinton, 5; George W.

Doing so highlights his strategic sensibility, patience and evolving maturity as a leader. Importantly, while disappointed (and likely humiliated) by his failure to achieve sanctions relief at the 2019 Hanoi Summit with US President Donald Trump, Chairman Kim has refrained from attacking the president personally. …</del></p><del> </del><p><del>Kim remains an aspirational leader, even as the DPRK’s diplomacy is likely to shift—given the replacement of Ri Yong Ho and appointment of Ri Son Gwon (a military hardliner and protégé of Kim Yong Chol) as foreign minister—to a more muscular, hard-nosed version. And Kim, rather than acting impulsively to provoke an unpredictable President Trump, has surely taken measure of America’s current impeachment drama, the upcoming American presidential election, and Trump’s recent show of resolve with respect to the killing of Iran’s Quds Force leader General Soleimani, as well as the signing of the China trade deal. Kim is patiently waiting—with a tendency to avoid unnecessary political risks—knowing that, if Trump were to serve another four years, time is on his and the DPRK’s side. …</del></p><del> </del><p><del><a href="https://www.38north.org/2020/01/kdekleva013020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Full commentary Link: https://www.38north.org/2020/01/kdekleva013020/ </a></del></p><del> </del><p><del><strong>Analysis: March 9, 2019</strong></del></p><del> </del><p><del><strong><a title="Permanent Link to U.S. Response to North Korea’s Rebuilding Activity at Sohae Satellite Launching Station" href="http://www.immelman.us/news/u-s-response-to-north-koreas-rebuilding-activity-at-sohae-satellite-launching-station/" target="_blank" rel="bookmark noopener noreferrer">U.S. Response to North Korea’s Rebuilding Activity at Sohae Satellite Launching Station Link: http://www.immelman.us/news/u-s-response-to-north-koreas-rebuilding-activity-at-sohae-satellite-launching-station/ </a></strong></del></p><del> </del><p><del>As <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/world/asia/kim-jong-trump-summit.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported in the New York Times Link: https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/world/asia/kim-jong-trump-summit.html </a> (March 8, 2019), the collapse of the Feb. 27-28 Hanoi summit meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump “was considered a big embarrassment” for North Korean leader Kim Jong-un “because he had to return home empty-handed after Mr. Trump rejected his demand for relief from United Nations sanctions.”</del></p><del> </del><p><del>Satellite imagery indicating North Korea has begun to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/05/world/asia/north-korea-missile-site.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rebuild the Sohae Satellite Launching Station Link: https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/05/world/asia/north-korea-missile-site.html </a> at Tongchang-ri has raised fears among some analysts that the country might resume missile tests (New York Times, March 5, 2019).</del></p><del> </del><del><img class=" wp-image-3830" src="http://personality-politics.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Sohae-Satellite-Launching-Station_2019-03-06-1024x619.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="387"></del><p><del>The U.S. response to these developments is critical to the progress of denuclearization talks with North Korea.

He arrived with a fake name, a collection of genuine, top-of-the-line Nike sneakers and a passion for American basketball.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>“We only dreamed about having such shoes. He was wearing them,” recalled Nikola Kovacevic, a former schoolmate of the curiously well-heeled North Korean. Each pair, estimates Kovacevic, cost more than $200 — at least four times the average monthly salary in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, where perhaps 1 million people died as a result of food shortages in the mid- and late 1990s.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>Today, the student — who vanished from this sleepy Swiss district as mysteriously as he appeared — is a key figure in a puzzle that U.S. and Asian intelligence services are scrambling to solve: Who will lead nuclear-armed North Korea — and where to — once its gravely ill leader, Kim Jong Il, passes from the scene?</del></p><del> </del><p><del>The answer is of vital importance to Washington, which has about 25,000 troops in South Korea, on guard against any resumption of a conflict frozen — but never formally ended — by a Korean War armistice accord in 1953. Who rules North Korea will decide whether Seoul, Tokyo and perhaps even Hawaii risk attack from a nation that has tested two nuclear devices, the most recent in May, and built up an arsenal of missiles and long-range artillery. The Pentagon has sent missile-defense systems to Hawaii just in case. North Korea marked July 4 this year by test-firing seven more rockets.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>North Korea shrouds the biographies of its rulers and their offspring in a fog of fiction and silence. “It is pretty amazing how very little real information we have,” said Victor Cha, who served as a Korea expert on the National Security Council in the Bush administration.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>A rare insight into this sealed world is offered by Swiss recollections of the young North Korean who, from 1998 until late 2000, lived here in Liebefeld at No. 10 Kirchstrasse, a sedate suburban street with two pizza joints, a Credit Suisse bank and a Coop supermarket. He was around 17 when he abruptly left in the middle of the school year, apparently to return to Pyongyang.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>There are many signs that he may now be the next leader of North Korea — 26-year-old Kim Jong Un, the third and youngest son of Kim Jong Il.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>Known as “Pak Un” to his teachers at Liebefeld-Steinhözli Schule, a German-speaking state school, he was registered with Swiss authorities as the son of an employee at North Korea’s embassy in the nearby city of Bern, Switzerland’s capital, according to Ueli Studer, director of education in the local administration.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>Throughout Pak Un’s time in Liebefeld, however, neither friends nor teachers ever met the parents. “I never saw his father or mother,” said the school’s principal, Peter Burri, recalling how they repeatedly failed to show up for parents’ night. Attending in their place, Burri said, were assorted North Koreans who apologized for the parents’ absence and said this was due to their inability to speak German.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>A more likely reason: The boy’s father didn’t work in Bern at the embassy but was more than 5,000 miles away in Pyongyang.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>Maria Micaelo, the mother of one of Pak Un’s closest school friends, said the North Korean teenager once confided to her son, Joao, that his father was the leader of North Korea. She recalled that she dismissed the claim as a fanciful teenage boast, but had second thoughts when her son saw pictures of Kim Jong Il on television and told her that he’d seen the same man in a photograph with Pak Un. Joao Micaelo, now a cook in Vienna, did not respond to repeated e-mail messages seeking comment.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>Kongdan Oh Hassig, an expert on North Korea at the Alexandria-based <a href="http://www.ida.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Institute for Defense Analyses Link: http://www.ida.org/ </a>, which does research for the Pentagon, says Pak Un certainly appears to be Kim Jong Il’s third son, Kim Jong Un, adding that members of North Korea’s elite usually use bogus names outside their homeland. Pak is a very common Korean surname akin to Smith.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>When reports of a Pyongyang succession plan began to leak out of North Korea this year, heir apparent Kim Jong Un was widely reported to have attended the International School of Berne, a private, English-speaking establishment near the North Korean Embassy in the Swiss capital.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>But, North Korea watchers say, that student — who went by the name “Pak Chol” — was most likely Kim Jong Un’s older brother, Kim Jong Chol. Both were born to Kim Jong Il’s third wife, a former dancer who died in 2004. The North Korean leader has another son, his oldest, by another wife. He also has four daughters. The oldest son, Kim Jong Nam, also studied for a time in Switzerland under an alias, as well as in the Soviet Union. …</del></p><del> </del><p><del><strong>Question of Culture’</strong></del></p><del> </del><p><del>The Swiss education of North Korea’s apparent future leader raises a tantalizing question: Did it open his horizons beyond the narrow, xenophobic worldview of his homeland, where schools bombard pupils with the evils of “U.S. imperialism” and instill unquestioning obedience to a highly centralized state headed by a leader-for-life? This is in stark contrast to Switzerland, a democratic federal state in which power is widely diffused, where all laws can be challenged by citizens through referendum, and where the presidency is a rotating position that changes every year.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>“There is a big difference between attending a school in a free country and a school where everyone has to salute,” said Studer, the local education director. Schooling, he added, is a “question of culture,” and a North Korean schooled in Liebefeld “will take something away that will have an effect on his life.” Pak Un, along with fellow students, had three classes a week on Swiss history from 1291 and the evolution of the country’s modern system of governance known as “direct democracy,” as well as current events, which in 2000 included the U.S. election campaign.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>The North Korean Embassy in Bern, housed in an elegant villa festooned with geraniums in the capital’s most expensive neighborhood, declined to comment. Some analysts in South Korea have expressed uncertainty about whether Kim Jong Un has definitely been selected as successor, noting that no official announcement has yet been made by Pyongyang.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>A propaganda display on the embassy’s ivy-covered wall obliquely addresses the issue of succession, stressing the reinvigorating vitality of youth, a frequent theme of North Korean propaganda in recent months as the regime prepares for a transfer of power. Featuring photographs of young soldiers, young athletes and Youth League zealots, it shows Kim Jong Il as he “hands over the torch of revolution to young vanguards of Juche,” the regime’s idiosyncratic state ideology.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>Since North Korea’s founding in 1945, power has passed exclusively from father to son. A hereditary dynasty, it mixes communist cant with Confucian emphasis on the primacy of family ties. Its founder, Kim Il Sung, known as the Great Leader, fabricated a patriotic lineage stretching back to the mid-19th century. After his death in 1994, power passed to his eldest son, the Dear Leader Kim Jong Il, who, according to his own falsified biography, was born on a Mount Paektu, a sacred mountain. He was really born in the Soviet Union, where he was known as Yuri.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>With Kim Jong Il, 67, now ailing, North Korea is preparing to hand the baton to the third generation — and gearing up for a new round of hagiography and mythmaking. …</del></p><del> </del><p><del>Last month, according to Open Radio for North Korea, a Seoul-based group with extensive contacts in North Korea, Pyongyang began holding lectures for selected audiences to trumpet the “greatness” of Kim Jong Un, the heir apparent. He was celebrated as a “genius of literary arts” and tireless patriot who “is working without sleep or rest” to promote North Korea as a nuclear superpower, according to the organization’s account of the sessions. Among his purported feats: He so inspired North Korea’s national soccer squad that it recently qualified for the World Cup finals, the first time the team has done so since 1966.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>A confidential report prepared in May by the <a href="https://www.opensource.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open Source Center Link: https://www.opensource.gov/ </a>, a U.S. agency that monitors foreign media outlets, said North Korea began to prepare the way for a hereditary successor to Kim Jong Il in 2001 with an essay in a party newspaper titled “A Brilliant Succession.” It didn’t name anyone but defined father-son succession as a “pure” tradition, and warned that any revolution that doesn’t follow tradition is “dead.”</del></p><del> </del><p><del>This subtle campaign accelerated sharply, according to the report, after Kim Jong Il fell seriously ill, possibly suffering a stroke, last August and vanished for months. U.S. analysts, seeking clues in mountains of North Korean propaganda, noted increasingly frequent mentions of the importance of “bloodlines” and detected veiled endorsements of Kim Jong Un.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>Kim Jong Il’s eldest son, Jong Nam, was for a time viewed as a likely heir but apparently bungled his chances in 2001 by trying to sneak into Japan under a fake Chinese name on a bogus Dominican Republic passport. He told Japanese immigration officials he wanted to visit Tokyo Disneyland. Interviewed briefly last month in the Chinese gambling enclave of Macau by Japanese television, Jong Nam said he had heard reports that his younger brother, Jong Un, had been chosen as successor but couldn’t comment because that “is a very sensitive question.”</del></p><del> </del><p><del><strong>Focused and Competitive</strong></del></p><del> </del><p><del>Kim Jong Un has not been seen in public since his apparent time in Switzerland. Neither his name nor his photograph has ever appeared in North Korean media. After leaving Europe, he is reported to have attended Pyongyang’s Kim Il Sung Military University, an officer training school, but virtually nothing else is known about him.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>A senior U.S. official says he appears to have “the same interests as most 26-year-olds,” noting that these do not generally involve nuclear strategy.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>If Liebefeld’s former student Pak Un is indeed Kim Jong Un, the memories of his former friends and teachers here offer a sketch of his character. He first started school after the summer holidays in 1998, a time when it looked as if North Korea might soon collapse. At about the same time, Kim Jong Il launched a secret program to produce highly enriched uranium for a nuclear bomb.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>During his first few months in Liebefeld, Pak Un attended a remedial language course for foreign students with poor German. A swift learner, he soon switched to a regular class, said Studer, the education official, who described the boy as “well-integrated, diligent and ambitious.” Friends recalled that Pak Un spoke fluent, if sometimes ungrammatical, German but struggled with the Swiss dialect. He also knew English.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>A video of a school music class he attended shows a lithe, intense-looking Asian boy wearing black sweat pants, Nike Air Jordan shoes and a long-sleeved black sports shirt. He sways uncomfortably while classmates pound African drums and beat tambourines. Though generally quiet in class and sometimes awkward, particularly around girls, Pak Un showed a different personality on the basketball court, former friends recalled. He fell in with a group of mostly immigrant kids who shared his love of the National Basketball Association. Kovacevic, who shot hoops with the North Korean most days, said Pak Un was a fiercely competitive player.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>“He was very explosive. He could make things happen. He was the playmaker,” said Kovacevic, who now works as a tech specialist in the Swiss army. “If I wasn’t sure I could make a shot, I always knew he could.”</del></p><del> </del><p><del>Marco Imhof, another Swiss basketball buddy, said the Korean was tough and fast, good at both shooting and dribbling. “He hated to lose. Winning was very important,” recalled Imhof. Pak Un also liked action films featuring hand-to-hand fighting, particularly those starring the Hong Kong kung fu star Jackie Chan, and played combat games on a Sony PlayStation.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>This picture of a focused, competitive young man matches what until now has been the only firsthand account of Kim Jong Un. That was provided by a Japanese sushi chef who claims to have worked in Pyongyang as a cook for the Kim family. The chef, who wrote a book on his experiences in Japanese under the pseudonym Kenji Fujimoto, described the boy as strong-willed, proud and “boss-like.”</del></p><del> </del><p><del>During his time in Liebefeld, friends remembered, Pak Un showed scant interest in politics and never vented publicly against Americans. Instead, he worshiped American basketball stars. He spent hours doing meticulous pencil drawings of Chicago Bulls superstar Michael Jordan.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>At his spacious apartment on Kirchstrasse, said one friend who visited, Pak Un had a room filled with American basketball paraphernalia. He proudly showed off photographs of himself standing with Toni Kukoc of the Chicago Bulls and Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers. It is unclear where the pictures were taken. On at least one occasion, a car from the North Korean Embassy drove Pak Un to Paris to watch an NBA exhibition game.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>With no parents in sight, Pak Un was watched over and waited on by North Koreans who appeared to combine the duties of servants, guardians and guards. A pair of Korean women, says Imhof, often observed him playing basketball and sometimes videotaped the action. A Korean-speaking man frequently hovered nearby. “It was a bit strange,” Imhof said. But he figured this was just “a Korean thing.”</del></p><del> </del><p><del>Pak Un’s ultimate guardian in Switzerland was Ri Tcheul, North Korea’s veteran ambassador in Bern. Ri has served in the Swiss capital for 21 years, making him the city’s longest-serving foreign envoy. Over the years, he has turned the embassy into the nerve center for Pyongyang’s sometimes furtive contacts with businessmen, bankers, officials and aid workers from across Europe.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>Studer, the local education official, said school authorities never had reason to question whether Pak Un really was the son of an embassy employee. Now that he’s gone, he added, “there is no need to go into the matter.”</del></p><del> </del><p><del>Pak Un’s former friends are more curious and say they’d like to know the real identity of the teenager they used to hang out with. They last saw him in 2000, when he suddenly vanished. He left no address and didn’t tell anyone where he was going.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>“We thought he was ill or something and would soon be back. He never came to school again. He totally disappeared,” said Kovacevic, his former friend. He and others asked teachers what had happened. They had no idea either. “We were just playing basketball — now he is going to be a dictator,” said Kovacevic. “I hope he is a good leader, but dictators are usually not that good.”</del></p><del> </del><p><del>——————————————————————————</del></p><del> </del><p><del><strong><a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/39413720/ns/world_news-asia_pacific/t/n-korea-releases-photo-kims-likely-heir/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">North Korea Releases Photo of Kim’s Likely Heir Link: http://www.nbcnews.com/id/39413720/ns/world_news-asia_pacific/t/n-korea-releases-photo-kims-likely-heir/ </a></strong></del></p><del> </del><p><del><strong>The Associated Press and Reuters via MSNBC.com</strong><br> September 30, 2010</del></p><del> </del><p><del>North Korea on Thursday released what is believed the first official image of leader Kim Jong Il’s youngest son and heir apparent. …</del></p><del> </del><p><del>The photo’s release comes after the younger Kim earlier this week was handed top military and party posts at a Workers’ Party conference.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>The ascension of Kim Jong Un to a prominent ruling party post put him well on the path to succeed the supreme leader at the helm of nuclear-armed North Korea and carry the family dynasty into a third generation.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>Rising with him were the ailing Kim Jong Il’s sister and her husband, creating a powerful triumvirate ready to take over the family dynasty that has ruled North Korea since its founding after World War Two.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>Kim’s Swiss-educated, youngest son was made a four-star general in his first mention in North Korea’s state media on Tuesday.

</del><p><del>March 29, 2013</del></p><p><del>Is Kim Jong Un crazy — or crazy like a fox?</del></p><del> </del><p><del>Analysts said Friday there’s a familiar method to the madness coming out of North Korea, where the rookie supreme leader has put rockets on standby, threatened to “settle accounts” with the U.S., and posed near a chart that appeared to map missile strikes on American cities. On Saturday, North Korea said it had entered a “state of war” against South Korea, according to a statement reported by the north’s official news agency, KCNA.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>Kim Jong Un’s father and grandfather were also serial saber-rattlers when they headed the secretive regime, and experts said there are clear strategic reasons why the world’s youngest head of state is ramping up the rhetoric now, after little more than a year in power.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>But if the bluster is predictable, the results may not be.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>North Korea has enhanced its nuclear capabilities and Kim Jong Un has something to prove to his people and the world. Some outside observers are warning that a misstep, or overstep, by Pyongyang could bring north[east] Asia to the brink of war.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>“I think there is always room for miscalculation and things spiraling out of control,” said Sung-Youn Lee, professor at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. “But he is following the playbook set by his father and grandfather.”</del></p><del> </del><p><del>North Korea is “very adept at engaging at psychological warfare,” Lee said. It cranks up the tensions, putting pressure on Seoul and Washington, and is rewarded with aid and concessions when it tones things down, Lee said.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>“No leader wants a foreign policy crisis created by North Korea on their hands … the impulse is to de-escalate,” Lee added. “North Korea has been very good at playing this game — nuclear diplomacy, even extortion — for the past 20 years.”</del></p><del> </del><p><del>This time around, foreign-policy watchers said, a confluence of circumstances have set the stage for Kim Jong Un’s provocations:</del></p><del> </del><ul><li><del>Pyongyang is stewing over the U.N. Security Council, with the support of China, tightening sanctions after satellite and nuclear testing that suggested they could one day attack the U.S.</del></li><del> </del><li><del>There are new administrations in South Korea, China and Tokyo, and President Barack Obama is making second-term changes to his defense and national-security leadership, so the timing is right to test the waters.</del></li><del> </del><li><del>Kim Jong Un may need to consolidate his political power at home. A strong response by the U.S. or South Korea, such as this week’s B-2 bomber flyover, helps rally domestic support and distract from economic problems.</del></li><del> </del><li><del>North Korea’s last nuclear test showed progress. “You feel you can afford to threaten because you feel you have a deterrent,” said Scott Snyder, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.</del></li><del> </del></ul><del> </del><p><del>Joel Wit, visiting fellow at the US-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University, said that from the North Korean perspective, Kim Jong Un and his lieutenants “aren’t crazy” and are falling back on a tried-and-true strategy.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>“They’re a very small country dealing with much more powerful countries, and they can’t show any weakness. For them, the best defense is a good offense,” he said.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>Yet Snyder said Kim Jong Un’s standing as a new, untested ruler is “the real wild-card factor that makes this different.” …</del></p><del> </del><p><del>A hit on U.S. targets seems highly unlikely and would be “suicidal,” Lee said. But South Korea and Japan are within striking distance, and many experts say it’s not impossible that Kim Jong Un could act rashly.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>“While these weapons can’t reach the U.S., it’s an extremely tense situation, and wars don’t always start logically,” Wit said. …</del></p><del> </del><p><del><a href="http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/03/29/17518490-north-korea-threats-predictable-but-kim-jong-un-is-not-analysts-say?lite" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Full report Link: http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/03/29/17518490-north-korea-threats-predictable-but-kim-jong-un-is-not-analysts-say?lite </a></del></p><del> </del><p><del>———————————————————————————————————————</del></p><del> </del><p><del><strong><a href="http://www.news.com.au/world-news/kim-jong-uns-aunt-kim-kyong-hui-and-uncle-jang-sung-taek-calling-the-shots-in-north-korea/story-fndir2ev-1226614836996" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim Jong-un’s Aunt Kim Kyong-Hui and Uncle Jang Sung-Taek Calling the Shots in North Korea Link: http://www.news.com.au/world-news/kim-jong-uns-aunt-kim-kyong-hui-and-uncle-jang-sung-taek-calling-the-shots-in-north-korea/story-fndir2ev-1226614836996 </a></strong></del></p><del> </del><p><del><img class="" src="http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2013/04/08/1226614/813101-kim-kyong-hui-kim-jong-un-auntie-north-korea.jpg" alt="" width="525" height="295"><br> Kim Kyong Hui, with Kim Jong Un (right) behind her in 2011.

At a time when the United States has learned to conduct drone strikes with increasing accuracy in Pakistan, and direct cyberweapons at specific nuclear centrifuges deep under the Iranian desert, its understanding of North Korea’s leadership and weapons systems has actually gotten worse. …</del></p><del> </del><p><del>The most recent intelligence failures included what administration officials now acknowledge was the C.I.A.’s initial judgment — now reversed — that the North’s young new leader, <a title="More articles about Kim Jong-un." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/k/kim_jongun/index.html?inline=nyt-per" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim Jong-un Link: http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/k/kim_jongun/index.html?inline=nyt-per </a>, was probably more interested in economic reform than in following his father’s and grandfather’s “military first” policy of bolstering the North’s missile and nuclear arsenals, and threatening to use them unless the world came to its door. …</del></p><del> </del><p><del>In a sign of continuing confusion, the Defense Intelligence Agency — the Pentagon’s intelligence arm — recently declared with “moderate confidence” that the North can now shrink a nuclear warhead to fit onto one of those missiles, only to find its assessment disputed, in public, by both President Obama and the director of national intelligence. …</del></p><del> </del><p><del>The depth of the inability to figure out what is happening was reflected on Thursday in an unclassified Pentagon report to Congress on North Korea’s military capabilities, which read much like it had been written in the late 1980s. It also cast, by implication, significant doubt that returning to negotiations would do much good: “In North Korea’s view,” it concluded, “the destruction of regimes such as Ceausescu, Hussein and Qaddafi was not an inevitable consequence of repressive government, but rather of a failure to secure the necessary capabilities to defend their respective autocratic regime’s survival.”</del></p><del> </del><p><del>But the more immediate concern is that Kim Jong-un could follow North Korea’s recent playbook and create another provocation — akin to the sinking of a South Korean navy ship in 2010 or the recent cyberattack on South Korean banks and news media companies. It took weeks of investigation before South Korea could blame the North for those past provocations. …</del></p><del> </del><p><del>But the heart of the intelligence weakness centers on Mr. Kim, who is thought to be in his late 20s. The Chinese, who regularly invited his father, <a title="More articles about Kim Jong II." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/k/_kim_jong_il/index.html?inline=nyt-per" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim Jong-il Link: http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/k/_kim_jong_il/index.html?inline=nyt-per </a>, to Beijing for consultations, praise and occasional dressing-downs, contend they have had few meetings with him.

By some counts, two-thirds of the North’s senior generals have been demoted, replaced or shunted to less-powerful jobs; a few have been banished by the young leader. All have had to sign loyalty letters.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>Yet the view that Mr. Kim has become as powerful as his father is not universal. “Who is in charge in North Korea? It’s hard to say,” said a senior South Korean policy maker. “How strong is Kim Jong-un? We don’t know exactly. Who is giving orders in Pyongyang? Apparently, it’s Kim Jong-un, but we are not sure about the inner-circle decision-making process.” [emphasis added]</del></p><del> </del><p><del>It is a measure of the varying interpretations inside the United States government that, testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Adm. Samuel J. Locklear III, the head of the Pacific Command, called Mr. Kim “impetuous” and “more unpredictable” than his father. But speaking to the same committee, Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, the Defense Intelligence Agency’s director, called Mr. Kim a leader “firmly in control” who “possesses a charisma that his father did not,” and who understands realpolitik, including that he could not survive full-scale war. …</del></p><del> </del><p><del><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/07/world/asia/intelligence-on-north-korea-still-out-of-reach.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Full report Link: http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/07/world/asia/intelligence-on-north-korea-still-out-of-reach.html </a></del></p><del> </del><p><del>———————————————————————————————————</del></p><del> </del><p><del><strong><a href="http://news.msn.com/world/more-purges-may-follow-execution-of-kims-uncle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">North Korea Executes Jang Song Thaek; More Purges May Follow Link: http://news.msn.com/world/more-purges-may-follow-execution-of-kims-uncle </a></strong></del></p><del> </del><p><del><img id="http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Photo/_new/pb-131209-nk-uncle-01.jpg" class="" src="http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Photo/_new/pb-131209-nk-uncle-01.photoblog900.jpg" alt="" width="524" height="270"><br> North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s uncle Jang Song Thaek, center, is arrested during an enlarged meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Workers’ Party in Pyongyang on Sunday, Dec. 8, 2013.

Either way, the purge is an unsettling development for a world that is already wary of Kim’s unpredictability amid North Korea’s attempts to develop nuclear weapons. …</del></p><del> </del><p><del>The first appearance of the new narrative came out just days ago, when North Korea accused Jang, 67, of corruption, womanizing, gambling and taking drugs. It said he’d been eliminated from all his posts.

He was also a fixture at the new leader’s side as he toured the country.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>The KCNA report was unusually specific in its accusations. In particular, it criticized Jang for not rising and applauding his nephew’s appointment to a senior position because Jang “thought that if Kim Jong Un’s base and system for leading the army were consolidated, this would lay a stumbling block in the way of grabbing the power.” …</del></p><del> </del><p><del>Jang’s death could herald a “reign of terror,” including more purges, said Lim Eul Chul, a North Korea expert at South Korea’s Kyungnam University.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>Another question mark is how the purge will impact North Korea’s relationship with its only major ally, China.

However, Russia is a complete open book compared to the Hermit Kingdom.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>The latest development in the ongoing saga of North Korea is Kim Jong-Un’s threat to attack Guam. If he was capable of that (and he very well might be), would he actually do it?</del></p><del> </del><p><del>That sort of question is the domain of intelligence analysts and others who engage in psychological profiling. One public source of information on this is the <a href="http://personality-politics.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unit for the Study of Personality in Politics Link: http://personality-politics.org/ </a>, a research project directed by psychology professor Aubrey Immelman. The unit has a page dedicated to <a href="http://personality-politics.org/north-korea" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim Jong-Un Link: http://personality-politics.org/north-korea </a>, which has been updated sporadically as more information has become available.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>The team’s initial assessment, published in April 2013, was that Mr. Kim is a congenial-cooperative leader, displaying traits such as agreeableness, charm, and a need for external approval. The team concluded that Mr. Kim’s personality was inconsistent with North Korea’s continued belligerence, which made the profilers wonder if somebody else was actually running the country.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>This was a perfectly decent psychological profile, but it certainly seems to be wrong. In August 2012, a writer for Foreign Policy <a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2012/08/21/kim-jong-un-is-no-reformer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">warned Link: http://foreignpolicy.com/2012/08/21/kim-jong-un-is-no-reformer/ </a>, “The North Korean regime will not change because Little Kim studied in Switzerland, likes Mickey Mouse, and has a hot wife.” Indeed, North Korea’s aggression has only increased in the years since.</del></p><del> </del><p><del><strong>Kim Jong-Un: An Updated Psychological Profile</strong></del></p><del> </del><p><del>In April of this year [2017], Prof. Immelman’s team updated Mr. Kim’s profile with another detailed assessment. Once again, they found that the dictator’s personal psychological profile is rather benign and similar to that of recent U.S. presidents, specifically in areas such as aggressiveness and cooperativeness. In fact, the authors conclude that “at worst, [he has] only a moderate predisposition to aggressive behavior.” [Note: <a href="https://digitalcommons.csbsju.edu/psychology_pubs/119/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New update published April 2018 Link: https://digitalcommons.csbsju.edu/psychology_pubs/119/ </a>]</del></p><del> </del><p><del>This is difficult to believe, however, given that Mr. Kim murdered his half-brother, Kim Jong-Nam, with <a href="http://www.acsh.org/news/2017/02/23/vx-nerve-agent-killed-kim-jong-nam-how-does-it-work-10904" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VX nerve agent Link: http://www.acsh.org/news/2017/02/23/vx-nerve-agent-killed-kim-jong-nam-how-does-it-work-10904 </a> in February. But the profilers would likely warn us that it is very easy to conflate an individual leader’s psychological profile with the actions of the regime. It is possible, for instance, that Mr. Kim’s advisors told him to murder his half-brother, and he did so. Without access to classified information — which the authors do not have — trying to decipher the behavior of such an enigmatic figure is like reading tea leaves.</del></p><del> </del><p><del><strong>Would Kim Jong-Un Attack Guam?</strong></del></p><del> </del><p><del>What can a psychological profile tell us about whether Mr. Kim would attack Guam? Not much, it seems. Even if it is true that Mr. Kim is not personally aggressive, it has become clear that he has allowed his regime to behave that way.

But in the coming weeks, US officials and at least one key US ally will look to dampen that optimism.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will come bearing a list of concerns over Trump’s face-to-face with Kim when he arrives in the US next month to meet with the President, a person familiar with the Japanese efforts said. The meeting — which could occur at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida after he returns from a trip to South America — came at Abe’s insistence after learning that Trump had accepted an invitation to meet with Kim. …</del></p><del> </del><p><del>Just this month — days before Trump quickly accepted North Korea’s invitation to meet — senior administration officials told reporters the US would not hold direct talks until North Korea takes “concrete steps” toward denuclearization. That condition has since been discarded, but now those officials are working to ensure Trump does not walk into his meeting with Kim with unduly high expectations.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>“I wouldn’t say optimism is called for right now. I would be very cautious because … what North Korea expects out of this summit and what the US expect may not be potentially aligned,” said Sue Mi Terry, a former CIA analyst and North Korea expert. “Optimism is the last word I would use for this.” …</del></p><del> </del><p><del>The planning for a summit has included Mike Pompeo, the director of the CIA whom Trump has tapped to become secretary of state. …</del></p><del> </del><p><del>As the White House works to secure his confirmation, Pompeo and a team at the CIA have been working through intelligence backchannels to make preparations for the Kim talks. Meanwhile, officials at the State Department — led by Marc Knapper, the chargé d’affaires in Seoul, and Susan Thornton, the assistant secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific affairs — have been working separately to prepare for the summit. …</del></p><del> </del><p><del>The efforts have fed into a working group convened by the National Security Council’s top Asia hand, Matthew Pottinger. …</del></p><del> </del><p><del>US officials say the talks will most likely take place in late May — or perhaps even June — should they occur. …</del></p><del> </del><p><del>The White House has declined to say whether official contact has yet been established between North Korea and Washington, which would allow US officials to confirm whether Kim had indeed vowed to halt missile and nuclear testing ahead of talks. In the absence of that confirmation, Trump and his aides have relied partly on the characterizations of the South Koreans, who came bearing the invitation earlier this month, and the Chinese, who provided a briefing to the White House on Tuesday after Kim and President Xi Jinping met in Beijing.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>According to Chinese state media, Kim told Xi he was open to summit talks with Trump. But the North Koreans have not themselves confirmed Kim’s intent to meet with Trump.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>“If South Korea and the United States respond with good will to our efforts and create an atmosphere of peace and stability, and take phased, synchronized measures to achieve peace, the issue of the denuclearization of the peninsula can reach resolution,” Kim said, according to Xinhua. …</del></p><del> </del><p><del>Senior administration officials spent Wednesday trying to decipher North Korean intentions following Kim’s meeting with Xi. Some officials noted the optics — including body language and rhetoric — from both the North Koreans and the Chinese was hardly warm and fuzzy, determining the meeting appeared like it was for show.</del></p><del> </del><p><del>China’s ambassador in Washington, Cui Tiankai, traveled to the White House on Tuesday afternoon to brief officials, confirming that it was indeed Kim who had paid a visit to President Xi Jinping.

But SpaceX predates it.\u003c/p>\u003cp>At 30, Musk was already wildly rich from selling his internet financial company PayPal and its predecessor Zip2. He arranged a series of lunches in Silicon Valley in 2001 with G. Scott Hubbard, who had been NASA’s Mars czar and was then running the agency’s Ames Research Center. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Musk wanted to somehow grow a rose on the red planet, show it to the world and inspire school children, recalls Hubbard. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“His real focus was having life on Mars,” says Hubbard, a Stanford University professor who now chairs SpaceX’s crew safety advisory panel. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The big problem, Hubbard told him, was building a rocket affordable enough to go to Mars. Less than a year later Space Exploration Technologies, called SpaceX, was born.\u003c/p>\u003cp>There are many space companies and like all of them, SpaceX is designed for profit. But what’s different is that behind that profit motive is a goal, which is simply to “Get Elon to Mars,” McDowell says. “By having that longer-term vision, that’s pushed them to be more ambitious and really changed things.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Everyone at SpaceX, from senior vice presidents to the barista who offers its in-house cappuccinos and FroYo, “will tell you they are working to make humans multi-planetary,” says former SpaceX Director of Space Operations Garrett Reisman, an ex-astronaut now at the University of Southern California. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Musk founded the company just before NASA ramped up the notion of commercial space.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Traditionally, private firms built things or provided services for NASA, which remained the boss and owned the equipment. The idea of bigger roles for private companies has been around for more than 50 years, but the market and technology weren’t yet right.\u003c/p>\u003cp>NASA’s two deadly space shuttle accidents -- Challenger in 1986 and Columbia in 2003 -- were pivotal, says W. Henry Lambright, a professor of public policy at Syracuse University. \u003c/p>\u003cp>When Columbia disintegrated, NASA had to contemplate a post-space shuttle world. That’s where private companies came in, Lambright says.\u003c/p>\u003cp>After Columbia, the agency focused on returning astronauts to the moon, but still had to get cargo and astronauts to the space station, says Sean O’Keefe, who was NASA’s administrator at the time. A 2005 pilot project helped private companies develop ships to bring cargo to the station.\u003c/p>\u003cp>SpaceX got some of that initial funding. The company’s first three launches failed. The company could have just as easily failed too, but NASA stuck by SpaceX and it started to pay off, Lambright says. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“You can’t explain SpaceX without really understanding how NASA really kind of nurtured it in the early days,” Lambright says. “In a way, SpaceX is kind of a child of NASA.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Since 2010, NASA has spent $6 billion to help private companies get people into orbit, with SpaceX and Boeing the biggest recipients, says Phil McAlister, NASA’s commercial spaceflight director.\u003c/p>\u003cp>NASA plans to spend another $2.5 billion to purchase 48 astronaut seats to the space station in 12 different flights, he says. At a little more than $50 million a ride, it’s much cheaper than what NASA has paid Russia for flights to the station.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Starting from scratch has given SpaceX an advantage over older firms and NASA that are stuck using legacy technology and infrastructure, O’Keefe says. \u003c/p>\u003cp>And SpaceX tries to build everything itself, giving the firm more control, Reisman says. The company saves money by reusing rockets, and it has customers aside from NASA.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The California company now has 6,000 employees. Its workers are young, highly caffeinated and put in 60- to 90-hour weeks, Hubbard and Reisman say. They also embrace risk more than their NASA counterparts.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Decisions that can take a year at NASA can be made in one or two meetings at SpaceX, says Reisman, who still advises the firm.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In 2010, a Falcon 9 rocket on the launch pad had a cracked nozzle extension on an engine. Normally that would mean rolling the rocket off the pad and a fix that would delay launch more than a month. \u003c/p>\u003cp>But with NASA’s permission, SpaceX engineer Florence Li was hoisted into the rocket nozzle with a crane and harness. Then, using what were essentially garden shears, she “cut the thing, we launched the next day and it worked,” Reisman says.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Musk is SpaceX’s public and unconventional face -- smoking marijuana on a popular podcast, feuding with local officials about opening his Tesla plant during the pandemic, naming his newborn child “X Æ A-12.” But insiders say aerospace industry veteran Gwynne Shotwell, the president and chief operating officer, is also key to the company’s success.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The SpaceX way is actually a combination of Musk’s imagination and creativity and drive and Shotwell’s sound management and responsible engineering,” McDowell says. \u003c/p>\u003cp>But it all comes back to Musk’s dream. Former NASA chief O’Keefe says Musk has his eccentricities, huge doses of self-confidence and persistence, and that last part is key: “You have the capacity to get through a setback and look ... toward where you’re trying to go.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>For Musk, it’s Mars.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Follow Seth Borenstein on Twitter: \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/borenbears\">@borenbears\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

The Democratic governor said in a statement Friday that Nevada has continued to see decreasing cases of the coronavirus and hospitalizations of COVID-19 when some restrictions began to be eased nearly two weeks ago.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Sisolak’s office said he plans to hold a news conference on Tuesday to offer more details about the next phase of reopening, assuming those positive trends continue through the Memorial Day weekend. Nevada’s gambling regulators also plan to meet Tuesday and will consider reopening plans submitted from casinos, which need to be approved at least seven days before reopening.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We all know what we’ve gone through for the last 10 weeks. No one’s having fun,” said Bill Hornbuckle, acting chief executive and president of casino giant MGM Resorts International. “The simple idea that I could get out, come to a resort, lay at a pool, enjoy a nice dinner, sit at a blackjack table. There’s something to be said for all of that.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Many properties have aimed for an early June restart in the gambling mecca closed almost overnight in the middle of a hot streak — three consecutive $1 billion months in statewide casino winnings. The city had been drawing more than 40 million annual visitors. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Once given the green light, the marquees and the managers will welcome people back to this 24/7 town built for crowds, excitement and excess. But not every resort amenity will be open. Nightclubs, dayclubs, buffets and large venues will remain closed. Cirque du Soleil shows will stay dark, at least for now.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Signs everywhere will remind guests of new rules: Wash your hands; keep distance from others; limit your elevator ride to your sanitized room to just four people.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“You’re going to see a lot of social distancing,\" said Sean McBurney, general manager at Caesars Palace. “If there’s crowding, it’s every employee’s responsibility to ensure there’s social distancing.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Dice will be disinfected between shooters, chips cleaned periodically and card decks changed frequently. At some resorts guests will be encouraged to use cellphones for touchless check in, as room keys, and to read restaurant menus.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Wynn Resorts properties and The Venetian, owned by Las Vegas Sands, plan to use thermal imaging cameras at every entrance to intercept people with fevers. Smaller operators in Las Vegas and Reno will offer hand-sanitizer.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“A gondola pilot wearing a face mask will be on board to steer the vessel,\" a Venetian protocol says. “Gondoliers stationed along the canal will serenade passengers from an appropriate distance.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>New state Gaming Control Board regulations require surfaces to be disinfected according to federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines and “increased attention” to high-touch hotel items like television remote controls and light switches.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Guests will get free masks at large resorts, but won’t be forced to use them. For blackjack dealers, bellhops, reservation clerks, security guards, housekeepers and waiters, masks are mandatory.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“That’s the most visual thing. Every employee will be required to wear a mask,” McBurney said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>His footsteps echoed walking with a reporter past marble statues in the lobby toward a gilded casino vacant for the first time since it opened in 1966. A slot machine cried “Wheel of Fortune!” in the void. Seats on both sides of the game had been removed.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Visually, you’ll still see a lot of color and activity, but you won’t be able to play every machine,” McBurney said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>At the neighboring Bellagio, Hornbuckle showed new hand-washing stations installed where banks of slot machines were removed. His company is losing almost $10 million a day during the shutdown, he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Other rules: four players only at roulette, six at craps. Plastic partitions will separate dealers from players and players from each other at the Bellagio, three at each table.\u003c/p>\u003cp>MGM Resorts plans to open just two of its 10 Strip properties at first: Bellagio and New York-New York.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Hornbuckle promised Bellagio’s iconic dancing fountains will restart as soon as the governor sets a date. Still, just 1,200 of the hotel’s 4,000 rooms will be rented and casinos will be limited to 50% of capacity.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“You’re going to see less people, by control and by design,” he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Caesars Entertainment plans to open Caesars Palace and the Flamingo Las Vegas at first, followed later by Harrah’s Las Vegas and the casino floor at the LINQ hotel-casino.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Lang called it unlikely that big crowds will return quickly, and said resort operators with deep pockets “will probably allow a bargain moment” until business improves. “First will be residents of Las Vegas. Then people getting here by car from California. Then domestic air flights. Then international,” the researcher predicted. \u003c/p>\u003cp>McBurney said that with nearly 4,000 rooms at Caesars Palace, he expected just one of six towers will be occupied. “Once people know there’s an opening date ... demand will increase,” he said. “How much? I can’t speculate.”\u003c/p>","description":null,"pullQuoteObjs":[],"embedCaption":null,"sequenceNumber":null,"title":"US--Virus Outbreak-Vegas Casinos","headline":"Disinfected dice: Las Vegas casinos getting ready to roll","localMemberName":null,"dateline":null,"old_lead_video_key":null,"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:a115ed1e561b5d0e9721dfabfca3ce55","truncatedFirstWords":true,"etag":"a115ed1e561b5d0e9721dfabfca3ce55_2a1aza0c0","notificationId":null,"version":null,"videoContext":"approved at least seven days before reopening.\u003c/p>","latestEtag":null,"embedLinkURL":null,"bylines":"By KEN RITTER","revision":null,"mediumIds":["ef96beb8ca514adeaad0c12e3d4a9851","47a7a21844e94648bb785e33ef4eec9f","8d04f114e2f549eea902566d68cd9447","f68e113a5b7440cebe82b70d62db0814","5254d5b201f84a86bf07081cb2c0b265","5017b842754d428ea92ee487564de142","1458b8e52d98454586568b5f135f62fb","bd154d54695c4cbf83413219a6d2ec71","3c9827eca9804c8a8e915a45c6e2f6d0","f84bec83658641cea071aff437af18c0"],"media":[{"altText":null,"embedCaption":null,"imageFileExtension":".jpeg","title":null,"videoMimeType":null,"gcsBaseUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/ef96beb8ca514adeaad0c12e3d4a9851/","state":null,"flattenedCaption":"Chairs are removed to keep social distancing between players as a coronavirus safety precaution at an electronic gaming machine in the closed Bellagio hotel and casino, Wednesday, May 20, 2020, in Las Vegas.

Less than a year later, Reade said, she was again the victim of abuse, \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/d922da60baa91121f4529fe51a0fd55a\">assaulted by Biden\u003c/a> in the hallway of a Senate office building — an allegation \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/de6b2131cb75e1e61b5d35d15f9f957e\">he vehemently denies\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>That accusation, which Reade made publicly for the first time in March, has revived difficult questions about how to evaluate allegations of assault in the era of #MeToo. It also has thrust Reade’s life story into the 2020 presidential race and, with it, scrutiny of a woman with a winding trail of extreme debt, an unfounded claim of educational attainment and questionable business practices. Along the way, some people who dealt with her found her duplicitous and deceitful, while others found her a heroic survivor.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"related-story-embed\" id=\"e9282cc0-91f0-11ea-fb7c-b3fa9b586e51\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>On Friday, her attorney, Douglas Wigdor, announced he was dropping her as a client. And officials confirmed media reports that she faced an inquiry about whether she was truthful when she testified about her credentials as an expert witness in domestic violence cases, an issue that could serve as grounds for appeal of a number of convictions she had a role in securing.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Reade’s story about the alleged assault by Biden is not a straight line, either. It has changed over the past year, from accusations of uncomfortable, harassing behavior to allegations of assault. Reade came forward publicly with her most serious accusation just as Biden was securing a path to the Democratic presidential nomination.\u003c/p>\u003cp>It is often not possible to conclusively resolve an allegation like the one Reade has made, where there are no witnesses and no timely police report.\u003c/p>\u003cp>So how her claim is evaluated turns largely on her credibility.\u003c/p>\u003cp>By some accounts, Reade is a bright and engaging woman who has tried her best as a single mother to raise her daughter while constantly looking for a fresh start. In others, Reade uses her charm and flair for drama to manipulate those supporting her until their goodwill runs out.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Reade says her critics have her wrong.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I’m not a lying, manipulative user,” she said in a Wednesday interview with The Associated Press. “I’ve really understood what it’s like to be struggling and poor. I’ve really tried to help people when I could.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>This account of Reade’s life is based on interviews with more than a dozen of her friends, relatives and personal and professional associates, as well as numerous interviews with Reade. The AP also reviewed hundreds of pages of court documents, emails and Reade’s own writings.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"hub-link-embed\" id=\"afs:Content:8962620257\">Full Coverage: Politics\u003c/div>\u003cp>CHILDHOOD OF DREAMS, DISAPPOINTMENT\u003c/p>\u003cp>Reade was born Tara Moulton in the coastal town of Monterey, California, and says she spent most of her childhood living on a farm in northern Wisconsin. Her father, Robert Reade Moulton, worked as a sportswriter for the Wausau Daily Herald in the 1960s before taking a public relations job with a defense contractor in Minnesota; Reade said her mother, Jeanette Altimus, was an artist.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Reade has written that she was an accomplished skier who qualified for the Junior Olympics team in downhill skiing at age 12 in Wisconsin and trained for three years before her parents’ divorce prompted a move to Athens, Georgia.\u003c/p>\u003cp>A stepbrother said most people in Wausau skied, mainly at nearby Rib Mountain, but he does not remember Reade being a standout.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I’m sure Tara did, but I don’t really remember her getting some significant accolades for her performance,” said Scott Thoma, 56, of Mound, Minnesota, who was a year ahead of Reade in middle school, when his mother married her father.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Reade and her brother Collin lived with her mother after her parents' split, eventually moving to Georgia, while Moulton and his new wife moved to the Minneapolis area.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Another of Reade’s aspirations was to be an actress, performing in “school theatre, community and regional theatre, sprinkled with some radio and television commercials,” according to her blog. She set out for California to pursue acting at age 17 and said she got a referral from a friend to informally train with Robert Reed, an actor best known for his role as the “Brady Bunch” father. She also said she scored an audition in New York for The Juilliard School’s exclusive acting program.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Reade said she learned at the audition that no scholarships were available and returned home brokenhearted when her father said he wouldn’t pay the tuition. The school declined to confirm whether Reade was selected for an audition.\u003c/p>\u003cp>She wrote in January that her father, who died in 2016, was physically and emotionally abusive throughout her childhood.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Thwarting my college dreams was the mild bit, the rejection and the physical assaults set the stage for how I would walk into the world,” she wrote.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Reade often discussed the issue with her former husband, Ted Dronen, according to Dronen’s account in the couple’s divorce filings.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“She referenced a long history of events dating back to her first memories in which her father would physically and emotionally, and mentally abuse her. She stated also that her mother seemed not to interfere with petitioner’s father’s abuse,” he wrote.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Thoma described Reade’s parents as alcoholics but said he never saw Moulton become angry when he drank, or emotionally or physically abuse Reade or anyone else.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“He got frustrated at her,” said Thoma, adding that Reade started more things than she finished. “He would have to put the kibosh on whatever she wanted. But no, I never saw Bob lay a hand on any of us kids, or Collin and Tara.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Dronen, in the court documents, described Reade as also having a sometimes tumultuous relationship with her mother, who he said kicked her out of her house during a fall 1994 argument while Reade was in the late stages of a pregnancy.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Reade has said her mother, who also died in 2016, was one of the few people she confided in about Biden’s alleged assault.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Early abuse can inform a victim’s relationships for the rest of his or her life, according to Barbara Ziv, a forensic psychologist and sexual assault expert.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“If you grow up in an abusive household, where your needs, your basic needs aren’t met and you aren’t taught to appropriately identify boundaries or emotions, then that’s going to impact the way that you develop as an adult,” Ziv said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>AN EYE TOWARD POLITICS \u003c/p>\u003cp>There’s little public accounting of the next few years of Reade’s life, after she says her Juilliard dreams were dashed. \u003c/p>\u003cp>She eventually attended Pasadena City College, where she says her strong performance in a political science class helped her land an internship in Washington with then-California Rep. Leon Panetta.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Reade said in the 2019 interview that she then worked as a field manager for Santa Barbara County Supervisor Gloria Ochoa in her campaign against Rep. Michael Huffington, the former husband of Arianna Huffington. A few days after Ochoa’s loss, Reade said, she got a call to interview for a job with Biden — which she described as a dream job. It was unclear how that interview came about.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I just always wanted to work for Biden. Because at the time, he was the champion of women’s legislation, women’s rights legislation,” she told the AP.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Reade said she traveled to Washington and was interviewed by Biden’s executive assistant, Marianne Baker. During their conversation, she said, Biden walked in and was introduced to the young job prospect.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“He kind of smiled and said, ‘Hire her,’” Reade said. “That was it.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>WORKING FOR BIDEN\u003c/p>\u003cp>Once she was in Washington, multiple friends described Reade as a young woman coming into her own. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Stacey Lentz, a friend at the time who worked in North Dakota Sen. Kent Conrad’s office, said the two would get together for lunch on Capitol Hill, and on days off, they’d peruse antique shops or enjoy a ballgame.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Another close friend of Reade’s, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect her family’s privacy, described her as a laid-back Californian in contrast to her own East Coast conservative upbringing. All three lived in Thompson Markward Hall, a women’s dormitory across the street from the Hart Senate Office Building.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Over the years, Reade spoke favorably about working for Biden.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Margie Estberg, of Aptos, California, said she got to know Reade after hiring her in late 2017 to pet sit. Over a pizza dinner and cocktails in 2018, Estberg said she asked Reade what Biden was like — and whether Biden was one of the “bad guys.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I said, ‘Is he a nice guy?’ And she said, ‘Yeah, he is,’” Estberg recently recalled. “I said, ’Oh, good. Because I hate to see somebody who you think is a decent person and somebody shuts them down and says, ‘No, they aren’t.’”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Reade said she didn’t share details of the alleged assault with Estberg because she wasn’t ready to discuss it.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But Reade’s friend, the one who spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity, said Reade told her a much different story about Biden in 1993. That’s when Reade says she was asked to deliver a gym bag to Biden in a Senate office building; when she met him, she says, he kissed her and digitally penetrated her.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The friend said Reade called her a few nights after the assault allegedly occurred, and the friend described in vivid detail feeling “so physically sick” at the disclosure that she ran to the bathroom and threw up in the middle of their conversation. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Reade recommended that the AP interview the friend, and reporters spoke to her multiple times, beginning in 2019. Initially, the friend confirmed Reade’s original, limited account of harassment by Biden. When Reade added assault to her allegation in March of this year, this friend also added those details to her own recollection.\u003c/p>\u003cp>This friend says she counseled Reade not to file a police report, and now expresses deep regret for what she characterized as leading Reade astray in dealing with the situation.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Reade left Washington shortly after the alleged assault. She says she tried to complain about harassment by Biden — but not assault — to a Senate personnel office and the senator’s top advisers, but felt retaliated against and ultimately said she was encouraged to find another job and quit.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The AP spoke with numerous current and former Biden staffers in the course of reporting on Reade’s claims, and none recalled such an incident or a report. Some of Biden’s top aides said they didn’t recall Reade at all.\u003c/p>\u003cp>MARRIAGE, DIVORCE, ABUSE\u003c/p>\u003cp>During her time in Washington, Reade met Ted Dronen, whom she describes in a 2009 essay as “a smiling 6’4” blonde Nordic-looking man” who playfully shot her with a water gun at a party one spring night in 1993. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Facing financial difficulties after leaving Biden’s office, Reade moved in with Dronen and ultimately asked to follow him to North Dakota, where he was working on a campaign that winter, according to his account in court records.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In her divorce filing, Reade described early warning signs that Dronen was explosive and unstable and says she fled North Dakota for California after Dronen became upset that she was pregnant. She soon came back to him, however, and they married in July 1994 and had a daughter that November.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In a domestic violence case filed 15 months later, Dronen admits that he attacked Reade but alleges that Reade got violent with him as well.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I admit that on February 21, 1996 my wife and I were involved in a heated argument and during that argument that I may have acted out in an inappropriate manner. During our marriage my wife and I had arguments. She has on past occasions struck me; specifically, in the face. That fact, however, does not excuse my conduct on the date in question,” he states.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Dronen did not respond to several requests for comment. \u003c/p>\u003cp>In court documents, he suggested that Reade conflated childhood traumas with her recollections of abuse by him.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I believe these incidences, in addition to the abuse, harassment and other truamatic (sic) events in Petitioner’s life, color Petitioner’s perception and judgment in the instant case and I believe them to be the underlying psychological reasons that Petitioner is making me out to be some sort of monster,” he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>During their divorce proceedings, Dronen also told the court that Reade said she was harassed while working in Biden’s office, but made no mention of assault, a detail that was first reported by the San Luis Obispo Tribune. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“On several occasions petitioner related a problem that she was having at work regarding sexual harassment in U.S. Senator Joe Biden’s office,” he wrote. Reade “eventually struck a deal” with Biden’s chief of staff and left the office, and Dronen supported her financially as she looked for work.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Biden’s former chief of staff, Ted Kaufman, has consistently said no such deal was made.\u003c/p>\u003cp>TURBULENT TIMES\u003c/p>\u003cp>The past two decades of Reade’s life have been tumultuous. In her own telling, she had to flee Dronen’s abuse, took shelter in domestic violence safe houses and moved to Washington state, where she changed her name to Alexandra Tara McCabe. She also said she received a new Social Security number to protect her safety, putting her in a “really vulnerable economic situation.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>She said the focus on her financial difficulties since coming forward with her allegation against Biden was “classist” and should have no bearing on the credibility of her accusation.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“How high does your credit score have to be to be believed as a victim of sexual assault?” Reade asked.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Reade’s resume states that she graduated from Antioch University with a bachelor’s degree in political science and later worked at the school’s Seattle campus as an “Ongoing Online Visiting Professor for degree completion.” But school officials said she did not graduate and was never a faculty member, though she was paid to do several hours of administrative work as an independent contractor, a detail first reported by CNN. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Reade disputed this, but could not produce evidence that she graduated. She says the number of school credits that could be applied to her graduation was complicated by her name and social security number change, and that the school's president at the time stepped in to personally confer a degree. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The school said that no such arrangement was made. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“University officials confirmed with former president Toni Murdock that no special arrangements existed,” university spokeswoman Karen Hamilton said in a statement. \u003c/p>\u003cp>She was accepted to Seattle University Law School through an alternative admissions program and obtained a law degree in 2004, but struggled to keep a job. She was helped by sympathetic strangers drawn to her story of escaping abuse, but often failed to meet financial obligations and was perpetually in debt and frequently entangled in legal battles.\u003c/p>\u003cp>By May 2006, she was back in California, working as a victims’ advocate for the Monterey County YWCA. \u003c/p>\u003cp>There, Reade lodged a series of complaints with the chapter’s board within months of taking the job, alleging that she and others were harassed and discriminated against by managers, which formed the basis of a 2007 lawsuit.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Reade and three co-workers alleged that two managers, who were both black, potentially misspent funds and favored African American employees who were members of their church. One supervisor, the lawsuit alleged, made racist comments. Meanwhile, Reade and her three co-workers, all of whom were white, said they were denied benefits and promotions.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I find your response to my recent complaint unacceptable. Therefore, I am taking the next step to get some resolution,” Reade wrote in a Nov. 9, 2006, memo to her boss.\u003c/p>\u003cp>She was also upset because someone called her “whitebread,” according to the memo, which was circulated to the board.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Bridgette Allen, the former YWCA chapter president, was among those sued. She said she viewed Reade’s persistent emails as an effort to build a court case.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I was the first black board president in the history here. You have to look at the dynamics: It was four white women that accused three black women,” Allen said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But to some of Reade’s co-workers, she was a hero empowered by a difficult past. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“She was such a great example of what I wanted to be as a mom and a woman and an advocate,” said Diane Wegner, a former YWCA employee who was part of the lawsuit, which was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Reade soon found a new job as executive director at the Animal Friends Rescue Project in Pacific Grove.\u003c/p>\u003cp>She also needed a new place to live and, in 2008, turned to Austin Chung, an inexperienced property manager, and inquired about a cottage he was renting out that offered a glimpse of the waves at nearby Monterey Bay. \u003c/p>\u003cp>She told him she was fleeing abuse and had no credit history, explaining her change of name and Social Security number. But she did have a law degree and a job, she told him.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“My heart went out to her right away,” Chung said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Chung said he had the interior painted and installed new flooring to make the home welcoming. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Within five months, she was behind on rent. Pretty soon, she was out of a job, too, after her management style grated on some employees and supporters of the animal shelter, according to former board members. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“There wasn’t any one big thing that happened. It was just, over time, her not really being competent,” said Carie Broecker, a longtime former board member. Broecker said she remained friends with Reade until Reade recently threatened to sue her because she publicly discussed her tenure at the agency.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Reade said she was proud of her work for the animal shelter.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Chung moved to evict Reade after she fell $3,600 behind on rent; Reade accused him of harassment in an email.\u003c/p>\u003cp>She eventually left behind a house in need of $8,000 in repairs that included carpets so stained by animal waste that they needed to be replaced, according to Chung, who provided emails and video footage of the home’s interior.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In 2011, Reade was again in a relationship that turned violent. Neighbors called Santa Cruz police to her home, and her live-in boyfriend, Edward Walker, was charged with corporal injury and battery against Reade and her daughter. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“Male subject battered live-in girlfriend, causing visible injury. During the altercation, the suspect also battered the victims daughter,” police said in an April 3, 2011 report. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Reade, who had spent years testifying in court as an advocate for domestic violence victims, acknowledged that Walker slapped her daughter at one point. She paid his bail and continued to live with Walker, caring for him after he suffered a stroke in 2012, court records show. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Walker, who could not be reached for comment, pleaded guilty and was given probation. A judge dismissed the charges in 2016. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Financial and legal turmoil followed her as she continued to move around California’s central coast, living in some of the most scenic and affluent parts of the state:\u003c/p>\u003cp>— She sought a restraining order in 2012 against a neighbor whom she accused of harassment and making racist threats against Walker. A judge dismissed the petition, and Reade dropped the matter.\u003c/p>\u003cp>— Months later, Reade was evicted again over $12,750 in unpaid rent. She filed for bankruptcy and listed $406,407 in debts, including nearly $300,000 in unpaid school loans, $1,715 owed to a bail bondsman and $2,100 due to a locally owned grocery store.\u003c/p>\u003cp>— Reade enrolled in an advanced legal degree program through Southwestern Law School. The school sued Reade in 2016 over $22,000 in loans, which remain unpaid, according to an attorney working on the case.\u003c/p>\u003cp>— She launched a charity that aimed to provide pet food to impoverished animal owners. The group's nonprofit status was revoked in 2017 after Reade failed to submit three years of mandatory tax filings, though she continued to solicit donations. In 2016, Reade tweeted that she was raising money for a nonprofit called Boudicca Rising Legal Assistance, which included a link to a GoFundMe page she created. There is no record of a nonprofit by that name in the IRS database. Reade raised $210 but said she eventually abandoned the effort because it was too difficult to sort out the logistics.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In 2014, Reade started volunteering at a Watsonville, California, nonprofit horse farm called the Pregnant Mare Rescue. She proved to be a dedicated volunteer who excelled at caring for abused horses, but “always had drama and craziness going on in her life,” according to Lynn Hummer, the organization’s founder.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“She was always broke and in a crisis,” Hummer said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The two had a falling out in 2016 after Reade charged $1,400 in veterinary care for her horse to the Pregnant Mare Rescue, billing records show. \u003c/p>\u003cp>In a June 8, 2016, email to Hummer, Reade acknowledged that she charged the bill to the organization but said that she was poor, that her mother’s health was failing and that she was “disgusted and appalled” that Hummer would “villainize” her poverty. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Reade said that she planned on paying back the money but decided against it after Hummer “started trashing me” on social media.\u003c/p>\u003cp>At the time, Reade had been asking for money to finance a cross-country move to take care of her mother. She also told acquaintances that Dronen, her ex-husband, had reappeared and was harassing her. \u003c/p>\u003cp>According to a letter from a domestic violence advocacy group that Reade shared, Dronen sent her and her daughter “friend requests” via Facebook after 15 years without contact, and the two were scared for their safety. She also inquired about changing her legal name back to Tara Reade, which she goes by now. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Eventually, a man in Seattle raised $3,500 for her through GoFundMe.\u003c/p>\u003cp>FALLOUT\u003c/p>\u003cp>Reade says her decision to go public with her claims against Biden has brought her more hardship. She describes facing death threats online and feeling abused and abandoned by the Democratic Party, which she says she’s supported her whole life. \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/a32dccced51f654815d5ee61c96b5ccb\">Numerous prominent Democrats\u003c/a> have said they believe Biden’s denials.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Inconsistencies in her accounts have also complicated matters. Defense attorneys are now reviewing whether she may have testified falsely about her education credentials in multiple domestic violence cases, the Monterey County Weekly and The New York Times first reported. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Still, Reade, a woman who’s spent her life trying to regain her footing in the face of myriad setbacks, said her decision to come forward has been empowering. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“It’s made my life so difficult in so many ways, but I’m doing this for more of an existential reason, and also for my own justice,” she said. When she first spoke out about the sexual assault allegation, Reade said, “I felt this release, of this burden, this secret that I’ve kept.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Jaffe and Slodysko reported from Washington; Dale reported from Philadelphia.

He listened to audiobooks constantly and closely followed the news. He devoured history and was quick with facts on U.S. presidents. He was humble. He won a Bronze Star, but his family only found out how decorated a soldier he was when he was gone. He was a longtime U.S. Postal Service employee who rose to become a town postmaster. He was sharp as a tack and liked to deem things “snazzy” or “classy.” On his last night, the nurses gave him chocolate ice cream and showed him photos of some young relatives.

But there were so many joys, too: The miles she drove in her Jeep or flew in the air to reach new places as a travel nurse, the rank of captain she achieved, the thrill of meeting Barry Manilow, the musician she loved. Her sister Tammy Petrowicz remembers a woman overflowing with energy “like the Energizer Bunny,” who was 16 years older but “still could run circles around me.” The Air Force veteran loved meeting new people wherever she went. Petrowicz recalls standing in a grocery store line with her, chit-chatting with strangers like they were old friends. “She talked to anybody and everybody,” her sister says.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"1bebb1ac605d4aee990da0bda02fb735\">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class=\"audio-embed\" id=\"afs:Medium:8975830254\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>James Sullivan, 99, grew up with nothing and appreciated everything, a consummate gentleman who found joy in the small things — the Red Sox on TV, a cold Bud Light in his hand, a fresh tomato out of the garden. Sullivan was an artillery technician in the Army during World War II who won the Bronze Star. He had a mischievous side, as evidenced by the time his father told him he couldn’t play ball because he had to paint the garage. He obliged, painting it top to bottom, windowpanes and all. He was a liquor store clerk, a school custodian and a city councilman, a man who always beamed with a smile right up to the end of his life. He died four days shy of his 100th birthday. Quiet, unselfish, inquisitive about others. “How you doing, pal?” he’d ask.

Along the way, his life was littered with good deeds — the troubled teenager he’d take in, the hungry family he’d help with groceries — done with little notice or unmentioned altogether. “He didn’t tell people things like that,” his daughter Susan Kenney says. She remembers a father always teaching her something new and always trying to make people laugh, something his wife, Alice Lowell, says his colleagues appreciated. “It wasn’t like going to work,” she says of the man she knew since she was a child. “It was going to play with Chuck.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"08933703c58944fe99821f9afe3b684b\">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class=\"audio-embed\" id=\"afs:Medium:8966800115\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Stephen Kulig, 92, always had a smile on his face and hard candies in his pocket. The list of roles he played was long: veteran of World War II and Korea, devoted Boston sports fan, bingo caller, school dance chaperone, altar server, soup kitchen volunteer, Knights of Columbus member. His daughter Elizabeth DeForest remembers a man who was a natural caregiver — for his wife of 63 years, for his five children and for his parents and in-laws. “I use the word fierce to describe him,” DeForest says. “He was really fiercely proud of his family. He was fierce in the way that he practiced faith and he taught it to our family and to all of us. Just fierce in the way he loved and protected the people that mattered to him.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"b276a88475294aadb88572dc5c68f2e5\">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class=\"audio-embed\" id=\"afs:Medium:8991850026\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Chester LaPlante, 78, had a knack for improving things wherever he went.

His son Randy LaPlante remembered his father giving him “bear rides” around the living room, rubbing his beard against his little face and buying him a go-kart. Later, the elder LaPlante took his son under his wing and taught him about being a machinist, a career he holds to this day. “I don’t know where I would be without him,” LaPlante says. \u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"66fcd820e96044fc97ee77c6586b0d1f\">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class=\"audio-embed\" id=\"afs:Medium:8951570632\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Harry Malandrinos, 89, was a quiet man, but had many stories to tell: of fighting a war in Korea, of touring the U.S. as a band’s drummer, of four decades as a public school teacher. “When he spoke, you listened, because he didn’t waste his words,” his daughter-in-law Cheryl Malandrinos says. He always had a joke, was a master woodworker, avidly rooted for the Patriots, Red Sox and Bruins and would happily settle for “Family Feud” if his teams weren’t on TV. Every now and again, his son Paul Malandrinos would run into a former student of his father’s who would sing his praises. “He was pretty much the working class guy that represents so many of us,” his daughter-in-law says.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"0b3da69f27f74ce78ccfbab68d945731\">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class=\"audio-embed\" id=\"afs:Medium:8980410016\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Francis Foley, 84, never learned to read music but could play any song by ear.

His daughter Robin Benson Wilson calls them “comfort sounds” that signaled “the world is good.” He was a towering 6-foot-4. He made friends easily and often, always finding a familiar face wherever he went. He was a mechanic in the Korean War and it seemed like he could fix anything. With old age, his ability to whistle faded. But during a Christmastime visit by Benson Wilson to the Soldiers’ Home, her father managed to pucker his lips and offer a bit of that familiar tune one last time.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"1385d6c64d994cdab95ae4db4f305998\">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class=\"audio-embed\" id=\"afs:Medium:8949790068\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Emilio DiPalma, 93, had gone off to war as a happy-go-lucky kid, but it didn’t take long for his Hollywood visions of battle to dissolve into the reality of watching friends die. After the Germans were defeated, DiPalma was sent to Nuremberg, where he made copies of documents detailing war crimes, watched over Nazis in their prison cells and stood guard beside the witness box in the courtroom where the evils of genocide were detailed. One time, he filled the glass of one of the most powerful Nazis — Hermann Goring — with toilet water. Back home in the U.S., he lived a life of humility, rarely talking about his service. “He did all of this in World War II and we hardly knew about it,” says his daughter Emily Aho. \u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"746f13b86f7a490caf359f37be26b31f\">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class=\"audio-embed\" id=\"afs:Medium:8978210134\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>James Mandeville, 83, had a playfulness to him that never seemed to fade.

He’d play cards with his daughter Laurie Mandeville Beaudette and, if she left the table, she’d return to find the deck had been stacked. She took to calling him “Cheater Beater.” He found joy in babies and dogs and for all his fun-lovingness, he imparted something deep in those who were close to him. “He always made me feel like I was the most important person in the world,” she says. “We were best friends.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"e12cec7ae0364d24bcbbbec8f58a4597\">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class=\"audio-embed\" id=\"afs:Medium:8970210347\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Samuel Melendez, 86, would clam up and appear sad when someone would ask about his time in Korea.

He loved the island of his heritage, Puerto Rico. He loved dominoes and family gatherings and would jump on a plane whenever someone needed him. When he became less independent, he went to live with his niece Janet Ramirez and when he needed more help, he moved to the Soldiers’ Home, where she is a nurse’s aide. She lost her own father when she was young and as her uncle grew sicker, Ramirez slipped away to his room to hold his hand or to play Spanish music on her phone and put it to his hear. “I felt like he was my dad,” she says. \u003c/p>","description":null,"pullQuoteObjs":[],"embedCaption":null,"sequenceNumber":null,"title":"US--Virus Outbreak-Veterans Home","headline":"Lives Lost: At veterans' home, towering legacies of the dead","localMemberName":null,"dateline":null,"old_lead_video_key":null,"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:43b5a0240fdf9e091069121a2f5f66cd","truncatedFirstWords":true,"etag":"43b5a0240fdf9e091069121a2f5f66cd_0a4aza0c0","notificationId":"urn:publicid:ap.org:43b5a0240fdf9e091069121a2f5f66cd","version":null,"videoContext":"\u003cp>____\u003c/p>","latestEtag":"43b5a0240fdf9e091069121a2f5f66cd_1a36aza0c0","embedLinkURL":null,"bylines":"By DAVID GOLDMAN and MATT SEDENSKY","revision":null,"mediumIds":["e413cdc770ef4726b5fa233762159550","520676c02a464e0eb342d15c1e6c03dc","f954aad33cf148588a2e0d92d47a117e","1bebb1ac605d4aee990da0bda02fb735","08933703c58944fe99821f9afe3b684b","b276a88475294aadb88572dc5c68f2e5","66fcd820e96044fc97ee77c6586b0d1f","0b3da69f27f74ce78ccfbab68d945731","bf6b7b05d2b24ae09ab442e4afe6c563","1385d6c64d994cdab95ae4db4f305998","746f13b86f7a490caf359f37be26b31f","e12cec7ae0364d24bcbbbec8f58a4597"],"media":[{"altText":null,"embedCaption":"An image of veteran Charles Lowell is projected onto the home he shared with his wife, Alice, for 30 years as she stands at left with her daughter Susan Kenney.

YORK (AP) — More than 4,500 recovering coronavirus patients were sent to New York’s already vulnerable nursing homes under a controversial state directive that was ultimately scrapped amid criticisms it was accelerating the nation’s deadliest outbreaks, according to a count by The Associated Press.\u003c/p>\u003cp>AP compiled its own tally to find out how many COVID-19 patients were discharged from hospitals to nursing homes under the March 25 directive after New York’s Health Department declined to release its internal survey conducted two weeks ago. It says it is still verifying data that was incomplete.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Whatever the full number, nursing home administrators, residents’ advocates and relatives say it has added up to a big and indefensible problem for facilities that even Gov. Andrew Cuomo — the main proponent of the policy — called “the optimum feeding ground for this virus.” \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"related-story-embed\" id=\"7ba8f9a0-91f0-11ea-d642-6d2076d3aefd\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“It was the single dumbest decision anyone could make if they wanted to kill people,” Daniel Arbeeny said of the directive, which prompted him to pull his 88-year-old father out of a Brooklyn nursing home where more than 50 people have died. His father later died of COVID-19 at home. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“This isn’t rocket science,” Arbeeny said. “We knew the most vulnerable -- the elderly and compromised -- are in nursing homes and rehab centers.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Told of the AP's tally, the Health Department said late Thursday it “can't comment on data we haven't had a chance to review, particularly while we’re still validating our own comprehensive survey of nursing homes admission and re-admission data in the middle of responding to this global pandemic.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>Cuomo, a Democrat, on May 10 reversed the directive, which had been intended to help free up hospital beds for the sickest patients as cases surged. But he continued to defend it this week, saying he didn't believe it contributed to the more than 5,800 nursing and adult care facility deaths in New York — more than in any other state — and that homes should have spoken up if it was a problem. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“Any nursing home could just say, ‘I can’t handle a COVID person in my facility,'\" he said, although the March 25 order didn’t specify how homes could refuse, saying that ”no resident shall be denied re-admission or admission to the (nursing home) solely based\" on confirmed or suspected COVID-19. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Over a month later, on April 29, the Health Department clarified that homes should not take any new residents if they were unable to meet their needs, including a checklist of standards for coronavirus care and prevention. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"social-embed\" id=\"se0:d9371620-91f0-11ea-f5f6-25dc2c08bdf1\">\u003ciframe aria-describedby=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"400\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-s5ErO\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/s5ErO/3/\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% !important;\" title=\"USA counties (2018) choropleth map Confirmed COVID-19 cases across the US per capita\">\u003c/iframe>\u003cscript type=\"text/javascript\">(function() {'use strict';window.addEventListener('message', function(event) {if (typeof event.data['datawrapper-height'] !== 'undefined') {for (var chartId in event.data['datawrapper-height']) {var iframe = document.getElementById('datawrapper-chart-' + chartId) || document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\" + chartId + \"']\");if (!iframe) {continue;}iframe.style.height = event.data['datawrapper-height'][chartId] + 'px';}}});})();\u003c/script>\n\u003cp class=\"social-caption\">\u003c/p>\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>In the meantime, some nursing homes felt obligated and overwhelmed. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Gurwin Jewish, a 460-bed home on Long Island, seemed well-prepared for the coronavirus in early March, with movable walls to seal off hallways for the infected. But after the state order, a trickle of recovering COVID-19 patients from local hospitals turned into a flood of 58 people.\u003c/p>\u003cp>More walls were put up, but other residents nonetheless began falling sick and dying. In the end, 47 Gurwin residents died of confirmed or suspected COVID-19.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"hub-link-embed\" id=\"afs:Content:8962310579\">Full Coverage: Virus Outbreak\u003c/div>\u003cp>The state order “put staff and residents at great risk,” CEO Stuart Almer said. “We can’t draw a straight line from bringing in someone positive to someone catching the disease, but we’re talking about elderly, fragile and vulnerable residents.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine, known as AMDA, had warned from the beginning that Cuomo’s order admitting infected patients posed a “clear and present danger” to nursing home residents. Now, Jeffrey N. Nichols, who serves on the executive committee of the group, said “the effect of that order was to contribute to 5,000 deaths.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Nationally, over 35,500 people have died from coronavirus outbreaks at nursing homes and long-term care facilities, about a third of the overall death toll, according to the AP's running tally. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"786c4e304a364cc094d952fed6a09df9\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Cuomo has deflected criticism over the nursing home directive by saying it stemmed from Trump administration guidance. Still, few states went as far as New York and neighboring New Jersey, which has the second-most care home deaths, in discharging hospitalized coronavirus patients to nursing homes. California followed suit but loosened its requirement following intense criticism.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Some states went in the opposite direction. Louisiana barred hospitals for 30 days from sending coronavirus patients to nursing homes with some exceptions. And while Louisiana reported about 1,000 coronavirus-related nursing home deaths, far fewer than New York, that was 40% of Louisiana's statewide death toll, a higher proportion than in New York. \u003c/p>\u003cp>New York's Health Department told the AP May 8 it was not tracking how many recovering COVID-19 patients were taken into nursing homes under the order. But it was at that very moment surveying administrators of the state’s over 1,150 nursing homes and long-term care facilities on just that question.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Those survey results have yet to be released. But regardless, the Health Department said, the survey had no bearing on Cuomo’s announcement May 10 that “we’re just not going to send a person who is positive to a nursing home after a hospital visit.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Cuomo said such patients would be accommodated elsewhere, such as sites originally set up as temporary hospitals.\u003c/p>\u003cp>To some, the governor’s reversal came too late. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“It infected a great number of people in nursing homes who had no business getting infected, including short-term residents who were there for rehabilitation after surgeries,” said John Dalli, a New York attorney who specializes in nursing home cases.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"cbdaf63b6fc64feebd1c308609f8c33d\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>To be sure, incoming residents weren’t the only possible source of infection. Some homes believe a bigger contribution came from staffers and residents unaware they had the virus. And some say they would have taken on COVID-19 patients regardless of the state’s order. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“There were nursing homes that realized that there was a void,” said Sarah Colomello, a spokeswoman for Thompson House in Rhinebeck. The 100-bed facility set up an isolated unit where affiliated hospitals nearby have sent at least 21 patients. It has reported no deaths.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Cuomo administration officials say the original directive came when the governor feared the hospital system would be overwhelmed and was focused on creating as much hospital space as possible. \u003c/p>\u003cp>That was welcomed by one of the many hospital systems and nursing homes surveyed for AP's count. Northwell Health said three of its medical centers were so overtaxed at one point they had to put some ICU patients in hallways. To relieve pressure, the company eventually sent more than 1,700 COVID-19 patients to nursing homes.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Suffice it say, our hospitals were under stress,” spokesman Terence Lynam said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Associated Press investigative researcher Randy Herschaft contributed to this report.\u003c/p>","description":null,"pullQuoteObjs":[],"embedCaption":null,"sequenceNumber":null,"title":"US-Virus Outbreak-New York Nursing Home Order","headline":"AP count: Over 4,500 virus patients sent to NY nursing homes","localMemberName":null,"dateline":null,"old_lead_video_key":null,"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:5ebc0ad45b73a899efa81f098330204c","truncatedFirstWords":true,"etag":"5ebc0ad45b73a899efa81f098330204c_1a1aza0c0","notificationId":"urn:publicid:ap.org:5ebc0ad45b73a899efa81f098330204c","version":null,"videoContext":"ed -- are in nursing homes and rehab centers.”\u003c/p>","latestEtag":null,"embedLinkURL":null,"bylines":"By BERNARD CONDON, JENNIFER PELTZ and JIM MUSTIAN","revision":null,"mediumIds":["0bb3073027f14f3fb905061b37d58736","786c4e304a364cc094d952fed6a09df9","1bf52bd3efdd4f51af434e2d91442f28","8be9b4d007434339bdb80d681d409e93","2ff4847f82594bcdbabda517e2083f2c","cc95181a0dfe48879080e394d857e79b","cbdaf63b6fc64feebd1c308609f8c33d"],"media":[{"altText":null,"embedCaption":null,"imageFileExtension":".jpeg","title":null,"videoMimeType":null,"gcsBaseUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/0bb3073027f14f3fb905061b37d58736/","state":null,"flattenedCaption":"FILE- In this April 17, 2020, file photo, a patient is wheeled into Cobble Hill Health Center by emergency medical workers in the Brooklyn borough of New York.

(AP) — For a preview of the future of office work, watch how the biggest tech companies are preparing for a post-pandemic world.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Silicon Valley and Seattle giants — Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, Twitter — were the first to send their employees home as the virus spread to the U.S. Now they're among the last to return them to the office. Some of their employees might never go back.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The companies are studying what their highly-paid, highly-valued employees want, using their own technology to make remote work easier and looking to hire new workers outside of big city hubs. It's a potentially huge turnaround after years in which companies like Amazon and Google chased scarce tech talent by opening or expanding offices in hip urban locations such as San Francisco and New York. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Such a shift might also amount to a repudiation of the notion that creative work demands corporate campuses reminiscent of college, with free food, ping pong tables and open office plans designed to encourage unplanned interactions. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The result could re-imagine not just Silicon Valley but other cities as the companies expand hiring in places like Atlanta, Dallas and Denver, where Facebook plans to open new “hubs” for its new, mostly remote hires.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Change won't happen quickly, though. “We want to make sure we move forward in a measured way,” said Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg during an employee town hall Thursday that was broadcast live on his Facebook page. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Facebook, which has nearly 45,000 employees, is looking five to 10 years down the line as it plans for more remote work, even when COVID-19 is no longer a threat that requires most of its employees to work from home. Since the coronavirus has upended work and office life, even companies with fewer resources and slower-moving cultures are likely to follow. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“Many companies are learning that their workers are just as or even more productive working from home,” said Andy Challenger, senior vice president of staffing firm Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Zuckerberg said a Facebook employee survey found that about 20% of workers were “extremely or very interested” in moving to full-time remote work after virus-related restrictions are lifted. Another 20% were “somewhat” interested and the largest group wanted flexibility, with some remote and some in-office work. Eventually, Zuckerberg said, as many as half of Facebook's workers could be working remotely. But he cautioned that this is years, perhaps even a decade, away. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Twitter went even further, announcing last week that it will allow some employees to work from home on a permanent basis, a plan CEO Jack Dorsey hatched before the coronavirus. His other company, Square, which like Twitter is based in San Francisco, is doing the same. Some new U.S.-based job listings for Twitter give the option for hires to work in cities like San Francisco, New York and Washington D.C. but also remotely full time anywhere in the country.\u003c/p>\u003cp>It's too early to know whether remote work options will mean an exodus of highly-paid tech workers from San Francisco and Silicon Valley, where they've contributed to skyrocketing rents and housing prices. But Facebook's employee survey suggests that at least some of its employees would leave the San Francisco Bay Area if given the option. \u003c/p>\u003cp>For companies that have built their empires on letting people communicate with far-flung friends and colleagues, moving toward remote work is not too hard of a sell. But there are many challenges. Collaboration, spontaneity, face-to-face interactions that aren't on a scheduled call — all look different when people are working alone from their homes. \u003c/p>\u003cp>There are also some jobs — in Facebook's case, the toughest content reviewing that deals with suicides, child abuse and other traumatizing material; sales; building, upgrading and maintaining data centers; lawyers who have to be in court and so on — that can't be done remotely. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Newer employees, especially recent college grads or those with little experience and lower performers might also fall into this group, Zuckerberg said. At Facebook, the CEO said employees will have to meet certain criteria to be considered for permanent remote work. This includes a level of seniority, strong performance and, naturally, being part of a team that supports remote work. \u003c/p>\u003cp>For now, workers at Facebook, Google, Twitter and elsewhere can work remotely through 2020. At Microsoft, employees can work from home until October. But the company's work-from-home flexibility has fit with the software giant’s broader effort to capitalize on what CEO Satya Nadella calls a shift to “remote everything.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Every organization will increasingly need the ability at a moment’s notice to remote everything from manufacturing to sales, to customer support,\" Nadella said this week at the company’s Build developer conference.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The company's chief technology officer, Kevin Scott, had already been working a lot from home, in part because he is based in Silicon Valley and most of the rest of the leadership team is in Redmond, Washington. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“We are all on this accelerated timeline figuring out how to work from home.... It’s learning the culture and the rhythms of interacting with your colleagues by video conference and doing your work remotely,\" he said, speaking not just of Microsoft but workplaces in general. \"That is getting so much better so quickly that I don’t think I’m going to be commuting nearly as frequently as I was before.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>__\u003c/p>\u003cp>AP Technology Writer Matt O'Brien contributed to this story from Providence, Rhode Island.\u003c/p>","description":null,"pullQuoteObjs":[],"embedCaption":null,"sequenceNumber":null,"title":"US--Tech Giants-Remote Work","headline":"Tech giants are embracing remote work.

With so few people about, and so many businesses closed, its starkness has called out to me in black and white.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>At the corner of Powell and Market streets, pigeons walk across an empty cable car turntable — one usually surrounded by dozens of tourists waiting to board. In Union Square, the Sir Francis Drake Hotel, known for its Beefeater doormen, is boarded up with plywood, along with a number of luxury retail shops nearby. The entryway of John’s Grill, home of the Maltese Falcon, is covered with black plywood. Here and there in the financial district are lone joggers and walkers, a contrast from the sea of people usually filling the streets on their way to and from work.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"5e4b4e9ef31a443d948406e101222ff6\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>On the usually packed crooked street, Lombard, only an occasional car passes down its eight hairpin turns. The seafood sellers’ stands at Fisherman’s Wharf sit empty, with no steam pouring out of the crab-boiling pots. Bay cruise boats sit tied up at a pier behind an old neon sign urging tourists to view Alcatraz — which, like so many other iconic San Francisco destinations, has been closed for more than two months.\u003c/p>\u003cp>This would be the time of year when baseball fans would fill the 40,000-seat Oracle Park to watch the San Francisco Giants. The park now sits hauntingly empty as scant people make their way around statues of Juan Marichal, Willie Mays and others surrounding it.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Walking on a recent morning through the popular Ferry Building Marketplace at the foot of Market Street, I saw only two of its few dozen businesses open — an empanada stand and a bread bakery. Hardly any commuters were passing through the building, the result of most downtown businesses being closed and sparse service from the ferries that shuttle people across the bay.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In Chinatown, lanterns swayed above Grant Avenue lined with closed shops behind metal gates and pull-down doors.

Most of the nightclubs, restaurants and cafes are shuttered.

The empty ruins of the Sutro Baths sat quietly below the shuttered Cliff House with the sound of waves in the distance.

No one knows exactly when. But San Francisco has proven its resiliency again and again: It survived a major earthquake and conflagration in 1906, the Spanish Flu of 1918, the Great Depression of the 1930s, the 1978 Moscone-Milk assassinations, the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake and the 2008 economic collapse.

The list of NBA players who were known to test positive eventually grew to 10 — not all were identified — and Commissioner Adam Silver said last month that the actual total was even higher.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But the league has been working on countless return-to-play scenarios for several weeks, all with the caveat that testing would be an integral part of any resumption of the season.\u003c/p>\u003cp>It remains unknown where the NBA is in the process of securing tests or developing large-scale testing protocols.

Gov. Ron DeSantis has said he wants the state open for pro sports, even telling franchises not based in Florida that they could come to the Sunshine State and train if restrictions preventing it existed in their own locales.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Places are opening up. Let’s not forget COVID isn’t magically less contagious now,\" Malcolm Miller of the Toronto Raptors tweeted Saturday. “The virus itself didn’t get better... stay safe.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>Teams have been allowed to welcome players back to their training facilities for voluntary sessions since May 8, and more than half of the league’s franchises have taken advantage of that opportunity.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The next steps along a return-to-play path would likely include a loosening of the restrictions for those voluntary workouts — no more than four players are currently allowed inside any facility at a time — and then a plan for when training camps could open.

Woods was going for his seventh straight PGA Tour victory when Mickelson beat him at Torrey Pines in 2000. Later that year, Woods had won 19 consecutive times on the PGA Tour when he had at least a share of the 54-hole lead until Mickelson beat him at the Tour Championship.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Woods, however, captured the streak that mattered, holding off Mickelson in the final group at the Masters in 2001 to hold all four professional majors at the same time.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The banter was lacking in Las Vegas, and perhaps having Manning and Brady will change the dynamics. The broadcast includes Charles Barkley providing commentary and Justin Thomas, whom Woods has embraced, on the course as a reporter in his television debut.\u003c/p>\u003cp>After this exhibition, golf has two weeks before the PGA Tour is set to return at Colonial in Fort Worth, Texas.

Ilhan Omar's metamorphosis from refugee to the first Somali-American in Congress has been well-documented. Now, Omar is out with a new memoir that offers her own spin on her path to prominence, starting with her childhood in Mogadishu. “This is What America Looks Like: My Journey from Refugee to Congresswoman,” set for release Tuesday, offers no revelations on some of the controversies that have dogged Omar. Instead, it sketches rugged years that Omar says made her a fearless fighter, unafraid to skirmish with \u003ca href=\"http://apnews.com/f2b66f5807cd44d78745a7be8f342829\">President Donald Trump \u003c/a> and her frequent conservative critics.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>A YOUNG FIGHTER\u003c/p>\u003cp>In her memoir, written with Rebecca Paley, Omar recounts taking on a much taller boy when she was just 7, rubbing his face in the sand after he picked on someone weaker.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I wasn’t afraid of fighting. I felt like I was bigger and stronger than everyone else — even if I knew that wasn’t really the case,” she wrote. It's a theme woven throughout the book, including after she arrived in America and settled in Arlington, Virginia, knowing almost no English. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Omar got into fights in middle school to show she wasn't afraid, she writes, and she describes incidents in which she choked one boy until he foamed at the mouth and kept hitting another girl even after being told the girl was pregnant.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Fighting didn’t feel like a choice. It was a part of me. Respect goes both ways,” she wrote. \u003c/p>\u003cp>LIFE IN SOMALIA\u003c/p>\u003cp>Omar said she grew up the youngest of seven in a loud, opinionated middle-class family, living in a guarded compound in Mogadishu. Her father’s clan was one of the country’s most powerful, and her mother, who died when she was in preschool, was Benadiri, a Somali ethnic minority. Omar, who described herself as a tomboy, said the only place she fit in was within the walls of her family home. Civil war broke out when she was 8, and after her family's compound came under attack by militia, the family escaped and eventually made it to a refugee camp in Kenya, where Omar spent four years before the family moved to the U.S.\u003c/p>\u003cp>LOVE AND STRUGGLES\u003c/p>\u003cp>Omar recounts meeting her first husband, Ahmed Hirsi, in Minneapolis when she was 16. She said they were in love, and shortly before she turned 19, their families decided they should marry.\u003c/p>\u003cp>By 2008, Omar was struggling. Finances were a stressor, she had two small children, and she began questioning her relationships, including her marriage. Since the couple had married religiously – not civilly -- to get divorced, Hirsi had to simply declare the marriage ended, Omar wrote.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>She then had what she called “a Britney Spears-style meltdown” in which she shaved her head and eloped with a man, Ahmed Nur Said Elmi, whom she wrote she “spent so little time with that I wouldn’t even make him a footnote in my story if it weren’t for the fact that this event turned into \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/cc2ccd70de56405098d2f259bf0e46c5\">the main headline later on\u003c/a>.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>In the book, Omar doesn’t name Elmi or say how they met or when their relationship ended. She later \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/d21424c54d0e4d09b02714de4336e0c0\">reunited with Hirsi\u003c/a> and had a third child.

Omar again denies those claims, saying they originated from a post in an online Somali discussion forum that she said was a last-ditch effort to sink her campaign.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“That Somalis were some of my harshest critics might seem absurd. But they refused to accept me because I refused to kiss the ring. It goes back to my inability since childhood to submit to bullies,” she wrote. \u003c/p>\u003cp>PUBLIC LIFE\u003c/p>\u003cp>Omar was elected to the state Legislature in 2016, knocking off a 44-year incumbent.

Their common thread: smile, sunshine, rainbow, birthday memories and other happy sides of life. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Murakami said comparing the fight against the coronavirus to a war, as politicians often do, is inappropriate. “It’s a challenge for us to figure out how we can share our wisdom to cooperate, help each other and keep balance. It’s not a war to kill each other but a fight of wisdom to let us all live,” he said. “We don’t need enmity and hatred here.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Music serves as an important motif in Murakami’s stories. An avid listener and collector of music, he has also written books on the topic and has a library of records in his study, where Friday’s program was prerecorded. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Murakami has hosted his “Murakami Radio” every two months since August 2018 on Tokyo FM. The station said Friday’s show was Murakami’s idea to cheer up those who are under stress, living under a coronavirus state of emergency still in place in parts of Japan, including Tokyo.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Murakami began writing while running a jazz bar in Tokyo after graduating from university. Following his 1979 debut novel “Hear the Wind Sing,” the 1987 romance “Norwegian Wood” became his first bestseller, establishing him as a young literary star. Recent hits include “1Q84” and “Killing Comnendatore.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>A perennial contender for the Nobel Prize in literature and a social recluse, Murakami said he has worked from home for years and the lifestyle has little changed, though “the corona situation” did affect him in many ways, possibly an inspiration for his future work.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Murakami has written stories inspired by events that have violently shaken the society, including the 1995 Tokyo subway gassing by an apocalyptic cult and the deadly quake in Kobe, where he grew up.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Rather than documenting an event as it develops, Murakami said that as a novelist he is more interested in transforming it into “a story in a different form,” though he doesn’t know when or how. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The world may be experiencing “a large-scale social experiment whose results could slowly spread across the entire society, for better or worse,” he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Murakami said he worries the post-corona world may be a more closed and selfish place even if it has better protection.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“If love and compassion are lacking, the world after the corona will surely be an edgy and insipid place even if masks and vaccines are abundantly distributed,” he said. “Love is important.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Other songs on the playlist: “Waiting on a Sunny Day” by Bruce Springsteen; “Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head” by Isley Meets Bacharach; “Here Comes the Sun” by Nina Simone; “You’ve Got A Friend” by Carole King; “Over the Rainbow” by Ella Fitzgerald; “Sun Is Shining” by Bob Marley &amp; The Wailers: “What A Wonderful World” by Louis Armstrong; “Happy Birthday Sweet Darling” by Kate Taylor; “Smile” by Eric Clapton; “My Favorite Things Featuring Kathleen Battle” by Al Jarreau; “She Wore a Yellow Ribbon” by Lisa Ono; “Happy Talk” by Nancy Wilson; “They Can’t Take That Away from Me” by Brian Wilson; “Put on a Happy Face” by Tony Bennett; “Over the Rainbow” by Fred Lowery; “We’ll Meet Again” by Peggy Lee with Benny Goodman; “Mon coeur s’ouvre à ta voix” by Sigrid Onégin; “What the World Needs Now Is Love” by Wei Wei Wuu.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>This story corrects the number of songs played.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Follow Mari Yamaguchi on Twitter at https://www.twitter.com/mariyamaguchi\u003c/p>","description":null,"pullQuoteObjs":[],"embedCaption":null,"sequenceNumber":null,"title":"AS--Virus-Outbrak-Japan-Murakami","headline":"Author Murakami DJs 'Stay Home' radio show to lift spirits ","localMemberName":null,"dateline":null,"old_lead_video_key":null,"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:c3cc8b243b14a36ce7e512fa00fe0cbd","truncatedFirstWords":false,"etag":"c3cc8b243b14a36ce7e512fa00fe0cbd_1a7aza0c0","notificationId":null,"version":null,"videoContext":null,"latestEtag":null,"embedLinkURL":null,"bylines":"By MARI YAMAGUCHI","revision":null,"mediumIds":["e67c84b5720d48378abadf8b8b756a5e"],"media":[{"altText":null,"embedCaption":null,"imageFileExtension":".jpeg","title":null,"videoMimeType":null,"gcsBaseUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/e67c84b5720d48378abadf8b8b756a5e/","state":null,"flattenedCaption":"FILE - In this Nov. 3, 2018, file photo, Japanese novelist Haruki Murakami signs his autograph on his novel \"Killing Commendatore\" during a press conference at Waseda University in Tokyo.

Just listening to everyone and making certain that when the industry decides it’s time to go back to work, that Pinewood Studios will be ready.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Georgia has become known as the Hollywood of the South with a surge of film and TV productions companies and several studios opening up over the past several years. The entertainment industry shuttered productions in March because of safety concerns during the coronavirus pandemic. With Los Angeles County still under stay-at-home orders and production shutdown, some are looking to Georgia as a possible destination to film.\u003c/p>\u003cp>After Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp declared that nonessential businesses in the state could reopen in late April, Perry emerged with a strategic plan to reopen his massive 330-acre studio, which has become a production powerhouse rivaling Hollywood’s best.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Perry believes he’s ready to move forward at Tyler Perry Studios to produce his own content such as the BET series “Sistas” and “The Oval.” The Hollywood Reporter obtained \u003ca href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/tyler-perry-reveals-details-covid-19-production-protocols-1295359\">a 30-page production protocol document to cast\u003c/a>, detailing health measures from testing in their hometown, traveling on a Perry-arranged private jet and doing another rapid test.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Many in the industry want to see how Perry’s protocol will unfold.

But I know, my priority right now is my kids and the safety of our family and the health of that.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Along with Perry’s studio, other studios in Georgia have implemented their own health and safety plans, but are waiting to see if they coincide with the rest of the industry. Perry declined an interview request. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Pinewood is focusing on security, limiting the number of guest on sets and using a device to purify the air to try to stop the virus's spread.

While serving his time, he would hear talented young inmates rapping in the yards at San Quentin State Prison with skill and power. In his cell, where Jassy used his keyboard to make beats, he invited the men to perform rap freestyles and taught them about songwriting and music production.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In the jail’s media center, Jassy uploaded each sound from his keyboard to a computer so he could produce music digitally. Word spread about Jassy’s music-led initiative as part of the prison’s Youthful Offenders Program, and donors — including Grammy-winning producer Greg Wells — contributed audio equipment, transforming the media lab into a full-blown production studio. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"a7c9b3ecf81643f582e0cdb1b2c7f5a0\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Celebrities even got involved, including J.

And I told them, I said, ‘If you’re a true MC, if you’re a real MC, you should be able to find all the words instead of that word and challenge yourself.’”\u003c/p>\u003cp>He even had members of rival gangs rap on the same song. “All of a sudden people that normally wouldn’t say ‘hi’ to each other was saying ‘hi’ to each other on the yard,” he said. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"affa902f747c4321aa2371cc47bf36c9\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Jassy, 46, has produced and written songs for Sean Kingston, Ashley Tisdale, Heidi Montag and others. He even worked and recorded material with Spears, but the songs were never released.\u003c/p>\u003cp>He transferred to San Quentin in 2013. In 2010, he was convicted of murder, assault with a deadly weapon and aggravated battery, and acquitted of charges of hit-and-run and a second assault with a deadly weapon.

I can choose to only put out positive things and try to help others as much as possible,” Jassy said.

None of these are legit, even though they were shared widely on social media. The Associated Press checked them out. Here are the facts:\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>CLAIM: Michigan sent absentee ballots to 7.7 million people ahead of primaries and the general election. This was done illegally and without authorization by a rogue secretary of state.\u003c/p>\u003cp>THE FACTS: Michigan mailed applications for ballots to voters, not the ballots themselves. President Donald Trump, a Republican, on Wednesday falsely claimed on Facebook and Twitter that Michigan’s secretary of state mailed ballots to millions of voters in the state. Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat, announced Tuesday that the state mailed absentee ballot applications to 7.7 million registered voters ahead of Michigan’s August primary and November election. Benson said mailing the applications cost the state $4.5 million, which was covered with funds from the federal coronavirus relief package. Traditionally, Michigan voters have had to ask their local clerk for an absentee ballot. Benson’s announcement was criticized by some state Republicans who argued that local clerks should handle the requests and the money would have been better spent on protective equipment for polling places and election workers and on machines to more quickly process surging absentee ballots. In 2018, Michigan voters approved a statewide ballot initiative that eased election restrictions, including allowing voters to request an absentee ballot without reason. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>____\u003c/p>\u003cp>CLAIM: Photo shows Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping holding up T-shirts that say “I (Heart) China.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>THE FACTS: The photo was manipulated. On May 12, the official Twitter account for the Trump campaign tweeted an altered photo of Biden and Xi next to each other holding up T-shirts that say “I (Heart) China.” The post, which was also captioned “Biden (Heart) China,” had over 1,900 retweets. In the original photo, Biden is holding up a T-shirt stating “China America two countries friendship everlasting,” in Chinese, while Xi holds a tee that says “Fostering goodwill between America &amp; China,” in English. The photo, captured by photographer Frederic J. Brown for AFP/Getty Images, was taken at the International Studies Learning School in South Gate, California, just outside Los Angeles, on February 17, 2012. (A similar photo can be found in the AP archives, but Xi holds the tee with text in Chinese and Biden holds the one in English.) When the men met, California was seeking to bolster Chinese investment in the state. The Trump campaign has painted Biden as a Washington lifer and has argued that he’s too cozy with China.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>CLAIM: The letters in COVID-19 stand for “certificate of vaccination identification” and 19 stands for “AI,” or artificial intelligence.\u003c/p>\u003cp>THE FACTS: COVID-19 stands for “coronavirus disease 2019,” according to the World Health Organization, which named it in February. A Facebook post with more than 21,000 views claims the name “COVID” is an acronym for “certificate of vaccination identification,” a reference to a potential future vaccine for the coronavirus and a digital certificate indicating someone has been vaccinated. The post also suggests the ‘19’ in COVID-19 stands for the first and ninth letters of the alphabet, A and I, representing the words “artificial intelligence.” The post references Bill Gates’ assertions that in the future, there may be digital certificates to track who has been tested or vaccinated for the coronavirus. Gates did say in a March 18 Reddit forum that “eventually we will have some digital certificates” for this purpose. But social media posts have taken this statement out of context and claimed Gates wishes to implant microchips in humans or use digital tools around the coronavirus to increase surveillance of humans. There is no evidence Gates has any interest in using a digital certificate of vaccination to monitor the public. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation told the AP in an email the idea of digital certificates “relates to efforts to create an open source digital platform with the goal of expanding access to safe, home-based testing” for the virus. False claims similar to these have circulated on social media platforms since the WHO introduced the name COVID-19 for the disease caused by the coronavirus earlier this year. Dozens of posts online have falsely claimed the acronym stands for “Chinese Originated Viral Infectious Disease” or “Certificate of Vaccination Identification by Artificial Intelligence.” There is no evidence for any of these claims.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>CLAIM: In Dayton, Ohio, city officials are telling people to wear masks because of coronavirus but just banned criminals from wearing them.\u003c/p>\u003cp>THE FACTS: Dayton commissioners approved an anti-mask law in early March, before state and national health experts began recommending people wear masks in public, to discourage hate groups from holding rallies in the city. Social media users are sharing an outdated article to falsely suggest that while city leaders in Dayton are encouraging people to wear cloth masks, they recently outlawed the facial coverings for criminals. The inaccurate posts sharing the article mock Dayton leaders for passing a nonsensical and contradictory law during the coronavirus pandemic. Other posts have taken a screenshot of the article’s headline, turning it into a meme. “This is literally the idiocracy that is all government,” one Facebook post said. The ordinance, passed by Dayton’s city commission on March 11, prohibits anyone from concealing their identity “during a crime” or while trying to “intimidate another.” The city ordinance was passed, in part, to discourage hate groups like the Ku Klux Klan from holding rallies after a Klan group requested a permit for a gathering this year. The request came after a handful of KKK members showed up in May 2019 at the city’s courthouse, requiring a massive police presence to keep counter protesters and Klan members from clashing. Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley said she began noticing the March article about Dayton’s anti-mask ordinance was being taken out of context because social media users were tagging her in posts linking to the outdated story. The Dayton television station that originally published the article has since updated their story to clarify the city ordinance was not passed in relation to COVID-19. “We did this before COVID was even happening,” Whaley said in a phone interview with The Associated Press. “We had taken this legislation from other cities to deal with hate groups. They don’t like to show their face during hate rallies. It was a way for us to say: ‘OK, you can come but you have to show yourself.’” Other cities and states have anti-mask laws on the books to discourage Klan members from wearing hoods during public rallies and marches. In April, for example, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp temporarily suspended an anti-mask law passed in 1951 that makes it a misdemeanor to wear “a mask, hood” or other face covering to “conceal the identity of the wearer” on public property.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>CLAIM: California Gov. Gavin Newsom has been defying his own stay-at-home order and fleeing to Montana.\u003c/p>\u003cp>THE FACTS: The governor has not left the state since the stay-at-home order was issued. Posts claiming the governor fled to Montana date back to at least May 5, with comments shared on Facebook suggesting the governor was seen in Bitterroot Valley without a mask. “Did you and your family enjoy being in Bitterroot Valley Montana last weekend?” one comment stated. “What’s wrong with staying in the state you have locked down.” The falsehood gained traction this week with posts featuring a photo of the governor receiving thousands of likes. “I am Gavin Newsom. I ordered California to stay home, no trips or vacations this summer. I decided to take a family vacation to Montana this weekend. Do as I say, not as I do,” the posts said. The governor’s office confirmed to the AP that he has not left the state throughout his order. “The Governor and his family have been in California for the duration of the pandemic,” Nathan Click, a spokesman for the governor, said in an email. The parents of Newsom’s wife, Jennifer Siebel Newsom, do own a ranch in Montana. The couple was married there in 2008. A photo provided to the AP shows Newsom and his wife on their wedding day posing on the banks of the Bitterroot River on the ranch. Newsom has held press conferences on May 6, May 14 and May 18 in California. “He wasn’t in Montana to our knowledge,” Erin Loranger, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock’s press secretary, said in an email. Newsom first issued his stay-home-order on March 19. The governor announced Monday that he would be relaxing the order. He said that counties would need to ask for state approval for restaurants to allow dining in and he suggested that it would be a few weeks before people could get haircuts. “Bottom line is: People can go at their own pace, and we are empowering our local health directors and county officials that understand their local communities and conditions,” Newsom said. It’s not the first time misinformation has swirled around a governor’s whereabouts during the pandemic. False posts also surfaced around Gov. Ralph \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/afs:Content:8797042046\">Northam supposedly escaping \u003c/a> to North Carolina in April.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>CLAIM: Photo shows Los Angeles County health director looking unwell.\u003c/p>\u003cp>THE FACTS: The photo was manipulated to make the health director appear sickly, her face pale and her eyes ringed by dark circles. The altered photo showing Barbara Ferrer, director of the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, circulated widely on social media with comments that suggested she was in poor health. “The health director of Los Angeles is the most unhealthy looking person I have ever seen,” a Twitter user posted on May 15. The post had over 23,000 retweets. A screenshot of the tweet also circulated on Facebook. Dinesh D’Souza, a conservative commentator, tweeted the altered photo on May 16, saying, “This is the health director of Los Angeles. Any questions?” The post had over 14,000 retweets. He later replied to a Twitter user who pointed out that the photo was false, “Okay, I got carried away with this one. Thanks for calling me on it.” The image was taken from a press briefing Ferrer gave on \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?v=2988585594558524&amp;ref=watch_permalink\">May 13\u003c/a>. In footage from the event, Ferrer appears to be in good health as she delivers COVID-19 updates. In the manipulated image, her eyes were darkened to make it appear she had dark circles and her face was made pale. Ferrer came under fire earlier this month after saying some form of stay-at-home restrictions would likely remain “for the next three months.” She later apologized for inadvertently creating confusion around the issue. \u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>CLAIM: Video shows “COV-19” is inscribed on equipment for 5G wireless towers.\u003c/p>\u003cp>THE FACTS: The circuit board filmed in the video is from a nearly decade-old set top TV box. A representative with Virgin Media, a British telecommunications company confirmed to the AP that the device never had “COV-19” printed on it. Last week, a video circulated on Facebook where a man filmed himself wearing a hard hat and a face mask. He claims he has been installing “5G masts.” He holds up a circuit board with “COV-19” inscribed on the device. “We don’t crack open these kits because we’re explicitly asked not to, but perhaps the best thing is for me to show you,” he says in the video. He goes on to say he is not aware of any company that “produces circuitry like this that has the brand name COV-19…I’ve read all that stuff online about coronavirus and COVID-19.” Several users on Facebook shared the false video. “Must See Worker Exposes Circuit Boards Being Installed in 5G Towers Whats on Them Will Surprise You !!!!” stated one post sharing the video. One part of the video shows that “HannStar J MV-1” is clearly written on the circuit board. HannStar is a Taiwanese company that produces parts for monitors, laptops, and televisions. The circuit board held up by the man in the video is not part of 5G technology, but belongs to an old set top TV box. Virgin Media told The Associated Press in an email that the part is from a 9-year-old TV box. “That is a board from a very old set top TV box, and which never featured any component parts inscribed/stamped/printed or otherwise with COV 19. It has absolutely no relation with any mobile network infrastructure, including that used for 5G,” Simon Dornan, a spokesman for Virgin Media, told the AP. The representative said the hardware looks like the Cisco 4585 HD (non-PVR) set top box, which was supplied to customers in 2011 but was discontinued a few years ago. Virgin Media tracked down some of those parts and sent The Associated Press photos confirming that COV-19 was never inscribed on them. The company said the inscription shown in the video was added to the RF Tuner component part, which is where the coaxial TV cable is connected. In recent months, conspiracy theories falsely linking coronavirus to 5G wireless have circulated widely online.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Rafael Cabrera contributed to this report from Mexico City.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>This is part of The Associated Press’ ongoing effort to fact-check misinformation that is shared widely online, including work with Facebook to identify and reduce the circulation of false stories on the platform.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___ \u003c/p>\u003cp>Find all AP Fact Checks here: https://apnews.com/APFactCheck\u003c/p>\u003cp>___ \u003c/p>\u003cp>Follow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck\u003c/p>","description":null,"pullQuoteObjs":[],"embedCaption":null,"sequenceNumber":null,"title":"Not-Real-News","headline":"NOT REAL NEWS: A look at what didn't happen this week","localMemberName":null,"dateline":null,"old_lead_video_key":null,"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:c4a819f1e83d6395cf0015038fa7d4b6","truncatedFirstWords":true,"etag":"c4a819f1e83d6395cf0015038fa7d4b6_0a7aza0c0","notificationId":null,"version":null,"videoContext":"to request an absentee ballot without reason. \u003c/p>","latestEtag":null,"embedLinkURL":null,"bylines":"By ARIJETA LAJKA, ALI SWENSON, AMANDA SEITZ and BEATRICE DUPUY","revision":null,"mediumIds":["73edd882d7074ff8b32938274bda486e","ae902b6ea30443acb3e506bb07221f6b","66ac10a292384b3f82873fa0361d3bce","e625c19ceda248b7a76642dab0349f05","7e3a442776614be88b522b2e1d41199f"],"media":[{"altText":null,"embedCaption":null,"imageFileExtension":".jpeg","title":null,"videoMimeType":null,"gcsBaseUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/73edd882d7074ff8b32938274bda486e/","state":null,"flattenedCaption":"FILE - In this Friday, Feb. 17, 2012 file photo, Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping and U.S. Vice President Joe Biden hold T-shirts given to them by students during their visit to the International Studies Learning Center in South Gate, Calif.

It means no congregational prayers at mosques and open fields, no family reunions, no relatives bearing gifts for children. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“This outbreak is not just dampening spirits of Eid, but also has made the tradition entirely different,” said Andieka Rabbani, a university student in Jakarta.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>This year, like other Indonesians, he can only greet his cousins and friends through video calls. \u003c/p>\u003cp>In deeply conservative Aceh, Indonesia’s only province enforcing Islamic sharia law, public Eid prayers can still be performed at mosques and fields, but without shaking hands and with limited sermons. The iconic public parade of decorated vehicles with loudspeakers invoking God's name was scrapped this year. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“It’s too sad ... the whole week used to be one long festival, but not this time,” said Muchtar Yusuf, a resident of Aceh’s Lhokseumawe city.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The province has reported zero coronavirus cases in the past weeks and has had only one death and 19 confirmed infections.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Unlike Aceh, mosques and fields in Jakarta, which are usually always crowded with Eid worshippers, stood empty after authorities extended the restrictions to June 4, suspended communal gatherings and banned private cars from leaving the capital.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Jakarta has become the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak in Indonesia with 6,515 confirmed cases with 501 deaths as of Saturday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Eid celebrations also were low-key in neighboring Muslim-majority Malaysia. Businesses have mostly reopened after weeks of virus shutdown, but mass gatherings are still banned and ethnic Malay Muslims are not allowed to travel back to their villages. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Police have turned away more than 5,000 cars trying to head back to their hometowns in the last few days and have warned of strict penalties against those who sneaked back. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The pandemic has also canceled the “open house” tradition, where Muslims invite family and friends to their homes for a feast. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The prime minister and government officials usually host open house events that attract thousands of people. This year, the government allowed family members living nearby to visit each other on Sunday only, but the gatherings must not exceed 20 people in the same house. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Mosques have reopened but are limited to small congregations of up to 30 people. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Rohaizam Zainuddin said he was blessed he could celebrate Eid with his elderly parents living nearby but his sister in another state couldn’t return home. Usually, the house will be teeming with visiting relatives and well-wishers on the first day of Eid, but Rohaizam said he expects most of them to stay away this year. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“We feel sad and being human, we are frustrated that celebration this year is not the same,\" he said. \"But there is no point getting angry.

The rest of Pakistan followed the next day. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Pakistan has been in a lockdown to control the spread of the coronavirus since mid-March but Prime Minister Imran Khan refused to close mosques during Ramadan, despite pleas from doctors and a rising number of COVID-19 infections.

The daily death tally peaked at 799 on April 8.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Reducing the state’s daily death count to fewer than 100 seemed almost impossible several weeks ago, the governor said. That figure, considered a lagging indicator, has remained stubbornly high even amid other signs of encouragement.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“In my head, I was always looking to get under 100,” Cuomo said. “For me, it’s a sign that we’re making real progress.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The number of hospitalized patients also continued to fall, dropping to over 4,600.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Cuomo announced that the Mid-Hudson region — the area along the Hudson River north of New York City and south of Albany — is set to begin reopening on Tuesday, and Long Island could follow suit Wednesday. \u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>EASING RESTRICTIONS\u003c/p>\u003cp>Cuomo signed an order late Friday allowing people to assemble in groups of as many as 10 as long as they stay at least 6 feet from other people and wear masks when they can't maintain that distance.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The surprise order came hours after the New York Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/2f364ef8ab33cd779c8a93650557de02\">challenging earlier rules\u003c/a> allowing gatherings only for religious services and Memorial Day commemorations.

The AP counted more than 4,500 recovering coronavirus patients sent to nursing homes. \u003c/p>\u003cp>But at Cuomo's news briefing Saturday, aide Melissa DeRosa answered an AP reporter’s question about the internal survey by saying there isn’t “any information we have that we haven’t released at this point.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>The AP has not received the results of the survey, which it first requested May 15.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Cuomo again deflected criticism for the since-rescinded directive that required nursing homes to admit coronavirus patients. The March 25 order had been intended to help free up hospital beds for the sickest patients as cases surged, but critics have said it fueled deadly outbreaks among the state’s most vulnerable population.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We’re in a political environment, I get it,” Cuomo said Saturday, insisting his administration followed U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance. “To the extent people want to politicize this issue ... New York followed the president’s agency’s guidance. So that depoliticizes it.

He needs 1,991 delegates to win the nomination, a threshold he is projected to reach in June.\u003c/p>\u003cp>A total of 35,044 voters cast ballots in the party-run primary. All ballots were cast by mail. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The party had initially planned to hold the primary on April 4 and had expected most party members would vote by mail and some would cast ballots at about 20 in-person polling sites around the state. \u003c/p>\u003cp>It began mailing ballots to registered party members in early March back when Sanders and Biden were the two front-runners and Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard was still maintaining her long-shot bid for the nomination. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>But concerns about the spread of the coronavirus forced the party to announce on March 20 it would cancel plans for in-person voting and allow only mail ballots. To give those who expected to vote in person on April 4 a chance to cast a ballot, the party said it would mail another round of ballots to members and wait until late May for them to be returned and counted. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Amidst these shifts, Gabbard dropped out and endorsed Biden. Sanders ended his bid and endorsed Biden on April 13. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Voters were instructed to mark their top three choices on paper ballots.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Only candidates receiving at least 15% of the votes cast in a given congressional district were to be allocated delegates. Votes for candidates who didn’t receive at least 15% were redistributed to voters’ second-ranked choices, starting with the candidate who received the lowest number of votes.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Gabbard represents Hawaii’s second congressional district in Congress, and got 4% of the vote in the first round of voting. She was absent from the district during much of the year while she campaigned for the presidency in Iowa and New Hampshire. State Sen. Kai Kahele, a fellow Democrat, fiercely criticized her for neglecting her constituents and mounted a campaign for her seat, which covers suburban Honolulu and the more rural islands of the state. Not long after, Gabbard said she wouldn’t run for reelection and would focus on her presidential bid. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Hawaii Democrats hired a contractor, Merriman River Group, to handle aspects of the election, including designing the vote-by-mail package and safely keeping returned ballots. The company has experience running elections for labor unions and organizations such as the Kauai Island Utility Cooperative, the electric utility on Kauai island.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Republican Party of Hawaii canceled its presidential caucus after President Donald Trump was the only candidate to declare for the ballot by the Dec. 2 deadline. The party is committing its national convention delegates to Trump. \u003c/p>","mediaCount":6,"shortId":"1e1e9af1cabb0881dd92f12d7d245a60","localLinkUrl":"https://apnews.com/1e1e9af1cabb0881dd92f12d7d245a60","interactiveLinkUrl":null,"downloadSettings":null,"interactiveLinkUrlText":null,"richEmbeds":null,"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:1e1e9af1cabb0881dd92f12d7d245a60","media":[],"videoContext":null,"tagIds":["VirusOutbreak","apf-GeneralNews","Hawaii","JoeBiden","state-Hawaii","Election2020","BernieSanders","apf-politics","apf-usnews"],"hasTextOverlay":false,"bylines":"By AUDREY McAVOY","leadPhotoId":"ca3420a1c999450eb7eb0255223a0a8f"}],"notificationUrl":null,"textColor":null,"sponsorUrl":null,"teamLimit":null,"cardType":"Wire Story","sponsorServeAd":false,"notificationText":null,"notificationUpdated":null},{"feed":[],"pollUpdated":null,"headlineWidget":false,"dividerColor":null,"tagObjs":[],"sponsorImageUrl":null,"hubPeekLinkText":null,"borderColor":null,"cardTitle":null,"localMemberName":null,"collectionTagObjs":[],"notificationTitle":null,"minimizedStoryCount":null,"shortId":"e2e3ace9fdf5d9cafe9370c77f630378","allowAd":true,"layoutType":"Text","pollWeek":null,"disclaimerText":null,"teams":null,"hubPeekTagName":null,"sponsorAttribution":null,"bracketsSettings":null,"textScale":null,"expandedStoryCount":null,"hubPeekTagId":null,"cardHeadline":null,"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:e2e3ace9fdf5d9cafe9370c77f630378","pollId":null,"contents":[{"embedHeight":null,"contentSponsor":null,"mediumIds":[],"title":"US--Virus Outbreak-Oregon ","headline":"Judge told vacate or explain order nixing virus restrictions","localMemberName":null,"updated":"2020-05-23 21:40:17","contentType":"text","layoutType":"Text","tagObjs":[{"name":"U.S. News","id":"apf-usnews","isPr":null,"order":4},{"name":"Religion","id":"apf-religion","isPr":null,"order":3},{"name":"Kate Brown","id":"KateBrown","isPr":null,"order":0},{"name":"General News","id":"apf-GeneralNews","isPr":false,"order":6},{"name":"Oregon","id":"Oregon","isPr":null,"order":0},{"name":"Business","id":"apf-business","isPr":null,"order":0},{"name":"Courts","id":"Courts","isPr":null,"order":0},{"name":"Virus Outbreak","id":"VirusOutbreak","isPr":null,"order":0}],"embedCaption":null,"gcsUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/contents/urn:publicid:ap.org:e2e3ace9fdf5d9cafe9370c77f630378","embedLinkURL":null,"language":null,"leadVideoId":null,"firstWords":"\u003cp>PORTLAND, Ore.

He also noted that other businesses deemed essential, such as grocery stores, had been allowed to remain open even with large numbers of people present and have relied on masks, social distancing and other measures to protect the public.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The governor’s orders are not required for public safety when plaintiffs can continue to utilize social distancing and safety protocols at larger gatherings involving spiritual worship,” he wrote.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Courts in other states have ruled against similar orders.

John Bel Edwards’ stay-at-home order, which expired that same day.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The ruling by the county judge in Oregon turned on the legal mechanism Brown used to issue her orders. The plaintiffs allege — and the judge agreed — that they were issued under a statute pertaining to public health emergencies, not an older provision that addresses natural disasters such as storms, earthquakes or floods. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The public health statute contains the 28-day time limit, while the other does not contain a time limit.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Brown maintained in court papers that the statue on public health emergencies was intended by the Legislature to supplement, and not supersede, the emergency powers granted her for natural disasters — including disease — and therefore the time limit doesn't apply.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Brown declared a statewide state of emergency due to the virus on March 8 and has issued multiple executive orders since then, including the closure of all schools, nonessential businesses and a ban on dine-in service at restaurants and bars. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Earlier this month, Brown extended the order another 60 days until July 6.

Woods and retired NFL quarterback Peyton Manning will face Phil Mickelson and Tom Brady, who won six Super Bowls with the New England Patriots and signed this year with Tampa Bay.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The match will be at Medalist Golf Club in Hobe Sound, Florida.

Brady remains employed, and this week got in some informal work with his new teammates in Tampa Bay.\u003c/p>\u003cp>No fans will be allowed, just like last week at Seminole.

Woods has 82 career victories to 44 for Mickelson, leads 15-5 in major championships and 11-0 in winning PGA Tour player of the year.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Mickelson won their first made-for-TV match over Thanksgiving weekend in 2018, a pay-per-view event that ran into technical problems and was free for all. Lefty won in a playoff under the lights for $9 million in a winner-take-all match.\u003c/p>\u003cp>He also has a 5-3-1 advantage over Woods in the nine times they have played in the final round on the PGA Tour, most recently in the AT&amp;T Pebble Beach Pro-Am in 2012 when Mickelson shot 64 to a 75 for Woods.\u003c/p>\u003cp>He also stopped two streaks. Woods was going for his seventh straight PGA Tour victory when Mickelson beat him at Torrey Pines in 2000. Later that year, Woods had won 19 consecutive times on the PGA Tour when he had at least a share of the 54-hole lead until Mickelson beat him at the Tour Championship.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Woods, however, captured the streak that mattered, holding off Mickelson in the final group at the Masters in 2001 to hold all four professional majors at the same time.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The banter was lacking in Las Vegas, and perhaps having Manning and Brady will change the dynamics. The broadcast includes Charles Barkley providing commentary and Justin Thomas, whom Woods has embraced, on the course as a reporter in his television debut.\u003c/p>\u003cp>After this exhibition, golf has two weeks before the PGA Tour is set to return at Colonial in Fort Worth, Texas.

Ron DeSantis has said he wants the state open for pro sports, even telling franchises not based in Florida that they could come to the Sunshine State and train if restrictions preventing it existed in their own locales.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Places are opening up. Let’s not forget COVID isn’t magically less contagious now,\" Malcolm Miller of the Toronto Raptors tweeted Saturday. “The virus itself didn’t get better... stay safe.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>Teams have been allowed to welcome players back to their training facilities for voluntary sessions since May 8, and more than half of the league’s franchises have taken advantage of that opportunity.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The next steps along a return-to-play path would likely include a loosening of the restrictions for those voluntary workouts — no more than four players are currently allowed inside any facility at a time — and then a plan for when training camps could open.

That lack of density, highest in wealthy areas, and reliance on cars as the main way to get around serve as shields from the virus.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But many in large inner-city swaths live an opposite reality. Multiple generations sometimes share an apartment. Essential low-wage workers don't have the luxury to telecommute.

But for others, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Los Angeles has far more nursing homes — 388 — than any other county in the state. San Diego, the state's second most populous county with about a third of LA's population, has about one-fifth as many nursing homes. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Barbara Ferrer, public health director for Los Angeles County, who somberly provides COVID-19 statistics at daily briefings recently said the death rates by race and class were “concerning.” People living in areas of high poverty were dying at four times the rate of those in communities of low poverty. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"3605bb2f7a08407da3d923a94f0529a2\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Per 100,000 people, 18 of those who died were African American, 15.5 were Latino, 12 were Asian and nine were white. \u003c/p>\u003cp>It didn’t always look this way. Earlier in the outbreak, as Northern California was harder hit, cases in Los Angeles began to appear in larger numbers in richer parts of town, particularly those closer to the coast. Beverly Hills, Bel Air and Brentwood all had relatively high numbers. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“LA had sort of a distorted picture in the beginning of who was infected,\" said Karin Michels, a UCLA epidemiology professor. \"The wealthier people were able to get the test kits.

gathered Saturday in their cars and on motorbikes in the center of Madrid and other Spanish cities to protest the Spanish government’s handling of the nation’s coronavirus crisis.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The party accuses the government of Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez of lying about the impact of the health crisis and of violating Spaniards’ rights by confining people to their homes and closing businesses during the lockdown. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Vox called for protesters to attend the protests in their vehicles and thus skirt the ban on social gatherings in effect under the nation’s two-month long state of emergency designed to reduce contagion risks. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Vox called the protest the “Caravan for Spain and Liberty.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We will never forget what they have done,” Vox leader Santiago Abascal said from the open-top bus leading the caravan as it inched down a Madrid boulevard. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“Do not doubt that we will make them face justice. They know it and fear our freedom. That is why they try to intimidate us.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>Most cars and motorbikes were decked with Spanish flags. There were also small groups of people who participated on foot, with some not respecting the two-meter social distancing rules. Protests were also held in Barcelona, Sevilla and other provincial capitals. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Spain's government says that the confinement measures have been necessary to save the nation's hospitals from collapse and save thousands of lives. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Sánchez said that the protesters were exercising their constitutional rights, but that he asked them “to respect the criteria, rules, and decisions that health authorities have made.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>“This government will preach for concord, peaceful co-existence, respect and tolerance, and not for hate and rage,” he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Over 28,000 Spaniards have been confirmed to have died from COVID-19. The government says that all the information it makes public on virus deaths and infections are provided by the regions, some of which are governed by opposition parties. No region has accused the government of relaying incorrect data. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Spain’s left-wing coalition government declared a state of emergency on March 14. The lockdown applied under the state of emergency, which has limited the right to free movement and assembly, has successfully reined in the outbreak.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Abascal and another leading Vox politician both fell ill with the virus after holding a massive party rally in early March. The party apologized for going ahead with the rally but blamed the government for not warning the nation of the danger. Abascal and his colleague recovered. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Vox, which is strongly anti-migrant and anti-women’s rights, won its first seats in Spain’s Parliament in April 2019. It then made huge gains in a repeat election in November and is the third-largest party in the legislature.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“I’m here to ask for the government to resign. We are tired of being kept in prison,” said 47-year-old bank employee Almudena Camara at the Madrid protest.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Saturday’s car protest follows a week of small protests in one of Madrid’s wealthiest neighborhoods and other cities that Vox has backed. \u003c/p>\u003cp>With its hospitals now able to handle the smaller load of cases, Spain is slowly moving toward gradually reactivating its economy and recovering social activities. On Monday, Madrid and Barcelona, the two hardest hit areas, will be able to join the rest of the country in reopening 50% of outdoor seating at bars and restaurants and gathering in groups of under 10 people.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Sánchez’s minority government of his Socialists and the left-wing United We Can party is under increasing pressure from opposition parties and some regional leaders to move forward with the rollback to reduce the already huge impact to the economy.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Spanish government spokeswoman María Jesús Montero said Friday that the right to protest “cannot be confused with a right to infect.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>“This is a country where people can protest freely, but we would like them to transmit the truth about what is happening in this country, where the right to expression is protected,” Montero said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Wilson reported from Barcelona.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Follow AP coverage of the virus outbreak at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak\u003c/p>","mediaCount":12,"shortId":"f0c4da9fefffc1d27171ab0c65489549","localLinkUrl":"https://apnews.com/f0c4da9fefffc1d27171ab0c65489549","interactiveLinkUrl":null,"downloadSettings":null,"interactiveLinkUrlText":null,"richEmbeds":null,"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:f0c4da9fefffc1d27171ab0c65489549","media":[],"videoContext":null,"tagIds":["apf-intlnews","Madrid","apf-GeneralNews","VirusOutbreak","apf-europe","Spain"],"hasTextOverlay":false,"bylines":"By JOSEPH WILSON AND ALICIA LEÓN","leadPhotoId":"a78eda5d99ab472e88ef342cbddf98f0"}],"notificationUrl":null,"textColor":null,"sponsorUrl":null,"teamLimit":null,"cardType":"Wire Story","sponsorServeAd":false,"notificationText":null,"notificationUpdated":null},{"feed":[],"pollUpdated":null,"headlineWidget":false,"dividerColor":null,"tagObjs":[],"sponsorImageUrl":null,"hubPeekLinkText":null,"borderColor":null,"cardTitle":null,"localMemberName":null,"collectionTagObjs":[],"notificationTitle":null,"minimizedStoryCount":null,"shortId":"eb7a3b10552688e79e8e8229accbf544","allowAd":true,"layoutType":"Small Photo","pollWeek":null,"disclaimerText":null,"teams":null,"hubPeekTagName":null,"sponsorAttribution":null,"bracketsSettings":null,"textScale":null,"expandedStoryCount":null,"hubPeekTagId":null,"cardHeadline":null,"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:eb7a3b10552688e79e8e8229accbf544","pollId":null,"contents":[{"embedHeight":null,"contentSponsor":null,"mediumIds":["8245d6231b274cc8ae2c03272015c22b","b9930bfabe2249c68fe63f2428964ce8"],"title":"US--SCI--Home Launch-Trump","headline":"Trump to attend Wednesday's NASA astronaut launch in Florida","localMemberName":null,"updated":"2020-05-23 16:45:35","contentType":"text","layoutType":"Small Photo","tagObjs":[{"name":"General News","id":"apf-GeneralNews","isPr":false,"order":0},{"name":"Florida","id":"Florida","isPr":null,"order":0},{"name":"Politics","id":"apf-politics","isPr":null,"order":9},{"name":"Business","id":"apf-business","isPr":null,"order":0},{"name":"Science","id":"apf-science","isPr":null,"order":3},{"name":"Elon Musk","id":"ElonMusk","isPr":null,"order":0},{"name":"United States","id":"UnitedStates","isPr":null,"order":0},{"name":"Michael Pence","id":"MichaelPence","isPr":null,"order":0},{"name":"Donald Trump","id":"DonaldTrump","isPr":null,"order":0}],"embedCaption":null,"gcsUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/contents/urn:publicid:ap.org:eb7a3b10552688e79e8e8229accbf544","embedLinkURL":null,"language":null,"leadVideoId":null,"firstWords":"\u003cp>STERLING, Va.

Hunter-Reay’s victory was selected by both Will Power and Takuma Sato.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“In my era of racing, the year that Hunter-Reay and Helio went at it,” said Power, the 2018 winner. “That was probably one of the most epic finishes.

It was quite exciting.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>Defending race winner Simon Pagenaud, who made it back-to-back victories for Team Penske last year, could actually recall nearly 20 years of past 500s because he studies them.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I try to learn from past maneuvers and manage new maneuvers and last year I came out with a new maneuver right at the end of the race that was based on bits of other moves throughout the years,” he explained.\u003c/p>\u003cp>As for his favorite, the Frenchman selected 1991 when Rick Mears beat Michael Andretti to join the club of four-time winners. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“They were really going at it. It was a different track, they had the apron, they could use the apron, which created really exciting racing,” Pagenaud said. “Rick Mears that day was definitely in his element and he had that move on the outside of Turn 1 that will always be one of my best memories.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>Alexander Rossi actually won the 100th running of the 500 as an IndyCar rookie after pulling the plug on his Formula One pursuits. Because he had grown up chasing a European racing career, Rossi didn’t quite grasp the overwhelming experience of the race or its place in history. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Then he won.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I went into that race with no expectation of winning it. Never, at any point during that race, did I allow myself to think I was going to win,” Rossi said. “So it was all such a shock. My early impression of the 500 was that there was a lot of ‘extra’ and the biggest relief was when we got to get into the car and just drive. Then I win the race. I had no real idea of what to expect and it took a little bit to really sink in, and then suddenly, I saw it. I saw what is so special about Indy. Now I have a new respect for it, and a pent-up desire to win again.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>He naturally ranks that win as the best 500, but the American also enjoyed last year’s race when he finished second to Pagenaud.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I’d say the 2019 Indy 500 is the one I’m the most proud of, even though we finished second,” Rossi said. “We came back from a bad pit stop and had some frustrating hold-ups on track. But we were able to overcome all that and be there at the end, with a genuine shot at winning.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>With the newest winners weighing in, Hunter-Reay's victory in 2014 becomes the sixth to receive multiple votes from the Indy 500 winners as the greatest race. The others:\u003c/p>\u003cp>Along with Unser's victory in 1992, his duel and defeat to Emerson Fittipaldi in the 1989 race; the 2006 race, when Sam Hornish Jr. passed Andretti within sight of the finish; the 1982 battle between Mears and Gordon Johncock; and the 2011 race won by the late Dan Wheldon.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Perhaps it was Unser’s close call three years earlier, when he touched tires with Fittipaldi and crashed with a lap to go, that made the first of his two victories such a popular one.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The crash-filled ’92 race came down to the final 12 laps, when Michael Andretti appeared on his way to a long-awaited win. But after leading 160 laps, and building a 28-second lead, the fuel pump in his car shut down and Andretti rolled to a stop in the short chute to bring out the caution.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The race restarted with seven laps to go, and Unser and Goodyear went toe-to-toe. Unser wobbled just a bit in the final corner, Goodyear weaved behind him down the straightaway, then dove inside as the two cars crossed the finish line in a blur - the margin of Unser’s victory officially 0.043 seconds, closest in race history.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Seeing him take the checkered flag was one of the greatest moments of my life,” said his father, Al Unser Sr., one of three drivers to have won four Indy 500s.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Not surprisingly, it was his son’s choice for best. It might have been Goodyear’s pick, too.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The finish between Hornish and Andretti, it took me until then to finally get it,” said Goodyear, who helped broadcast that 2006 race for ABC. “I was taken in by it. Oh man, it was close. And it was like, ‘Now I understand how cool the end of our race was.’”\u003c/p>\u003cp>1989\u003c/p>\u003cp>Fittipaldi called the first of his two wins “without a doubt” the greatest race in history. He nearly ended up in the wall with Unser Jr. after the two touched tires, but Fittipaldi made a dramatic save and then completed the final lap under caution to win.\u003c/p>\u003cp>2006\u003c/p>\u003cp>Michael Andretti and Marco Andretti both led in the final laps, but father faltered and son was passed by Hornish a mere 450 feet from the line in the third-closest finish in race history.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The way he went through traffic was just incredible and that allowed him to close the gap enough,” Mears said. “That was one of the most exciting ones I’ve seen.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>1982\u003c/p>\u003cp>Johncock and Mears spent the final 40 laps engaged in a two-man race, putting an entire lap between them and the rest of the field. Johncock wound up winning by 0.16 seconds.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Mears was coming like a freight train and Johncock was just trying to hang on,” recalled 1969 winner Mario Andretti, who had crashed out of the race. “That was a nail-biter.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>2011\u003c/p>\u003cp>J.R.

Ilhan Omar's metamorphosis from refugee to the first Somali-American in Congress has been well-documented. Now, Omar is out with a new memoir that offers her own spin on her path to prominence, starting with her childhood in Mogadishu. “This is What America Looks Like: My Journey from Refugee to Congresswoman,” set for release Tuesday, offers no revelations on some of the controversies that have dogged Omar. Instead, it sketches rugged years that Omar says made her a fearless fighter, unafraid to skirmish with \u003ca href=\"http://apnews.com/f2b66f5807cd44d78745a7be8f342829\">President Donald Trump \u003c/a> and her frequent conservative critics.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>A YOUNG FIGHTER\u003c/p>\u003cp>In her memoir, written with Rebecca Paley, Omar recounts taking on a much taller boy when she was just 7, rubbing his face in the sand after he picked on someone weaker.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I wasn’t afraid of fighting. I felt like I was bigger and stronger than everyone else — even if I knew that wasn’t really the case,” she wrote. It's a theme woven throughout the book, including after she arrived in America and settled in Arlington, Virginia, knowing almost no English. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Omar got into fights in middle school to show she wasn't afraid, she writes, and she describes incidents in which she choked one boy until he foamed at the mouth and kept hitting another girl even after being told the girl was pregnant.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Fighting didn’t feel like a choice. It was a part of me. Respect goes both ways,” she wrote. \u003c/p>\u003cp>LIFE IN SOMALIA\u003c/p>\u003cp>Omar said she grew up the youngest of seven in a loud, opinionated middle-class family, living in a guarded compound in Mogadishu. Her father’s clan was one of the country’s most powerful, and her mother, who died when she was in preschool, was Benadiri, a Somali ethnic minority. Omar, who described herself as a tomboy, said the only place she fit in was within the walls of her family home. Civil war broke out when she was 8, and after her family's compound came under attack by militia, the family escaped and eventually made it to a refugee camp in Kenya, where Omar spent four years before the family moved to the U.S.\u003c/p>\u003cp>LOVE AND STRUGGLES\u003c/p>\u003cp>Omar recounts meeting her first husband, Ahmed Hirsi, in Minneapolis when she was 16. She said they were in love, and shortly before she turned 19, their families decided they should marry.\u003c/p>\u003cp>By 2008, Omar was struggling. Finances were a stressor, she had two small children, and she began questioning her relationships, including her marriage. Since the couple had married religiously – not civilly -- to get divorced, Hirsi had to simply declare the marriage ended, Omar wrote.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>She then had what she called “a Britney Spears-style meltdown” in which she shaved her head and eloped with a man, Ahmed Nur Said Elmi, whom she wrote she “spent so little time with that I wouldn’t even make him a footnote in my story if it weren’t for the fact that this event turned into \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/cc2ccd70de56405098d2f259bf0e46c5\">the main headline later on\u003c/a>.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>In the book, Omar doesn’t name Elmi or say how they met or when their relationship ended.

Omar again denies those claims, saying they originated from a post in an online Somali discussion forum that she said was a last-ditch effort to sink her campaign.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“That Somalis were some of my harshest critics might seem absurd. But they refused to accept me because I refused to kiss the ring. It goes back to my inability since childhood to submit to bullies,” she wrote. \u003c/p>\u003cp>PUBLIC LIFE\u003c/p>\u003cp>Omar was elected to the state Legislature in 2016, knocking off a 44-year incumbent. She describes a statehouse “hostile to my presence” because of her determination to attack the status quo, and recounts confronting a fellow Democratic lawmaker unhappy she'd won a leadership position.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The lawmaker told Omar she was different, and eventually said it was because she walks into a room “like a man.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“A white man,” Omar said she responded.\u003c/p>\u003cp>As a congresswoman, Omar has come under fire for \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/8626ad32183c431a8cdc1fdcaa1cb1d5\">controversial statements\u003c/a>, and has been the \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/186eed93ab024f43a8f5d26f47088122\">subject of attacks\u003c/a> and \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/d1307a4d2e454cecbf0275f9dce6582e\">falsehoods\u003c/a> by critics.

The two hardest-hit areas — the capital, Colombo, and Gampaha district — have been under a 24-hour curfew since March, with residents allowed to leave home once a week. In the rest of the island nation, the curfew has been in force from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. on working days and all day long on other days.

The guidelines said karaoke microphones must be cleaned after each use, and workers should wash their hands and gargle every 30 minutes. A customer and worker can sit together, but one empty seat must be kept in between another customer. Visitors from abroad who didn’t undergo a 14-day quarantine will be refused at the door. More than a million women are estimated to work at cabarets, with more at the cheaper places. Their income has plunged amid the outbreak, as major companies instruct employees to work from home.

And maybe it does; maybe it doesn’t. But if it doesn’t, you’re not going to get sick or die. This is a pill that’s been used for a long time — for 30, 40 years on the malaria and on lupus too, and even on arthritis, I guess, from what I understand.” — remarks Monday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>TRUMP: “It doesn’t hurt people.” — remarks Tuesday after a GOP policy lunch.\u003c/p>\u003cp>THE FACTS: He’s wrong to assert there is no risk of harm if people take the malaria drug to try to prevent a coronavirus infection. Trump’s own health agencies have cautioned that taking hydroxychloroquine to stave off the virus could be dangerous due to side effects. If the president is to be believed, he's taking the drug himself.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump repeatedly has pushed hydroxychloroquine, with or without the antibiotic azithromycin. No large, rigorous studies have found them safe or effective for COVID-19, and they can cause heart rhythm problems and other serious side effects. The Food and Drug Administration has warned against the drug combination and said hydroxychloroquine should only be used for the coronavirus in hospitals and research settings.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Two large observational studies, each involving about 1,400 patients in New York, recently found no benefit from hydroxychloroquine. Two new ones in the journal BMJ, \u003ca href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m1844\">one by French researchers\u003c/a> and \u003ca href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m1849\">the other from China\u003c/a>, reached the same conclusion. \u003c/p>\u003cp>On Friday, a \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/a6c06113305f2084af2bf3b92cc8813f\">study published by the journal Lancet\u003c/a> suggested that hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, with or without an antibiotic, did not help hospitalized patients and was tied to a greater risk of death or heart rhythm problems. Although it was observational rather than a rigorous test, it’s by far the largest so far to examine these drugs in real-world settings — nearly 100,000 patients in 671 hospitals on six continents. Researchers estimated that the death rate attributable to use of the drugs, with or without an antibiotic such as azithromycin, is roughly 13% versus 9% for patients not taking them.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The drug has been available for decades to treat the mosquito-borne illness malaria; it is also prescribed for some lupus and arthritis patients.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Technically, doctors can already prescribe the drug to patients with COVID-19, a practice known as off-label prescribing.

They were very old, almost dead. It was a ‘Trump enemy statement.'” — remarks Tuesday after GOP policy lunch. \u003c/p>\u003cp>THE FACTS: There’s no evidence of a political plot at the Department of Veterans Affairs or elsewhere to produce a study pointing to poor outcomes for veterans who took hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 in a bid to make Trump look bad. That \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/a5077c7227b8eb8b0dc23423c0bbe2b2\">study was led by independent researchers\u003c/a> — at the University of Virginia and University of South Carolina — and grants from the National Institutes of Health and the Virginia school paid for the work. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The study \u003ca href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.16.20065920v1.full.pdf\">released last month\u003c/a> found no benefit from hydroxychloroquine. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The analysis, conducted by the researchers with VA approval, was not a rigorous experiment, nor was it peer-reviewed. Still, with 368 patients, it was the largest look at hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 at the time. Researchers stressed a “great and immediate need” to conduct the analysis due to limited scientific evidence on the drug's safety and “increasingly widespread use\" both as a way to prevent COVID-19 and to treat it.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Researchers analyzed medical records of male veterans hospitalized with confirmed coronavirus infection at VA medical centers who died or were discharged by April 11. About 28% of veterans who were given hydroxychloroquine plus usual care died, versus 11% of those getting routine care alone. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“These findings highlight the importance of awaiting the results of ongoing prospective, randomized, controlled studies before widespread adoption of these drugs,” the researchers wrote. \u003c/p>\u003cp>It’s also a point that Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious diseases expert and a member of the White House coronavirus task force, has repeatedly made, urging caution on the drug. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\"Although there is anecdotal evidence that hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin may benefit people with COVID-19, we need solid data,” Fauci said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>No drug has been approved for treating the disease, although several have “emergency use” authorization.

And the study came out. The people were ready to die. Everybody was old, had bad problems with hearts, diabetes, and everything else you can imagine.” — remarks Tuesday at Cabinet meeting.\u003c/p>\u003cp>VA SECRETARY ROBERT WILKIE: “They did not even look at what the president just mentioned — the various comorbidities that the patients who were referenced in that study had.” — Cabinet meeting Tuesday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>WILKIE: “The analysis did not adjust for patients’ clinical status.” — letter on April 29 to veterans’ groups.\u003c/p>\u003cp>THE FACTS: Trump and his VA secretary are incorrect. Researchers did use standard statistical methods to adjust for differences in the groups being compared, including clinical status and the presence of other chronic health conditions. They did not cherry-pick only the oldest or sickest ones who took the drug. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Even though the VA hospital patients given the drug tended to be sicker than those in the comparison group, researchers still saw no benefit from the drug after taking that into account.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The study included all VA patients treated with the drug. One of the measurements was whether it helped prevent the need for breathing machines. It didn't.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Researchers did not track side effects, but noted there was hints hydroxychloroquine might have damaged other organs. The drug has long been known to have potentially serious side effects such as altering the heartbeat in a way that could lead to sudden death.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The study noted that the median age of the test group was over 65, meaning half the patients were below that and half above it.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The NIH and others have more rigorous tests underway.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>OBESITY\u003c/p>\u003cp>HOUSE SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI, D-Calif., on Trump's statement that he's taking hydroxychloroquine: “He’s our president and I would rather he not be taking something that has not been approved by the scientists, especially in his age group and in his, shall we say, weight group — morbidly obese, they say.” — interview Tuesday on CNN.\u003c/p>\u003cp>THE FACTS: Trump is not \"morbidly” obese. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump is 73. At his last full checkup in February 2019 he passed the official threshold for being considered obese, with a body mass index of 30.4. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an index of 40 or above is considered “severe” obesity, which some also call “morbid” obesity. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Pelosi's statement was not purely or even primarily an expression of concern about the president's health. She said later she was giving him “a dose of his own medicine” for his history of putting down women for their weight.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>VETERANS\u003c/p>\u003cp>TRUMP: “We’ve done the greatest job maybe of anything in the VA, because I got VA Choice ... approved.\" — remarks Monday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>TRUMP: “You know we got the Veterans Choice.\" — remarks Friday at veterans' event.\u003c/p>\u003cp>THE FACTS: False.

Internal VA emails obtained by The Associated Press reveal that some veterans are being turned away, even when private doctors are available to see them.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The program allows veterans to see a private doctor for primary or mental health care if their VA wait is 20 days (28 for specialty care) or their drive to a VA facility is 30 minutes or more.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But since the program’s expansion in June 2018, the VA has not seen a major increase in veterans seeking private care. Two months ago, after the coronavirus outbreak, the VA also took the step of restricting veterans’ access to private doctors, citing the added risks of infection and limited capacity at private hospitals.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Under the temporary guidelines, the VA is reviewing referrals for nonemergency care “on a case-by-case basis for immediate clinical need and with regard to the safety of the veteran when being seen in-person, regardless of wait time or drive time eligibility,” according to VA spokeswoman Christina Noel.

Billingslea said they agreed to meet, talk about their objectives and find a way to begin negotiations.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Suffice to say, this won’t be easy. It is new,” Billingslea said, adding that the U.S. fully expects Russia to help bring China to the table. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Russian officials and many arms control experts agree that China, as a rising power, should be part of a nuclear arms accord, but they are eyeing the calendar. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“It’s really hard to see how, in the midst of a pandemic that would make actual in-person negotiations quite difficult, you’re going to get something done and ratified and in force before the New START treaty expires on Feb. 5, 2021,” said Alexandra Bell at the \u003ca href=\"https://armscontrolcenter.org/\">Center for Arms Control and Non-proliferation\u003c/a>. \u003c/p>\u003cp>They note how Trump's reelection campaign, the coronavirus pandemic and the economic problems it has created are consuming a lot of time.

If it were to collapse, it would be the first time in 50 years that the U.S. does not have the ability to inspect Russian nuclear forces, said Rose Gottemoeller, a former undersecretary of state for arms control and international security. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“Every time they (the Russians) take a missile out of a silo and take it to a maintenance facility, they have to notify us that that missile’s going to move. ... The intelligence community is simply going to have a much harder time knowing what’s going on,\" she said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>But Trump has accused Russia of not living up to agreements. He cited Russian violations in his announcement Thursday that the U.S. would withdraw from the Open Skies Treaty. While the U.S. has officially given its required six-month notice of withdrawal, Trump hinted that he may reconsider and stay in the pact. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump also blamed Russian violations for his decision last year to \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/65d75aef66234b07abd82143762b7493\">pull out\u003c/a> of the 1987 \u003ca href=\"https://2009-2017.state.gov/t/avc/trty/102360.htm\">Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty\u003c/a> that banned production, testing and deployment of intermediate-range land-based cruise and ballistic missiles. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/cc698c4ee650c4bb9bb9232d12571676\">Russia’s Foreign Ministry\u003c/a> on Friday accused the U.S. of aiming to dismantle security pacts.

For us, we have to do it a certain way,” she said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>For Schall and other students at technical and trade colleges, the coronavirus is disrupting their education in a very different way than that of more traditional college students. Learning how to stick a needle in someone’s vein or mix just the right amount of hair color for the perfect shade doesn't translate well to Zoom meetings. Those specialized skills, known as career and technical education, require hands-on learning. \u003c/p>\u003cp>About 8.4 million students are seeking postsecondary certificates and associate degrees in career and technical education fields, according to the Association for Career and Technical Education. Many are black or Hispanic and come from low-income households, according to the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce analysis. For many, technical careers are a path out of poverty. Roughly 30 million American jobs that pay a median income of $55,000 require less education than a bachelor’s degree, the ACTE reports. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Across the country, teachers and students in technical training classes have had to adapt to class closures rapidly and creatively. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Butler Tech, which teaches Ohio high school and post-secondary students subjects ranging from police academy to welding, has started slowly reopening campus after being closed for several weeks. \u003c/p>\u003cp>When the pandemic first hit, it had to transition to online learning quickly. Jon Graft, the school’s superintendent and CEO, said Butler has learned some valuable lessons about having to teach in a completely different way.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“There will be a new normal for us because of the lessons we’ve learned being forced upon being online and virtual learning,” Graft said. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>In Linda Romano’s New York high school nursing aide class, students at home used frying pans to learn how to use a bedpan on a patient. Romano used a doll she found in her daughter’s old bedroom to demonstrate how to perform a bed bath. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“I think they’re getting a better education because they’re really, really thinking about this skill and the aspects that go along with it,” Romano said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>As part of his agriculture courses at a high school near Columbus, Missouri, Scott Stone leads a greenhouse class each year where students grow and tend plants on site. Stone, a teacher for 23 years, had never taught online when students were sent home in March.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Because the students can’t access the greenhouse, they are taking care of plants at home. Stone talks with them about their weekly development, asking them to describe what the plants smell and feel like. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“It’s like being a first-year teacher all over again,” Stone said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The stakes are higher for postsecondary students like Tara Ferguson, who is studying to become a phlebotomist at Atlanta Technical College. Ferguson was heading into a hands-on area of instruction when schools began to close and shift to online learning. \u003c/p>\u003cp>But, as anyone who has had blood drawn would likely agree, the intricacies of feeling for a vein and poking it with a needle “just can’t be done online,” Ferguson said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>For Ferguson, a pharmacy technician and single mom of a 13-year-old daughter, becoming a phlebotomist would be a bump in pay and more stability.\u003c/p>\u003cp>She was supposed to start the clinical side of her education, when students train at a local medical facility to draw blood from various types of patients, on May 18.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But as the date approached and uncertain whether the class would go forward, she decided to drop it. So instead of completing her studies in August, getting her certification and going into the workforce, she hopes she can finish by early next year.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“This will put it way back.

It said class sizes should be halved and limited to a maximum of 15, and that children should be separated into the same small groups.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Waugh’s school group, the True Learning Partnership in Cheshire, is doing that and more.\u003c/p>\u003cp>He is planning to split students into “mini school” zones, each with separate entrances, daily timetables and play areas. Meals will be delivered to classrooms. Teachers’ desks will be 2-meter “exclusion zones” ringed off with tape. Even the cutlery will be assigned to separate groups.\u003c/p>\u003cp>It’s “more than feasible” to make schools safe, he said, even if it’s a “logistical nightmare.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>English schools will be following those in Denmark, Germany, France and elsewhere that are easing restrictions. Proponents say the effect of being away from the classroom has been felt keenly by the most disadvantaged families.\u003c/p>\u003cp>A report from the Institute for Fiscal Studies said school closures will almost certainly increase educational inequality. Wealthier children are spending 30% more time on home learning during lockdown — about 5.8 hours a day — than those in poorer families and have access to better resources like online tutors, it found. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Working parents, too, are increasingly frustrated about working from home with children. Sarah Hesz, a mother of three, says that after considering the risks, she plans to send her 5-year-old back to school next month.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“People are so torn, worried and confused about what is best,” said Hesz, who works for a childcare app. “There is a massive part of me that want my kids to be learning again, to be with their friends again. At the moment, it's just impossible. I can't home school my kids and work.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>But it’s a tough sell for many, and one key concern is the risk of infection from children to adults. The confusion was highlighted when the doctors union, the British Medical Association, first backed teachers who oppose a June 1 reopening, only to change its stance days later.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The BMA said Wednesday that while there was growing evidence that the virus risk to children is extremely small, there is conflicting evidence about the likelihood of children spreading it to others.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“A zero-risk approach is not possible,” it concluded. “This is about ‘safe’ being an acceptable level of risk.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Jonathan Van-Tam, the deputy chief medical officer for England, acknowledged that data on how infectious children are is “pretty sparse.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“There are significant welfare and wellbeing issues for children who are out (of school) months and months on end.

In Minnesota, after Democratic Gov. Tim Walz this week declined to lift restrictions on churches, Roman Catholic and some Lutheran leaders said they would defy his ban and resume worship services.

But the White House dragged its feet, concerned that the recommendations were too specific and could give the impression the administration was interfering in church operations.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The guidance posted Friday contains most of the same advice as the draft guidance. It calls for the use of face coverings and recommends keeping worshippers 6 feet from one another and cutting down on singing, which can spread aerosolized drops that carry the virus. \u003c/p>\u003cp>But there are some differences. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The draft guidance discussed reopening in steps. A first phase would have limited gatherings to video streaming and drive-in services. Later phases allow in-person gatherings of limited size and only when social distancing precautions could be followed. The new guidance has no discussion of such phases.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Another difference: The draft guidance said everyone who attends a service should wear a face covering, while the new guidance says

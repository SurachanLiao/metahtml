Health care workers in China are among the affected.</p><p class="p1">Thailand, South Korea and Japan have also reported cases of the illness, which is part of the same family of coronaviruses as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed 800 people globally during 2002-03. SARS also began in China, where officials initially tried to conceal the severity of the situation.</p> <del><img src="https://postmediatorontosun.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/1194134288.jpg-e1579320630664.jpeg?quality=60&amp;strip=all&amp;w=640"></del> <p>Symptoms of the coronavirus that originated in Wuhan include fever and difficulty in breathing.</p><p class="p1">Scientists with the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College in London <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/news--wuhan-coronavirus/">released a paper</a> three days ago that said 1,700 is a more likely number of cases in Wuhan, based on the population and time between infection and detection. <span class="s5">The report concluded, <span class="s4"> <ins>“Surveillance</ins> </span> <del>“Surveillance</del> should be expanded to include all hospitalized cases of pneumonia or severe respiratory disease in the Wuhan area,” and connected cities.</span></p><p class="p1">According to AFP,<a href="https://news.yahoo.com/sars-virus-spreads-china-nearly-140-cases-015137885.html">person to person</a> transmission was confirmed Monday by respiratory expert Zhong Nanshan.</p><p class="p1">The news is particularly worrisome as Wuhan is a major transportation hub and hundreds of millions of people in China will travel by train and plane this week to take part in Lunar New Year celebrations — the largest annual human migration on the planet.</p><p class="p1">The large crowds and close quarters of mass travel are an ideal environment for the transmission of this or any other influenza.</p><p class="p1">Public Health Canada says there is low risk of infection here.</p><p class="p1">Arrival screens in the international airports in Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver will include messages asking travellers from Wuhan to speak to border service personnel if they have any symptoms of the flu-like virus.</p><p class="p1">According to Toronto emergency room physician Brett Belchetz, that’s not good enough.</p><p class="p1">Belchetz believes Canada needs thermal scanners at ports of entry, just as other countries have. He has first-hand experience that incoming passengers often lie about their health and where they’ve travelled.</p><p class="p1">Belchetz was the admitting physician for the youngest patient who died in Toronto of SARS during the 2002-03 crisis.</p><p class="p1">That patient lied about his symptoms and his travel history, he added.</p><p class="p1">“We cannot rely on patients being honest,” said Belchetz. “We must become much more pro-active about this. The reaction — to rely on patients admitting symptoms, is definitely not adequate.</p><p class="p1">“And you can’t be too careful here. You can never be too careful.”</p><p class="p1">Doris Grinspun, CEO of the Registered Nurses’ Association of Ontario (RNAO), expressed  exactly the same concerns, insisting, “we have to be smart, especially at the airports.”</p><p class="p1">It was her organization that called for the public inquiry into SARS “because, at the time, there was, in fact, no plan in place — believe it or not!”</p> <ul class="related_links"><li><ins><a href="https://torontosun.com/news/world/as-coronavirus-spreads-to-more-chinese-cities-lunar-new-year-travel-adds-to-containment-worries/wcm/0130520e-2652-4d44-b976-c784d343d452">As coronavirus spreads to more Chinese cities, Lunar New Year travel adds to containment worries Link: https://torontosun.com/news/world/as-coronavirus-spreads-to-more-chinese-cities-lunar-new-year-travel-adds-to-containment-worries/wcm/0130520e-2652-4d44-b976-c784d343d452 </a></ins></li><ins> </ins><li><ins><a href="https://torontosun.com/news/local-news/deadly-virus-looking-back-at-torontos-sars-outbreak">DEADLY VIRUS: Looking back at Toronto's SARS outbreak Link: https://torontosun.com/news/local-news/deadly-virus-looking-back-at-torontos-sars-outbreak </a></ins></li><ins> </ins><li><ins><a href="https://torontosun.com/news/world/china-reports-new-cases-in-wuhan-virus-outbreak/wcm/178c618a-36bb-4c05-afd2-2811b09d4816">China reports new cases in Wuhan virus outbreak Link: https://torontosun.com/news/world/china-reports-new-cases-in-wuhan-virus-outbreak/wcm/178c618a-36bb-4c05-afd2-2811b09d4816 </a></ins></li><ins> </ins></ul> <p class="p1">The nurses association has alerted politicians and public health agencies that the time has come to follow the precautionary principle — and move fast to put in place whatever measures are required to prevent harm.</p><p class="p4"><span class="s4"> <ins><span class="s3">D</span>uring</ins> <del>During</del> SARS, recalled Grinspun, what unfolded instead was a reactionary principle.</span></p><p class="p4"><span class="s4">(An example: nurses were asked not to wear surgical masks so as not to frighten patients, as the SARS crisis was believed to be over. It was not over.)</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">A simple question on border control forms: “Have you been in China?” would be a good start, said Grinspun, who also believes that self-reporting isn’t useful. Better to get something on a form that has the person’s name on it, and can be traced back to him or her.</span></p><p>There’s a better incentive to tell the truth.</p><p class="p1">As well, there should be official warnings to emergency room doctors and all other primary medical sites, such as walk-in clinics.</p><p class="p1">“We don’t want to create panic,” said Grinspun. “We just want to be smart. We want them to listen to health-care professionals on the front line of this.</p><p class="p1">“Last time, they did not.”</p><p class="p5">No health care professionals interviewed for this story were impressed with the anti-virus efforts so far. As one doctor put it, “infection control and hallway medicine don’t really co-exist.”</p><p class="p5">Asked for a statement on the coronavirus, a health ministry spokesman offered a list of steps undertaken to ensure health and safety; the first step was monitoring our hospitals for potential cases of the coronavirus.</p><p class="p5">Someone will need to tell Health Minister Christine Elliott that at the point she has cases being identified in a hospital, it’s already too late.</p></article>

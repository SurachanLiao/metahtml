This palpably shows the true nature of the US as the main culprit behind terrorism.”</span></p><p><span>The North Korean government claims that in fact, back in May that it had foiled a US and South Korean plot to kill its Supreme Leader.</span></p><p><span>They captured a  man  who happened to be going by the name of  “Kim” (I give them a zero for creativity here). They went on to say that “Kim” had been paid to carry out an attack with biological substances.</span></p><p><span>In all honesty, really guys over at the CIA, what did you send ‘heinous’ rookies in to do a man’s job or something?</span></p><p><span>By the way, it should be noted that North Korea has a history of making false statements, accusations and basically just making shit up that cannot be verified. </span></p><p><span>The CIA has basically not comment on this one, no doubt likely due to laughing hysterically over the accusation. </span></p><p><span>All kidding aside, if the CIA had wanted Kim Jong-Un dead (which a lot of people do let’s just be honest here), Kim Jong-Un, would be dead. </span></p><p><span>The CIA does not screw around with assassination attempts, they are pretty serious and if they feel that they need to attempt one, it’s a fairly slim chance that you’d ever know the CIA would have been behind it. </span></p><p><span>And Kim Jong-Un is a fairly easy target. </span></p><p><span>Too many people on the inside can be bought in particular, on the inside of North Korea’s regime many people can be bought for the right price. </span></p><p><span>If Kim is under some misguided delusion that anyone is really loyal to him, he may want to sit down and really think that one through. </span></p><p><span>No one is truly loyal to Kim Jong-Un, no one.</span></p><p><span>Fear of being murdered at the request of your country’s leader and loyalty are two very different things my friend. </span></p><p><span>Cristal M Clark</span></p><p><a href="https://apple.news/TQl7IRxuXQqaBdPnt023HIA"><span>IOS users can find The Crime Shop on Apple News</span></a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/thecimeshop"><span>@thecrimeshop on twitter</span></a></p><p><a href="https://gab.ai/thecrimeshop"><span>And https://gab.ai/thecrimeshop</span></a></p><h3 class="sd-title">Share this:</h3><ul><li class="share-twitter"><a href="https://twitter.com/share" class="twitter-share-button">Tweet</a></li></ul><h3 class="sd-title">Like this:</h3><p class="likes-widget-placeholder post-likes-widget-placeholder"><span class="button"><span>Like</span></span> <span class="loading">Loading...</span></p><p id="jp-relatedposts" class="jp-relatedposts"></p><h3 class="jp-relatedposts-headline">Related</h3> <p id="respond" class="comment-respond"><ins></ins></p><h3 id="reply-title" class="comment-reply-title"><ins>What are your thoughts <a rel="nofollow" id="cancel-comment-reply-link" href="/2017/10/09/kim-jong-un-survives-us-assassination-plot/#respond">Cancel reply Link: /2017/10/09/kim-jong-un-survives-us-assassination-plot/#respond </a></ins></h3><ins> </ins><p class="comment-form-field comment-textarea"><ins>Enter your comment here...

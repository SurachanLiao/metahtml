There will be two seatings of one and half hours each, starting at 5 pm on Friday and Saturday and 1 pm on Sunday. This idea was modeled after a similar program in Paso Robles and is designed to encourage residents to support local restaurants by getting food to go and picnic in the park in a stanchion designated area, across from the Library, near Sixth Street and Orange Avenue. The City will provide a maître d’ to greet guests and another employee to service tables.</ins></p><p><ins>Reservations can be made through the Chamber of Commerce at 619-435-9260.  City Manager Blair King indicated that he, along with many others, already has reservations and they will see how successful the program is to consider expanding it; but he is hopeful that things will open up in a couple of weeks, so restaurants can resume indoor service.</ins></p><p><ins>King commented, “Picnicking is already allowed; we are just formalizing this with precautions. We are not encouraging large gatherings.” When asked what types of alcohol would be allowed, he laughed and said it was all inclusive, even “Grandma’s special recipe with gin.” He confirmed that this motion had nothing to do with allowing food trucks. City Councilmember Sandke suggested designating curb space for food delivery.</ins></p><p><ins>Waiving parking restrictions to allow certain businesses to operate outdoors on private parking lots was the next approved motion. This mainly impacts fitness centers and gyms, allowing them to temporarily operate outdoors for the duration of the County Health Order which forbids them to have clients indoors. Another motion was approved to help gyms continue to operate in public spaces, allowing them to utilize Spreckels Park, Bradley Field, and the beach to hold outdoor classes. The Council delegated the special use permit issuance to city staff and waived fees, also permitting other allowed spaces to be designated by the Parks and Recreation Department. For more information about obtaining a permit please contact Director of Parks and Recreation, Roger Miller at <a href="mailto:rmiller@coronado.ca.us">rmiller@coronado.ca.us Link: mailto:rmiller@coronado.ca.us </a>.</ins></p><p><ins>This variance applies to Coronado-based brick and mortar gyms that currently have fitness classes. King said that they have had many requests by individuals previously, but Coronado is a park deficient city with only three park acres per thousand people, so parks space is a precious commodity. Designated times will be from 7 am to noon, with no amplified music or microphones allowed. Councilmember Sandke pointed out that noise complaints could shut this down.</ins></p><p><ins>Equipment, such as weights are allowed, but not stationary bikes that could potentially damage areas. Mayor Bailey advised that they follow the County Health Guidelines with regards to the class size of 12. Classes can be scheduled in 90-minute blocks. There was some concern about Little League allowing the use of Bradley Field, which currently can only be used for camps and not games. The Mayor and King pointed out that permission was not needed because it is City-owned, and it was important to allow these local businesses to continue. The Mayor did jokingly say that maybe the businesses using Bradley Field will become Little League sponsors.</ins></p><p><ins>The motion that failed was one that would have allowed personal service businesses, like barbershops and hair salons to operate outdoors. The Council did not feel that this was sanitary and that it would not be authorized by the State Board.</ins></p><p class="item-details"><ins></ins></p><h3 class="entry-title td-module-title"><ins><a href="https://coronadotimes.com/news/2020/07/16/church-book-club-tackles-waking-up-white-brave-spaces/" rel="bookmark" title="Church Book Club Tackles “Waking Up White,” Brave Spaces">Church Book Club Tackles “Waking Up White,” Brave Spaces  Link: https://coronadotimes.com/news/2020/07/16/church-book-club-tackles-waking-up-white-brave-spaces/ </a></ins></h3><ul class="td-category"><li class="entry-category"><ins><a href="https://coronadotimes.com/news/category/community/community-news/">Community News Link: https://coronadotimes.com/news/category/community/community-news/ </a></ins></li></ul><ins> </ins><ins><a href="https://coronadotimes.com/news/author/alylawson/">Aly Lawson Link: https://coronadotimes.com/news/author/alylawson/ </a></ins><p class="td-author-line"><ins>-</ins></p><ins><span class="td-post-date">07/16/2020 </span></ins><p class="td-post-comments"><ins><a href="https://coronadotimes.com/news/2020/07/16/church-book-club-tackles-waking-up-white-brave-spaces/#respond">0  Link: https://coronadotimes.com/news/2020/07/16/church-book-club-tackles-waking-up-white-brave-spaces/#respond </a></ins></p><p><ins>Christ Church in Coronado is hosting a weekly book club currently reading Waking Up White, and kicking off a Sacred Ground educational series that’s part of a global church effort to have deeper discussions on race and faith.</ins></p><p><ins>Charlette Preslar, the church’s director of youth and family ministries as well as chaplain of Christ Church Day School, discussed how we’re all children of God who need to choose to participate in a brave space.</ins></p><p><ins>The church decided to take up the book as an introduction to the existing worldwide <a href="https://episcopalchurch.org/sacred-ground" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sacred Ground Link: https://episcopalchurch.org/sacred-ground </a> Episcopal Church program.</ins></p><p><ins>Sacred Ground is an educational series designed to foster “a prayerful resource that creates space for difficult but respectful and transformative conversations on race and racism,” Preslar said. From the Sacred Ground website: “it’s a film- and readings-based dialogue series on race, grounded in faith.”</ins></p><p><ins>Preslar, who also heads up Formation (an education-based component of the church), and the church’s ministry team discussed the idea and how they could structure the group, as well as future Sacred Ground workshops, during a pandemic.</ins></p><p><ins>“It’s very hard to have 38 people (the number participating) on one giant Zoom call,” Preslar said. “That would be completely overwhelming. We have three small groups with one leader in each that are reading the book concurrently.”</ins></p><p><ins>The book has nine sections so nine sessions are taking place presently that include discussion prompts from the book and additional resources.</ins></p><p><ins>“We were thrilled with the turnout,” Preslar said, adding they had originally planned to launch in the fall but adjusted given the current climate and tremendous need. “Our goal was to have one group of 12. The fact that we have three groups of that many has been just for us a visual of how wanted and needed this type of program is within our community.”</ins></p><p><ins>Waking Up White, and Finding Myself in the Story of Race is written by Debby Irving, a racial justice educator and writer as well as teacher and administrator. Throughout her life, Irving says she sensed racial tensions in her personal and professional relationships. She worried about offending people she wanted to befriend. She didn’t understand why her reaching out and diversity efforts lacked traction. In the book she candidly discusses the paradigm shift that adjusted her worldview and life plan.</ins></p><p><ins>Preslar said part of the reason Christ Church chose the book is because it’s “so approachable.” She added that other churches have also recommended it as a successful introduction to Sacred Ground.</ins></p><p><ins>“(Another reason) we chose to start with a book study for it,” Preslar said of the Sacred Ground program, “is the time spent apart where we’re not in a church community. A video series in the parish hall can’t happen now. Book study and online conversation can get people used to having those challenging conversations.”</ins></p><p><ins>Preslar said any other group could have access to the program as well. She explained how it’s designed to create affinity groups that do the work together of exploring race and racism, covering different topics each time together with readings, dialogue prompts and forming a brave place for conversation.</ins></p><p><ins>She described how a brave place is different from a safe place or space where the ultimate goal is sharing and support — that in a brave space the focus is on encouraging respectful and constructive dialogue.</ins></p><p><ins>Brave spaces are becoming known as places for education, discourse, sharing experiences, recognizing differences and coming to new understandings, undertakings which are often difficult and uncomfortable.</ins></p><p><ins>“Our goal locally is to very much have the conversation,” Preslar said, “mirror what the Dismantling Racism youth program does (an Episcopal program for grades 6-12, in which three Coronado students are participating). We want to encourage participation and conversation in brave spaces.”</ins></p><p><ins>Preslar said they’ll start the Sacred Ground curriculum once the book sessions are complete.</ins></p><p><ins>“It’s been wonderful,” she said of the book club’s reception. “The conversations are deep and heartfelt, and the people who are participating are enjoying the process — but the process is very challenging.</ins></p><p><ins>“It’s enjoyable to be doing this work in the community and have the support of community. It’s also sometimes very hard, and it brings to mind how much Black people have struggled for so long. Just as the book title is Waking Up White, we have to wake up to what their realities have been and equity in our world … I would say that it’s life-changing and pushes us toward a positive sense of change.”</ins></p><p><ins>The chaplain also mentioned how the day school is in the process of diversifying its library and resources, and teachers are looking at ways to incorporate racially-inclusive books into their curriculums for the coming school year.</ins></p><p><ins>“I think the main thing for all of us is that we’ve been doing this work,” Preslar said. “It doesn’t matter how far along you are in doing this journey, there’s always something new to learn. It’s OK to be a beginner and not knowing a thing and pick up and talk. It’s OK to be 15 steps down the road and doing more advanced work. Wherever you are in your journey, we all have an important role to play.”</ins></p><p><ins>The church shared how it’s striving to continue to have brave conversations about race, working toward “a viewing of all of us as beloved children of God,” and “how we choose to work together in this world to provide equity for everyone,” Preslar said.</ins></p><p><ins>Connect with Christ Church using <a href="https://www.christchurchcoronado.org/get-in-touch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their website contact page Link: https://www.christchurchcoronado.org/get-in-touch/ </a>, including being part of their congregation’s deeper discussions on race and faith, “healing racial division and exploring the ways in which we are connected,” Preslar said.</ins></p><p><ins>You can also <a href="http://www.centerforracialhealing.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">learn more here Link: http://www.centerforracialhealing.org/ </a> about the Dismantling Racism youth program and its creator the Absolom Jones Episcopal Center for Racial Healing in Atlanta, Georgia.</ins></p><p class="item-details"><ins></ins></p><h3 class="entry-title td-module-title"><ins><a href="https://coronadotimes.com/news/2020/07/16/stability-concerns-add-challenges-for-firefighters-aboard-uss-bonhomme-richard/" rel="bookmark" title="Stability Concerns Add Challenges for Firefighters Aboard USS Bonhomme Richard">Stability Concerns Add Challenges for Firefighters Aboard USS Bonhomme Richard  Link: https://coronadotimes.com/news/2020/07/16/stability-concerns-add-challenges-for-firefighters-aboard-uss-bonhomme-richard/ </a></ins></h3><ul class="td-category"><li class="entry-category"><ins><a href="https://coronadotimes.com/news/category/featured/">Featured Link: https://coronadotimes.com/news/category/featured/ </a></ins></li><li class="entry-category"><ins><a href="https://coronadotimes.com/news/category/news/military/">Military Link: https://coronadotimes.com/news/category/news/military/ </a></ins></li></ul><ins> </ins><ins><a href="https://coronadotimes.com/news/author/jeanettegroeneveld/">Jeannie Groeneveld Link: https://coronadotimes.com/news/author/jeanettegroeneveld/ </a></ins><p class="td-author-line"><ins>-</ins></p><ins><span class="td-post-date">07/16/2020 </span></ins><p class="td-post-comments"><ins><a href="https://coronadotimes.com/news/2020/07/16/stability-concerns-add-challenges-for-firefighters-aboard-uss-bonhomme-richard/#respond">0  Link: https://coronadotimes.com/news/2020/07/16/stability-concerns-add-challenges-for-firefighters-aboard-uss-bonhomme-richard/#respond </a></ins></p><p><ins>UPDATED July 16, 1:00pm – In a statement Thursday afternoon, Rear Admiral Philip E. Sobeck Commander, Expeditionary Strike Group Three shared:</ins></p><p><ins>After four days of firefighting, all known fires have been extinguished aboard USS Bonhomme Richard (LHD 6).</ins></p><p><ins>Our fire teams are investigating every space to verify the absence of fire. Until every space is checked and there are no active fires we will not be able to commence any official investigations.</ins></p><p><ins>We did not know the origin of the fire. We do not know the extent of the damage. It is too early to make any predictions or promises of what the future of the ship will be.</ins></p><p><ins>We cannot make any conclusions until the investigation is complete.</ins></p><p><ins>What we do know is that brave Sailors from commands all across San Diego worked tirelessly alongside Federal Firefighters to get this fire extinguished and I want to thank them for their efforts. This was a Navy team effort. We had support from the air and sea. Three helicopter squadrons conducted more than 1,500 water bucket drops, fighting the fire and cooling the super structure and flight deck enabling fire crews to get onboard to fight the fire. Tugs also provided firefighting support from the waterline, cooling the ship’s hull.</ins></p><p><ins>Entering day five, firefighters continue efforts to contain the fire aboard USS Bonhomme Richard on July 16th, while facing new concerns of ship stability. Late Wednesday evening Naval Surface Forces (NSF) announced that, “Out of an abundance of caution the pier and ship were cleared of personnel due to an initial shift in the ship’s list. Personnel are now pier side. We will continue to monitor as the ship settles.” Early in the morning of July 16th firefighters were allowed back on board and NSF provided an update on injuries stating, “As of 06:00 am Pacific time July 16, firefighting teams are on board USS Bonhomme Richard (LHD 6) continuing operations. The total personnel treated for minor injuries remains 63, 40 Sailors and 23 civilians.”</ins></p><p><ins>A full investigation will be conducted once the fire has been extinguished and the ship spaces are deemed safe to inspect. Firefighters are assessing damage as they contain the fire.</ins></p><p><ins>USS Bonhomme Richard Commanding Officer, CAPT G.S. Thoroman, has worked alongside firefighting planners as they continue to plan firefighting operations. In a letter to all those who have supported the efforts to save the ship and take care of the crew, Thoroman stated, “The overwhelming support we received from all the waterfront commands, Federal Fire Department, Naval Base San Diego, tenant shore commandos and myriad other entities have been nothing short of inspiring… Thank you for all the help and support you have provided.” Later in the letter Thoroman shared his thoughts on his Sailors and said, “The Sailors of USS Bonhomme Richard have demonstrated courage in the face of the fire.

Are we destroying monuments to racism or are we erasing important parts of our history? Let me tell you a short story and then I’ll let you decide.</p><p>Carl Vinson served in the U.S. House of Representatives, representing Georgia’s 10th congressional district, from 1914 to 1965. He is sometimes referred to as the “Patriarch of the Armed Forces,” though he never served in the military, due to his role on various Armed Forces committees in the House and the logistical innovations that occurred during his service.</p><p>Vinson was a staunch segregationist. He signed “The Southern Manifesto” in 1956, with a slew of other Southern politicians, in resistance to the Supreme Court ruling on “Brown v. Board of Education” that deemed segregated public schools unconstitutional. He retired from Congress in 1965, declining to seek reelection in 1964, the same year the Civil Rights Act was passed.</p><p>In 1980, the United States Navy commissioned its third Nimitz-class Aircraft Carrier, no less than a floating city, the pinnacle of our military might. They named it the USS CARL VINSON (CVN-70).</p><p>In 1956, as Congressman Vinson was applying his John Hancock to the “The Southern Manifesto,” an ambitious 11-year-old Black boy was attending Dunbar Junior High School in Little Rock, Arkansas. The next year, the Little Rock Nine would be the first black students to enroll at the formerly all-white Central High School, beginning the long and arduous road of desegregation, much to Vinson’s chagrin.</p><p>This young boy, still in junior high school, was friends with the younger siblings of much of the Little Rock Nine and was able to hear first-hand accounts of the tribulations they were facing as they walked those whitewashed hallways. Tales of needing an elite armed guard, military jeeps, and helicopters to go to and from school. Tales of being openly abused and defamed while the abusers faced no consequences or retribution. Tales of receiving C grades for A papers, despite putting in twice as much time and producing higher quality work than white students who received better marks.</p><p>In the next few years, this young boy would face a difficult decision. Either enter the fray of being one of those select few Black students permitted to enter a higher quality school on a limited basis and immerse himself in a hotbed of blatant racism and violent tension while being forced to constantly exercise restraint of tongue and fist, not retaliate and likely accept grades below the marks he’d earned, or attend the separate but not equal Horace Mann High School with a Black teaching staff who was invested in his future, supportive of his goals and would grade his work on merit. He chose the latter. He had a goal and C’s just would not cut it.</p><p>He would graduate from Horace Mann in 1963 with stellar grades and submit his first application to the U.S. Naval Academy. It was denied. He pressed on, attending Southern Illinois University and applied to the Naval Academy again after his freshman year there. Once more he was denied. The young man confronted the realization that both his State Senators and the congressional representative from his home district were unlikely to appoint a young Black man to the prestigious academic institution meant to train and groom future Officers. There had been progress, but not that much. He had already enlisted in the U.S. Naval Reserve, so he would make his way as an enlisted man. A young, Black enlisted man in the good-ole-boys Navy of the time.</p><p>This began the storied career of Vice Admiral Edward Moore Jr.</p><p>Admiral Moore would go on to serve his country in the Vietnam War, serve as Gunnery Officer, Communications Officer, Operations Officer, Navigator and earn a Master’s degree in Business Administration from U.S. Naval Postgraduate School. He would become a Junior Assignment Officer and Shore Assignments Coordinator at the Bureau of Naval Personnel. He was then assigned to the USS BUCHANAN (DDG-14) as Executive Officer in 1979 and served as the second Commanding Officer of the USS LEWIS B. PULLER (FFG-23) before being promoted to Captain and first Commanding Officer of the Ticonderoga-class guided-missile cruiser the USS COWPENS (CG-63). As the first Black Captain of an Aegis Class Cruiser, he led a successful Tomahawk missile strike against a sensitive target in Iraq.</p><p>Admiral Moore would end his 38-year career as the highest-ranking Black officer in the Navy, a 3-Star Admiral retiring as Commander, U.S. Naval Surface Forces, Pacific.</p><p>During those 38 years he was awarded the Navy Distinguished Service Medal, Legion of Merit Medal with four gold stars, the Defense Meritorious Service Medal, the Meritorious Service Medal, the Navy Achievement Medal, and many other service and campaign awards. He also made significant contributions in pioneering systems integration aboard ships as the Navy ushered in a new era of technological advancement. Moore pioneered many things, not the least of which was an unprecedented avenue to the Flag Officer rank from enlisted service. Where the progress of society lagged behind his vision, he made his own path and cleared the way for those who came after him.</p><p>In 1995 when he assumed command of Cruiser-Destroyer Group Three, his flagship was the USS CARL VINSON. He defied the odds and rose the ranks through the barriers of discrimination and then, as Task Force Commander, stood aboard a floating fortress named in commemoration of the man who had so adamantly opposed his equality; a monument to someone who fought tooth and nail to try to prevent him -and anyone who looked like him- from ever assuming such a command, or going to a decent school, from ever riding in the front of the bus, or eating in the same restaurants as white people. Carl Vinson spent his 51 years of service devoted to the belief, in word and action, that Vice Admiral Edward Moore Jr. was a second class citizen.</p><p>Vice Admiral Edward Moore Jr. is my father.</p><p>I have stood on the CARL VINSON as my father stepped aboard and hundreds of men and women jumped to attention and saluted to the announcement, “Admiral on deck!”  I have walked the passageways of that ship with him as young, Black sailors stepped out on a limb and broke rank to take the opportunity to thank him from the bottom of their hearts for paving the way ahead of them, with joyous smiles and reverent souls. I’ve watched thousands of brave men and women of every color and creed who have served this country at the highest level, offer this man the utmost respect for his service and devotion to this Nation and for leadership that changed their lives.</p><p>I didn’t really know who Carl Vinson was until last week. My father never mentioned it. I walked the passageways, climbed the ladders, and stood on the deck of that ship as a child in awe of his father — without ever really knowing the poetry of the triumph written by determination and fate as he assumed command and stepped aboard. A story, that upon closer examination, seems to be written by the hand of Justice itself.</p><p>So you tell me, who should the ship be named after? Who deserves a monument? Whose stories and ideals should we enshrine in our statues, our ships, our military bases, and our Capitol buildings? The great men and women of this country who defied the odds and triumphed over evil, doing so in service to all Americans? Or those who strove to preserve the evil of racism at the expense of so many of those heroes?</p><p>My father cried when he retired. My father loves the Navy. He loves this country as too few do, in action and above his own life. Is it not time his country, at minimum, respect him and the 13% of the population with black skin enough to remove the state-sponsored glorification of those who fought to try and ensure we could never be truly free?</p><p>Trust me, we will not forget our history because 10-foot statues of bigots do not loom in public squares. We will not forget slavery because traitors to the Union don’t have bases and war vessels in their names. We will not forget segregation because those who fought to preserve it are no longer celebrated as icons of the country they strove to divide.</p><p>My Father never brought up Vinson’s history. When I realized what I had missed, I called him to talk about it. I sheepishly asked if he knew Carl Vinson’s history, knowing it was a silly question. Do you know what he said? “Yea, Carl Vinson certainly turned over in his grave when that ship became my Flagship.” He always knew and he never mentioned it. His life and his career said every word there was to say on the matter.</p><p>So you tell me, who should that ship be named after?</p> <p class="item-details"><ins></ins></p><h3 class="entry-title td-module-title"><ins><a href="https://coronadotimes.com/news/2020/07/15/more-young-san-diegans-getting-sick-hospitalized-due-to-covid-19/" rel="bookmark" title="More Young San Diegans Getting Sick, Hospitalized Due to COVID-19">More Young San Diegans Getting Sick, Hospitalized Due to COVID-19  Link: https://coronadotimes.com/news/2020/07/15/more-young-san-diegans-getting-sick-hospitalized-due-to-covid-19/ </a></ins></h3><ul class="td-category"><li class="entry-category"><ins><a href="https://coronadotimes.com/news/category/community/community-news/">Community News Link: https://coronadotimes.com/news/category/community/community-news/ </a></ins></li></ul><ins> </ins><ins><a href="https://coronadotimes.com/news/author/editor/">Managing Editor Link: https://coronadotimes.com/news/author/editor/ </a></ins><p class="td-author-line"><ins>-</ins></p><ins><span class="td-post-date">07/15/2020 </span></ins><p class="td-post-comments"><ins><a href="https://coronadotimes.com/news/2020/07/15/more-young-san-diegans-getting-sick-hospitalized-due-to-covid-19/#respond">0  Link: https://coronadotimes.com/news/2020/07/15/more-young-san-diegans-getting-sick-hospitalized-due-to-covid-19/#respond </a></ins></p><p class="td-post-text-content td-post-content tagdiv-type"><ins></ins></p><p><ins>The number of younger San Diegans getting infected with the novel coronavirus has been increasing in recent weeks, and more of them are landing in the hospital, the County Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA) announced today.</ins></p><p><ins>Of the nearly 21,500 COVID-19 cases reported in the region, San Diegans between 20 and 39 years of age represent nearly 44% of all cases.</ins></p><p><ins>A closer look at the HHSA data shows that after restaurants, bars, wineries, breweries, hotels and other businesses reopened, the number of people between 20 and 39 years of age getting sick with COVID-19 began to rise rapidly.</ins></p><p><ins>During the second week of June, 510 San Diegans in that age bracket got sick with COVID-19. Another 1,144 got sick the following week, and during the last week of June the number jumped to 1,595. The figures began to decrease again when indoor activities at those same locales were closed again. The total was down to 1,028 by the week ending July 11.</ins></p><p><ins>“Some young people think they’re invincible and won’t get sick, but that’s not the case,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “Not only are they getting sick, but they are also ending up at emergency rooms and needing hospitalization.”</ins></p><p><ins>During the second week of June 10, a total of 16 San Diegans between 20 and 39 years of age were hospitalized. The figured dropped to 12 the following week and jumped to 27 the last week of June. Again, the number began to decrease when certain sectors of the economy were closed and was down to 18 by July 11.</ins></p><p><ins>Also, the number of COVID-19 outbreaks in community settings followed a similar pattern of increasing as activities widened. While only eight community outbreaks were reported in May, in June, 33 were identified. This month, 38 community outbreaks have been reported, with restaurants/bars and private residences the most common locations.</ins></p><p><ins>“The evidence is clear. As more people started to go out, especially young people, we started to see an increasing number of COVID-19 cases,” Wooten said.</ins></p><h3><ins>COVID-19 Impact in Younger People</ins></h3><p><ins>Dr. Scott Eisman, a pulmonary disease and critical care medicine expert at Scripps Memorial Hospital in Encinitas, said that while young people think COVID-19 is not serious, the novel coronavirus could have serious health issues, especially in young people who smoke or vape.</ins></p><p><ins>“Many younger people think that this is something that you’ll get, and you’ll overcome, and everything will be fine, but the complications of this illness are greater than the flu,” Eisman said. “We have younger and younger patients showing up with more and more significant complications.”</ins></p><p><ins>Eisman said research has shown that COVID-19 attacks both lungs and their blood vessels which could result in blood clotting in the lungs and other parts of the body.</ins></p><p><ins>COVID-19, Eisman said, can cause other problems, including stroke, cardiac issues, cerebral dysfunction, liver and kidney failure.</ins></p><p><ins>“It causes blood clotting in general and that could create substantial problems in the ability of the lung to deliver oxygen,” Eisman said.</ins></p><h3><ins>County Hiring Case Investigators</ins></h3><p><ins>Due to the increasing number of COVID-19 cases, the County is hiring additional people to do case investigations, an important activity in public health responses to infectious disease.</ins></p><p><ins>Case investigators call or email people who have tested positive for COVID-19 to ask them to isolate themselves and find out their close contacts. Bilingual applicants are encouraged to <a href="https://www.governmentjobs.com/careers/sdcounty?keywords=temporary%27">apply for the temporary position Link: https://www.governmentjobs.com/careers/sdcounty?keywords=temporary%27 </a>.</ins></p><p><ins>The new hires will join the more than 510 case investigators and contact tracers currently working to stop the spread of the virus.</ins></p><p><ins>Community Setting Outbreaks and Other Triggers:</ins></p><ul><li><ins>Four new community setting outbreaks were identified on July 14 in a hair salon, a barbershop, a restaurant/bar and a laboratory.</ins></li><li><ins>In the past seven days, 14 community outbreaks were confirmed.</ins></li><li><ins>The number of community outbreaks is double the trigger of seven or more in seven days.</ins></li><li><ins>A community setting outbreak is defined as three or more COVID-19 cases in a setting and in people of different households.</ins></li><li><ins>The County also reached the Case Investigation trigger because only 46% of investigations were initiated within 24 hours of notification over a 7-day period. The percentage should be at least 71%.</ins></li><li><ins>The state’s threshold of no more than 100 cases per every 100,000 residents is also in the red and currently registers at 147.2 in San Diego County.</ins></li></ul><p><ins><span>Source: County of San Diego</span></ins></p><p class="item-details"><ins></ins></p><h3 class="entry-title td-module-title"><ins><a href="https://coronadotimes.com/news/2020/07/15/pet-of-the-week-cookie-an-applehead-seal-point-siamese-for-adoption/" rel="bookmark" title="Pet of the Week:  Cookie, an Applehead Seal Point Siamese for Adoption">Pet of the Week:  Cookie, an Applehead Seal Point Siamese for Adoption  Link: https://coronadotimes.com/news/2020/07/15/pet-of-the-week-cookie-an-applehead-seal-point-siamese-for-adoption/ </a></ins></h3><ul class="td-category"><li class="entry-category"><ins><a href="https://coronadotimes.com/news/category/community/community-news/">Community News Link: https://coronadotimes.com/news/category/community/community-news/ </a></ins></li></ul><ins> </ins><ins><a href="https://coronadotimes.com/news/author/pawsofcoronado/">PAWS of Coronado Link: https://coronadotimes.com/news/author/pawsofcoronado/ </a></ins><p class="td-author-line"><ins>-</ins></p><ins><span class="td-post-date">07/15/2020 </span></ins><p class="td-post-comments"><ins><a href="https://coronadotimes.com/news/2020/07/15/pet-of-the-week-cookie-an-applehead-seal-point-siamese-for-adoption/#respond">0  Link: https://coronadotimes.com/news/2020/07/15/pet-of-the-week-cookie-an-applehead-seal-point-siamese-for-adoption/#respond </a></ins></p><p class="td-post-text-content td-post-content tagdiv-type"><ins></ins></p><h2><ins>Add a Sweet Treat to Your Life with Cookie…</ins></h2><p dir="ltr"><ins>Beautiful and elegant Cookie came to the Coronado Animal Care Facility when her former owner relinquished her.

I have had lots of time to think and reflect, and to think and reflect some more. Concurrently, our City has faced some truly extraordinary challenges with regard to the making of public policy and in the managing of its finances in the face of losing most of our hotel tax revenue. While other people bleed red blood, I exclusively bleed green, white, and gold blood. I want to jump off of the sidelines and help our citizens to problem solve and to move forward in the midst of these challenges. I do not claim to have a bunch of novel answers, but I know a great deal about this City, its people, and its past.</ins></p><p><ins>Therefore, with excitement and a little bit of anxiety, I am ready to announce that I will be a candidate for the Coronado City Council. I am running for the Council because I want to be there to help people to find solutions to their problems. I am not running for Mayor because I think I should go back to the end of the line and work my way back up to that spot when the time is right.

Broadly speaking this is beneficial, as studies have found that therapy provided online or over-the-phone is just as effective as in-person therapy, when implemented appropriately. As a licensed psychologist with a lot of experience providing such services even before the pandemic, I believe that understanding the benefits and risks of engaging in remote therapy is paramount in ensuring that we maximize treatment outcomes.</ins></p><p><ins>What are the benefits?</ins></p><p><ins><span>If you are struggling to cope and find it difficult to make in-person appointments, engaging in therapy over-the-phone or through video-conferencing may be greatly beneficial for you. The benefits of therapy or counseling services via telehealth include:</span></ins></p><ul><li><ins>Reduced Commute Time</ins><ul><li><ins>With no need to travel to and from a physical office space, the overall time commitment needed to attend traditional in-person sessions is greatly reduced.</ins></li></ul></li><li><ins>Flexible Scheduling Options</ins><ul><li><ins>Therapists may offer sessions earlier in the morning or later in the evening; and clients can often take a calls or video-conferences to attend sessions during the day.</ins></li></ul></li><li><ins>Accommodate Changes in Plans or Travel</ins><ul><li><ins>Remote access means that you don’t necessarily need to cancel appointments when plans change, as you can access the session wherever you are—even when you are traveling.</ins></li></ul></li><li><ins>Improved Continuity of Care</ins><ul><li><ins>The option to attend therapy sessions remotely can also increase adherence to treatment plans, especially for individuals who have busy lives that require flexible scheduling options.</ins></li></ul></li><li><ins>Expand Accessibility of Services</ins><ul><li><ins>Psychological services and specialties offered remotely can greatly increase access to care for those who live in areas where such services are not readily available in-person.</ins></li></ul></li></ul><p><ins>What are the risks?</ins></p><p><ins>While there are many benefits of telepsychology, it is extremely important to take the time to also discuss the potential risks with your provider. In my experience, planning ahead with your therapist is crucial in optimizing treatment outcomes and minimize risks. These discussions may include the following:</ins></p><ul><li><ins>Therapist License</ins><ul><li><ins>In most jurisdictions, psychotherapy is considered to be provided where the client is located. Therefore, it is important to know where your provider is licensed and the potential risks to engaging in therapy with a provider who is not licensed to practice in your state.</ins></li></ul></li><li><ins>Risks to Confidentiality</ins><ul><li><ins>When engaging in psychotherapy online or over-the-phone, there is a risk that others around you may overhear your conversation. Access to a quiet, private space to attend your sessions and the use of secure technologies can greatly reduce this risk.</ins></li></ul></li><li><ins>Emergency Planning</ins><ul><li><ins>Although unlikely, it is important to talk with your provider about what would happen if you came across a crisis during remote treatment.

Ideally, clients seeking remote psychotherapy or counseling services should pursue therapists that are experienced in providing such services, particularly if they are considering taking part in therapy via telehealth in the long-term. Often providers list their availability for remote therapy services on their websites or on their directory profiles. I encourage anyone who is interested in online therapy to reach out to those providers in their area to ask about their experience with and options for telehealth and discuss the applicable risks and benefits of online therapy and counseling services with them directly.</ins></p><h6><ins><span>About Dr. Tanaka &amp; Coronado Psych</span></ins></h6><h6><ins><span>Dr. Rika Tanaka (PSY30925) is a licensed psychologist and founder of Coronado Psych.

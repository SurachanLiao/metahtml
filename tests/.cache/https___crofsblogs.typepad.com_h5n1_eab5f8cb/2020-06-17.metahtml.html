<blockquote cite="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/17/trump-coronavirus-pandemic-recovery-missed-chance">Despite the inertia and dysfunction that plagued the early stages of the US government&#8217;s response to the coronavirus pandemic, the situation could still have been somewhat rescued if Donald Trump had merely backed the efforts of his own administration, public health experts say. &#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/17/trump-coronavirus-pandemic-recovery-missed-chance">Instead Trump has shown little active leadership and frequently undermined government efforts and advice aimed at curbing the virus by encouraging reopening protests and refusing to wear a face mask.</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/17/trump-coronavirus-pandemic-recovery-missed-chance">As America pushes ahead with reopening businesses and allowing public gatherings even as Covid-19 infections have jumped to alarming new highs in a number of states, missed opportunities have severely undermined the recovery phase of a pandemic that has already claimed 116,000 lives in the US. &#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/17/trump-coronavirus-pandemic-recovery-missed-chance">On 16 April, the White House issued guidelines to states on how to safely restart normal life again. Many epidemiologists saw them as flawed &#8211; too broad, still not backed with a robust system of testing and tracking infected people to prevent a resurgence of the virus &#8211; but it was at least something consistent to work to at a delicate stage of the pandemic. &#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/17/trump-coronavirus-pandemic-recovery-missed-chance">Instead, Trump announced &#8220;we&#8217;re in the process of winning now&#8221; and the next day responded to protests demanding an immediate reopening by tweeting &#8220;LIBERATE MICHIGAN&#8221;, &#8220;LIBERATE MINNESOTA&#8221; and &#8220;LIBERATE VIRGINIA&#8221;.&#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/17/trump-coronavirus-pandemic-recovery-missed-chance">From calling himself a wartime president fighting an invisible enemy, Trump, having seen some initial progress and a modest rebound in the stock market, vacated the battlefield, observers say.&#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/17/trump-coronavirus-pandemic-recovery-missed-chance">An official close to the pandemic effort, who did not want to be named, said the federal response has been a &#8220;shitshow&#8221; with a leadership vacuum that Dr Deborah Birx, coordinator of the coronavirus taskforce; Jared Kushner, the president&#8217;s son-in-law; and Mike Pence have all tried to fill. &#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/17/trump-coronavirus-pandemic-recovery-missed-chance">&#8220;Trump had a plan from Dr Birx and if he had asked for a little more patience from the public we&#8217;d have a very different situation to now,&#8221; said Andy Slavitt, former acting head of Medicare and Medicaid Services. &#8220;But he was unwilling to do that. He couldn&#8217;t wait.&#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/17/trump-coronavirus-pandemic-recovery-missed-chance">&#8220;There&#8217;s no science saying taking a month off ends the virus. The way the virus works is that it goes to places it hasn&#8217;t been and infects people, and that&#8217;s happening again now. No one has an easy job in this and there are tough decisions to make, but that&#8217;s where you need leadership. We&#8217;ve lacked that.&#8221; &#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/17/trump-coronavirus-pandemic-recovery-missed-chance">Another potential turning point arrived earlier in the crisis, on 3 April, when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which has been largely sidelined during the pandemic, advised Americans to wear cloth face coverings. Again, the advisory was not perfect &#8211; surgical masks are far more effective but were in short supply because of a deficient federal stockpile.&#160;&#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/17/trump-coronavirus-pandemic-recovery-missed-chance">Public health researchers have found, however, that even homemade masks can prevent Covid-19 spreading through coughing and sneezing and with Republican men far less likely to wear masks than other groups, a strong endorsement of the CDC advice from Trump could have pushed mass mask wearing and cut the pandemic off at the knees. &#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/17/trump-coronavirus-pandemic-recovery-missed-chance">But Trump revealed he would not be wearing a mask himself, and pondered &#8220;sitting in the Oval Office behind that beautiful Resolute Desk, the great Resolute Desk, I think wearing a face mask as I greet presidents, prime ministers, dictators, kings, queens, I don&#8217;t know, somehow I don&#8217;t see it for myself&#8221;. &#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/17/trump-coronavirus-pandemic-recovery-missed-chance">He subsequently removed a mask he was wearing during a tour of a factory in Michigan to avoid the media seeing him in one. &#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/17/trump-coronavirus-pandemic-recovery-missed-chance">&#8220;There&#8217;s been a complete failing in the national response and to recommend mask wearing and then undermine it in the same press conference is the epitome of what&#8217;s gone wrong,&#8221; said Tom Frieden, former head of the CDC.</blockquote>

				<p>Via the South China Morning Post:&#160;<a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3089453/beijing-has-learned-wuhan-tackling-market-coronavirus-cluster" title="Beijing has &#8216;learned from Wuhan&#8217; in tackling market coronavirus cluster | South China Morning Post">Beijing has &#8216;learned from Wuhan&#8217; in tackling market coronavirus cluster</a>. Excerpt:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3089453/beijing-has-learned-wuhan-tackling-market-coronavirus-cluster">The response to Beijing&#8217;s latest coronavirus outbreak &#8211; unlike the blanket lockdown in Wuhan &#8211; has been fast and effective, and the situation is controllable, according to Chinese experts.&#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3089453/beijing-has-learned-wuhan-tackling-market-coronavirus-cluster">Beijing has reimposed measures to contain the virus after a cluster of cases emerged from the city&#8217;s largest wholesale food market last week.&#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3089453/beijing-has-learned-wuhan-tackling-market-coronavirus-cluster">There are 137 cases linked to the Xinfadi market and the Chinese capital raised its emergency response to the second-highest level on Tuesday night, five days after the new outbreak was reported.&#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3089453/beijing-has-learned-wuhan-tackling-market-coronavirus-cluster">Residents of &#8220;medium- or high-risk&#8221; areas are banned from leaving Beijing, while others have to provide a negative nucleic acid test result from the previous seven days if they want to leave the city.&#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3089453/beijing-has-learned-wuhan-tackling-market-coronavirus-cluster">Across Beijing, people have to go through a temperature check, display a QR code on their phones to show they are not ill and provide an entry pass before they can go into a residential compound.&#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3089453/beijing-has-learned-wuhan-tackling-market-coronavirus-cluster">Those measures were announced by Chen Bei, deputy secretary general of the Beijing municipal government, on Tuesday night.</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3089453/beijing-has-learned-wuhan-tackling-market-coronavirus-cluster">The situation was very different in Wuhan, the city in central China where the first cases of the deadly new virus were detected late last year. There, a draconian lockdown was imposed from January 23 to April 4, with travel restricted, highway exits closed and people not allowed to leave their residential compounds &#8211; groceries were delivered by community workers and volunteers.&#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3089453/beijing-has-learned-wuhan-tackling-market-coronavirus-cluster">Even after the lockdown was lifted, residents in some areas still had to show the health code on their phones and go through temperature checks before they could enter their compounds.&#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3089453/beijing-has-learned-wuhan-tackling-market-coronavirus-cluster">Liang Qidong, vice-president of the Liaoning Academy of Social Sciences, said the new outbreak in Beijing was controllable so there was no need for a strict lockdown like in Wuhan.&#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3089453/beijing-has-learned-wuhan-tackling-market-coronavirus-cluster">&#8220;Beijing has accumulated experience from Wuhan so its contingency measures are more specific,&#8221; Liang said.&#160;&#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3089453/beijing-has-learned-wuhan-tackling-market-coronavirus-cluster">That experience had led to general optimism that any new outbreak could be controlled, Yang Zhanqiu, deputy director of the pathogen biology department at Wuhan University, told state tabloid Global Times.&#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3089453/beijing-has-learned-wuhan-tackling-market-coronavirus-cluster">It included contact tracing and a &#8220;grid management&#8221; system &#8211; where people are assigned to monitor small sections of communities &#8211; both of which had helped to swiftly identify carriers and contain the spread of the virus in Beijing, according to Xie Maosong, a professor with the Chinese Academy of Sciences.&#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3089453/beijing-has-learned-wuhan-tackling-market-coronavirus-cluster">He said on the first day of the new outbreak, some communities in the city&#8217;s Haidian district had required residents to report to authorities if they had been to the Xinfadi market.&#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3089453/beijing-has-learned-wuhan-tackling-market-coronavirus-cluster">&#8220;Beijing&#8217;s response has been quick, and the prevention measures are precise,&#8221; he said.&#160;&#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3089453/beijing-has-learned-wuhan-tackling-market-coronavirus-cluster">The city authorities also rolled out mass nucleic acid testing of residents. More than 76,000 people in the affected areas were tested on Sunday, with 59 testing positive, Beijing Health Commission spokesman Xia Xiaojun said.&#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3089453/beijing-has-learned-wuhan-tackling-market-coronavirus-cluster">In total, more than 356,000 people in Beijing had been tested since Saturday, Zhang Qiang, deputy head of the Organisation Department under the Communist Party&#8217;s Beijing Municipal Committee, said on Wednesday.</blockquote>

<blockquote cite="https://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/news/2020/06/16/montgomery-council-votes-down-mask-ordinance-doctors-disgust/3203300001/">Jackson Hospital pulmonologist William Saliski cleared his throat as he started&#160;describing the dire situation created by the coronavirus pandemic in Montgomery to its City Council before they voted on a mandatory mask ordinance. "It's been a long day, I apologize," he said.&#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/news/2020/06/16/montgomery-council-votes-down-mask-ordinance-doctors-disgust/3203300001/">"The units are full with critically-ill COVID patients," Saliski said. About 90% of them are Black. He said hospitals are&#160;able to manage for now, but it's not sustainable. "This mask slows that down,&#160;95% protection from something as easy as cloth. ... If this continues the way it's going, we will be overrun." &#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/news/2020/06/16/montgomery-council-votes-down-mask-ordinance-doctors-disgust/3203300001/">More doctors followed him to the microphone, describing the dead being carried out within 30 minutes of each other, and doctors being disturbed when people&#160;on the street ask them if the media is lying about the pandemic as part of a political ploy.&#160;&#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/news/2020/06/16/montgomery-council-votes-down-mask-ordinance-doctors-disgust/3203300001/">After they spoke, and before the council voted on a proposal by Councilman C.C. Calhoun to mandate mask-wearing in public in Montgomery, Councilman Brantley Lyons&#160;questioned whether masks and six-foot distancing really helps. They do, the doctors replied. Lyons was unmoved. "At the end of the day, if an illness or a pandemic comes through we do not throw our constitutional rights out the window," Lyons said. &#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/news/2020/06/16/montgomery-council-votes-down-mask-ordinance-doctors-disgust/3203300001/">From the crowd, doctors called for him to visit the hospital sometime.&#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/news/2020/06/16/montgomery-council-votes-down-mask-ordinance-doctors-disgust/3203300001/">Instead, the council killed the ordinance after it failed to pass in a 4-4 tie, mostly along racial lines, with Councilman Tracy Larkin absent. Councilman Clay McInnis voted with three Black council members &#8212;&#160;Calhoun, Oronde Mitchell and&#160;Audrey Graham&#160;&#8212;&#160;in favor of the ordinance. Lyons, Charles Jinright, Richard Bollinger and Glen Pruitt voted against it.&#160;&#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/news/2020/06/16/montgomery-council-votes-down-mask-ordinance-doctors-disgust/3203300001/">A trio of doctors, who had waited hours to speak, got up and left the chamber in disgust. "Unbelievable," Saliski said.</blockquote>

Excerpt:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/world/coronavirus-live-updates.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage">Florida reported 2,783 new confirmed virus cases on Tuesday, setting another new daily high in a state that has seen a steady increase in cases as it has increased testing, eased social distancing restrictions and allowed more businesses to reopen.&#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/world/coronavirus-live-updates.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage">It is one of 20 states that have seen the number of newly reported cases grow over the past two weeks, according to a New York Times database. &#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/world/coronavirus-live-updates.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage">Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, a Republican, attributed the uptick to more widespread testing, noting at a news conference Tuesday that the state was not only testing far more people than it did earlier in the spring, but was also going into high-risk environments, testing farm workers and migrant workers, and finding new cases. &#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/world/coronavirus-live-updates.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage">But epidemiologists have said that the numbers recorded in the state in recent days suggest increased transmissions, and the governor acknowledged that community transmission remained a factor.&#160;&#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/world/coronavirus-live-updates.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage">&#8220;There&#8217;s been community spread the whole time,&#8221; Mr. DeSantis said at the news conference, saying that there were pockets of the state with higher rates, particularly lower-income areas. &#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/world/coronavirus-live-updates.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage">He dismissed the idea that the recent infections stemmed from the reopening of businesses including bars and restaurants and said the state would not shutter activity again. &#160;</blockquote>

<blockquote cite="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/world/coronavirus-live-updates.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage">There have been at least 80,101 cases of the virus in Florida, the eighth-highest number in the nation, according to The New York Times database. As of Tuesday at least 2,992 people had died.&#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/world/coronavirus-live-updates.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage">The state has been trying to get back to normal. President Trump plans to give his convention speech this August in Jacksonville, where he moved the event after his demands for a convention without social distancing led to a rift with Democratic leaders in North Carolina, where it was originally supposed to be held. The Kennedy Space Center recently hosted the SpaceX launch. And Orlando soon plans to welcome the National Basketball Association.&#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/world/coronavirus-live-updates.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage">The state has often reported higher case counts on Tuesdays, as numbers from the weekend come in. But this tally set a record that eclipsed the previous one, which was set on Saturday, when the state reported 2,581 new cases. (In the entire month of May there were only a few days when the state reported more than 1,000 new cases in a day.)&#160;&#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/world/coronavirus-live-updates.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage">Epidemiologists have said that even taking into account the increase in testing, the rising number of cases in Florida and other Sun Belt states suggests increased transmissions. In Florida more than 4.5 percent of those who tested between May 31 and June 6 had the virus, compared with about 2.3 percent of people who sought tests in mid-May. While the percentage of people testing positive there was higher at times earlier in the outbreak, that was when testing was far more limited.</blockquote>

				<p>Via Nature.com:&#160;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01738-2" title="How deadly is the coronavirus? Scientists are close to an answer">How deadly is the coronavirus? Scientists are close to an answer</a>. Excerpt:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01738-2">One of the most crucial questions about an emerging infectious disease such as the new coronavirus is how deadly it is. After months of collecting data, scientists are getting closer to an answer.&#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01738-2">Researchers use a metric called infection fatality rate (IFR) to calculate how deadly a new disease is. It is the proportion of infected people who will die as a result, including those who don&#8217;t get tested or show symptoms. &#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01738-2">&#8220;The IFR is one of the important numbers alongside the herd immunity threshold, and has implications for the scale of an epidemic and how seriously we should take a new disease,&#8221; says Robert Verity, an epidemiologist at Imperial College London.</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01738-2">Calculating an accurate IFR is challenging in the midst of any outbreak because it relies on knowing the total number of people infected &#8212; not just those who are confirmed through testing. But the fatality rate is especially difficult to pin down for COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, says Timothy Russell, a mathematical epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. That&#8217;s partly because there are many people with mild or no symptoms, whose infection has gone undetected, and also because the time between infection and death can be as long as two months. Many countries are also struggling to count all their virus-related deaths, he says. Death records suggest that some of those are being missed in official counts.&#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01738-2">Data from early in the pandemic overestimated how deadly the virus was, and then later analyses underestimated its lethality. Now, numerous studies &#8212; using a range of methods &#8212; estimate that in many countries some 5 to 10 people will die for every 1,000 people with COVID-19. &#8220;The studies I have any faith in are tending to converge around 0.5&#8211;1%,&#8221; says Russell.&#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01738-2">But some researchers say that convergence between studies could just be coincidence. For a true understanding of how deadly the virus is, scientists need to know how readily it kills different groups of people. The risk of dying from COVID-19 can vary considerably depending on age, ethnicity, access to healthcare, socioeconomic status and underlying health conditions. More high-quality surveys of different groups are needed, these researchers say. &#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01738-2">IFR is also specific to a population and changes over time as doctors get better at treating the disease, which can further complicate efforts to pin it down. &#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01738-2">Getting the number right is important because it helps governments and individuals to determine appropriate responses. &#8220;Calculate too low an IFR, and a community could underreact, and be underprepared. Too high, and the overreaction could be at best expensive, and at worst [could] also add harms from the overuse of interventions like lockdowns,&#8221; says Hilda Bastian, who studies evidence-based medicine, and is a PhD candidate at Bond University in the Gold Coast, Australia.&#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01738-2">Bridging the gap&#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01738-2">Some of the first indications of the virus&#8217;s deadliness were gleaned from the total number of confirmed cases in China. In late February, the World Health Organization crudely estimated that 38 people had died for every 1,000 with confirmed COVID-19 diagnoses. The death rate among these people &#8212; known as the case fatality rate (CFR) &#8212; reached as high as 58 out of 1,000 in Wuhan, the city where the virus emerged. But such estimates exaggerated the disease&#8217;s deadliness because they did not account for the many people who had the virus but were not tested, obscuring the outbreak&#8217;s true spread.&#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01738-2">Researchers tried to address this gap by estimating the IFR from models that projected the virus&#8217;s spread. The result from these early analyses hovered around 0.9% &#8212; 9 deaths for every 1,000 people infected &#8212; with a broader range of 0.4&#8211;3.6%, says Verity.

Excerpt:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/brazil-bolsonaro-coronavirus-cases-deaths-reopening-second-wave/2020/06/15/3282d27e-ae4b-11ea-856d-5054296735e5_story.html">RIO DE JANEIRO &#8212; Weeks ago, when this seaside metropolis had recorded fewer than 10,000 cases of the novel coronavirus and there still appeared to be time, some of Brazil's most respected scientists made their last-ditch appeal. The country had reached a pivotal juncture. Cases were skyrocketing. The hospital system was teetering at capacity. Thousands had already died. &#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/brazil-bolsonaro-coronavirus-cases-deaths-reopening-second-wave/2020/06/15/3282d27e-ae4b-11ea-856d-5054296735e5_story.html">So Carlos Machado, a senior scientist with Brazil&#8217;s prestigious Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, wanted the language to be strong. At the request of Rio officials, his team was assembling a list of recommendations. He needed to make clear what would happen if they didn&#8217;t immediately impose a complete lockdown. &#8220;It would result,&#8221; the team warned in the early May report, &#8220;in a human catastrophe of unimaginable proportions.&#8221;&#160;&#160;</blockquote>

Cases and deaths soared. People stopped isolating, choosing instead to pack beach boardwalks on weekends. And the warning turned out to be just one more exit ramp that Brazil declined to take on its way toward becoming the second-most disease-ravaged country in the world.&#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/brazil-bolsonaro-coronavirus-cases-deaths-reopening-second-wave/2020/06/15/3282d27e-ae4b-11ea-856d-5054296735e5_story.html">Latin America&#8217;s largest country has so far registered more than 888,000 coronavirus cases and nearly 44,000 deaths, second on both counts only to the United States. But while other countries have been through steep curves and are now focused on preparations for a possible second wave, Brazil can&#8217;t even get past its first.&#160;</blockquote>

Despite soaring numbers, officials never implemented measures largely successful elsewhere in the world. There has been no national lockdown. No national testing campaign. No agreed-upon plan. Insufficient health-care expansion. Instead, the hardest-hit cities are now deciding to open up, throwing open the doors to malls and churches, at a time when the country is routinely posting more than 30,000 new cases a day &#8212; five times more than Italy reported at the peak of its outbreak.&#160;&#160;</blockquote>

We want to see how strong you are.&#8217; Like this is a game of poker, and we&#8217;re all in.&#8221;&#160;&#160;</blockquote>

But just as the pandemic is magnifying the similarities between the United States and Brazil &#8212; two continent-sized countries with extreme inequality and populist presidents &#8212; it is also revealing the chasm between them. Brazil has neither the world&#8217;s biggest economy, nor one of its strongest health-care systems, nor the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</blockquote>

But despite the stakes, the country never found unity. President Jair Bolsonaro, who continues to dismiss the disease and its victims, has urged a policy of doing nothing. He has attacked governors who advocated restrictive measures as corrupt liars, waded into crowds of supporters in defiance of his advisers&#8217; admonitions and threatened to host a large barbecue to spite public health recommendations.&#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/brazil-bolsonaro-coronavirus-cases-deaths-reopening-second-wave/2020/06/15/3282d27e-ae4b-11ea-856d-5054296735e5_story.html">He never empowered health experts and scientists to lead a response. Instead, they were undermined and ignored, sidelined and pushed out. He fired his first health minister, Luiz Henrique Mandetta, whose sober briefings had calmed anxious Brazilians, after they&#8217;d clashed over the need for social distancing.&#160;</blockquote>

(The U.S. Food and Drug Administration this week revoked its emergency authorization to use the anti-malarial drug to treat the coronavirus, saying it was unlikely to be effective but carries &#8220;potential serious side effects.&#8221;) &#160;</blockquote>

				<p>Via The New York Times, an op-ed by Daniela J. Lamas, a critical care doctor:&#160;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/opinion/coronavirus-hospital-second-wave.html?action=click&amp;module=Opinion&amp;pgtype=Homepage" title="Opinion | Doctors Know the Second Coronavirus Wave Is Coming - The New York Times">Doctors Know the Second Coronavirus Wave Is Coming</a>. Excerpt:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/opinion/coronavirus-hospital-second-wave.html?action=click&amp;module=Opinion&amp;pgtype=Homepage">Rushing into the hospital for an overnight shift, I grab my brown paper bag of personal protective equipment, swing open the door to the coronavirus intensive care unit &#8212; and stop short. The patients are gone. The halls that were cluttered just a day ago with ventilator monitors are now empty, silent. &#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/opinion/coronavirus-hospital-second-wave.html?action=click&amp;module=Opinion&amp;pgtype=Homepage">It has been nearly three months since we reconfigured our hospital to care for the Covid-19 surge. And as our numbers fall, from more than 100 critically ill patients to fewer than 20, most of our coronavirus units are closing.&#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/opinion/coronavirus-hospital-second-wave.html?action=click&amp;module=Opinion&amp;pgtype=Homepage">This is good news. But there is no celebration. How can there be? Nearly 1,000 Americans continue to die every day from this virus, while others dance in crowded clubs and refuse to wear masks in public places. We were tragically unprepared for the initial deluge of patients with a virus we still cannot cure. And now, I am not sure how to feel about what comes next. &#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/opinion/coronavirus-hospital-second-wave.html?action=click&amp;module=Opinion&amp;pgtype=Homepage">Each of the empty rooms still holds the memory of a patient. I think of the man who loved sugary sweet iced coffee and the Red Sox. He died with one of our interns at his bedside holding a phone to his ear for his family to say goodbye.&#160;&#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/opinion/coronavirus-hospital-second-wave.html?action=click&amp;module=Opinion&amp;pgtype=Homepage">I pause in a doorway, remembering a grandmother with red nails and tattooed eyeliner who had been looking forward to a trip to Florida with her family. She died, too.&#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/opinion/coronavirus-hospital-second-wave.html?action=click&amp;module=Opinion&amp;pgtype=Homepage">When I reach the corner room, I smile about the gamble we took when we decided to extubate a young cabdriver the night before a surgery that would have connected him more permanently to the ventilator. He made it out of the unit. I would like to think he&#8217;s home by now. &#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/opinion/coronavirus-hospital-second-wave.html?action=click&amp;module=Opinion&amp;pgtype=Homepage">The first time I walked down these halls, it seemed to me that the very air itself was poison. Those were the days when we were not sure how long we would have to wear each N95 mask. We saved them in Tupperware or in the small basins that patients use if they need to vomit.&#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/opinion/coronavirus-hospital-second-wave.html?action=click&amp;module=Opinion&amp;pgtype=Homepage">At home, a cough could send me into a panic that lasted for hours.

<blockquote cite="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/opinion/coronavirus-hospital-second-wave.html?action=click&amp;module=Opinion&amp;pgtype=Homepage">I remember the early days, when we had to fight to get our patients tested, and even when we succeeded, we waited days for results to return from our state&#8217;s Department of Public Health. We debated the danger of aerosols and optimal ventilator settings. The public rallied behind us, with hashtags and so many food donations, praising us as heroes even as I hesitated and tried to hold my breath whenever I entered a patient&#8217;s room.&#160;&#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/opinion/coronavirus-hospital-second-wave.html?action=click&amp;module=Opinion&amp;pgtype=Homepage">A few of these messages of support remain on the wall of the empty unit &#8212; a card with a child&#8217;s sweet drawing of a heart, a family photograph, a colorful thank-you poster from a local Girl Scout troop. On my way out of the empty unit, I snap a photo of the posters on the wall. &#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/opinion/coronavirus-hospital-second-wave.html?action=click&amp;module=Opinion&amp;pgtype=Homepage">Still, even as I say &#8220;so long&#8221; to nurses returning to their own units, I am sadly aware that this is not an ending. The numbers of the sick and dying in my city decreased because we were practicing social distancing. And now, cases in areas of the country that reopened more rapidly are rising, with patients in respiratory failure filling intensive care unit beds in Arizona and Texas.&#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/opinion/coronavirus-hospital-second-wave.html?action=click&amp;module=Opinion&amp;pgtype=Homepage">I see photos of the doctors and nurses there gearing up in their P.P.E., and I feel only exhaustion and dread, knowing what comes next &#8212; isolated deaths, terrible FaceTime goodbyes. I had believed that the hard-won knowledge of those of us in hard-hit places like New York City and Boston would begin to spread as efficiently as the virus, but now I am not so hopeful. &#160;</blockquote>

<blockquote cite="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/16/steroid-found-to-help-prevent-deaths-of-sickest-coronavirus-patients">A cheap steroid has become the first life-saving treatment in the Covid-19 pandemic, described by scientists as a major breakthrough and raising hopes for the survival of thousands of the most seriously ill. &#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/16/steroid-found-to-help-prevent-deaths-of-sickest-coronavirus-patients">Dexamethasone is cheap, available from any pharmacy, and easily obtainable anywhere in the world. Investigators said the drug was responsible for the survival of one in eight of the sickest patients &#8211; those who were on ventilators &#8211; in the Recovery trial, the biggest randomised, controlled trial of coronavirus treatments in the world. &#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/16/steroid-found-to-help-prevent-deaths-of-sickest-coronavirus-patients">&#8220;It is the only drug so far shown to reduce mortality and it reduces it significantly,&#8221; said Peter Horby, a professor of emerging infectious diseases in the Nuffield department of medicine, at the University of Oxford, and one of the chief investigators of the trial. &#8220;It is a major breakthrough, I think.&#8221;&#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/16/steroid-found-to-help-prevent-deaths-of-sickest-coronavirus-patients">Prof Martin Landray, his co-chief investigator said the sickest patients could begin to be treated with the drug immediately. &#8220;The search has been on for a treatment that actually reduces the risk of dying. There hasn&#8217;t been one until today. &#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/16/steroid-found-to-help-prevent-deaths-of-sickest-coronavirus-patients">&#8220;This is a drug that is globally available. This is not an expensive drug. That is immensely important.&#8221;&#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/16/steroid-found-to-help-prevent-deaths-of-sickest-coronavirus-patients">A total of 2,104 patients were chosen at random to receive 6mg of dexamethasone once a day (either by mouth or by intravenous injection) for 10 days, and were compared with 4,321 patients chosen at random to continue with normal care alone. Among the latter group of patients, 28-day mortality was highest in those who required ventilation (41%), intermediate in those who required oxygen only (25%), and lowest among those who did not require any respiratory intervention (13%). &#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/16/steroid-found-to-help-prevent-deaths-of-sickest-coronavirus-patients">Dexamethasone reduced deaths by one-third in ventilated patients (rate ratio 0.65 [95% confidence interval 0.48 to 0.88]; p=0.0003) and by one fifth in other patients receiving oxygen only (0.80 [0.67 to 0.96]; p=0.0021). There was no benefit among those patients who did not require respiratory support (1.22 [0.86 to 1.75; p=0.14).&#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/16/steroid-found-to-help-prevent-deaths-of-sickest-coronavirus-patients">Based on these results, the use of dexamethasone would prevent one death of around eight ventilated patients, or one of about 25 patients requiring oxygen alone. &#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/16/steroid-found-to-help-prevent-deaths-of-sickest-coronavirus-patients">Last week, the Recovery team, who have been trialling seven drugs and will add more, concluded that hydroxychloroquine did not benefit patients in hospital with Covid-19.&#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/16/steroid-found-to-help-prevent-deaths-of-sickest-coronavirus-patients">Sir Patrick Vallance, the government&#8217;s chief scientific adviser, said: &#8220;This is tremendous news today from the Recovery trial showing that dexamethasone is the first drug to reduce mortality from COVID-19. It is particularly exciting as this is an inexpensive widely available medicine.&#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/16/steroid-found-to-help-prevent-deaths-of-sickest-coronavirus-patients">&#8220;This is a ground-breaking development in our fight against the disease, and the speed at which researchers have progressed finding an effective treatment is truly remarkable. It shows the importance of doing high quality clinical trials and basing decisions on the results of those trials.&#8221;</blockquote>

The list of underlying conditions relevant to COVID-19 was determined by mapping the conditions listed in GBD 2017 to those listed in guidelines published by WHO and public health agencies in the UK and the USA.&#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(20)30264-3/fulltext">We analysed data from two large multimorbidity studies to determine appropriate adjustment factors for clustering and multimorbidity. To help interpretation of the degree of risk among those at increased risk, we also estimated the number of individuals at high risk (defined as those that would require hospital admission if infected) using age-specific infection&#8211;hospitalisation ratios for COVID-19 estimated for mainland China and making adjustments to reflect country-specific differences in the prevalence of underlying conditions and frailty. We assumed males were twice at likely as females to be at high risk. We also calculated the number of individuals without an underlying condition that could be considered at increased risk because of their age, using minimum ages from 50 to 70 years.&#160;</blockquote>

<blockquote cite="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(20)30264-3/fulltext">We estimated that 1&#183;7 billion (UI 1&#183;0&#8211;2&#183;4) people, comprising 22% (UI 15&#8211;28) of the global population, have at least one underlying condition that puts them at increased risk of severe COVID-19 if infected (ranging from &lt;5% of those younger than 20 years to &gt;66% of those aged 70 years or older). We estimated that 349 million (186&#8211;787) people (4% [3&#8211;9] of the global population) are at high risk of severe COVID-19 and would require hospital admission if infected (ranging from &lt;1% of those younger than 20 years to approximately 20% of those aged 70 years or older). We estimated 6% (3&#8211;12) of males to be at high risk compared with 3% (2&#8211;7) of females.&#160;</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(20)30264-3/fulltext">The share of the population at increased risk was highest in countries with older populations, African countries with high HIV/AIDS prevalence, and small island nations with high diabetes prevalence. Estimates of the number of individuals at increased risk were most sensitive to the prevalence of chronic kidney disease, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic respiratory disease.</blockquote>
<blockquote cite="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(20)30264-3/fulltext">Interpretation</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>About one in five individuals worldwide could be at increased risk of severe COVID-19, should they become infected, due to underlying health conditions, but this risk varies considerably by age. Our estimates are uncertain, and focus on underlying conditions rather than other risk factors such as ethnicity, socioeconomic deprivation, and obesity, but provide a starting point for considering the number of individuals that might need to be shielded or vaccinated as the global pandemic unfolds.</p>

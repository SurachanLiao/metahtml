Via The New York Times: Florida sets another record for the most cases it has reported in a day. Excerpt:

Florida reported 2,783 new confirmed virus cases on Tuesday, setting another new daily high in a state that has seen a steady increase in cases as it has increased testing, eased social distancing restrictions and allowed more businesses to reopen.

It is one of 20 states that have seen the number of newly reported cases grow over the past two weeks, according to a New York Times database.

Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, a Republican, attributed the uptick to more widespread testing, noting at a news conference Tuesday that the state was not only testing far more people than it did earlier in the spring, but was also going into high-risk environments, testing farm workers and migrant workers, and finding new cases.

But epidemiologists have said that the numbers recorded in the state in recent days suggest increased transmissions, and the governor acknowledged that community transmission remained a factor.

“There’s been community spread the whole time,” Mr. DeSantis said at the news conference, saying that there were pockets of the state with higher rates, particularly lower-income areas.

He dismissed the idea that the recent infections stemmed from the reopening of businesses including bars and restaurants and said the state would not shutter activity again.

“We’re not shutting down,” he said. He added: “you have to have society function.”

There have been at least 80,101 cases of the virus in Florida, the eighth-highest number in the nation, according to The New York Times database. As of Tuesday at least 2,992 people had died.

The state has been trying to get back to normal. President Trump plans to give his convention speech this August in Jacksonville, where he moved the event after his demands for a convention without social distancing led to a rift with Democratic leaders in North Carolina, where it was originally supposed to be held. The Kennedy Space Center recently hosted the SpaceX launch. And Orlando soon plans to welcome the National Basketball Association.

The state has often reported higher case counts on Tuesdays, as numbers from the weekend come in. But this tally set a record that eclipsed the previous one, which was set on Saturday, when the state reported 2,581 new cases. (In the entire month of May there were only a few days when the state reported more than 1,000 new cases in a day.)

Epidemiologists have said that even taking into account the increase in testing, the rising number of cases in Florida and other Sun Belt states suggests increased transmissions. In Florida more than 4.5 percent of those who tested between May 31 and June 6 had the virus, compared with about 2.3 percent of people who sought tests in mid-May. While the percentage of people testing positive there was higher at times earlier in the outbreak, that was when testing was far more limited.

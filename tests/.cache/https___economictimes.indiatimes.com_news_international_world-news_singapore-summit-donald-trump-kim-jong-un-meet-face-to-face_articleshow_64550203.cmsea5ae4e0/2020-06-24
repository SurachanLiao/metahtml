<br>He says ``it's not a big deal'' for world leaders to meet with the president of the United States.
<br>
<br>"It's a great thing for China... China was very helpful," Trump says when asked about the role Beijing played.
<br>
<br>"I want significant improvement...I want to know it is happening. Once we reach that point scientifically and mechanically where it is not possible to go back, we can do that," he replies to a question on when US will lift sanctions.
<br>
<br>Trump announces that he will stop conducting U.S. military ``war games'' with ally South Korea while negotiations between the two countries continue.
<br>
<br>Trump casts the decision as a cost-saving measure, but North Korea has long objected to the drills as a security threat.
<br>
<br>Trump also says Kim is committed to denuclearizing his country, but details on how that will happen are yet to thrashed out.

<br>President Donald Trump says he had planned to place another 300 sanctions on North Korea recently, but he held off because it would be ``disrespectful'' ahead of the meeting.
<br>
<br>He also says that it takes ``a long time to pull off complete denuclearization'' but that he will push for North Korea to remove its nuclear weapons as fast as it can ``mechanically and physically'' be done.

<br>President Donald Trump says North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is destroying a major missile engine testing site.

<br>Trump says Kim informed him of this development during the historic nuclear summit they held Tuesday in Singapore.
<br>
<br>Trump did not give a location for the testing site.
<br>
<br>He says the details about the site being destroyed were not included in the joint declaration the leaders signed after nearly five hours of talks because they agreed to it after the document was signed.

<br>Trump says destruction of the site is a ``big thing.''

<br>President Donald Trump is defending his repeated praise of North Korea's Kim Jong Un during their meetings in spite of Kim's distressing record on human rights.
<br>
<br>Trump told reporters at a press conference in Singapore on Tuesday that Kim ``is very talented.'' He pointed to Kim's rise to power at a relatively young age.
<br>
<br>Trump has appeared largely unconcerned about the implications of feting an authoritarian leader suspected of ordering the public assassination of his half brother with a nerve agent, executing his uncle by firing squad and killing U.S. college student Otto Warmbier.
<br>
<br>But Trump says without Warmbier's death, his meeting with Kim may not have happened. He says, ``Otto did not die in vain.''
<br>
<br>Trump says human rights did come up during the talks, albeit briefly.

<br>President Donald Trump says he will be ending joint military exercises between the United States and South Korea.
<br>
<br>Trump made the announcement Tuesday at a news conference in Singapore after his historic meeting with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
<br>
<br>North Korea has long objected to the annual exercises, viewing them as practice for future military action against the North by the United States.
<br>
<br>Trump cast his decision as a financial consideration, saying the U.S. will save a lot of money by canceling the drills.

<br>
<br>He also says that he's prepared ``to start a new history'' and ``write a new chapter'' between the two nations.

<br>President Donald Trump says he gave North Korean leader Kim Jong Un a video that laid out the opportunities of their historic meeting.
<br>
<br>Reporters were shown the video before the start of Trump's news conference Tuesday. The video resembled a preview of a film. It shows images of warplanes and artillery and says there can ``only be two results,'' one of moving back or moving forward.
<br>
<br>The video shows the two leaders and raises the questions: ``What if history can be changed? Will the world embrace this change?''
<br>
<br>The president says he gave the video ``to Chairman Kim and his people.''

<br>President Donald Trump is finally revealing that he spoke directly with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ahead of their Singapore summit.
<br>
<br>Trump said in an interview Tuesday with ABC's George Stephanopoulos that he'd spoken with Kim and others before the summit.
<br>
<br>?Trump had dodged the question for weeks, refusing to answer reporters who asked about their contact.
<br>
<br>During a visit to Mar-a-Lago in April, Trump told a reporter that he had spoken with Kim personally, but an aide quickly walked back the statement, saying it was other officials who'd spoken with Kim.
<br>
<br>It was later revealed that Trump's secretary of state had traveled to Pyongyang to meet with Kim.
<br>
<br>Trump is describing his day with Kim as ``very intense.'' He says he believes Kim wants to get denuclearization ``done'' and says he trusts Kim.

<br>U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has spoken with his Japanese and South Korean counterparts after President Donald Trump's summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

<br>Pompeo tweeted shortly after the summit ended Tuesday that he'd telephoned South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha and Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono. The State Department released a photograph of Pompeo on the phone.
<br>
<br>Pompeo says on Twitter he provided the diplomats with ``a brief readout of today's meeting'' between Trump and Kim. The two leaders concluded their summit by signing a document in which Trump pledged ``security guarantees'' to the North and Kim reiterated his commitment to ``complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.''
<br>
<br>The State Department is declining to release any additional information about the calls.

<br>
<br>President Donald Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong Un have concluded an extraordinary nuclear summit by signing a document in which Trump pledged ``security guarantees'' to the North and Kim reiterated his commitment to ``complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.''
<br>
<br>Light on specifics, the document largely amounted to an agreement to continue discussions as it reiterated previous public statements and past commitments. It did not include an agreement to take steps toward ending the technical state of warfare between the U.S. and North Korea.
<br>
<br>The pair promised in the document to ``build a lasting and stable peace regime'' on the Korean Peninsula and to repatriate remains of prisoners of war and those missing in action during the Korean War.

<br>Moon has met Kim twice in recent months and helped arrange the U.S.-North Korean summit.
<br>
<br>Moon said he ``ardently aspires'' for the success of the summit and hopes it brings complete denuclearization and peace to the Korean Peninsula.

<br>There's excitement surrounding the summit but also skepticism that the North will relinquish a nuclear weapons program it spent decades building despite crushing sanctions.
<br>
<br>Kim and Trump are scheduled to meet alone, with their interpreters, after greeting each other at the resort.

<strong>7:50 a.m.</strong>
<br>North Korea's state media has reported on Kim Jong Un's late-night tour of Singapore with unusual speed.
<br>
<br>Pyongyang's official Rodong Sinmun on Tuesday filled its front page with photos of his visits to Singapore's landmarks, including the Flower Dome at Gardens by the Bay and the Marina Bay Sands resort.
<br>
<br>The North's Korean Central News Agency quoted Kim as saying that Singapore is ``clean and beautiful and every building is stylish'' and that he will learn ``a lot from the good knowledge and experience of Singapore in various fields in the future.''
<br>
<br>It's rare that security-obsessed North Korea reports on Kim's activities within hours. When Kim visited China for meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping in March and May, state media didn't report on the trips until after he returned home.
<br>
<br>Some experts say North Korea is trying to keep up with the speed of the Western media in Singapore.

<strong>7:05 a.m.</strong>
<br>President Donald Trump is sitting down with Fox News host Sean Hannity after his summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
<br>
<br>Fox News says the interview will take place Tuesday at the Capella Hotel on Sentosa Island in Singapore. Trump and Kim are set to meet on Sentosa Island on Tuesday morning for roughly 45 minutes while their entourages wait nearby.
<br>
<br>The interview is set to air on Fox's ``Hannity'' at 9 p.m. Tuesday on the U.S. East Coast, which is 9 a.m. Wednesday in Singapore.
<br>
<br>Fox News says Trump will talk about the meeting with Kim and future relations between the two countries.
<br>
<br>Hannity is a friend and confidant of the president and speaks out in support of Trump on his show.

<strong>6:20 a.m.</strong>
<br>President Donald Trump says the ``haters &amp; losers'' are complaining that his meeting with North Korea's Kim Jong Un is a ``major loss,'' but he notes that the U.S. has gotten its three captives returned and that the North's nuclear missile launches have stopped.
<br>
<br>Trump tweeted early Tuesday from Singapore, just hours before his face-to-face with Kim.
<br>
<br> 
 
<br>
<br>He says, ``The fact that I am having a meeting is a major loss for the U.S., say the haters &amp; losers.'' But he says ``our hostages'' are back home and testing, research and launches have stopped.
<br>
<br>He says, ``These pundits, who have called me wrong from the beginning, have nothing else they can say!''
<br>
<br>Critics have argued that Kim has notched a win by getting a sit-down with the U.S. president.

<br>
<strong>5:30 a.m.</strong>
<br>President Donald Trump says ``we will all know soon'' whether he can reach a deal with North Korea's Kim Jong Un to end its nuclear program.
<br>
<br>Trump is tweeting hours before the leaders' historic face-to-face that, ``Meetings between staffs and representatives are going well and quickly.''
<br>
<br>But he says that, ``in the end, that doesn't matter. We will all know soon whether or not a real deal, unlike those of the past, can happen!''
<br>
<br>Before leaving Washington for Singapore, Trump said his gut instincts will guide him when he gets into the room with Kim.
<br>
<br>He told reporters he'll know almost immediately whether a deal can be made, saying: ``I will know, just my touch, my feel. That's what I do.''
<br>
<br>Their meeting is scheduled for 9 a.m. Singapore time.
<br>

<strong>4 a.m.</strong>
<br>Defense Secretary Jim Mattis says the U.S. has picked up no indications that North Korea's military is in a heightened state of alert in the run-up to the Singapore summit.
<br>
<br>Mattis told reporters at the Pentagon on Monday that ``All's quiet'' in North Korea.
<br>
<br>Mattis is declining to discuss his expectations for President Donald Trump's meeting with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un.
<br>
<br>He says he does not expect it to include a negotiation over reducing the number of U.S. troops in South Korea _ currently about 28,000. He says that, at least initially, this is a matter between Washington and Seoul.
<br>

<br>
<strong>1:45 a.m.</strong>
<br>For better part of an hour, President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will square off one on one, alone but for a pair of translators. That's raising concerns about the risk of holding such a monumental meeting with barely anyone to bear witness.
<br>
<br>Trump and Kim will meet on Singapore's Sentosa Island for roughly 45 minutes while their entourages wait nearby.
<br>
<br>The huddle will come before a larger meeting and a working lunch attended by top advisers to the president and their North Korean counterparts.
<br>
<br>Word of the private meeting unleashed a torrent of criticism on social media from national security veterans who worry the lack of a transcript will create a he-said-he-said showdown that could turn into a major headache for Trump.

<br>
<strong>12:40 a.m.</strong>
<br>Former NBA star Dennis Rodman has arrived in Singapore, hours before President Donald Trump is set to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for the first time.
<br>
<br>Rodman emerged from the baggage claim area at Changi airport around midnight Monday. He told reporters he wasn't sure if he would meet Kim in Singapore.
<br>
<br>Last week, Rodman said he would ``give whatever support is needed'' to his ``friends'' Trump and Kim.
<br>
<br>White House officials have said Rodman will play no official role in the diplomatic negotiations. Trump said last week that Rodman had not been invited to the summit.
<br>
<br>He is one of the few westerners to have met the North Korean leader on visits to the capital city Pyongyang.

<strong>11:30 p.m.</strong>
<br>United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is urging U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to seize the opportunity ``to support a peaceful, prosperous, secure and verifiably denuclearized Korean Peninsula.''
<br>
<br>The U.N. chief is commending the two leaders for pursuing a diplomatic solution and ``seeking to break out of the dangerous cycle that created so much concern last year.''
<br>
<br>Guterres told reporters Monday ahead of the Trump-Kim summit in Singapore that ``peace and verifiable denuclearization must remain the clear and shared goal.''
<br>
<br>The secretary-general says he wrote to both leaders last month saying ``the road ahead will require cooperation, compromise and a common cause.''
<br>
<br>He says the U.N. system ``stands ready to support this process in every way, including verification if requested by both parties.''
<br>___
<br>
<strong>11:15 p.m.</strong>
<br>Former U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry is warning that if President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un fail to reach a deal at their Singapore summit, there's an increased danger for a ``catastrophic'' military solution.
<br>
<br>Perry says, ``If it falls apart, it's probably worse than as if we ever started.''
<br>
<br>Perry says he's hopeful the two leaders will discuss normalization of ties as well as denuclearization to improve the prospect for long-term success of any deal.
<br>
<br>He spoke Monday to The Associated Press at a Luxembourg Forum Conference on Preventing Nuclear Catastrophe event in Geneva.
<br>
<br>Perry also served as President Bill Clinton's special envoy to North Korea and traveled there in 1999 to discuss its nuclear and missile programs.

<strong>11 p.m.</strong>
<br>The White House says President Donald Trump plans to visit U.S. military bases in Guam and Hawaii on the return from his historic summit with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
<br>
<br>Trump is expected to depart Singapore on Tuesday night after his meeting with Kim on Sentosa Island. Before leaving Singapore, the president is scheduled to address the media.
<br>
<br>The White House says the president will stop at Andersen Air Force Base in Guam on Tuesday and also travel to Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam in Hawaii later in the day.
<br>
<br>The president visited the USS Arizona memorial at Pearl Harbor last November on his way to Asia.
<br>
<br>Trump is expected to return to the White House on Wednesday morning.

<strong>10:30 p.m</strong>.
<br>France's Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian (le dree-AHN) says he will be the first one to applaud U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong Un if they reach a deal on nuclear weapons disarmament of the Korean Peninsula.
<br>
<br>Le Drian says that ``everything that has to do with disarmament is positive.''
<br>
<br>The French foreign minister met Monday with his Swedish counterpart Margot Wallstrom in Stockholm. Le Drian cautions ``we have been enthusiastic before and it has led to failures.''
<br>
<br>Wallstrom hosted talks in March with North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho in Stockholm. She says one should be prepared for both ``a fruitful meeting and a failure.''

<br>
<strong>9:55 p.m.<br></strong>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is out of his luxurious hotel for a late-night city tour hours ahead of his summit with President Donald Trump.
<br>
<br>Singapore Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan (Bal-a-krish-nan) says Kim went to the Flower Dome at Gardens by the Bay in Singapore on Monday night.
<br>
<br>The foreign minister posted a photo showing him with Kim at the place on Facebook.
<br>
<br>South Korean media says Kim went there with his sister Kim Yo Jong and other top deputies.
<br>
<br>Kim is meeting Trump on Tuesday for a historic summit aimed at discussing the future of his nuclear program.
<br>
<br>It would be the first summit between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader.

<strong>8:20 p.m.</strong>
<br>The White House says in a statement ahead of President Donald Trump's historic summit with North Korea's Kim Jong Un that the talks with North Korea are moving ``more quickly than expected.'' The White House says Trump now plans to depart Singapore on Tuesday evening ahead of schedule.
<br>
<br>The White House says Trump will address the media on Tuesday following his summit with Kim and depart Singapore at approximately 8 p.m. local time for the United States. The president had been expected to leave Singapore on Wednesday morning.
<br>
<br>Trump is set to meet with Kim in Singapore on Tuesday morning.

<strong>7:30 p.m.</strong>
<br>Seoul says President Donald Trump talked with South Korean President Moon Jae-in (jah-YIHN') about his upcoming summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and expressed optimism for a diplomatic breakthrough.
<br>
<br>South Korea's presidential office says Trump filled Moon on the details of the pre-summit negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang. The Blue House didn't elaborate on what Moon was told during the 40 minute telephone call.
<br>
<br>The Blue House says Moon told him South Koreans will be praying for a ``miraculous result.''
<br>
<br>Moon said earlier he hopes the summit will be a ``historic milestone'' for peace but it will only be the first step in a complex and lengthy process. Moon says the hostility ``cannot be solved at once by a single meeting between the leaders.''

<strong>6:25 p.m.</strong>
<br>Iran says North Korea should be wary of negotiating with President Donald Trump following his withdrawal from the landmark 2015 nuclear agreement.
<br>
<br>Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Ghasemi said Monday that North Korea should approach this week's summit with Trump with ``awareness.'' He says Iran views Trump and the United States with ``great pessimism,'' saying they are known for ``quitting treaties and violating their commitments.''
<br>
<br>Trump withdrew the U.S. from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which the Obama administration had reached with Iran, Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia. The agreement required Iran to curb its uranium enrichment in exchange for relief from international sanctions.
<br>
<br>Trump has announced the restoration of U.S. sanctions, while European leaders are trying to preserve the deal.
<br>
<br>The U.S. president is set to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore on Tuesday.

<strong>6:15 p.m.</strong>
<br>President Donald Trump has accepted an invitation to return to Singapore for a state visit this fall.
<br>
<br>That's according to Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
<br>
<br>Trump is expected to travel to Asia in November in conjunction with a pair of regional summits.
<br>
<br>The White House did not immediately respond to questions about the president's fall plans.
<br>
<br>A White House read-out of Trump's meetings with Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong (lee haz-ee-en lahng) Monday did not include mention of a state visit.
<br>
<br>Singapore will be hosting Trump's summit Tuesday with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

<strong>6 p.m.</strong>
<br>U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says the United States is prepared to take actions to provide North Korea with ``sufficient certainty'' that denuclearization ``is not something that ends badly for them.''
<br>
<br>Pompeo is briefing reporters in Singapore ahead of President Donald Trump's summit Tuesday with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. He says the U.S. is prepared to show North Korea that rather than denuclearization posing a threat to North Korea, it's ``the opposite.''
<br>
<br>Pompeo won't say whether Trump would consider withdrawing U.S. troops from the Korean Peninsula.
<br>
<br>Pompeo says that U.S. sanctions on the North will remain in place until the North denuclearizes. But he says if diplomacy fails to move in the right direction, the sanctions ``will increase.''
<br>___
<br>
<strong>5:50 p.m.</strong>
<br>President Donald Trump called the leaders of South Korea and Japan Monday ahead of his summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
<br>
<br>That's according to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who is briefing reporters in Singapore. He says Trump spoke by phone with the two U.S. allies as preparatory talks continue between American and North Korean officials ahead of the leader sit-down Tuesday morning.
<br>
<br>Pompeo says there is ``enormous potential'' for the summit, but lowered expectations that the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula will happen after one meeting. He says: ``We are hopeful the summit will have set the conditions for future productive talks.''
<br>
<br>Pompeo also says Tuesday's meeting presents a test of Kim's willingness to agree to deal his nuclear weapons away for ``protections'' from the United States.

			  "articleBody":"After signing a historic pact with North Korea's Kim Jong Un on denuclearising the Korean peninsula, US president Donald Trump has said sanctions will be lifted when nukes are no longer a factor. He has also said he is confident Kim will live up to the agreement.  Here are all the updates on what transpired between the two leaders in the historic Singapore Summit (All times local):  5 p.m. President Donald Trump is pushing back on criticism that the U.S. has got little in return for his meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.  Trump tells reporters at a news conference in Singapore after his meeting that he ``gave up nothing.''  He says ``it's not a big deal'' for world leaders to meet with the president of the United States.   It's a great thing for China... China was very helpful,  Trump says when asked about the role Beijing played.   I want significant improvement...I want to know it is happening. Once we reach that point scientifically and mechanically where it is not possible to go back, we can do that,  he replies to a question on when US will lift sanctions.  Trump announces that he will stop conducting U.S. military ``war games'' with ally South Korea while negotiations between the two countries continue.  Trump casts the decision as a cost-saving measure, but North Korea has long objected to the drills as a security threat.  Trump also says Kim is committed to denuclearizing his country, but details on how that will happen are yet to thrashed out. ___  4:55 p.m. President Donald Trump says he had planned to place another 300 sanctions on North Korea recently, but he held off because it would be ``disrespectful'' ahead of the meeting.  He also says that it takes ``a long time to pull off complete denuclearization'' but that he will push for North Korea to remove its nuclear weapons as fast as it can ``mechanically and physically'' be done. ___  4:50 p.m.  President Donald Trump says the remains of U.S. prisoners of war and those missing in action during the Korean War will be returned.  Trump said during a news conference Tuesday after a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore that he asked Kim to commit to returning the remains ``and we got it.''  The president says he had received ``countless calls'' and letters from family members asking him to help them receive the remains of their loved ones.  Trump says, ``The remains will be coming back. They're going to start that process immediately.''   ---4:50 p.m.  US President Donald Trump addresses media after meeting North Korea's Kim Jong Un.    64555552   Anyone can make war, most courageous can make peace, says Donald Trump  Trump says Kim Jong Un has accepted his invitation to visit the White House sometime in the future.  Trump says he discussed human rights with Kim Jong Un, will hold more conversations on that in the future.  My talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un was honest, direct and productive, says US President Donald Trump.  Kim reaffirmed his unwavering commitment to the complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula: Trump  US to halt SKorea 'war games' after Kim summit: Donald Trump  We signed a very comprehensive document today and I think when he (Kim Jong Un) lands in North Korea he will start the process soon, says Trump    President Donald Trump says the remains of U.S. prisoners of war and those missing in action during the Korean War will be returned.  Trump said during a news conference Tuesday after a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore that he asked Kim to commit to returning the remains ``and we got it.''  The president says he had received ``countless calls'' and letters from family members asking him to help them receive the remains of their loved ones.  Trump says, ``The remains will be coming back. They're going to start that process immediately.''  Trump says he halted plans last week for 300 new North Korea sanctions designations because it would be `disrespectful'    * Donald Trump, Kim Jong Un agree to repatriating US military remains    *Trump says Korean war will 'soon end' 4:45 p.m.  President Donald Trump says he'll invite North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to visit the White House at the ``appropriate time.'' And he says Kim has accepted.  Trump also says he is open to visiting Kim some day in Pyongyang.  Trump is speaking at a press conference Tuesday after a day of meetings with Kim in Singapore.  It was the first time a sitting U.S. president and North Korean leader had met face to face.  Trump praised Kim, calling him ``very talented'' and pointing to his rise to power at a relatively young age. He also said the U.S. would be ending its joint military exercises with South Korea.  -------------  4:45 p.m. President Donald Trump says North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is destroying a major missile engine testing site.  Trump says Kim informed him of this development during the historic nuclear summit they held Tuesday in Singapore.  Trump did not give a location for the testing site.  He says the details about the site being destroyed were not included in the joint declaration the leaders signed after nearly five hours of talks because they agreed to it after the document was signed.  Trump says destruction of the site is a ``big thing.'' ___  4:40 p.m. President Donald Trump is defending his repeated praise of North Korea's Kim Jong Un during their meetings in spite of Kim's distressing record on human rights.  Trump told reporters at a press conference in Singapore on Tuesday that Kim ``is very talented.'' He pointed to Kim's rise to power at a relatively young age.  Trump has appeared largely unconcerned about the implications of feting an authoritarian leader suspected of ordering the public assassination of his half brother with a nerve agent, executing his uncle by firing squad and killing U.S. college student Otto Warmbier.  But Trump says without Warmbier's death, his meeting with Kim may not have happened. He says, ``Otto did not die in vain.''  Trump says human rights did come up during the talks, albeit briefly.  Trump says he believes Kim wants to do the right thing. ___  4:30 p.m. President Donald Trump says he will be ending joint military exercises between the United States and South Korea.  Trump made the announcement Tuesday at a news conference in Singapore after his historic meeting with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.  North Korea has long objected to the annual exercises, viewing them as practice for future military action against the North by the United States.  Trump cast his decision as a financial consideration, saying the U.S. will save a lot of money by canceling the drills. ___  4:25 p.m. President Donald Trump is thanking North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ``for taking the first bold step toward a bright new future for his people'' after the leaders' historic Singapore summit.  Trump said at a news conference Tuesday after meeting face to face with Kim that ``real change is indeed possible.''  He also says that he's prepared ``to start a new history'' and ``write a new chapter'' between the two nations.  He says, ``The past does not have to define the future.''  Trump held a news conference in Singapore before returning home. ___  4:20 p.m.  President Donald Trump says he gave North Korean leader Kim Jong Un a video that laid out the opportunities of their historic meeting.  Reporters were shown the video before the start of Trump's news conference Tuesday. The video resembled a preview of a film. It shows images of warplanes and artillery and says there can ``only be two results,'' one of moving back or moving forward.  The video shows the two leaders and raises the questions: ``What if history can be changed? Will the world embrace this change?''  The president says he gave the video ``to Chairman Kim and his people.''  ---------------  4:15 p.m. President Donald Trump is finally revealing that he spoke directly with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ahead of their Singapore summit.  Trump said in an interview Tuesday with ABC's George Stephanopoulos that he'd spoken with Kim and others before the summit.  ?Trump had dodged the question for weeks, refusing to answer reporters who asked about their contact.  During a visit to Mar-a-Lago in April, Trump told a reporter that he had spoken with Kim personally, but an aide quickly walked back the statement, saying it was other officials who'd spoken with Kim.  It was later revealed that Trump's secretary of state had traveled to Pyongyang to meet with Kim.  Trump is describing his day with Kim as ``very intense.'' He says he believes Kim wants to get denuclearization ``done'' and says he trusts Kim. ___  3:50 p.m. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has spoken with his Japanese and South Korean counterparts after President Donald Trump's summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.  Pompeo tweeted shortly after the summit ended Tuesday that he'd telephoned South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha and Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono. The State Department released a photograph of Pompeo on the phone.  Pompeo says on Twitter he provided the diplomats with ``a brief readout of today's meeting'' between Trump and Kim. The two leaders concluded their summit by signing a document in which Trump pledged ``security guarantees'' to the North and Kim reiterated his commitment to ``complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.''  The State Department is declining to release any additional information about the calls.  ___  3:30 p.m.  President Donald Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong Un have concluded an extraordinary nuclear summit by signing a document in which Trump pledged ``security guarantees'' to the North and Kim reiterated his commitment to ``complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.''  Light on specifics, the document largely amounted to an agreement to continue discussions as it reiterated previous public statements and past commitments. It did not include an agreement to take steps toward ending the technical state of warfare between the U.S. and North Korea.  The pair promised in the document to ``build a lasting and stable peace regime'' on the Korean Peninsula and to repatriate remains of prisoners of war and those missing in action during the Korean War.   * Singapore hotel offers 250 free Trump-Kim burgers to celebrate summit      * Kim Jong Un commits to 'complete denuclearisation of Korean Peninsula' in joint text  *   China urges 'full denuclearisation' as Kim Jong, Donald Trump meet   * Donald Trump, Kim Jong Un formed 'special bond' in historic meeting    *  Donald Trump, Kim Jong Un sign 'comprehensive document' after historic summit  Donald Trump, Kim Jong sign documents after  top of the line  meet at Singapore  Trump says North Korea denuclearization process will be starting `very quickly'  Trump, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un sign unspecified document in Singapore, Trump calls it `pretty comprehensive'    64553043   We have decided to leave the past behind. The world will see a major change, says North Korea's leader Kim.   ---  1 p.m. President Donald Trump has given North Korean leader Kim Jong Un a rare peek inside the U.S. presidential limousine.  As the two leaders strolled around the grounds of the Singapore resort where they're having their summit Tuesday, they walked up to the U.S. limousine nicknamed The Beast.  Trump can be seen talking and gesturing before a Secret Service agent opens the door and the leaders look in.  It wasn't immediately clear how Kim felt about the presidential tour, but he seemed to be smiling.  Trump says he and Kim will be signing a document shortly, but he declined to specify what that document would say.  ----  12:55 p.m. President Donald Trump says he and North Korea's Kim Jong Un will be signing a document shortly.    64552687   Trump declined to specify what exactly the leaders would be signing.  Trump said after emerging from hours of talks with Kim on Tuesday in Singapore that ``we're going right now for a signing.''  Asked what he'd be signing, Trump said: ``We're going to be announcing that in a couple of minutes.''  Trump also said that the meeting was ``going great'' and that they had made ``a lot of progress.'' He says he thinks it was ``better than anybody could imagine.''    64552320 ___ 12:45 p.m. President Donald Trump says his summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un went ``better than anybody could imagine.''  The leaders emerged from a working lunch and strolled together down a paved walkway Tuesday before stopping and posing before the waiting news media.  Trump said the meeting is ``going great. We had a really fantastic meeting.''  He added that there has been ``a lot of progress. Really very positive. I think better than anybody could imagine.''  The working lunch was the final official event scheduled for the leaders before they go their separate ways.  Trump is scheduled to address the press corps and then begin the journey back to Washington.  ___  12:25 p.m. President Donald Trump joked about his appearance as he prepared to sit down to lunch with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.  Trump said to photographers at Tuesday's summit in Singapore: ``Getting a good picture, everybody? So we look nice and handsome and thin? Perfect.''  A video feed provided by the summit host showed Trump, Kim and their aides taking their places at a long table. Salad courses were prepositioned on the table along with flower bouquets.  Trump took his spot in the middle of the table, and Kim opposite him. Trump was joined by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and a few other aides.  The lunch menu includes beef short ribs, sweet and sour crispy pork, and braised codfish.  -----  12:15 p.m.  The White House has restricted journalists' access to parts of President Donald Trump's summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un despite long-standing arrangements intended to ensure the public is kept fully abreast of key presidential moments.  Under standard rules agreed to by the White House and the press corps, a full pool of reporters travels with the president at all times and is allowed at any meetings where press access in granted. The group includes media representatives who then pool the information they gather with other news outlets that couldn't attend.  During the photo-op at the start of Trump's one-on-one meeting with Kim, text reporters for newswires The Associated Press, Reuters and Bloomberg were kept out of the pool, as were the designated representatives for radio and the foreign press corps.    64552303  ___  12:05 p.m.  President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un have started a working lunch meeting in Singapore.  A video feed provided by the host of the summit showed Trump, Kim and their aides walking into a room and taking their places at a long table. Salad courses were prepositioned on the table along with flower bouquets.  Trump took his spot in the middle of the table, and Kim opposite him. Trump was joined by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and a few other aides.  Independent journalists covering Trump's summit were not allowed in to witness the start of the lunch in Singapore.  ---  11:45 a.m. South Korean President Moon Jae-in says he ``hardly slept'' in anticipation of the United States-North Korea summit in Singapore.  Moon and other officials watched the live broadcast of the summit before a South Korean Cabinet meeting in his presidential office Tuesday.  Moon smiled and nodded as he watched President Donald Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong Un meet.  Moon has met Kim twice in recent months and helped arrange the U.S.-North Korean summit.  Moon said he ``ardently aspires'' for the success of the summit and hopes it brings complete denuclearization and peace to the Korean Peninsula.  Fighting in the Korean War ended with an armistice in July 1953. That armistice has yet to be replaced with a peace treaty, leaving the peninsula in a technical state of war.  ___   11:35 a.m. Former NBA star Dennis Rodman says all the pressure is on President Donald Trump in the historic meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.  Rodman told The Associated Press on Tuesday that it's up to Trump to prove he can be trusted by Kim and the North Korean people. The basketball Hall of Famer says it will take multiple visits for the countries to have any hope of a peaceful relationship.  Rodman joked that he should be pushing for the Nobel Peace Prize, or ``at least give me a piece of it.'' He struck up an unlikely friendship with Kim over their shared love of basketball and has visited North Korea several times but had no official role in the summit.  Rodman says he expects to meet with Trump after the summit. ___  11:25 a.m.  President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un are chatting over a lunch of beef short ribs, sweet and sour crispy pork, and braised codfish.  Details released by the White House show that lunch began Tuesday with a prawn cocktail and avocado salad, and green mango kerabu with honey lime dressing and octopus.    64551745    Side dishes included potato dauphinois, steamed broccolini, fried rice and Asian vegetables.  Dessert included dark chocolate tartlet and Haagen-Dazs vanilla ice cream.  Among those joining the leaders on the U.S. side were Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, White House chief of staff John Kelly and national security adviser John Bolton. The North Korean delegation included Kim Yong Chol, a top aide to Kim Jong Un who recently met Trump at the White House.  ----  10:30 a.m. Former NBA star Dennis Rodman says he received a call from the White House ahead of President Donald Trump's historic meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.  Rodman told CNN in an interview from Singapore on Tuesday that a White House staffer called the former ``Celebrity Apprentice'' contestant to tell him the president was proud of him.  The White House did not immediately respond to questions about the call.  Rodman struck up an unlikely friendship with Kim over their shared love of basketball, but he says former President Barack Obama never took him seriously.  Rodman described Kim as a ``big kid'' who wants to see the world and he expressed hope that the two leaders will make progress.  Rodman is in town for the summit, but the White House had said he will play no official role.  ___  10:10 a.m. President Donald Trump is sounding optimistic about his ability to persuade North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons program after a lengthy one-on-one meeting with leader Kim Jong Un.  Trump said Tuesday at the beginning of expanded discussions with aides from both countries that ``We will solve a big problem'' and ``a big dilemma.''  He talked about the pair achieving ``tremendous success together'' and predicts that ``it will be successful. It will be done.''  It was hard to hear the president and Kim over the constant clicking of camera shutters, and it remains unclear precisely what he was referring to.  But Kim appeared to echo the president's optimism.  ---  9:55 a.m. President Donald Trump says that his one-on-one meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was ``very, very good'' and that the two have an ``excellent relationship.''  Trump and Kim met for about 40 minutes Tuesday one-on-one, joined only by interpreters.    64551197  Trump made the comments as he and Kim walked together along balcony as they headed to a larger meeting with aides.  Trump was flanked in the larger meeting by chief of staff John Kelly, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and national security adviser John Bolton. They sat across the table from Kim and his team.  ----  9:20 a.m. President Donald Trump is predicting that he and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will have ``a terrific relationship'' as they meet face to face for the first time.  Trump said Tuesday after meeting Kim that he's feeling ``really great.'' He says, ``We're going to have a great discussion and a terrific relationship.''  Kim says through an interpreter that it ``was not easy to get here'' and that there ``were obstacles but we overcame them to be here.''  The two men are expected to meet on their own for the better part of an hour, with only a pair of interpreters in the room.  That decision has raised concerns about the risk of holding such a monumental meeting with barely anyone to bear witness. ---  9:05 a.m. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un are sharing a historic handshake as they meet for the first time.  The two clasped hands for a long while Tuesday as they posed for photos in front of a row of U.S. and North Korean flags. Trump then directed Kim to walk down a hallway, where they briefly spoke.    64550534    It's the first ever meeting between a sitting U.S. president and North Korean leader.  Trump and Kim arrived not long ago on Singapore's Sentosa Island, the site of their unprecedented summit. It's aimed at settling a standoff over Pyongyang's nuclear arsenal.  The two will huddle alone for roughly 45 minutes before being joined by aides for a larger meeting and working lunch.  Trump has said he'll know within minutes whether a deal can be made. ___  8:35 a.m. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has arrived at Singapore's Sentosa Island, where he'll be meeting shortly face-to-face with President Donald Trump.  The two men are expected to share a handshake before they meet alone with a pair of interpreters for roughly 45 minutes while their entourages wait nearby.    64550440   After the intimate huddle, they're scheduled to hold a larger meeting and working lunch. Trump's chief of staff, national security adviser and secretary of state are among those expected to join.  The meeting is the first sit-down between a sitting U.S. president and North Korean leader and is meant to settle a standoff over Pyongyang's nuclear program.  Trump earlier defended his decision to meet with Kim, tweeting that North Korea has already released three detainees and that missile tests have halted.  ___  8:20 a.m.President Donald Trump has arrived on Singapore's Sentosa Island for his historic meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.  Trump's motorcade pulled into the grounds of the Capella Hotel at 8:13 a.m. Tuesday local time.  He is scheduled to meet Kim for the first time at 9 a.m.  Kim is also en route to Sentosa Island for the meeting to discuss the fate of his country's nuclear weapons arsenal. ___  8:15 a.m. Kim Jong Un's entourage has left for the luxury Singapore island resort where the North Korean leader will meet with President Donald Trump.  Kim's black armored limousine with two large North Korean flags was surrounded Tuesday by police vehicles, their lights flashing, and other black cars.   64550167  There's excitement surrounding the summit but also skepticism that the North will relinquish a nuclear weapons program it spent decades building despite crushing sanctions.  Kim and Trump are scheduled to meet alone, with their interpreters, after greeting each other at the resort. ___  7:50 a.m. North Korea's state media has reported on Kim Jong Un's late-night tour of Singapore with unusual speed.  Pyongyang's official Rodong Sinmun on Tuesday filled its front page with photos of his visits to Singapore's landmarks, including the Flower Dome at Gardens by the Bay and the Marina Bay Sands resort.  The North's Korean Central News Agency quoted Kim as saying that Singapore is ``clean and beautiful and every building is stylish'' and that he will learn ``a lot from the good knowledge and experience of Singapore in various fields in the future.''  It's rare that security-obsessed North Korea reports on Kim's activities within hours. When Kim visited China for meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping in March and May, state media didn't report on the trips until after he returned home.  Some experts say North Korea is trying to keep up with the speed of the Western media in Singapore. ___  7:05 a.m. President Donald Trump is sitting down with Fox News host Sean Hannity after his summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.  Fox News says the interview will take place Tuesday at the Capella Hotel on Sentosa Island in Singapore. Trump and Kim are set to meet on Sentosa Island on Tuesday morning for roughly 45 minutes while their entourages wait nearby.  The interview is set to air on Fox's ``Hannity'' at 9 p.m. Tuesday on the U.S. East Coast, which is 9 a.m. Wednesday in Singapore.  Fox News says Trump will talk about the meeting with Kim and future relations between the two countries.  Hannity is a friend and confidant of the president and speaks out in support of Trump on his show. ___  6:20 a.m. President Donald Trump says the ``haters & losers'' are complaining that his meeting with North Korea's Kim Jong Un is a ``major loss,'' but he notes that the U.S. has gotten its three captives returned and that the North's nuclear missile launches have stopped.  Trump tweeted early Tuesday from Singapore, just hours before his face-to-face with Kim.    64536546   He says, ``The fact that I am having a meeting is a major loss for the U.S., say the haters & losers.'' But he says ``our hostages'' are back home and testing, research and launches have stopped.  He says, ``These pundits, who have called me wrong from the beginning, have nothing else they can say!''  Critics have argued that Kim has notched a win by getting a sit-down with the U.S. president. ___  5:30 a.m. President Donald Trump says ``we will all know soon'' whether he can reach a deal with North Korea's Kim Jong Un to end its nuclear program.  Trump is tweeting hours before the leaders' historic face-to-face that, ``Meetings between staffs and representatives are going well and quickly.''  But he says that, ``in the end, that doesn't matter. We will all know soon whether or not a real deal, unlike those of the past, can happen!''  Before leaving Washington for Singapore, Trump said his gut instincts will guide him when he gets into the room with Kim.  He told reporters he'll know almost immediately whether a deal can be made, saying: ``I will know, just my touch, my feel. That's what I do.''  Their meeting is scheduled for 9 a.m. Singapore time.  ___  4 a.m. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis says the U.S. has picked up no indications that North Korea's military is in a heightened state of alert in the run-up to the Singapore summit.  Mattis told reporters at the Pentagon on Monday that ``All's quiet'' in North Korea.  Mattis is declining to discuss his expectations for President Donald Trump's meeting with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un.  He says he does not expect it to include a negotiation over reducing the number of U.S. troops in South Korea _ currently about 28,000. He says that, at least initially, this is a matter between Washington and Seoul.  ___  1:45 a.m. For better part of an hour, President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will square off one on one, alone but for a pair of translators. That's raising concerns about the risk of holding such a monumental meeting with barely anyone to bear witness.  Trump and Kim will meet on Singapore's Sentosa Island for roughly 45 minutes while their entourages wait nearby.  The huddle will come before a larger meeting and a working lunch attended by top advisers to the president and their North Korean counterparts.  Word of the private meeting unleashed a torrent of criticism on social media from national security veterans who worry the lack of a transcript will create a he-said-he-said showdown that could turn into a major headache for Trump.  ___  12:40 a.m. Former NBA star Dennis Rodman has arrived in Singapore, hours before President Donald Trump is set to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for the first time.  Rodman emerged from the baggage claim area at Changi airport around midnight Monday. He told reporters he wasn't sure if he would meet Kim in Singapore.  Last week, Rodman said he would ``give whatever support is needed'' to his ``friends'' Trump and Kim.  White House officials have said Rodman will play no official role in the diplomatic negotiations. Trump said last week that Rodman had not been invited to the summit.  He is one of the few westerners to have met the North Korean leader on visits to the capital city Pyongyang.  ___  11:30 p.m. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is urging U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to seize the opportunity ``to support a peaceful, prosperous, secure and verifiably denuclearized Korean Peninsula.''  The U.N. chief is commending the two leaders for pursuing a diplomatic solution and ``seeking to break out of the dangerous cycle that created so much concern last year.''  Guterres told reporters Monday ahead of the Trump-Kim summit in Singapore that ``peace and verifiable denuclearization must remain the clear and shared goal.''  The secretary-general says he wrote to both leaders last month saying ``the road ahead will require cooperation, compromise and a common cause.''  He says the U.N. system ``stands ready to support this process in every way, including verification if requested by both parties.'' ___  11:15 p.m. Former U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry is warning that if President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un fail to reach a deal at their Singapore summit, there's an increased danger for a ``catastrophic'' military solution.  Perry says, ``If it falls apart, it's probably worse than as if we ever started.''  Perry says he's hopeful the two leaders will discuss normalization of ties as well as denuclearization to improve the prospect for long-term success of any deal.  He spoke Monday to The Associated Press at a Luxembourg Forum Conference on Preventing Nuclear Catastrophe event in Geneva.  Perry also served as President Bill Clinton's special envoy to North Korea and traveled there in 1999 to discuss its nuclear and missile programs.  ___  11 p.m. The White House says President Donald Trump plans to visit U.S. military bases in Guam and Hawaii on the return from his historic summit with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.  Trump is expected to depart Singapore on Tuesday night after his meeting with Kim on Sentosa Island. Before leaving Singapore, the president is scheduled to address the media.  The White House says the president will stop at Andersen Air Force Base in Guam on Tuesday and also travel to Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam in Hawaii later in the day.  The president visited the USS Arizona memorial at Pearl Harbor last November on his way to Asia.  Trump is expected to return to the White House on Wednesday morning.  ___  10:30 p.m. France's Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian (le dree-AHN) says he will be the first one to applaud U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong Un if they reach a deal on nuclear weapons disarmament of the Korean Peninsula.  Le Drian says that ``everything that has to do with disarmament is positive.''  The French foreign minister met Monday with his Swedish counterpart Margot Wallstrom in Stockholm. Le Drian cautions ``we have been enthusiastic before and it has led to failures.''  Wallstrom hosted talks in March with North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho in Stockholm. She says one should be prepared for both ``a fruitful meeting and a failure.'' ___  9:55 p.m.North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is out of his luxurious hotel for a late-night city tour hours ahead of his summit with President Donald Trump.  Singapore Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan (Bal-a-krish-nan) says Kim went to the Flower Dome at Gardens by the Bay in Singapore on Monday night.  The foreign minister posted a photo showing him with Kim at the place on Facebook.  South Korean media says Kim went there with his sister Kim Yo Jong and other top deputies.  Kim is meeting Trump on Tuesday for a historic summit aimed at discussing the future of his nuclear program.  It would be the first summit between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader. ___  8:20 p.m. The White House says in a statement ahead of President Donald Trump's historic summit with North Korea's Kim Jong Un that the talks with North Korea are moving ``more quickly than expected.'' The White House says Trump now plans to depart Singapore on Tuesday evening ahead of schedule.  The White House says Trump will address the media on Tuesday following his summit with Kim and depart Singapore at approximately 8 p.m. local time for the United States. The president had been expected to leave Singapore on Wednesday morning.  Trump is set to meet with Kim in Singapore on Tuesday morning. ___  7:30 p.m. Seoul says President Donald Trump talked with South Korean President Moon Jae-in (jah-YIHN') about his upcoming summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and expressed optimism for a diplomatic breakthrough.  South Korea's presidential office says Trump filled Moon on the details of the pre-summit negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang. The Blue House didn't elaborate on what Moon was told during the 40 minute telephone call.  The Blue House says Moon told him South Koreans will be praying for a ``miraculous result.''  Moon said earlier he hopes the summit will be a ``historic milestone'' for peace but it will only be the first step in a complex and lengthy process. Moon says the hostility ``cannot be solved at once by a single meeting between the leaders.''  ___  6:25 p.m. Iran says North Korea should be wary of negotiating with President Donald Trump following his withdrawal from the landmark 2015 nuclear agreement.  Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Ghasemi said Monday that North Korea should approach this week's summit with Trump with ``awareness.'' He says Iran views Trump and the United States with ``great pessimism,'' saying they are known for ``quitting treaties and violating their commitments.''  Trump withdrew the U.S. from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which the Obama administration had reached with Iran, Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia. The agreement required Iran to curb its uranium enrichment in exchange for relief from international sanctions.  Trump has announced the restoration of U.S. sanctions, while European leaders are trying to preserve the deal.  The U.S. president is set to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore on Tuesday.  ___  6:15 p.m. President Donald Trump has accepted an invitation to return to Singapore for a state visit this fall.  That's according to Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  Trump is expected to travel to Asia in November in conjunction with a pair of regional summits.  The White House did not immediately respond to questions about the president's fall plans.  A White House read-out of Trump's meetings with Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong (lee haz-ee-en lahng) Monday did not include mention of a state visit.  Singapore will be hosting Trump's summit Tuesday with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.  ___  6 p.m. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says the United States is prepared to take actions to provide North Korea with ``sufficient certainty'' that denuclearization ``is not something that ends badly for them.''  Pompeo is briefing reporters in Singapore ahead of President Donald Trump's summit Tuesday with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. He says the U.S. is prepared to show North Korea that rather than denuclearization posing a threat to North Korea, it's ``the opposite.''  Pompeo won't say whether Trump would consider withdrawing U.S. troops from the Korean Peninsula.  Pompeo says that U.S. sanctions on the North will remain in place until the North denuclearizes. But he says if diplomacy fails to move in the right direction, the sanctions ``will increase.'' ___  5:50 p.m. President Donald Trump called the leaders of South Korea and Japan Monday ahead of his summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.  That's according to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who is briefing reporters in Singapore. He says Trump spoke by phone with the two U.S. allies as preparatory talks continue between American and North Korean officials ahead of the leader sit-down Tuesday morning.  Pompeo says there is ``enormous potential'' for the summit, but lowered expectations that the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula will happen after one meeting. He says: ``We are hopeful the summit will have set the conditions for future productive talks.''  Pompeo also says Tuesday's meeting presents a test of Kim's willingness to agree to deal his nuclear weapons away for ``protections'' from the United States.   ",

The state of Illinois has ordered senior centers, including the one in Millstadt, closed because of the illness.</p><p>Five days a week, Millstadt seniors go to the Millstadt Township Senior Center to play games, eat lunch, and enjoy each other&#8217;s company. But the Illinois Department of Aging said it&#8217;s too risky and the centers need to close for a while to prevent folks from spreading the virus.</p><p>&#8220;This is pretty unusual pretty disruptive here,&#8221; said Patty Evansco, the executive director of the Millstadt Township Senior Center.</p><p>Evansco got the notice Wednesday that her clients cannot come to the senior center for probably two weeks, maybe longer. </p><p>&#8220;My concern is for the safety and health of my seniors that my top priority so I totally agree with this measure,&#8221; she said.</p><p>Wednesday night is the last event here for a while.&#160;It&#8217;s a dinner for many of the volunteers who keep the place running. Folks love the center for its daily meal, games like bingo and quilt making. </p><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like a family, so I&#8217;ll miss it. I&#8217;ll miss it greatly,&#8221; said one client.</p><p>Evansco said she fears some of her approximately 100 clients who are 60 to 100 years old will become lonely. </p><p>&#8220;They get depressed and the depression will lower their resistance to disease and sickness,&#8221; she said.</p><p>The state&#8217;s order to close was getting mixed reviews. </p><p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s ridiculous,&#8221; Betty Schranz said. &#8220;Because I think the media plays this thing up really big, and it&#8217;s not going to be as big as they think it is.&#8221;</p><p>Norma Burleson had a different opinion.</p><p>&#8220;We&#8217;re older people and our immune systems are down and if anyone of us gets and it spreads,  we&#8217;d lose some of our friends, so I have to go along with them,&#8221; she said.</p><p>Now lunches can be picked up or delivered, and the center will still offer many services like transportation to the supermarket and doctors&#8217; offices, as well as tax preparation.</p><p class="modal modal--suggest-a-correction article-content-cta-group__cta">

<p></p><p></p><br><p>And then he admitted he says shocking things like this on purpose just to get bigger rally crowds.</p> <p>Trump's <a href="https://shareblue.com/watch-trumps-admiration-for-dictators-just-became-more-terrifying/">admiration for</a> murderous dictators is well-known &#8212; but he took that to a shocking new level Saturday night when he told a rally crowd that he and North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un "fell in love" with each other.</p>
<p>At a so-called "Make America Great Again" <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3445&amp;v=Zjpu7q-YDGI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rally</a> in Wheeling, West Virginia, Trump devoted a portion of his speech to bragging about his diplomacy with North Korea.</p>
<p>Trump claimed that his <a href="https://gcp.shareblue.com/world-leaders-watch-stone-faced-as-trump-casually-threatens-nuclear-war-at-un/">casual threats</a> of starting a nuclear war, and the dangerously escalating rhetoric between Trump and Kim that led up to their <a href="https://shareblue.com/michael-hayden-trump-kim-jong-un-north-korea-military-exercises/">disastrous summit</a>,&#160;were just examples of the two men being "tough."</p>

    <p>"And then we fell in love, okay?" Trump told the crowd. "No, really. He wrote me beautiful letters, and they&#8217;re great letters. We fell in love."</p>
<p>It is, of course, shocking and inflammatory for Trump to claim that he and a murderous dictator "fell in love."</p>
<p>But then Trump immediately revealed that he knows exactly how shocking and inflammatory this was &#8212; and that he says this kind of thing on purpose so that he can get bigger crowds at his rallies.</p>
<p>"Now they'll say, 'Donald Trump said they fell in love, how horrible &#8212; how horrible is that. So unpresidential!'" Trump said, mocking the way he expected his critics to react.</p>
<p>"It's so easy to be presidential," Trump added. "But instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this packed arena, we'd have about 200 people standing right there."</p>
<p></p>
<p>Trump's declaration of love did indeed draw shocked <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=love%20kim%20jong%20un&amp;src=typd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reactions</a> from many prominent Americans on Twitter.</p>
<p>Former National Security Adviser Susan Rice may have summed it up best when she&#160;<a href="https://twitter.com/AmbassadorRice/status/1046229702455832577?s=19">wrote</a>, "This is totally FUBAR!" (FUBAR is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_military_slang_terms">military slang</a>&#160;for a situation that is "fucked up beyond all repair.")</p>
<p>Former United States Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul pointed out that mocking others for taking offense at what you say doesn't make what you say any less offensive.</p>
<p>"Yes, Mr. President, it is horrible that you 'fell in love' with one of the most brutal dictators in the world today," McFaul&#160;<a href="https://twitter.com/McFaul/status/1046253333491593216?s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a>. "Its worse than horrible. Its sick. As a proud American, your words about 'falling in love' with any world leader, let alone KJU, embarrass me."</p>
<p>"IF Obama said he and Kim Jong Un fell in love, @seanhannity would call him a traitor," former Hillary Clinton staffer Jesse Ferguson <a href="https://twitter.com/JesseFFerguson/status/1046220586567909377" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pointed out.</a>&#160;"As Trump says he and Kim Jong Un fell in love, I'm hearing @seanhannity wants to be best man."</p>
<p>And DNC official Khary Penebaker wondered "how Otto Warmbier&#8217;s parents feel about" Trump's remarks &#8212; a reference to the U.S. <a href="https://shareblue.com/trump-kim-jong-un-north-korea-9-course-lunch/">hostage who died</a> following his captivity in North Korea.</p>
<p>Trump has made <a href="https://gcp.shareblue.com/trump-shamefully-stands-by-as-his-favorite-dictator-brutally-savages-anti-trump-protesters/">a habit</a> of <a href="https://shareblue.com/authoritarians-unite-trump-congratulates-turkish-president-after-internationally-condemned-power-grab/">praising authoritarian</a> dictators. But his latest declaration of "love" for Kim Jong Un is shocking even by <a href="https://shareblue.com/watch-trumps-admiration-for-dictators-just-became-more-terrifying/">those standards</a>.</p>
<p>And even if Trump is doing it on purpose just because he knows it's shocking, that doesn't make it better. Instead, it's yet <a href="https://shareblue.com/embarrassed-trump-says-he-totally-meant-to-make-the-world-laugh-at-him/">another embarrassment</a> of the United States in the eyes of the world.</p>

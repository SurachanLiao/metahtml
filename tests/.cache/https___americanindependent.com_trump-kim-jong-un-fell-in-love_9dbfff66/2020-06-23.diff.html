Trump told the crowd. "No, really. He wrote me beautiful letters, and they’re great letters. We fell in love."</p><p>It is, of course, shocking and inflammatory for Trump to claim that he and a murderous dictator "fell in love."</p><p>But then Trump immediately revealed that he knows exactly how shocking and inflammatory this was — and that he says this kind of thing on purpose so that he can get bigger crowds at his rallies.</p><p>"Now they'll say, 'Donald Trump said they fell in love, how horrible — how horrible is that. So unpresidential!'" Trump said, mocking the way he expected his critics to react.</p><p>"It's so easy to be presidential," Trump added. "But instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this packed arena, we'd have about 200 people standing right there."</p><p>Trump's declaration of love did indeed draw shocked <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=love%20kim%20jong%20un&amp;src=typd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reactions</a> from many prominent Americans on Twitter.</p><p>Former National Security Adviser Susan Rice may have summed it up best when she <a href="https://twitter.com/AmbassadorRice/status/1046229702455832577?s=19">wrote</a>, "This is totally FUBAR!" (FUBAR is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_military_slang_terms">military slang</a>for a situation that is "fucked up beyond all repair.")</p><p>Former United States Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul pointed out that mocking others for taking offense at what you say doesn't make what you say any less offensive.</p><p>"Yes, Mr. President, it is horrible that you 'fell in love' with one of the most brutal dictators in the world today," McFaul <a href="https://twitter.com/McFaul/status/1046253333491593216?s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a>. "Its worse than horrible. Its sick. As a proud American, your words about 'falling in love' with any world leader, let alone KJU, embarrass me."</p><p>"IF Obama said he and Kim Jong Un fell in love, @seanhannity would call him a traitor," former Hillary Clinton staffer Jesse Ferguson <a href="https://twitter.com/JesseFFerguson/status/1046220586567909377" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pointed out.</a>"As Trump says he and Kim Jong Un fell in love, I'm hearing @seanhannity wants to be best man."</p><p>And DNC official Khary Penebaker wondered "how Otto Warmbier’s parents feel about" Trump's remarks — a reference to the U.S. <a href="https://shareblue.com/trump-kim-jong-un-north-korea-9-course-lunch/">hostage who died</a> following his captivity in North Korea.</p><p>Trump has made <a href="https://gcp.shareblue.com/trump-shamefully-stands-by-as-his-favorite-dictator-brutally-savages-anti-trump-protesters/">a habit</a> of <a href="https://shareblue.com/authoritarians-unite-trump-congratulates-turkish-president-after-internationally-condemned-power-grab/">praising authoritarian</a> dictators. But his latest declaration of "love" for Kim Jong Un is shocking even by <a href="https://shareblue.com/watch-trumps-admiration-for-dictators-just-became-more-terrifying/">those standards</a>.</p><p>And even if Trump is doing it on purpose just because he knows it's shocking, that doesn't make it better.

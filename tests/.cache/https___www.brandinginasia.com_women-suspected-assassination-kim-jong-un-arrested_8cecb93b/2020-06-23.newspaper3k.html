<p>Malaysian officials have detained a woman holding a Vietnamese passport in connection with the death of the half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The woman was traveling under the name Doan Thi Huong and had returned to the airport in an attempt to catch a flight to Vietnam Wednesday morning local time.</p>
<p>General of Police Tan Sri Khalid Abu Bakar said she is the same woman shown on surveillance footage.</p>
<p>&#8220;She was in possession of a Socialist Republic of Vietnam travel document,&#8221; Khalid said in a statement, adding that the &#8220;suspect was positively identified from the CCTV footage at the airport and was alone at the time of the arrest,&#8221; Khalid said in a statement.</p><p class="g-single a-80"> 


</p><p>South Korea&#8217;s spy agency said earlier in the day that it suspects two female North Korean agents assassinated the estranged half-brother of the North Korean leader on Tuesday and that there are others involved that are on the run.</p>
<p>The 46-year-old older brother, who at one time branded his little brother&#8217;s regime a &#8216;joke&#8217;, died on his way to hospital&#160;after being poisoned.</p>

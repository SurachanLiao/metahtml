Malaysian police said Thursday that they arrested a third person in connection with the assassination of Kim Jong Nam, the estranged half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

A Malaysian man, the boyfriend of the second suspect arrested in the case, was detained on Wednesday evening, police said.

“He is not the main suspect,” police official Abdul Samah told Malaysian news site Malay Mail Online. “We detained him because we needed more information about the second suspect. He is her boyfriend. When we got him, (and) through him, we managed to detain the second suspect,” he said.

Police named the second suspect as Siti Aishah, 25, from Banten province in Indonesia. Indonesia’s foreign ministry confirmed she was an Indonesian citizen.

“Following that verification, the embassy has requested consular access to the Government of Malaysia to provide assistance in order to ensure her legal rights,” a statement by the Indonesian ministry said.

The first suspect, a 28-year-old woman detained Wednesday at Kuala Lumpur International Airport, was carrying a Vietnamese passport with the name Doan Thi Huong, police said. Vietnam has not confirmed if she is a citizen.

Kim Jong Nam, who was 46 according to a police report, was the eldest son of the late North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, the father of Kim Jong Un, 33.

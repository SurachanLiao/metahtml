<p>Malaysian police said Thursday that they arrested a third person in connection with the assassination of Kim Jong Nam, the estranged half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.</p>
<p>A Malaysian man, the boyfriend of the second suspect arrested in the case, was detained on Wednesday evening, police said.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is not the main suspect,&#8221; police official Abdul Samah told Malaysian news site Malay Mail Online. &#8220;We detained him because we needed more information about the second suspect. He is her boyfriend. When we got him, (and) through him, we managed to detain the second suspect,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Police named the second suspect as Siti Aishah, 25, from Banten province in Indonesia. Indonesia&#8217;s foreign ministry confirmed she was an Indonesian citizen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Following that verification, the embassy has requested consular access to the Government of Malaysia to provide assistance in order to ensure her legal rights,&#8221; a statement by the Indonesian ministry said.</p>
<p>The first suspect, a 28-year-old woman detained Wednesday at Kuala Lumpur International Airport, was carrying a Vietnamese passport with the name Doan Thi Huong, police said. Vietnam has not confirmed if she is a citizen.</p>
<p>Kim Jong Nam, who was 46 according to a police report, was the eldest son of the late North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, the father of Kim Jong Un, 33.</p>

Biogenic amines are a group of naturally occurring amines derived by enzymatic decarboxylation of amino acids. They are primarily responsible for the regulation of cognitive processes but they also play a key role in memory and emotion, as well as in neuronal health and psychiatric disorders. Enzyme Immunoassay (EIA) and Radio Immunoassay (RIA) test kits provide the accurate assessment of the five biogenic amines neurotransmitters (dopamine, norepinephrine (noradrenaline), epinephrine (adrenaline), histamine and serotonin). MP Biomedicals offers Biogenic Amines RIA and EIA Test Kits for the in vitro diagnostic determination of biogenic amines in human serum or plasma as well as Research Use Only (RUO) applications.

While prose cannot help but push us forward word by word, cinema frame by frame, the default state of a picture or video game is inertia. The world, or at least its aperture, stands still until you move it. So, not only do picture books and video games share a focus on the visual, by their very nature, they encourage us to explore their visuals at our own pace. &#8230; <a href="https://www.gamemaz.info/2020/05/picture-books-and-video-games-a-backdoor-into-childhood/" class="more-link">[Read more...] <span class="screen-reader-text">about Picture books and video games: a backdoor into&#160;childhood</span></a></p></article><article class="post-74080569 post type-post status-publish format-standard entry"><p>Solving bugs in game development is complicated. Solving bugs in game development when your game is actually half a dozen games, ported to PC from three different consoles across two decades, is very complicated. That's the broad thrust of the latest Halo: Master Chief Collection community update, which goes into rare, extensive detail about the process of bug fixing a big game. It's an interesting read that's surprisingly easy to understand even if you aren't a game developer, and serves as a direct response to the unfortunately nasty multiplayer bug Halo 2 launched with. &#8230; <a href="https://www.gamemaz.info/2020/05/halo-community-update-tracks-the-obscure-cause-of-halo-2-s-worst-launch-bug/" class="more-link">[Read more...] <span class="screen-reader-text">about Halo community update tracks the obscure cause of Halo 2&#8217;s worst launch bug</span></a></p></article><article class="post-74086593 post type-post status-publish format-standard entry"><p>343 have kept a staggering pace in porting the old Halos, with a brief snapshot at Halo 3 and ODST running on PC coming before even Halo 2 Anniversary&#8217;s release earlier this month. So, while there&#8217;s no mention of the jazzy, Nathan Fillon-fronted spin-off in this week&#8217;s post, it&#8217;s not too shocking that there are already plans to roll out the trilogy&#8217;s closing act. Posting in a development update this week, 343 laid out their plans for Halo 3 flighting (testing) within the &#8220;first half&#8221; of June. &#8230; <a href="https://www.gamemaz.info/2020/05/halo-3-makes-its-pc-debut-with-limited-testing-next-month/" class="more-link">[Read more...] <span class="screen-reader-text">about Halo 3 makes its PC debut with limited testing next&#160;month</span></a></p></article><article class="post-74092362 post type-post status-publish format-standard entry"><p>In case there was any doubt, Baldur's Gate 3's new sizzle reel confirms rooms full of fire &#8230; <a href="https://www.gamemaz.info/2020/05/play-half-life-alyx-as-a-more-traditional-shooter-in-this-vr-free-mod/" class="more-link">[Read more...] <span class="screen-reader-text">about Play Half-Life: Alyx as a more traditional shooter in this VR-free&#160;mod</span></a></p></article><article class="post-74092368 post type-post status-publish format-standard entry"><p>The playlist update comes alongside a double XP, double weapon XP and 2X tier progression weekend.

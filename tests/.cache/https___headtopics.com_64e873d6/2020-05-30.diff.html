Tim Walz announces he is authorizing 'full mobilization' of the state's National Guard. Walz calls it 'an action that has never been taken in the 164 year history of the Minnesota National Guard.'</p><p>Este gobernador es un incapaz como puede apoyar y permitir el racismo en estos tiempos deberia mandarlos a la cárcel a estos malditos policias asesinos. Typical American response. Don't look at the problem - the numerous deaths of black people at police hands - send in the army to deal with protesters at the scene. Governors are blaming protesters for violence yet they are being attacked by police with tear gas and batons. This is Standing Rock coming back to bite you for sending your cops to get anti-BLM training there. MN - look up largest single day hanging in the USA - legacy. The protesters and marauders were allowed to express their anger with little resistance. At some point, the anger has to be reigned in by these adults who have protested and burned, and brandish all their energy at the politicians peacefully, or the anger will eventually backfire Anyone ask him about this?

</del> <p>Mexico’s other major beer producer Heineken – which makes the Tecate and Dos Equis brands – could also stop activities on Friday, Mexican media said.</p> <p>The northern state of Nuevo Leon where Heineken’s Mexican operations are based said on Wednesday it would stop the distribution of beer, sparking panic-buying.</p> <p>The company suffered another blow last week when plans for a $1.5billion brewery on the U.S. border were rejected in a referendum.</p> <p>The plant was already two-thirds built but Mexico’s government said it would not grant operating permits after the vote.</p> <p>Anheuser-Busch InBev, the brewer of Corona and other beers, said last month it believes it has lost $170 million in profits due to the <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/topic/coronavirus/" rel="">coronavirus</a> outbreak.</p> <p>The massive lost sales over the last few months coincides with the rising concern over the disease.</p> <p class="rail__header"></p><h3 class="rail__title

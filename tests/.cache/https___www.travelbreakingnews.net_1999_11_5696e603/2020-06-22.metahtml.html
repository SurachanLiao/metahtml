"If you know you'll be hiking uphill, take off some clothes before you start. Keep your skin a little cold all the time (while moving)." The key is layering: a hydrophobic (water-hating) inner layer, an insulation layer or two, plus a windproof outer layer. "Look for clothes with zippers," adds Curtis, "so you can vent to prevent perspiration." &#8230; <a href="https://www.travelbreakingnews.net/1999/11/winter-harm-cold-dangers/" class="more-link">[Read more...] <span class="screen-reader-text">about Winter Harm: Cold Dangers</span></a></p></article><article class="post-39787851 post type-post status-publish format-standard entry"><p>Here's a favorite recipe of mine: Slice a 1-pound block of tofu into cubes or slabs. Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a wok or skillet on the highest heat, then add the tofu. Flip and rotate the tofu frequently. When the tofu is well browned, add 1 more tablespoon of oil, 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh garlic, and 3 tablespoons soy sauce. Stir well, and cook for a few more minutes. Experiment with other flavors, like a tablespoon of stone-ground mustard or grated gingerroot. Although you can carry tofu in a zipper-lock bag, a hard-sided container helps keep it fluffy longer. &#8230; <a href="https://www.travelbreakingnews.net/1999/11/tofu-anyone/" class="more-link">[Read more...] <span class="screen-reader-text">about Tofu, Anyone?</span></a></p></article><article class="post-39787863 post type-post status-publish format-standard entry"><p>Spend an evening camped in the John Muir Wilderness southwest of Mammoth Lakes, and in the morning you can ask your tentmate with a straight face, "Did the earth move for you last night?" Chances are it did, geologically speaking. The Mammoth Lakes region rides a magma dome whose every burp and gurgle sends shivers to the Earth's crust, making it the most active volcanic hot spot in the continental United States south of Washington's Mt. St. Helens. A record 1,000-plus mini earthquakes were detected in a single day in 1997. &#8230; <a href="https://www.travelbreakingnews.net/1999/11/earthquakes-in-californias-fish-valley/" class="more-link">[Read more...] <span class="screen-reader-text">about Earthquakes in California&#8217;s Fish Valley</span></a></p></article><article class="post-39787875 post type-post status-publish format-standard entry"><p>Most invasive plants are characterized as "aggressive." This can mean they put down extensive root systems, seed often and prodigiously, use nutrients in high quantities, or grow in ways that reduce sunlight and water access to other plants. While winds can blow plant seeds long distances, most invasions result from the acts of man. As the population has shifted to the South and West in recent decades, some people have taken their favorite plants with them. Jet transportation has made global travel and shipping more pervasive, making the accidental and deliberate transfer of foreign plants from continent to continent easier. &#8230; <a href="https://www.travelbreakingnews.net/1999/11/americas-least-wanted-flowers/" class="more-link">[Read more...] <span class="screen-reader-text">about America&#8217;s Least Wanted Flowers</span></a></p></article><article class="post-39787827 post type-post status-publish format-standard entry"><p>Knowing what to look for is the key to finding a bona fide meteorite. It will look different from the other rocks, since its origins and wear-and-tear were different. The surface will have a smooth "cooked," or glazed, appearance, possibly with small pock marks. The color is often black or dark gray, though older meteorites may be a rust brown. Shape is usually irregular, not spherical. &#8230; <a href="https://www.travelbreakingnews.net/1999/11/hunting-for-meteors/" class="more-link">[Read more...] <span class="screen-reader-text">about Hunting For Meteors</span></a></p></article></main>

Areas downwind of the Great Lakes are expected to be buried by intense lake-effect snow lakes into Thursday night.</p>
<p>
The region near Buffalo, New York, should see the heaviest snowfall. Snow could fall at rates of 3in-5in (7cm-12cm) per hour.</p>
<p>
The icy cold is expected to loosen its grip on Friday.</p>
<p>
With wind chill factored in, the Midwest and Great Lakes have felt temperatures closer to -40C (-40F) and -53C (-63F), which is enough to cause frostbite in under five minutes.</p>
<p>
But by the end of the weekend, Chicago could see temperatures as high as 10C (50F).</p>
<p>
"It's going to be at least a 60-degree swing for Chicago," David Hamrick, a National Weather Service forecaster, told Reuters news agency.</p>
<h2 class="story-body__crosshead">
How is the cold snap affecting daily life?</h2>

Michigan residents have had similar requests from their utility companies as providers struggle to keep the states warm.</p>
<p>
Detroit, Michigan, has had more than two dozen water mains freeze over this week. A city spokesman told the Associated Press the pipes were installed up to 1.8m below the frost line, but with such drastically low temperatures, the ground has still frozen through.</p>
<p>
The US Postal Service has suspended all mail deliveries for the second day to parts of six states.</p>

How cold is Chicago?</h2>
<p>
The Illinois city became a frozen ghost town after temperatures fell to -30C (-22F), colder than parts of Antarctica. But as Chicago is forecast to warm up to a balmy -6C (43F) later on Thursday, many residents will have to prepare to return to work.</p>
<p>
A Good Samaritan paid for 70 homeless Chicagoans to stay in a hotel as temperatures dropped.</p>
<p>
Salvation Army spokeswoman Jacqueline Rachev&#160;<a class="story-body__link-external" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/01/31/true-hero-good-samaritan-puts-up-dozens-chicagos-homeless-hotel-amid-record-low-temperatures/">told the Washington Post</a>: "It's a deadly situation for anyone. We're thrilled that someone was in a position to be able to do this."</p>
<p>
Most of the thousands of cancelled flights this week were coming out of Chicago's airports - O'Hare International is ranked as one of the top 10 busiest airports in the world.</p>
<p>
Amtrak also cancelled all trains into Chicago on Wednesday, affecting 55 trains, and said most would be cancelled on Thursday as well.</p>

What about Canada?</h2>
<p>
Most of Canada was under some sort of weather warning - from extreme cold in the Prairies, Quebec and Ontario to heavy snows in Alberta and Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>
In Toronto, where winters tend to be milder compared to cities such as Montreal and Ottawa, temperatures had plummeted to -18C (0F). Icy roads and several transit delays made for a hellish commute for millions of the city's residents.</p>
<p>
Environment Canada issued extreme cold warnings for most parts of Ontario, Quebec and Manitoba, urging residents to limit their exposure to cold and keep pets indoors.</p>
<p>
"If it's too cold for you to stay outside, it's too cold for your pet to stay outside," the weather agency warned.</p>
<p>
Advocates expressed concern for homeless people living in cities hit by the extreme temperatures.</p>
<p>
In Winnipeg, the capital of Manitoba, temperatures were a frigid -40C (-40F), with wind chill factors making it feel like -50C (-58F).</p>
<p>

<p>
In Calgary, Alberta, temperatures were a relatively balmy -3C (27F), but were expected to plummet overnight and through the weekends.</p>
<p>
In parts of rural northern Alberta, 15in of snow were expected to fall.</p>

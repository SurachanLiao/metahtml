                L. No Shiite sign!<br>
              R. Ayatollah Khomeini: Thank you Allah for making me the Shah!</p>
          <p class="style84">"Ayatollah 
            Ruhollah Khomeini was the founder and the first Supreme Clerical 
            and Social Leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran."</p>
          <p class="style84"><img src="images/No%20Shiite%20sign.jpg" width="568" height="389"></p>
          <p class="style84">A selection 
            from "<b>Resaleh</b>" (Towzih ol Masael) Book of Ayatollah 
            Ruhollah Khomeini:</p>
          <p class="style84">Have in mind 
            that these are the true words of The Leader and Founder of The 
            Islamic Republic of Iran, the first Supreme Cleric and Social 
            Leader of IRI. Ayatollah Khomeini is also one of the Greatest 
            Imams (Saints) of the Shiite Islam in the Whole Wide World.</p>
          <p class="style84">In the past, 
            I wrote a few parts series about writings of Ayatollah Khomeini 
            in his famous book "Resaleh" and his views on sex, specifically 
            sex with a nine year old child and how to pay and how much to 
            pay or not to pay for damaging the child's vagina, or marry and 
            not to marry her as a Siqeh, in a temporary wedding.</p>
          <p class="style84"><b>Islamically Correct Toilet Training</b></p>
          <p class="style84">Now I shall 
            mention a few of Ayatollah's famous hints on the chapter related 
            to "How to Behave in the Bathroom, Islamic Way"! </p>
          <p class="style84">Many of you 
            already know about this famous chapter of Khomeini's book, the 
            ones who had never read the book, please go and buy it, even if 
            you have to read it as humor only to laugh!</p>
          <p class="style84">Ayatollah 
            begins talking about how to enter the bathroom, with what foot 
            first and what foot second, and then how to sit on the toilet, 
            with what foot first and what foot second to be Islamically proper!</p>
          <p class="style84"><b>Islamically Correct Bathroom Geography!</b></p>
          <p class="style84">Then he goes 
            on through paragraphs about in what position to sit on the toilet, 
            one must sit on the toilet not facing the Holy Kabbah in Mecca, 
            also not to show his Moameleh (tools) towards the Mecca in Saudi 
            Arabia, cause showing your Haji Kuchike or schlong towards Mecca 
            is Haraam (Religiously Forbidden), however if sitting down towards 
            Mecca and showing your Shambool towards it while doing number 
            two or one, yet covering it with your hands while doing your business, 
            is Macrooh (Religiously not recommended, yet fine). It is also 
            not OK to turn your back to Mecca while taking a dump! It is not 
            polite to show your Anus to House of Allah! So technically one 
            should first find out in what direction is Mecca, it all depends 
            that where are you located (in the world) while taking the dump!</p>
          <p class="style84">For instance, 
            If you are in San Diego, you need to know not to face the South 
            East nor back to the South East while Shiiting all over the bathroom! 
            Other wise it might be Macrooh even Haraam (Religiously forbidden)! 
            So if you want to take a Halaal (Religiously OK) dump, you need 
            to study and know your Geography of the bathroom, which you are 
            about to take the dump in! Now all this is fine, but what if you 
            are vacationing or in a Foreign land, or city?! You need to somehow 
            know the Geography of the Toilet!</p>
          <p class="style84">I guess Ayatollah 
            means that all people should carry a compass or Thomas Guide Map 
            Book, before entering a strange bathroom! Do not worry about the 
            toilet paper, or soap or water, yet make sure that you got your 
            compass and map when visiting a strange toilet!</p>
          <p class="style84"><b>Islamically Correct Butt Wash!</b></p>
          <p class="style84">Then The Great 
            Saint of Islam, the holy Imam Khomeini, continues about the way 
            to wash the Ass, Islamic way!</p>
          <p class="style84">He expands 
            that when taking the dump and ready to wash your Ass, either with 
            the Aftabeh (Islamic Toilet Pitcher) full of water, or a Water 
            Hose connected to the wall (modern Ass Wash), one must first make 
            sure that he caresses his hand movements from the back of the 
            butt between the butt Cheeks, towards the front until he hits 
            the balls (Roundels)! Cause if he does this gentle movement vise 
            versa (front to back), then he might not properly clean himself 
            and take pieces of Doodoo to the back area of the buns! And the 
            wrong method might not truly clean the between cheeks area; therefore, 
            if he does prayer (Salath) later, the prayer will not be true, 
            and it might become false (Batel)!</p>
          <p class="style84"><b>Islamically Correct Butt Fingering!</b></p>
          <p class="style84">Also when 
            holding the toilet pitcher with one hand and washing your Hiney 
            with the other one, you need to make sure that first you must 
            use "The Middle Finger" and for sure recommended to 
            stick 2/3 of your middle finger (Do Sols) in your butt hole, three 
            or so times and then caress your between butt cheeks forward towards 
            your balls, three times!</p>
          <p class="style84">2/3 of the 
            middle finger, then with full hand rubbing towards the front area 
            between your butt is religiously crucial! If not, your cleaning, 
            Qosl (Islamic shower), or Vozu (Wash before prayer) or Taharat 
            (Islamic Butt Wipe) will not be done properly; therefore, your 
            prayer might end up being False (Batel), so you shall read it 
            again!</p>
          <p class="style84">So on each 
            Taharat you must stick 2/3 of your middle finger 3 times in your 
            butt hole and then rub it 3 times from the hole all the way to 
            your balls! Oh, and women should do it backwards, from the hole 
            to the back of the butt, because if they bring it on forwards, 
            they may get Doodoo in their Poonani!</p>
          <p class="style84">Yup, men should 
            butt wash in the direction of back-forth and women must butt wash 
            in the direction of forth-back! Are you guys taking notes or what? 
            I am trying to enlighten yous? Welcome to Shiite Islam! Are you 
            getting all of this or do you want me to draw diagrams?</p>
          <p class="style84">I imagine 
            there are also Shiite Diagrams available for all good Shiites 
            on how to take a Shiite! You see, Shiite Muslim are in need of 
            Marja' Taqlid and Velayat-e Faqih (Supreme Religious Leadership) 
            to follow his every move or else they will be lost!</p>
          <p class="style84">OK this is 
            all fine and dandy, but now imagine a few things:</p>
          <p class="style84">By the time 
            a good Muslim in a foreign Land studies the Geography of the Bathroom 
            and the angle of the toilet in relation to Mecca, his number two 
            or number one might go up and he might not even have to nor can 
            go any more! Or worst, he might dirty his pants and underwear!</p>
          <p class="style84">Then there 
            is the issue with the 2/3 of the middle finger! Imagine sticking 
            that much finger in your butt holio, everytime you go to the bathroom! 
            Boy, one can become Gay by sticking them fingers up and down his 
            rectum! He might actually like it, you know, men have their prostate 
            there and it is gentle, why do you think Gays enjoy doing it that 
            way so much!? Hey no wonder all the holy Tolab students, Hojatol 
            Eslams, and Ayatollahs are all in to homosexual Activities, it 
            is all according to The Book! Islam actually turns you gay, but 
            then they hang you for being gay! All the holy Muslim clerics 
            are gay, but then they release Fatwa against the gays! What hypocrites! 
            On the other hand, transsexuality is allowed and recommended (according 
            to Ayatollah Khomeini)! Today's Iran is transsexual heaven and 
            the center for the cheapest transsexual operations in the globe! 
            Isn't Islam great? This religion is one large Islamic Bangarooni 
            for the Kunis!</p>
          <p class="style84">Imam Khamenei 
            himself was the Boy Toy of Imam Khomeini! In the old days, the 
            duo posters of Shah and Farah were all over Iranian cities' walls. 
            Today there are the duo posters of Khomeini and Khamenei all over 
            the Iranian cities' walls!</p>
          <p class="style84">So today's 
            "<b>Shah and Farah</b>" are "<b>Khomeini and Khamenei</b>", 
            well except that these Shah and Farah are Gays! Allah is merciful!</p>
          <p class="style84">See people, 
            I bet with you, if the Great Saint and Martyr of Islam, The Great 
            Shiatsu, Oops I mean The Great Shiite, Ayatollah Khomeini would 
            have only talked half of what he had mentioned about Sex with 
            Under Aged Girls and Children, How to Repair Children's Damaged 
            and not fully grown Vaginas, how sodomizing little girls in the 
            butt is Halaal but boning small vagina is not, how to enter, sit, 
            dump, and clean your Ass in the Bathroom, and on and on....... 
            Now only if he would talk as half of all this about Bull Shiite, 
            yet only about The Economy, Society, Politics, Philosophy, etc. 
            Maybe Iran, other Shiite Nations, and other Islamic Nations in 
            Middle East and North Africa would have not been so Screwed Up 
            and Backward!</p>
          <p class="style84">Only if the 
            Great Saint Imam Khomeini would have talked a few chapters about 
            Economical problems, instead of little girls' poontangs and Guys' 
            Corn Holes and 2/3 finger issues, maybe Iran's Economy and Social 
            Status would have been semi sufficient!</p>
          <p class="style84">But then what 
            do you expect from a group of Religious Mullahs of Uneducated 
            and Horny Toads?! Did you possibly expect them to write about 
            Actual Social Issues?<br>
                <br>
            Just a thought, imagine A Founder of a new political or Social 
            Ideology like Marx, Engels, Mussolini, Hitler, Adam Smith, Thomas 
            Jefferson, or others would have talked about the same issues that 
            Khomeini talked about in their books! Imagine if <b>Marx </b>would 
            have talked about how to wash Ass in German Society, the Proletariat 
            Way! I'm telling ya, Marx was so na&#239;ve and primitive not 
            releasing a few chapters on how to wash ass or bang butts in Das 
            Kapital! How about Hitler? Imagine if <b>Hitler</b> would have 
            talked about how to butt wipe, National Socialistic way! Wouldn't 
            then Mine Kampf be more colorful?!</p>
          <p class="style84">Yes, my friends, 
            these are the reasons that Europe is Europe, America is America, 
            Japan is Japan, and United States will soon Land Human on Mars 
            ...... and then Iran is where it is today!</p>
          <p class="style84">US is seeking 
            salvation in "Space Exploration" for human's future 
            ecological space and resources to live and survive, and then Iran 
            is seeking salvation in "Rectum and 2/3 fingering of the 
            holes" or "Banging 9 year old girls' vaginas, the correct 
            and Islamic way" and in accordance to the jokes of the books 
            such as Quran, Nahjol Bilaqah, Resaleh, and etc.</p>
          <p class="style84">For more beautiful 
            tales of Imam Khomeini on Bathroom Behaviors, Laws and Regulations, 
            also toilet training the Shiite, please go to the IPC Persian 
            Library and read the complete Resaleh:</p>

          </p>
          <p class="style84">Yes, my friends 
            this is why the civilized world is going to the Mars and Iran 
            is going to the Rectum! US is discovering the universe, expanding 
            robotics, completing computer science, and Iran is concerned about 
            women covering their hair and legs with Chador and Hejab so the 
            men will not get an instantaneous combustion of orgasmic climax 
            and wet themselves! Let's spend half of the budget on buying used 
            up Military junk from China and Russia and send the other half 
            to Mullahs' Bank Accounts in Swiss and Caymans, let's see how 
            fast can we Absolutely Screw Up and Deform, Degenerate, and Transform 
            the superior Persian culture in to an Islamic Shiite hole?</p>
          <p class="style84">The Degeneration 
            of a Nation, how fast and how long does it take? Is 29 years enough 
            to Destroy a Nation?! Or do we need to give Mullahs more time?! </p>
          <p class="style84">In today's 
            Iran, people await for Imam Khamenei to observe with his telescope, 
            and figure out the exact time when the Moon is aligned with Bull 
            Crap (Qamar dar Aqrab) and astrologically correct to release the 
            exact time for Eid Fetr (Eid ul Fitr) celebrations during Ramadan 
            and Muharram! Every day people look up on their Marja' Taqlid 
            (Supreme Spiritual Leader), Imam Khamenei to declare the exact 
            time for the Eid, so they can celebrate!</p>
          <p class="style84">In the west, 
            people are in to technology, but in Iran our people are in to 
            astrology, superstition and religious garbage!</p>
          <p class="style84">What have 
            I told you?</p>
          <p class="style84">Islamic Republic 
            of Iran is the government of <b>Hamals</b> (Porters) and <b>Ramals</b> (Fortune Tellers)! Hamal like Ahmadinejad and Ramal like Khamenei! 
            Yes my friends, the government of Hamals and Ramals for the Morons!</p>
          <p class="style84">This is today's 
            Iran, thanks to Glory of Islam!</p>
          <p class="style84">Welcome to 
            Islam, religion of Bull Shiite by the Bulls (Imams) for the Shiite!</p>

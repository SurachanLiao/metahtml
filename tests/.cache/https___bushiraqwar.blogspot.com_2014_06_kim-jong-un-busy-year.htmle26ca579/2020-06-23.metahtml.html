and tucked into a dish of 'spag-bol' in an Italian restaurant in Jakarta.  </p><p align="justify">He even wrapped a burly arm around the chef's shoulders as they posed for a photo, but the chef was so concerned about his own safety that he asked for his face to be obscured.  </p>  <p align="justify">+2  </p><p align="justify">Kim Jong-nam, the elder half-brother of North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un, poses for a photo with the chef of an Italian restaurant in Jakarta earlier this month  </p><p align="justify">Kim looked every part the aging playboy he is reputed to be as he brazenly grinned into the camera with his dangling sunglasses and straw hat.  </p><p align="justify">Happy to shake off memories of bibimbap - a common North Korean dish of rice, vegetables and occasionally eggs and meat - Kim is said to have consumed his Italian meal with great relish in the upmarket restaurant.  </p><p align="justify">The photo was acquired by South Korea's YTN television network from a friend of Kim's.  </p><p align="justify">&#8216;Despite reports that Kim Jong-nam's safety was in question following the execution of his uncle, Jang Song-taek, he is still alive and well,' said a source close to the family.  </p><p align="justify">'He's living the same lavish lifestyle, moving around between Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia and France.'  </p><p align="justify">He has been seen in the casinos of Macau and slipping into fine-dining restaurants throughout South East Asia.  </p><p align="justify">But he is said to be aware that his life remains in constant danger because he criticised the King Jong-un regime and he made sure he 'disappeared' following the execution of Jang last December.  </p><p align="justify">Another source claims that a North Korean agent had tried to assassinate Kim Jong-nam in Macau in 2011, but failed after a bloody shootout with his bodyguards. He fled to another city.  </p><p align="justify">Since then, he has lived the life of a wandering playboy and when he visited the Italian restaurant - which is owned by a Japanese businessman - he was accompanied by an attractive woman aged in her early 30s.  </p>  <p align="justify">+2  </p><p align="justify">Kim Jong-Nam has been moving from city to city in South East Asia amid concerns of an assassination attempt by North Korean agents  </p><p align="justify">Until late 2011, when his father - former leader Kim Jong-il, who is also Kim Jong-un's father by a different mother - was still alive, Jong-nam shuffled back and forth between Beijing and Macau, where his first and second wives lived.  </p><p align="justify">He is also known to have travelled to Thailand, Austria and Russia, stopping in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, from time to time.  </p><p align="justify">But following the death of his father he disappeared from view, fearing the purges being carried out by his younger half-brother.  </p><p align="justify">He has been able to live well, say North Korea watchers, thanks to benefits from building projects and trading companies set up by his executed uncle Jang Song-taek.  </p><p align="justify">'It is possible that he believes he is not on the list of those to be purged by the current North Korean regime,' a source said.  </p><p align="justify">'This is why he has happily posed for a photo in an Indonesian restaurant. But he would not have gone back there a second time - just in case.'  </p><p align="justify">In fact, it is believed he has moved on from Jakarta since the picture was taken earlier this month.  </p><p align="justify">He is said to be still on his guard, worried that his playboy lifestyle might have infuriated his younger half-brother, who had been angered by the 'worldliness and womanising' of Kim Jang-taek.  </p><p align="justify">There is speculation that Beijing is watching Kim Jong-nam's back for him, with a pencilled-in plan to install him as leader of North Korea should the regime of Kim Jong-un collapse.  </p></td>   <td valign="top" width="199">       <h3 align="left">Looks like Un's been to Iceland!

is rare in North Korea, with Kim usually keen to praise government agencies in an attempt to pass his regime off as a success  </p><p align="justify">Accurate forecasts are needed to protect the 'lives and properties' of people from disasters caused by 'abnormal climatic phenomenon', he said.  </p><p align="justify">Calling the weather service 'very important work directly affecting the overall economic affairs', Kim also underscored the need to 'modernise meteorological observation equipment at a high level', KCNA said.  </p><p align="justify">It was not clear when Kim visited the agency, but public criticism of government officials during field trips by North Korean leaders is extremely rare.  </p><p align="justify">Usually Kim's official visits are marked by broad smiles and adoring crowds while Kim praises the work people are doing, in an attempt to pass his regime off as a success.  </p><h3 align="justify">Kim Jong-un has engineers behind deadly North Korean apartment

<div><p class="description">The never ending wars of habitual aggressors are likely to end up as failures. The dreams of world domination, contradictory to the majority  persist to play politics over the lives of  men and resources. Like the fog of war based on failed intelligence reports led to the demise of our world influence, the loss of a $3T surplus to a $2.5T deficit in six years, intended for our governance. Worst still, is the planned attack on Syria and Iran.How much more did we learn?....Amor Patriae</p>

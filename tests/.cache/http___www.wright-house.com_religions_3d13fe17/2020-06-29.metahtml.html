Book Description: 
  
Emphasizing the inner -- rather than institutional -- dimensions of [the world's major] religions, Smith devotes special attention to Zen and Tibetan Buddhism, Sufism, and the teachings of Jesus. He convincingly conveys the unique appeal and gifts of each of the traditions and reveals their hold on the human heart and imagination.

Synopsis: 
  
When Takeko Hose was shot and paralyzed from the knees down, she and her husband, David, turned to prayer more fervently than ever. They received all they'd hoped for and more. Every Day God recounts the dialogues Takeko and David have engaged in with God for eight years. To them, God is akin to a warm and caring parent eager to nurture and love every child unconditionally. Moreover, with the right seeking, each person can access this divine source at the core of his or her being.

Review by Booklist: 
  
The Dalai Lama's most salient traits are his great beaming smile and hearty laugh, spontaneous expressions of happiness that inspired Cutler, a psychiatrist, to initiate what evolved into a long and productive series of conversations about what aspects of Buddhist thought could help non-Buddhists achieve a sense of fulfillment. Their discussions ranged far and wide, revealing many differences between Eastern and Western thought.... Over and over again, Cutler poses complicated psychological inquiries only to have the Dalai Lama offer responses that reach far beyond the parameters of the self. There really is such a thing as an art of happiness, and this is one of the best how-to books a reader will ever find. --Donna Seaman

Xinhua had its correspondents in Seoul and Pyongyang write a detailed background of the story which has circulated in the often gossip fueled and unverifiable rumor filled South Korean media, concluding that media stories that Kim Jong-un has had plastic surgery six times to resemble his grandfather.

Every responsible work unit must demand that its department’s editors, reporters, and staff discontinue voicing their support for Southern Weekly online. Starting tomorrow, media and websites in all locales must prominently republish the Global Times editorial “Southern Weekly’s ‘Message to Readers’ Is Food for Thought Indeed.” (January 7, 2013).”中宣部：关于南方周末新年献辞出版事件的紧急通知，各级主管党委和媒体，对于此次事件，必须明确以下三点：一，党管媒体是不可动摇的基本原则；二， 南方周末此次出版事故与广东省委宣传部长庹震同志无关；三，此事的发展有境外敌对势力介入。各主管单位必须严格要求其部门的编辑，记者和员工不得继续在网 络上发言支持南方周末。各地媒体、网站明天起以显著版面转发《环球时报》的社评《南方周末“致读者”实在令人深思》。</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The order by Beijing to all media and bloggers to ‘refrain from writing on the personal lives of North Korean leaders” comes two days after Beijing on Tuesday took an unusually adversarial position against Pyongyang in signing a unanimous United Nations Security Council resolution that imposed new sanctions on North Korea for their December launch of a long range ballistic rocket, which most analysts say was testing the rocket delivery system for nuclear warheads designed to reach the United States.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>“China maintains that the Security Council’s reaction should be prudent and moderate, and that it should work for the peace and stability of the (Korean) Peninsula and avoid the progressive escalation of tensions,” foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei said at a daily press briefing on Monday.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The U.S. and China hashed out a carefully worded agreement in private negotiations over the last month to win Beijing’s approval of the UN sanctions. “China and the US have many differences in principles over dealing with the satellite launch. That’s why the <a title="Posts tagged with UN" href="http://chinadigitaltimes.net/china/un/">UN Link: http://chinadigitaltimes.net/china/un/ </a> negotiations have lasted for more than a month,”Shi Yuanhua, a researcher on Korean studies at the Shanghai-based Fudan University, was quoted as saying.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Diplomats say the <a title="Posts tagged with U.S." href="http://chinadigitaltimes.net/china/us/">U.S. Link: http://chinadigitaltimes.net/china/us/ </a> circulated a draft resolution to the 15-member U.N. Security Council condemning the launch and expand existing sanctions.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Aside from the UNSC resolution, Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi said China does not support North Korea’s nuclear weapons program at a meeting with a delegation sent by South Korea’s President-elect to Beijing. “I believe South Korea under Park’s leadership will achieve its growth targets of the new era,” Yang was quoted by the official South Korean news agency, Yonhap, as saying during a meeting with the delegation. “South Korea is very important to China, and our strategic relations will develop into a new stage and take a big leap down the road.”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>North Korean state media just released a statement by the supreme power body of the regime, the National Defense Commission Thursday January 24 vowing “ a variety of satellites and long-range rockets which will be launched by the DPRK one after another and a nuclear test of higher level” in an “upcoming all-out action.” The NDC dismissed “all the illegal resolutions adopted by the “United Nations Security Council.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The NDC built on Wednesday January 23 KCNA official reaction to the UN security Council condemnation and sanctions taken after last month’s launch of a ballistic missile rocket designed as a delivery system for nuclear weapons, “that only when the denuclearization of the world is realized on a perfect and preferential basis including the denuclearization of the U.S., will it be possible to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula and ensure peace and security of the DPRK.”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The NDC statement is significant as is targets Beijing, as much as the US or ROK.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The National Defense Commission statement, according to KCNA said : “Our successful launch of satellite Kwangmyongsong 3-2 was a great jubilee in the history of the nation as it placed the nation’s dignity and honor on the highest plane and a spectacular success made in the efforts to develop space for peaceful purposes recognized by the world.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>This being a hard reality, the U.S. at the outset of the year termed our satellite launch “long-range missile launch,” “wanton violation” of the UN resolutions and “blatant challenge” to world peace and security in a bid to build up public opinion on this. Finally, it prodded the UNSC into cooking up a new resolution on tightening sanctions against the DPRK.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The keynote of the resolution was worked out through backstage dealing with the U.S. as a main player and it was adopted at the UNSC with blind hand-raising by its member nations. This goes to clearly prove that the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK has entered a new dangerous phase. 
This shows, at the same time, that those big countries, which are obliged to take the lead in building a fair world order, are abandoning without hesitation even elementary principle, under the influence of the U.S. arbitrary and high-handed practices, failing to come to their senses.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Moreover, this also indicates that the UNSC, which should regard it as its mission to guarantee sovereign rights and security of its member nations, has turned into a defunct marionette international body on which no hope can be pinned.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The DPRK National Defence Commission solemnly declares as follows as regards the adoption of the entirely unreasonable resolution on the DPRK:</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>We totally reject all the illegal resolutions on the DPRK adopted by the UNSC.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>We have never recognized all forms of base resolutions tightening sanctions cooked up by the hostile forces to encroach upon the DPRK’s sovereignty.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Sovereignty is what keeps a country and nation alive.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The country and the nation without sovereignty are more dead than alive.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The U.S. should clearly know that the times have changed and so have the army and the people of the DPRK.</ins></p><ins> </ins><ol><li><ins>Along with the nationwide efforts to defend the sovereignty, the DPRK will continue launching peaceful satellites to outer space one after another. 
2. As the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK has entered more dangerous phase, overall efforts should be directed to denuclearizing big powers including the U.S. rather than the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. 
The army and people of the DPRK drew a final conclusion that only when the denuclearization of the world is realized on a perfect and preferential basis including the denuclearization of the U.S., will it be possible to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula and ensure peace and security of the DPRK. 
“Under this situation the DPRK can not but declare that there will no longer exist the six-party talks and the September 19 joint statement.” 
No dialogue on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula will be possible in the future even though there may be dialogues and negotiations on ensuring peace and security in the region including the Korean Peninsula. 
3. We will launch an all-out action to foil the hostile policy toward the DPRK being pursued by the U.S. and those dishonest forces following the U.S., and safeguard the sovereignty of the country and the nation. 
The UN Security Council resolution on expanding sanctions against the DPRK, which was adopted on the initiative of the U.S., represents the most dangerous phase of the hostile policy toward the DPRK.</ins></li><ins> </ins></ol><ins> </ins><p><ins>Under the prevailing situation, the army and people of the DPRK will turn out in an all-out action to defend its sovereignty which is more precious than their own lives and frustrate the moves of the U.S. and its allies to isolate and stifle the DPRK.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>We do not hide that a variety of satellites and long-range rockets which will be launched by the DPRK one after another and a nuclear test of higher level which will be carried out by it in the upcoming all-out action, a new phase of the anti-U.S. struggle that has lasted century after century, will target against the U.S., the sworn enemy of the Korean people.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Settling accounts with the U.S. needs to be done with force, not with words as it regards jungle law as the rule of its survival.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The world will clearly see how the army and people of the DPRK punish all kinds of hostile forces and emerge as a final victor while following the just road of defending its sovereignty, convinced of the justice of its cause.”</ins></p><ins> </ins><h3 class="sd-title"><ins>Share this:</ins></h3><ul><li

</ins><p><ins>North Korea has erupted after months of silence over repeated news reports that Kim Jong-Un had plastic surgery to look like his grandfather, Kim Il Sung, with official media denouncing  “sordid” and “false report… released by enemies is a hideous criminal act which the party, state, army and people can never tolerate,” said Korean Central News Agency on Wednesday, calling it “sordid hackwork by rubbish media.”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p id="caption-attachment-811" class="wp-caption-text"><ins>Kim Il Sung (L) and his Grandson (R)</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>What seemed to set Pyongyang off in a particularly virulent tizzy was not months of speculative South Korean news reports suggesting the young Kim had undergone plastic surgery, but rather a Chinese report last week by China’s Shenzhen TV who cited a diplomatic source who, on a private visit to Pyongyang, had spoken to a North Korean official who confirmed the plastic surgery rumours. KCNA referenced the Chinese report,</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>“Those hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership of the nation should not expect any mercy or leniency.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>“Time will clearly show what dear price the human scum and media in the service of traitors of South Korea, slaves of capital, will have to pay,” it said.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p id="caption-attachment-812" class="wp-caption-text"><ins>Statues of Kim Il Sung and his son Kim Jong Il in Pyongyang</ins></p><ins> </ins><p id="caption-attachment-813" class="wp-caption-text"><ins>Kim Jong Un on horse repeatedlly depicted in state media since he assumed power one year ago</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Apparently, Pyongyang issued a demarche to Beijing, and the Chinese ruling party instructed the official Chinese party organ, Xinhua, to debunk the stories, and Xinhua issued a report Tuesday, citing two of its correspondents in Pyongyang who  denied the plastic surgery rumours. Xinhua had its correspondents in Seoul and Pyongyang write a detailed background of the story which has circulated in the often gossip fueled and unverifiable rumor filled South Korean media, concluding that media stories that Kim Jong-un has had plastic surgery six times to resemble his grandfather was first reported in Seoul, then picked up by a Chinese news website, and then reported as fact on Shenzhen Satellite TV.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The rumours have been fed by Pyongyang’s propaganda apparatus who for months carefully crafted a meticulous written and pictorial narrative trying to evoke similarities between Kim Jong-Un and his grandfather, including through his dress, haircut, gestures and public appearances.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Xinhua cited as evidence of the stories falsehood that “There have been no news reports in North Korea about Kim Jong-un’s plastic surgery” and that there was “nothing suspicious” about Kim resembling his grandfather since they carry same genes.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>While Kim tries to dress, walk and smile like his grandfather, this just aims to give the impression that he “holds the people dear,” Xinhua said.</ins></p><ins> </ins><h3 class="sd-title"><ins>Share this:</ins></h3><ul><li class="share-twitter"><ins><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" class="share-twitter sd-button share-icon"

Daughter of Google Chief Spills The True Story on North Korea Visit: Puts to Shame Free Press, Dad, and U.S. Government</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>By Nate Thayer</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Google chief executive Eric Schmidt may now regret inviting his 19 year old teenage daughter, Sophie Schmidt, along on his world headline grabbing, secretive trip to North Korea last week.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Sophie Schmidt was one of the nine members of the high powered delegation which included her dad, representing the world’s most prominent powerhouse, Google corporation, in the new internet age of borderless, free, uncensored flow of  information to the most restricted closed and censored society on earth. Other members included her dad, former U.S. presidential candidate, Ambassador to the United Nations and governor of New Mexico, Bill Richardson, and other powerful but very tight lipped hi tech and government types.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Together they have revealed virtually nothing of the purpose, encounters, impressions, and success of the trip to North Korea.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p id="caption-attachment-755" class="wp-caption-text"><ins>Cartoon posted by hid daughter on blog post writing about her trip to North Korea</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Until teenager Sophie posted a startling frank, detailed, and revealing blog today, accompanied by typical American teenage bluntness and snarky, that blew away the powerful American mucky mucks scripted silence, revealing all the public interest really needed to know.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Now, really, was that so hard?</ins></p><ins> </ins><p id="caption-attachment-757" class="wp-caption-text"><ins>North Korean ID card of Sophie Schmidt, teenage daughter of Google chief</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The quite entertaining and enticing young Ms Schmidt got right to the point.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Titled “It might not get weirder than this”, Sophie’s blog post began with the caveat “ Pro tip: Max browser window (for width), keep scrolling and blame Google Sites (and this two-column structure idea of mine) for limited functionality.  Proper slideshow at the end with larger-version photos. Apologies to folks with f’d up layouts” which was followed by a highlighted note before her incisive and insightful musing on the Google delegation 4 day visit began: “Disclaimer: I am a North Korea amateur and can only share what it’s like to be part of a NK-bound delegation. Straightforward trip report here: no discussion of meeting details or intentions–just some observations.”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>She began with a photo of the North Korean Custom form to be filled out upon arrival in Pyongyang. “Do note #1 and #6: leave your “killing device” and “publishing’s of all kinds” at home.  Got it. We carried a ton of cash (USD) since that was the only way to pay for anything.”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p id="caption-attachment-751" class="wp-caption-text"><ins>“Do note #1 and #6: leave your “killing device” and “publishing’s of all kinds” at home. Got it.” wrote Ms Schmidt</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>She then detailed the ambience of their surroundings. “We also met our handlers, two men from the Foreign Ministry, whom we gave code names. Unusually, both men had lived in the US, in addition to other countries, as embassy staffers…. How on earth do they reconcile the differences they see between their experience abroad and what they’d always been told?” adding “It was a nine-person delegation in total. We left our phones and laptops behind in China, since we were warned they’d be confiscated in NK, and probably infected with lord knows what malware.”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Ms Schmidt then offered a health warning on how much credibility her observations should be accorded: “#1 Caveat: It’s impossible to know how much we can extrapolate from what we saw in Pyongyang to what the DPRK is really like.  Our trip was a mixture of highly staged encounters, tightly-orchestrated viewings and what seemed like genuine human moments.  We had zero interactions with non-state-approved North Koreans and were never far from our two minders (2, so one can mind the other).”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p id="caption-attachment-752" class="wp-caption-text"><ins>Ms Schmidt captioned thsi photo: “Excellent Caption Opportunity.”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Sophie then offered a meteorological assessment and advice for potential visitors who might want to visit the hermit Kingdom. “I can’t express how cold it was. Maybe 10-15 degrees F in the sunshine, not including wind chill.  The cold was compounded by the fact that none of the buildings we visited were heated, which meant hour-long tours in cavernous, 30-degree indoor environments. It is quite extraordinary to have the Honored Guest Experience in such conditions: they’re proudly showing you their latest technology or best library, and you can see your breath. A clue to how much is really in their control.”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The Ms. Schmidt blogged on a general impressionistic overview regarding the delegation representing the name which is synonymous with free and unfettered access to information: “Ordinary North Koreans live in a near-total information bubble, without any true frame of reference.  I can’t think of any reaction to that except absolute sympathy.  My understanding is that North Koreans are taught to believe they are lucky to be in North Korea, so why would they ever want to leave?  They’re hostages in their own country, without any real consciousness of it.  And the opacity of the country’s inner workings–down to the basics of its economy–further serves to reinforce the state’s control. The best description we could come up with: it’s like The Truman Show, at country scale. “</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>She then offered a food review .</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>“We stayed at a guesthouse a few kilometers from Pyongyang that was really like a private hotel, in that we were the only guests.  Food overall? Solidly decent.  Like Korean food, only with less pizzazz and more corn (?).”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>This was followed by rating the hotel accommodations:</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>“We were told well ahead of time to assume that everything was bugged: phones, cars, rooms, meetings, restaurants and who knows what else.  I looked for cameras in the room but came up short. But then, why bother with cameras when you have minders? After a day in frigid Pyongyang, I was just thankful it was warm. Long, empty hallways. My father’s reaction to staying in a bugged luxury socialist guesthouse was to simply leave his door open. Since we didn’t have cell phones or alarm clocks,  the question of how we’d wake up on time in the morning was legitimate.  One person suggested announcing  “I’m awake” to the room, and then waiting until someone came to fetch you.”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p id="caption-attachment-754" class="wp-caption-text"><ins>Sophie Schmidt in Pyongyang as a member of her Dad’s high powered delegation</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Ms Schmidt followed this with a traffic report and an assessment of the local culture: “People there walk very long distances (miles and miles) in sub-zero temperatures, often in the middle of the road.  (Not a problem because there are almost no cars outside the city center.) Conclusion: these people are really, really tough.”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The teenage daughter of the Google chief executive then offered the most empirical and honest observations of the highlight of the world headline grabbing delegation’s visit to Pyongyang—their visit to where North Korean’s access computers and, allegedly, surf the internet.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>She posted a picture of  North Koreans using computers which was broadcast worldwide by the Associated Press but given absolutely no explanatory commentary, leaving readers wondering whether these were actually North Koreans using the internet, a capability strictly banned in the country.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>She captioned the photograph: “The Kim Il Sung University e-Library, or as I like to call it, the e-Potemkin Village” and then posted this observation below: “Inside, we were shown through study rooms like the one above, maybe 60 people diligently at desks.  Were they bussed in for our benefit? Were any of them actually reading? All I know is that it. was. freezing.”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p id="caption-attachment-750" class="wp-caption-text"><ins>The North Korean Compuer capabilties as portrayed to the Google delegation and described by eyewitness 19 year old daughter of Google Chief</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>She continued with more crucial first hand detail, saying “Looks great, right? All this activity, all those monitors. Probably 90 desks in the room, all manned, with an identical scene one floor up. One problem: No one was actually doing anything.  A few scrolled or clicked, but the rest just stared. More disturbing: when our group walked in–a noisy bunch, with media in tow–not one of them looked up from their desks.  <span>Not a head turn, no eye contact, no reaction to stimuli</span>. They might as well have been figurines.  Of all the stops we made, the e-Potemkin Village was among the more unsettling. We knew nothing about what we were seeing, even as it was in front of us. Were they really students? Did our handlers honestly think we bought it? Did they even care?  Photo op and tour completed, maybe they dismantled the whole set and went home.  When one of our group went to peek back into the room, a man abruptly closed the door ahead of him and told him to move along.”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Then the teenage Ms. Schmidt offered what neither her father or the Associated Press were willing to regarding the technical realities of North Korea in the information age.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>“On the tech front: Everything that is accessible is accessible only in special tiers. Their mobile network, Koryolink, has between 1-2 million subscribers. No data service, but international calls were possible on the phones we rented. Realistically, even basic service is prohibitively expensive, much like every other consumption good (fuel, cars, etc.). The officials we interacted with, and a fair number of people we saw in Pyongyang, had mobiles (but not smart phones). North Korea has a national intranet, a walled garden of scrubbed content taken from the real Internet.  Our understanding is that some university students have access to this.  On tour at the Korea Computer Center (a deranged version of the Consumer Electronics Show), they demo’d their latest invention: a tablet, running on Android that had access to the real Internet.  Whether anyone, beyond very select students, high-ranking officials or occasional American delegation tourists, actually gets to use it is unknowable.  We also saw virtual-reality software, video chat platform, musical composition software (?) and other random stuff.”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>“What’s so odd about the whole thing is that no one in North Korea can even hope to afford the things they showed us. And it’s not like they’re going to export this technology.  They’re building products for a market that doesn’t exist.”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>“Those in the know are savvier than you’d expect. Exhibit A: Eric fielded questions like, “When is the next version of Android coming out?”and “Can you help us with e-Settlement so that we can put North Korean apps on Android Market?”  Answers: soon, and No, silly North Koreans, you’re under international bank sanctions.”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Ms Schmidt concisely analyzed the trip with remarkable precision and savvy.  “They seemed to acknowledge that connectivity is coming, and that they can’t hope to keep it out.  Indeed, some seemed to understand that it’s only with connectivity that their country has a snowball’s chance in hell of keeping up with the 21st century. But we’ll have to wait and see what direction they choose to take.”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>She then could not help herself by suppressing her innate teenage snarkiness by concluding her blog with the comment    “We can leave, really? Oh, thank Kim Jong Un!”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>“No, really, thank him, because it was only with his expert instruction and inspirational vision that I was able to make this slideshow.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The end.”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p id="caption-attachment-758" class="wp-caption-text"><ins>“We can leave now?Oh, thank Kim Jong Un.!”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>“I mean, really: how lucky are they that their new Leader turns out to be a nuclear technology expert, genius computer scientist and shrewd geopolitical strategist? That guy is good at everything.”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Ms Schmidt did a stellar job in representing her country and the new information age, not to mention teenagers everywhere.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>And she put to shame the head of the world’s most powerful technology entity, represented by her dad, the U.S. government politicians, represented by Bill Richardson, and the Free Press, represented by the Associated Press, all of whom didn’t have the sense, integrity, and honesty to just cut to the chase and get to the nut of the matter.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>If their was a combination Pulitzer prize for citizen journalists, Sophie Schmidt has my nomination.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p id="caption-attachment-756" class="wp-caption-text"><ins>Sophie Schmidt–Teenage daughter/Citizen Journalist</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>I suspect that Google head Eric Schmidt is, like fathers of teenage daughters everywhere, both very proud and very exasperated with young Sophie Schmidt tonight.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>But I, for one, want to personally thank her for being the first person to substantively inform me what the Google delegations trip to North Korea was really like. Plus, she is very cute.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Now really, was that so hard?</ins></p><ins> </ins><h3 class="sd-title"><ins>Share this:</ins></h3><ul><li class="share-twitter"><ins><a

its Former Good Name to Serve as a Propaganda Arm of the World’s Most Repressive Govt in Exchange for Access Which has Produced Exactly  No News and Undermined the Principles of a Free Press 
</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The Associated Press Korea coverage is nothing short of a stain on, and an embarrassment to, the principles of a free press, and it is past time they  cut it out, close their bureau in Pyongyang and apologize.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>And I say this as a former AP reporter (who spent a month in North Korea as their correspondent) and was the AP bureau chief in Cambodia–a country whose modern series of governments are as equally as egregious as Pyongyang, albeit minor league amateurs in comparison to the Kim family regime, simply not as accomplished or sophisticated in their thuggery.The Kim family dynastic criminal syndicate which operates currently under the protection and privileges of a recognized nation state, will make Pol Pot and his Khmer Rouge look like Mother Theresa when the unspeakable truth comes out what has happened inside North Korea over the last fifty years when they inevitably will implode and collapse.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>It is the unspeakable which the AP refuses to speak about–the central moral and professional mandate of its existence–in its coverage of North Korea which is, in itself, unspeakably offensive.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The AP just released an “exclusive” that the head of Google is planning a trip soon to Pyongyang, the only country in the world that has a blanket ban on use of the internet, headlined “APNewsBreak: Google exec chairman to visit NKorea”, datelined Seoul with the byline of correspondent Jean H. Lee.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>What is the outrage are the several things missing from the story that violate the most basic ethical standards and AP’s own formal–and now formerly– inviolable ethics, standards and rules, a concept they have repeatedly abandoned when it comes to Korea coverage since opening a “bureau” in Pyongyang last year.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Among the most glaring absences is that there is no mention of, or reference to, any input from AP’s own Pyongyang Bureau in the story, the existence of which is a rank embarrassment and scandal in itself.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>AP cut a sweetheart deal with Pyongyang to open the bureau a year ago, the contents of the written contractual arrangement they have kept as tightly secret as if they were a third world dictatorship themselves.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>In the year since they opened the bureau, in a pomp and ceremony propaganda excersize orchestrated by the same North Korean government architects that are charged with maintaining  the Kim family dictatorship personality cult, not a single substantive news story has been produced from the AP Pyongyang bureau.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>In fact, on numerous occasions, the AP bureaus and their competitors based in other countries have consistently first broken virtually every significant top world North Korean story and informed the world, the AP in Pyongyang remaining entirely in the dark about every important news event happening under their very nose.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>These include both the April and December launches of the long range missile tests designed to carry nuclear weapons that can reach the continental U.S., which were first reported by foreign media in Tokyo, Beijing, and Seoul, to the purge of the top army commander in July, to a series of stories regarding top personal changes and policy statements.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>This is because the AP bureau in Pyongyang is a wholly owned and staffed subsidiary of the the intelligence and propaganda arms of the North Korean regime. The foreign reporters can go nowhere, meet no one, or see nothing without the permission of the Pyongyang government.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>In fact, the AP staffers, both the “reporters” and “photographers” are entirely handpicked by the North Korean government and widely known to be nothing short of trained operatives of the regime intelligence services.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The entire function of the bureau is to give credibility to Pyongyang’s rank manipulation of events of import and twist, suppress, or blatantly create a false narrative of the life of North Korean citizens and the conduct, actions, and intent of its brutal elite who are in power.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Regarding this story of the head of Google–a Company whose name is so firmly ubiquitous it is now both a noun and a verb absorbed irrevocably in popular international linguistic usage it is synonymous with the power, good, and importance of freedom of, and free access to, information–visiting Pyongyang, the irony is so rich it would be cut from the script of a third rate daytime TV soap opera.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Specifically, the story made only a comically brief, frightened reference in passing to the most obviously important news of the story that was so transparent one could almost visualize the AP bosses fleeing from the terror of upsetting their Pyongyang choreographers by reporting a truth: That North Korea is the only country on earth that outright bans the entire internet technology that has transformed life in literally every other piece of real estate on the planet. And failed entirely to mention the  fact that North Korean citizens are routinely imprisoned if caught using any communication devices to access information from, or communicate with people in, countries outside the borders of the worlds saddest, most repressive, most despicable gulag posing as a government and given the benefits rights and benefits of a a seat at the table of the rest of the properly organized nation states.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>These are facts so ubiquitously known, that is outside the borders of North Korea, and so obvious that a good chunk of the American population that couldn’t name who their own current vice president is are aware of this news. But not if they were forced to rely on the AP for their news and information.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>And in a further inexcusable breach of ethics, the AP censored the title of the job of the author of this story, editing out the fact that Ms. Jean Lee is also the “Bureau Chief” of the Pyongyang AP bureau simultaneously with her same function in Seoul–two countries formally at war with each other.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>If this story involved any other country, or the AP wasn’t running fully scared of upsetting the Pyongyang authorities, they would have had input from the Pyongyang bureau, obtained some comment from a regime official or, more probably, confirmation of the very country the entire story was the subject of. But not one word. Not even the obligatory “No Pyongyang official could be reached fro comment. 
In fact the sources for the entire story were all anonymous, in itself a violation of AP’s own rules requiring two named sources for publishing a story.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>But the biggest outrage, among the aforementioned and several more, is buried deep in the story, in a reference  that the Google chief will be merely a member of a delegation with Kun “Tony” Namkung who they say will “also (be) leading the trip” and identified him as “an Asian affairs expert who has made numerous visits to North Korea over the past 25 years. Namkung also has been a consultant to the AP.”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>AP made no reference to how Mr Namkung is “an Asian affairs expert” or what he had been in the employ of the AP “consulting” about.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>In truth, Mr Namkung is a broker who makes his living taking large amounts of money from people such as the AP and Google in exchange for getting them access to meet with North Korean elite government officials and taking  a cut from business deals being negotiated. In fact, Mr. NamKung was central to the deal negotiated with the Pyongyang propaganda apparatus to open the AP bureau itself, which is so cowed, ineffectual, and counterproductive it is unwilling to shed the most mundane of light on even this what normally would be a wholly innocuous and non controversial news piece.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>AP should be ashamed of themselves and quit shilling for the most offensive, oppressive dictatorship in the world and knowingly misleading their readers as part of a deal to pimp for the thugs in power in Pyongyang. Not to mention soiling the reputation of the free press, and by extension, me.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Here is a link to the just released AP story: <a

</ins><p><ins>By Nate Thayer</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Here is a short example of the day in the life of a freelance journalist in 2012.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>At 3:53 PM I sent a message to the Assignment editor of Newsweek/ The Daily Beast offering what I thought to be a good story that North Korea had fallen for an internet hoax that Kim Jong-un has been named Time Magazine’s Man of the year today.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>“Hi Louise:</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>You commissioned a story by me back in August on North Korean leader Kim Jong-un’s new wife and I am inquiring whether you are interested in another North Korea story. Today, the official North Korean media announced that Kim Jong-un had been chosen Time Magazine person of the year, apparently having fallen for what had been an internet prankster website effort last month to get people to vote for him on Time’s public voting campaign. The Korean Central News Agency has a top story out today that leads with “The U.S. magazine The Time selected the dear respected Kim Jong Un as “man of 2012”.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Time did not name Kim as man of the year and in fact had said days ago that the public voting by internet was not going to be a deciding factor. That choice is made by the editors of TIME and will be revealed tomorrow, Dec. 19, on the Today show, on TIME.com and via TIME’s Twitter handle. “Some of the highest vote tallies got a boost from members of Internet forums like 4Chan who launched a campaign to manipulate the results, pushing North Korea’s supreme leader to the top of the list,” wrote TIME in early December.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>In November, the internet site 4chan started a campaign to get people to vote for Kim online as Time Person of the Year, and created a program that allowed for repetitive, automatic votes, skyrocketing Kim Jong-un to leading the polls at 5.6 million votes, ahead of the new Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>In 2009, the site launched an online effort to vote its co-founder, Chris Poole, as the World’s Most Influential Person, and out polled Bernie Madoff, Oprah Winfrey and the president.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The North Korean media report comes days after they launched a long range ballistic missile that is designed to reach the U.S. that caused global consternation. Tommorow is the first anniversary of Kim Jong-un’s reign as leader of North Korea.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>This comes only weeks after the official the Chinese party media organ People’s Daily fell for the Onion’s satirical story naming Kim Jong-un the “sexiest man alive.”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>I have all the details and can get the story in promptly if you are interested. Please give me a shout back one way or another.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Best regards,</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Nate Thayer”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>At 4:09PM, I got a reply back: “Yes, but can you do a quick, tongue-in-cheek piece for us, filing today? no more than 600 words, please.”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>At 4:15, I messaged back: “Louise: Will do. Give me the latest deadline time and I will have it to you before.”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>At 4:16, she responded: “Some time before 10 pm tonight. And make it funny!”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>At 4:19 Pm , I replied: “ Louise: No worries. I will have it in well before that. And I will be at my wittiest. On another matter, I never was paid for the last piece, Can you make sure to forward me the details of who to be in touch with regarding payment for both pieces? 
 best, 
 Nate”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>At 4:20PM she replied: “Jane Frye will be in touch regarding payment. And thanks. “</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>At 5:49,PM, I sent the story along with a graphic showing the winners of the TIME poll spelled out “KJU Gas Chamber” and accompanied by this message. “Louise: Here is a story on Kim Jong Un named Time “Man of the Year”. Attached is an important graphic which shows the hacked Time poll was manipulated to make the top 14 winners red “KJU Gas Chamber.” I am at phone number <a href="tel:443%20205%209162" target="_blank">443 205 9162 Link: tel:443%20205%209162 </a> where I will be walking my dog, but back before 7:00 pm on the computer. Please let me know you received this ok.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Best,</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Nate”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>I went out to walk my pal, Lamont, in the park to romp with his friends and returned early at 6:40 PM to find this message from Louise at Newsweek/Daily Beast which had been sent at 5:55 PM:</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>“Hi Nate,</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Thanks for the quick file. As a news story, it’s good but, and I don’t know how to say this, except, it’s not very funny…</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Given how little bandwidth we have in terms of editing, I think it’s not going to work after all. I’ll make sure you get a kill fee, of course, and hope that you will still write other pieces for us.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Thanks.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>And best,</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Louise”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>So apparently Newsweek/Daily Beast doesn’t consider that a “good news story” deserves to be published given its “limited bandwidth” because “it’s not very funny.”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>So much for what remains of the news part of what remains of “Newsweek.”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Plus I disagree that it was insufficiently humorous.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Not to mention, just watch over the next 24 hours as this story takes off over the internet, given it has all the ingredients of what makes news news these days. </ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>So, once again, I am posting much of a days work on Facebook for free. Here is the story as written without any edits:</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>“North Korea has fallen for an internet prankster’s joke announcing today that dictator Kim Jong-un has been chosen Time Magazine person of the year after computer hackers manipulated the online poll to catapult the young dictator to the lead while making sure the first initials of the following vote winners spelled out “KJU Gas Chambers.”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The Korean Central News Agency trumpeted a lead story today headlined “U.S. Magazine Selects Kim Jong Un as Man of 2012” saying “The U.S. magazine The Time selected the dear respected Kim Jong Un as ‘man of 2012’” after polling ” politicians, businessmen, artistes, sports persons and announcers.”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>In fact, the website 4chan , a community of self styled underground hackers  skilled in computer coding  manipulated the entire online TIME poll pushing Kim to the top with 5.6 million votes—twice as much as the second runner up, “The Daily Show’s” Jon Stewart with ”Undocumented Immigrants” in third place.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>If one scrolls down the list of the top 14 vote getters, the first letter of each name spells out “KJU Gas Chambers”.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p id="caption-attachment-641" class="wp-caption-text"><ins>Time Magazine Person of the Year Top Vote Getters Spell “KJU Gas Chamber”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Time magazine denied on December 13 that Kim has been named their 2012 “Person of the Year” and said that “some of the highest vote tallies got a boost from members of Internet forums like 4Chan, which launched a campaign to manipulate the results, pushing North Korea’s leader to the top of the list.” Time magazine acknowledged its online poll had been hacked and made clear its editors would select the winner and make an announcement on December 19. The choice for TIME person of the year will be made by TIME editors and announced tomorrow on the Today show, on TIME.com and via TIME’s Twitter handle.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>But apparently the North Korean government didn’t read the TIME announcement and, days after it launched a ballistic missile test believed to be an attempt to perfect its ability to reach the continental U.S. with nuclear warheads, announced that the accolade had been bestowed on the baby faced twenty something leader on the anniversary of his first year in power.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>A December 18 story from the official government news agency, KCNA, said “The magazine has selected and published “man of the year” every year from 1927. This year…more than 5.6 million people, the greatest number, voted for Kim Jong Un.” The story added that “The U.S. magazine Forbes, dealing with the most influential persons in the world on Dec. 8, carried photos of his revolutionary activities and introduced his brief biography.”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>In November, 4chan started a campaign to get people to vote for Kim online as Time Person of the Year, and created a program that allowed for repetitive, automatic votes, skyrocketing Kim Jong-un to leading the polls at 5.6 million votes, ahead of the new Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>And this isn’t the first time that TIME has fallen victim to 4Chan hackers. In 2009, the site launched an online effort to vote its co-founder, Chris Poole, as the World’s Most Influential Person, and out polled Bernie Madoff, Oprah Winfrey and the president.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>This comes only weeks after the official the Chinese party media organ People’s Daily fell for the U.S. satirical publication, The Onion, which named Kim Jong-un the “sexiest man alive.” The Onion published a spoof poll in November, naming the “devastatingly handsome” North Korean leader the world’s sexiest man of 2012.”</ins></p><ins> </ins><h3 class="sd-title"><ins>Share

Capable of Reaching Continental United States in Coming Days</p> <p>If there are any illusions that North Korea, arguably the single biggest threat to global stability, continues to march unimpeded forward toward a fully operational  nuclear weapons state to further strengthen what is already the fourth largest standing army in the world with policies that could spark an outbreak of open military conflict with the potential of wreaking regional and global economic, political and military havoc, it can only be because the implications of this reality are too unpleasant o even contemplate.</p> <p>Ominous developments in recent weeks have oddly seemed to have garnered little international attention. This can be for only a very few reasons: That no one is paying attention; that no believes them despite their uninterrupted track record of doing what they say they will do; their monitored preparatory actions as a run up to demonstrating that this time is somehow different than the numerous times that have proven otherwise in recent decades; that the world is distracted by international crisis’s elsewhere such as the multi faceted intractable middle east where the connected but independent events in Syria, Iran, and Gaza threaten to ignite and spread; or that world policy makers are wholly incapable, unwilling, or totally flummoxed in formulating a new strategy to replace the series of previous failed  efforts of formulating an effective North Korean policy strategy to prevent such an eventuality.</p> <p>North Korea has been crystal clear in its public declarations and concomitant military preparations and internal political reorganizations that their top priority is their race to create an operational arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs.</p> <p>As the now one year old government has consolidated its hold on power, they continue to threaten to use their nuclear and ballistic missile program against those who object to their domestic or foreign policy objectives. Any illusions that the “new” government under the titular leadership of Kim Jong-un, the 20 something year old heir to the family dynastic dictatorship, would be a kinder gentler Orwellian purgatory, can now be fully dispatched to the waste bin of wishful thinking.</p> <p>While there has been some purges and reorganization within the North Korean regime and military since April, the nuclear and ballistic missile program has been consolidated. </p> <p>The timing of this launch is not coincidentally coming as the one year anniversary of the death of former leader Kim Jong-il</p> <p>Official North Korean media on December 1 announced that it would launch a “satellite” test launch between today, December 10 and December 22.giving the dates of the launch taking place sometime between December 10 and December 22. On December 8, they said the  dates might be postponed because of an unspecified “technical difficulty.” On December 10, they reaffirmed their intention to proceed with the launch the potential time window extended by one week to sometime between December 10 and Dec. 29 with KCNA reporting technicians had “found technical deficiency in the first-stage control engine module of the rocket,” citing a spokesman for the Korean Committee of Space Technology.</p> <p>As a result, they have decided to extend the launch period until December 29,</p> <p>Satellite photos confirmed steadily throughout November until today that the first two stages of constructing the missile on the launch pad had been completed by last Thursday. Satellite images showed that a new third-stage booster was delivered to the launch pad on Saturday. The final stage of the fueling was confirmed by imagery to have begun on Sunday December 9.</p> <p>Official state media clarified with more specifics the earlier unspecified reason for an extension of the potential dates of the launch on December 10.</p> <p>The missile launch is designed to test the capability of its secret intensive efforts to fit nuclear bombs on a delivery system—which is the long range missile being tested– that can effectively target much of the planet including the continental United States, as well as those countries who publicly criticize their repressive domestic policies or object to their foreign policy demands which they use threats of military attacks against those who object, primarily Japan, South Korea, and the United States.</p> <p>The fact that all of the primary nations involved in efforts to avoid a worst case scenario descent into open conflict, Washington, Seoul, Tokyo and Beijing, are distracted by leadership transitions within their own countries, offers Pyongyang the chance to move quickly while their most important adversaries are otherwise occupied.</p> <p>This is the second missile launch this year by North Korea</p> <p>Official media has vowed to launch a long range ballistic rocket named after its late leader into orbit by year’s end. A rocket carrying a Kwangmyongsong satellite exploded in April shortly after takeoff. The mishap embarrassed Mr. Kim before the foreign journalists his government had invited to witness the launching. It also scuttled hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. humanitarian aid shipments.</p> <p>This is an article I wrote days before their April missile launch. Another article outlining how internal North Korean developments since then have only reinforced and confirmed Pyongyang’s commitment to a fully operational nuclear weapons program that can reach the United States.</p> <p>All of Kim Jong-un’s Men</p> <p>By Nate Thayer</p> <p>Asia Times</p> <p>April 4, 2012</p> <p>WASHINGTON – The top managers of North Korea’s clandestine nuclear and ballistic missile program have been methodically promoted and now dominate the inner circle of Kim Jong-eun’s new government, confidential foreign government documents and official media reports from Pyongyang show.</p> <p>The shadowy group of power brokers in the world’s most secretive nation emerged in the first military promotions prominently unveiled during recent high-profile ceremonies as the official mourning period for the death of former dictator Kim Jong-il concluded last week.</p> <p>These same senior officials are known to be behind Pyongyang’s missile test launch – scheduled for the middle of April – which has rattled regional nerves and sabotaged a short-lived agreement with Washington designed to slow North Korea’s steady march towards a nuclear weaponized state. The United Nations and United States have charged the “earth observation satellite” launch is a thinly disguised cover for testing capabilities for a nuclear armed long-range ballistic missile.</p> <p>At least 10 senior North Korean officials, now prominent at the core of power behind 29-year-old hereditary successor Kim Jong-eun, have been named by several foreign intelligence services as in charge of Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile development and export program, including enrichment of uranium to weapons grade strength.</p> <p>They have also been implicated in selling nuclear and missile technology to Iran and Syria, dispatching special operation teams to attack South Korea and assassinate political opponents, coordinating an international criminal network involved in drug trafficking, counterfeit money laundering, and establishing front companies and banks to raise more than a billion US dollars per year to bankroll the privileged lifestyles of the regime’s elite.</p> <p>The 10 are among North Korean officials and government agencies named by at least 31 governments as part of a network that has imported, sold and developed components and technology for weapons of mass destruction (WMD). They have had their assets frozen, been banned from travel outside of North Korea and forbidden from engaging in business with the countries’ nationals or companies, according to official documents.</p> <p>In the first leadership reshuffle following Kim Jong-il’s death and in one of his first public acts as the Korean People’s Army Supreme Commander, Kim Jong-eun promoted four key officials to the rank of general at ceremonies marking his deceased father’s 70th birthday on February 15.</p> <p>Pak To-chun, Ju Kyu-chang and Paek Se-bong, previously seen only in civilian dress, were never known to have military rank before being made senior generals. Pyongyang’s top spy, Kim Yong-chol, was also recently promoted to four-star general rank. In January, another key powerbroker, Kim Jong-eun’s uncle Jang Song-thaek, who appeared for the first time in military uniform at the December funeral ceremonies for Kim Jong-il, was appointed to the rank of four-star general.</p> <p>All five men are named by the United Nations, the US, the European Union (EU) and other government documents as key managers of Pyongyang’s illicit ballistic and nuclear development and export programs.</p> <p>Nuclear aides 
Ju Kyu-chang has been at the center of Pyongyang’s clandestine nuclear and missile development policies for more than two decades. He “oversees the development of North Korea’s ballistic missile and nuclear programs”, according to a December 19, 2011 EU document listing North Korean officials designated on its sanction list.</p> <p>Ju Kyu-chang is also director of the Korean Workers’ Party (KWP) Machine-Building Industry Department, former head of the KWP Second Economic Committee and past head of the National Academy of Natural Sciences. All three government agencies are named by US, UN, EU and other governments as deeply involved in covert nuclear and ballistic missile production, research and export.</p> <p>According to a May 2010 confidential report to the United Nations Security Council, “Ju served as the overall supervisor for North Korea’s missile development, including oversight of the April 5, 2009 Taepo Dong-2 (TD-2) missile launch and the failed July 2006 TD-2 launch.”</p> <p>Those two missile launches were the predecessors to the upcoming launch this month of an “earth observation satellite”. Both ballistic missile launches immediately preceded Pyongyang’s two underground nuclear explosions.</p> <p>Daniel Pinkston, an analyst with the International Crisis Group (ICG), said Ju Kyu-chang has “technical expertise regarding the SLV [space launch vehicle] and satellite programs and the nuclear weapons program”. In its June 2009 report “North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs”, ICG said Ju Kyu-chang “is believed to be in charge of an independent entity with custody of North Korea’s nuclear bombs” and “was in charge of the August 1998 attempted satellite launch and the 2009 launch”.</p> <p>“I would equate Ju with General Leslie Groves, who headed the US Manhattan Project that produced atomic bombs during World War II,” said Larry Niksch, a senior associate with the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies and former Asian affairs specialist for 43 years with the non-partisan Congressional Research Service. “Ju runs the day-to-day programs to develop missiles and probably nuclear weapons,” he said in an e-mail this week.</p> <p>Niksch wrote that Pyongyang reacted to international sanctions by “fashioning an alternative based on illicit programs: counterfeiting of US currency and products, narcotics smuggling, and selling missiles and other weapons to other ‘rogue’ nations like Syria, Pakistan, and Iran, and terrorist groups like Hezbollah … I estimate that North Korean earnings from various forms of collaboration with Iran earns Pyongyang upwards of $2 billion annually. Kim Jong-il distributed much of these earnings to his military and communist elite to keep them satisfied and loyal.”</p> <p>Paek Se-bong is chairman of the government’s Second Economic Committee (SEC). A classified May 2010 UN “Report to the Security Council from the Panel of Experts” said, “It is broadly believed that the Second Economic Committee of the National Defense Commission plays the largest and most prominent role in nuclear, other WMD and missile-related development programs as well as in arranging and conducting arms-related exports.”</p> <p>According to 2010 US government documents “The US has reason to believe … [the Second Economic Committee] has been used for North Korea-Iran proliferation-related transactions.” A 2009 UN report to the Security Council said the SEC “is a national-level organization responsible for research and development of North Korea’s advanced weapons systems, including missiles and probably nuclear weapons”. The same UN report said, “Paek is the chief operating officer of the DPRK’s [Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s] military industry, the country’s largest employer and economic consumer.”</p> <p>Paek Se-bong personifies the mysterious grouping of figures in charge of North Korea’s illicit weapons program. Very little biographical data exists on Paek Se-bong, who emerged from obscurity in 2003 when he was appointed to head the SEC and made a member of the National Defense Commission (NDC), the supreme ruling body of the DPRK.</p> <p>After 2003, Paek Se-bong did not appear for eight years in official North Korean media until April 9, 2009 – four days after the highly publicized launch of the last North Korean “satellite”. He was at that time reappointed publicly to his position as head of the SEC and a member of the NDC.</p> <p>That long-range rocket test scuttled ongoing talks over its nuclear program and was followed weeks later by an underground explosion testing a nuclear bomb, which resulted in harsh UN sanctions. It was shortly thereafter that Paek Se-bong’s name was placed on international sanction lists.</p> <p>His name translates to the “Three peaks of Mt Paektu”, a term used in official propaganda to refer to Kim Jong-il and his parents. (It is purported to be the mythical birthplace of Kim Jong-il, but he is known to have been born in a village in Siberia where his parents were in exile during World War II.)</p> <p>Illicit exports 
Pak To-chun was placed under international sanction on December 19, 2011, the same day Kim Jong-il’s death was announced. According to the EU, “He is in charge of the arms industry. It is reported that he commands the office for nuclear energy. This institution is decisive for [North Korea’s] nuclear and rocket launcher program.”</p> <p><del><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-627" alt="rocket" src="https://natethayer.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/rocket.gif?w=490"></del></p> <p>An image of a national report meeting held on February 15, 2012, highlighted are Pak To-chun (2nd row, left), Ju Kyu-chang (2nd row, 2nd left) and Kim Yong-chol (3rd row, right), all of whom were given military promotions on the occasion of Kim Jong-il’s recent birthday celebration. (Photo: KBS screen grab)</p> <p>Pak To-chun, also a member of the powerful NDC, is director of the Military Arms Production Department. According to the May 2010 UN report to the Security Council: “The Military Arms Production Department of the Korea Workers’ Party oversees the matters related to the Yongbyon nuclear plant and its nuclear weapons programs.”</p> <p>He succeeded Jon Pyong-ho as head of North Korea’s military industries in 2010. Jon Pyong-ho was the primary manager since the 1980s of North Korea’s clandestine international network tasked with covertly acquiring components and technology to build a nuclear bomb. He was in charge of trading ballistic missile and nuclear technology with Pakistan’s Abdul Qadeer Khan network to build Pyongyang’s nuclear and other weapons arsenal.</p> <p>In 2008, a secret delegation of Myanmar military generals traveled to North Korea on a weapons and technology purchasing trip. A leaked detailed report, complete with pictures, showed Jon Pyong-ho hosting Myanmar military officials, including on a tour of a missile factory.</p> <p>Jon Pyong-ho continues to serve on the powerful NDC and is named on international sanction lists for running a worldwide network trafficking in nuclear material with Iran, Libya, Pakistan and Syria.</p> <p>“[He] is in charge of nuclear weapons development,” according to a 2009 UN report issued after Pyongyang detonated a second underground nuclear explosion. According to a December 21, 2011 EU report ordering new sanctions, the Machine Building</p> <p>Industries Department he headed is “responsible for overseeing activities of North Korea’s military industries” including “the development of North Korea’s ballistic missile and nuclear programs”.</p> <p>In April 2009, Jon Pyong-ho was one of only two officials named as accompanying Kim Jong-il to witness the purported peaceful “space launch” that scuttled earlier bilateral agreements to halt ballistic and nuclear testing, according to photographs and statements from the official Korean Central News Agency archives. The other was Ju Kyu Chang, who was promoted to four-star general during this year’s February ceremonies for the deceased Kim Jong-il. Jon Pyong-ho was given special prominence at the recent mourning period closing ceremonies on 25 March.</p> <p>Kim Yong-chol, a former bodyguard turned head of North Korea’s spy agency, also received his fourth star during the recent Kim Jong-il birthday celebrations. Kim heads the Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB). Both he and the RGB are named in UN, US, EU and other international sanctions for their involvement in banned sales of sophisticated weapons systems, including to Iran and Syria, and have been implicated in launching recent military attacks on South Korea.</p> <p>Kim Yong-chol and the RGB “specializes in the production of maritime military craft and armaments, such as submarines, military boats and missile systems, and has exported torpedoes and technical assistance to Iranian defense-related firms”, according to December 2011 United Kingdom and EU sanctions documents.</p> <p>The same documents name the RGB as “responsible for approximately half of the arms and related material exported by North Korea” and name RGB front companies that in 2007 and 2008 “facilitated transactions involving … designated Iranian financial institutions, including Bank Melli and Bank Sepah … for the benefit of North Korea’s Reconnaissance General Bureau’s (RGB) weapons program.”</p> <p>Kim Yong-chol was first implicated by intelligence agencies in 2010. In August 2010, US President Barack Obama cited the “unprovoked attack that resulted in the sinking of the Republic of Korea Navy ship Cheonan and the deaths of 46 sailors in March 2010″ when issuing Executive Order 13551 that placed US sanctions on a single North Korean official, General Kim Yong-chol, the RGB he commanded, and the Green Pine Associated Corporation, a North Korean front company the US and others have identified as acting on the RGB’s behalf to sell prohibited arms, including to Iran and Syria.</p> <p>The day before Kim Yong-chol was promoted to full general, Pyongyang announced the creation of a new medal, the “Order of Kim Jong-il,” awarded for services in building a “thriving socialist nation” and for the military defense of the country. The first recipients of the award included Kim Yong-chol.</p> <p>Kim Yong-chol’s direct superior, General O Kuk-ryol, vice chairman of the National Defense Commission, is another prominent figure in the new regime’s inner circle. The UN described O Kuk-ryol as “supervising the acquisition abroad of advanced technology for nuclear and ballistics programs” in a list of sanctioned North Korean officials he was placed on in 2009. The EU added him to its list in December of last year.</p> <p>At this year’s March 25 ceremonies closing Kim Jong-il’s 100-day mourning period, Minister of People’s Armed Forces and Vice-Marshal Kim Yong-chun delivered the keynote speech which said that Kim Jong-eun “has turned North Korea into an invincible country which nobody dares to attack”.</p> <p>United Nations and US documents from 2011 placed Kim Yong-chun, identified as “special adviser to Kim Jong-il on nuclear strategy” on a sanction list that froze his assets and imposed a travel ban. He currently serves as Pyongyang’s de facto defense minister and was one of only eight leaders to walk with Kim Jong-eun alongside the hearse during Kim Jong-il’s recent funeral procession.</p> <p>Analysts say that the decision to name Kim Jong-eun as successor to his father was made by early 2009 and subsequent reshuffles made within the party and military have paved the way for a smooth transition. In February 2009, O Kuk-ryol was appointed vice chairman of the NDC and Kim Yong-chun was appointed minister of the People’s Armed Forces.</p> <p>Top commanders 
In April 2009, Kim Yong-chun, O Kuk-ryol, Jon Pyong-ho, Paek Se-bong, Jang Song-thaek and Ju Kyu-chang were all elected to North Korea’s highest body, the National Defense Commission. All six are also named as key figures in Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile program by the UN, US and other governments, and have all been prominent in public appearances with Kim Jong-eun in recent weeks.</p> <p><del><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-628" alt="rocket2" src="https://natethayer.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/rocket2.gif?w=490"></del></p> <p>Second Economy Commission chairman Paek Se-bong (circled) applauds at the start of a national report meeting for Kim Jong-il’s birthday on February 15, 2012. He was given the rank of colonel general (sangjang) in a military promotions list issued on the occasion of Kim Jong-il’s 70th birthday. At past national events, Paek Se-bong had been observed wearing business suits (Photo: KCNA-Yonhap)</p> <p>Prior to the current diplomatic scuffle over the upcoming supposed satellite launch, North Korea was accused of creating nearly identical crises in 2009 when it launched a long-range, multi-stage rocket it referred to as a space satellite. The move was in defiance of a UN ban, broke off then six-nation nuclear disarmament talks and set the stage for a new underground nuclear test, the country’s second.</p> <p>The following year saw North Korea launch an artillery attack on South Korea that claimed the lives of 46 South Koreans and stoked international fears that the Koreas were near war.</p> <p>In recent weeks, the same North Korean officials known to command these provocative events have been given high-profile promotions as Pyongyang unveils the new core of leaders behind Kim Jong-eun’s new regime. In addition to the 10, other senior officials have also been named as key figures in North Korea’s illicit nuclear and ballistic missile program.</p> <p>Pak Jae-gyong and Hyon Chol-hae, both of the Korean People’s Army’s political department, are named as “military adviser to Kim Jong-il” in UN and other sanctions lists. Head of the Academy of Science, Pyon Yong-rip, is also named as “involved in WMD-related biological research”. All three played prominent roles in the ceremonies that followed the death of Kim Jong-il in the carefully orchestrated succession process to crown Kim Jong-eun as North Korea’s new dictator.</p> <p>Several other powerful figures who are not named in international sanctions also play key roles in the new inner power circle. Korean People’s Army chief of staff Ri Yong-ho and two NDC members, Generals U Dong-guk and Kim Jong-gak, are also known to be in Kim Jong-eun’s inner circle.</p> <p><del><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-629" alt="rocket3" src="https://natethayer.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/rocket3.gif?w=490"></del></p> <p>Vice Marshal Kim Jong-gak (2nd right) seen at a March 25, 2012, rally ending the 100 days of mourning Kim Jong-il’s death.

Ministry of State Security’s General U Tong-chuk (3rd right). </p> <p>U Dong-guk heads the State Security Department responsible for domestic intelligence while Kim Jong-gak is in charge of ensuring loyalty to the new leader within the armed forces and party. Kim Ki-nam, meanwhile, leads the formidable propaganda operation in charge of molding Kim Jong-eun’s image. Another prominent figure is Choe Tae-bok who is involved in Pyongyang’s scientific and technological development which concentrates mainly on efforts to build a sophisticated military state.</p> <p>The coming weeks will see the further unveiling of top advisers who hold the real power in the new regime, say analysts. The 100th anniversary of the birth of the founder of the North Korean state, Kim Il-sung, will take place on April 15. State media have touted the date for several years as a major national turning point, marking the regime’s promise to create “a mighty and prosperous nation”.</p> <p>The official Korean Central News Agency said on Monday that a rare Workers’ Party conference will be held on April 11, shortly before Kim Il-sung’s birthday celebration. At that event, his grandson, Kim Jong-eun, is expected to be named the secretary general of the KWP, the title previously held by his father Kim Jong-il. Kim Il-sung still retains the title of president in death.</p> <p>North Korea’s parliament, the Supreme People’s Assembly, is set to hold its annual session on April 13. It is expected Kim Jong-eun will also be promoted to chairman of the NDC, another post held by his now deceased father. Coincident with these transitional events, Pyongyang informed international maritime and space organizations that it will launch its ballistic missile into orbit between April 12 and 16.</p> <p>Nate <ins>Thayer,</ins> <del>Thayer,</del> former Southeast Asia correspondent for the Far Eastern Economic Review, is an investigative reporter specializing in conflict, transnational crime, and Asian affairs.

Were robots and software digesting jobs? Or did offshore production and distributed supply chains have a greater effect? Economists and pundits throughout the world weighed in.\r\n\r\nThen along came a virus. We know now that neither globalization nor automation compares to the sudden appearance of a global health crisis, and the dramatic shift in where, when and how we work.\r\n\r\nYet that great shift masked two even more powerful forces: the pace of change and the spread of change. It\u2019s the speed and the distance of change that are causing the greatest ripple effects on human work.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThey have also contributed to an exponential increase in the potential complexity of enterprise security. As a result, these are the two forces that are fueling some of the greatest challenges\u2014opportunities\u2014for cybersecurity.\r\nThe Pace and Spread of Change\r\nAs the pandemic gripped the world, we entered into what I called The Great Reset, a tectonic shift in how, when and where we worked. That reset has ended up being one of the most profound lessons on the pace and spread of change for virtually every industry, business, leader and worker.\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn the rapid shift to distributed work, many leaders are gaining the growing realization that they have broken the seal on the traditional organization. The result: Their workforces are becoming fluid right before their eyes.\r\n\r\nMany workers who rarely or never used video calls suddenly found themselves completely dependent on a daily stream of back-to-back-to back webcam meetings. Yet this process masked what was already happening to workers and teams, fueling a new workforce framework for the enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn many industries and organizations, work and jobs were already becoming atomized by technology. Work tasks were being split up among workers in dynamic ways, as teams continually faced new problems. Work responsibilities and roles were being adjusted accordingly.\u00a0\r\n\r\nSome organizations responded by committing to programs that could help workers become adaptive learners. But many companies continued to follow less-agile processes that kept workers from being able to effectively adapt.\r\n\r\nThat less-flexible mindset of the past can be thought of as somewhat binary. Workers are either employees, or they\u2019re not. While there might be a range of work roles within the organization, a binary approach reduced the number of use cases for work, making it comparatively easier to hire, develop and promote workers.\r\n\r\nBut the Great Reset has forced organizations to embrace a far more fluid mindset about workers and work roles. While market leaders in the past could simply reinforce existing processes and work roles, even traditional incumbents are now realizing they must embrace more agile processes. This will inevitably mean a far more fluid mindset about the range of roles that workers will perform.\r\n\r\nThink of it as a \u201csoft-walled organization,\u201d with people in a range of contexts easily and rapidly traversing the former edges of the company. But how can business and IT leaders get their minds around this kind of shift? Rather than a binary mindset, a more useful perspective may be fuzzy thinking.\r\n\r\nIn mathematics, a binary set is straightforward. Membership in the set is either 0 or 1. But an element in a fuzzy set is defined by its degree of membership in the set.\r\n\r\nLook at the range of roles in an organization. At any point, your organization may have traditional full-time employees. But it may also leverage the energies of part-time workers, temporary workers, contractors, sub-contractors, consultants, work consortia, industry consortia, online gig workers, apprentices, students, cloud workers, crowdsourced workers, partners and even former employees. And all of these might be performing their work in an unlimited number of physical locations, and collaborating with each other in an N-dimensional number of relationships.\r\n\r\nFull-time employees with benefits might be thought of as having 100% membership in the work of the organization. But a gig worker who drops off a pizza to the office (assuming you have an office) would have only the slightest percentage of membership in an organization\u2019s work. Every other role would be something in between 0 and 100%.\r\n\r\nFuzzy set thinking also needs to be subjective and multi-directional. For example, let\u2019s say that I think you and I are friends and co-workers. You, however, think we are just co-workers. So when the arrow points from me to you, there\u2019s an additional \u201cfriend\u201d set. But it only works one way, since you don\u2019t feel the same.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe same can be true for work relationships. I may have tremendous loyalty and affinity to the organization. But if I\u2019m a contractor, the organization may think of me as a disposable worker. That kind of subjectivity and ambiguity is hard enough in simple interpersonal interactions; it is especially problematic in a constantly changing workforce.\u00a0\r\n\r\nSome leaders may find this breathtaking complexity such an overwhelming problem to solve, even from a pure HR management standpoint, they may believe that existing business processes are simply not up to the task.\u00a0\r\n\r\nYet the response by many organizations to the Great Reset actually shows that this kind of fluid mentality is indeed possible. What is critical is that IT leaders have the same approach to the organization\u2019s cybersecurity model.\u00a0\r\nFuzzy Ways of Thinking About Cyber Risk\r\nUsers in the old enterprise security model were essentially managed by standard set theory. A worker could be thought of as occupying a position in a set, such as \u201cemployee.\u201d That \u201cemployee set\u201d had a limited number of use cases associated with it. Cyber-risk models related to work would typically be based on the layering of tasks, resources, interactions, and geography.\r\n\r\nAny worker\u2019s responsibilities results in a set of tasks they regularly perform. Each worker needs access to certain resources, such as information, hardware and software. Invariably there are some kinds of interactions with other workers, both inside and outside the organization. And workers perform those tasks in one or more physical locations.\r\n\r\nIn the past, these factors could be relied upon to be relatively static for many work roles. Sure, some people changed work roles and tasks regularly, requiring new resources and interactions. But in many organizations this was a small subset of the workforce. Some workers operated from home, or performed as nomads, but in most organizations these were limited to sales and business development functions.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Great Reset has shown that virtually all of these\u2014tasks, resources, interactions, and geographies\u2014can change dramatically. And they can, and will, continue to morph, both in terms of the pace and spread of change.\r\n\r\nHow, then, should leaders think about cyber risk in the era of the fluid organization?\r\n\r\nIn the early \u201890\u2019s, the risk model for the organization focused on the perimeter. If an organization could simply manage the edges of its technology and physical infrastructure, anything within those virtual and physical walls could be considered part of the trust domain.\u00a0\r\n\r\nBut the advent of public networks erased the perimeter, and with it went perimeter security strategies. To incorporate a range of use cases that included remote and mobile workers, the new model focused on endpoints. Secure every endpoint, and the connections between them, and trusted communications could ensue. But because organizations of any scale still had large offices, a substantial percentage of workers could be assumed to operate within the trust bubble much of the time.\r\n\r\nToday, however, the organization is perpetually distributed, and likely perpetually fluid. Suddenly, someone who was a contributor to a cloud-based crowdsourcing competition becomes a contractor working on a sensitive project. How does the organization recognize that transition? How can it flexibly and easily adapt its security model, practices, and tools to ensure that the appropriate levels of security are maintained?\r\n\r\nIn addition to these challenges, the Great Reset has introduced at least one new security factor to consider. Health risk. An enterprise information security strategist might have cared about worker health in the abstract. But suppose now that a worker comes into the office, and a week later her co-workers fall ill.\u00a0\r\n\r\nIs it the organization\u2019s responsibility to track those interactions, and trace back to find out who was in contact with whom? Does that have an impact on how the organization will manage resource access and co-worker interactions? Would a worker who has tested positive for a disease be flagged on building entry in the same way as someone who had breached information security?\r\n\r\nThe new enterprise cybersecurity model needs to be built on fuzzy thinking. The constantly changing landscape of workers, tasks, roles, resources, and geographical location itself will remain fuzzy for some time.\u00a0\r\n\r\nEven when many organizations ultimately shift into the Thrive phase of the Great Reset, hopefully with the capacity to build their businesses even better than before, leaders will find their organizations have become inevitably and perpetually fluid.\r\n\r\nThose organizations that embrace this new model in their businesses\u2014as well as in their approach to cybersecurity\u2014are the ones that will truly thrive from the insights gained in and around the Great Reset.\u00a0\r\n\r\nGary A.

    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until early 2020, much of the ongoing debate about the shifting landscape of human work focused on whether technology or globalization was having a greater impact on our work. Were robots and software digesting jobs? Or did offshore production and distributed supply chains have a greater effect? Economists and pundits throughout the world weighed in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then along came a virus. We know now that neither globalization nor automation compares to the sudden appearance of a global health crisis, and the dramatic shift in where, when and how we work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet that great shift masked two even more powerful forces: the pace of change and the spread of change. It’s the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">speed</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">distance</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of change that are causing the greatest ripple effects on human work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They have also contributed to an exponential increase in the potential complexity of enterprise security. As a result, these are the two forces that are fueling some of the greatest challenges—opportunities—for cybersecurity.</span></p>
<h2><b>The Pace and Spread of Change</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the pandemic gripped the world, we entered into what I called The Great Reset, a tectonic shift in how, when and where we worked. That reset has ended up being one of the most profound lessons on the pace and spread of change for virtually every industry, business, leader and worker. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the rapid shift to distributed work, many leaders are gaining the growing realization that they have broken the seal on the traditional organization. The result: Their workforces are becoming fluid right before their eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many workers who rarely or never used video calls suddenly found themselves completely dependent on a daily stream of back-to-back-to back webcam meetings. Yet this process masked what was already happening to workers and teams, fueling a new workforce framework for the enterprise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In many industries and organizations, work and jobs were already becoming atomized by technology. Work tasks were being split up among workers in dynamic ways, as teams continually faced new problems. Work responsibilities and roles were being adjusted accordingly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some organizations responded by committing to programs that could help workers become adaptive learners. But many companies continued to follow less-agile processes that kept workers from being able to effectively adapt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That less-flexible mindset of the past can be thought of as somewhat binary. Workers are either employees, or they’re not. While there might be a range of work roles within the organization, a binary approach reduced the number of use cases for work, making it comparatively easier to hire, develop and promote workers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the Great Reset has forced organizations to embrace a far more fluid mindset about workers and work roles. While market leaders in the past could simply reinforce existing processes and work roles, even traditional incumbents are now realizing they must embrace more agile processes. This will inevitably mean a far more fluid mindset about the range of roles that workers will perform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think of it as a “soft-walled organization,” with people in a range of contexts easily and rapidly traversing the former edges of the company. But how can business and IT leaders get their minds around this kind of shift? Rather than a binary mindset, a more useful perspective may be fuzzy thinking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In mathematics, a binary set is straightforward. Membership in the set is either 0 or 1. But an element in a fuzzy set is defined by its </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">degree of membership </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">in the set.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look at the range of roles in an organization. At any point, your organization may have traditional full-time employees. But it may also leverage the energies of part-time workers, temporary workers, contractors, sub-contractors, consultants, work consortia, industry consortia, online gig workers, apprentices, students, cloud workers, crowdsourced workers, partners and even former employees. And all of these might be performing their work in an unlimited number of physical locations, and collaborating with each other in an N-dimensional number of relationships.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Full-time employees with benefits might be thought of as having 100% membership in the work of the organization. But a gig worker who drops off a pizza to the office (assuming you have an office) would have only the slightest percentage of membership in an organization’s work. Every other role would be something in between 0 and 100%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fuzzy set thinking also needs to be subjective and multi-directional. For example, let’s say that I think you and I are friends and co-workers. You, however, think we are just co-workers. So when the arrow points from me to you, there’s an additional “friend” set. But it only works one way, since you don’t feel the same. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same can be true for work relationships. I may have tremendous loyalty and affinity to the organization. But if I’m a contractor, the organization may think of me as a disposable worker. That kind of subjectivity and ambiguity is hard enough in simple interpersonal interactions; it is especially problematic in a constantly changing workforce. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some leaders may find this breathtaking complexity such an overwhelming problem to solve, even from a pure HR management standpoint, they may believe that existing business processes are simply not up to the task. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet the response by many organizations to the Great Reset actually shows that this kind of fluid mentality is indeed possible. What is critical is that IT leaders have the same approach to the organization’s cybersecurity model. </span></p>
<h2><b>Fuzzy Ways of Thinking About Cyber Risk</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Users in the old enterprise security model were essentially managed by standard set theory. A worker could be thought of as occupying a position in a set, such as “employee.” That “employee set” had a limited number of use cases associated with it. Cyber-risk models related to work would typically be based on the layering of tasks, resources, interactions, and geography.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any worker’s responsibilities results in a set of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">tasks </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">they regularly perform. Each worker needs access to certain </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">resources</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, such as information, hardware and software. Invariably there are some kinds of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">interactions </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">with other workers, both inside and outside the organization. And workers perform those tasks in one or more physical </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">locations</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past, these factors could be relied upon to be relatively static for many work roles. Sure, some people changed work roles and tasks regularly, requiring new resources and interactions. But in many organizations this was a small subset of the workforce. Some workers operated from home, or performed as nomads, but in most organizations these were limited to sales and business development functions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the Great Reset has shown that virtually all of these—tasks, resources, interactions, and geographies—can change dramatically. And they can, and will, continue to morph, both in terms of the pace and spread of change.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How, then, should leaders think about cyber risk in the era of the fluid organization?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the early ‘90’s, the risk model for the organization focused on the perimeter. If an organization could simply manage the edges of its technology and physical infrastructure, anything within those virtual and physical walls could be considered part of the trust domain. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the advent of public networks erased the perimeter, and with it went perimeter security strategies. To incorporate a range of use cases that included remote and mobile workers, the new model focused on endpoints. Secure every endpoint, and the connections between them, and trusted communications could ensue. But because organizations of any scale still had large offices, a substantial percentage of workers could be assumed to operate within the trust bubble much of the time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, however, the organization is perpetually distributed, and likely perpetually fluid. Suddenly, someone who was a contributor to a cloud-based crowdsourcing competition becomes a contractor working on a sensitive project. How does the organization recognize that transition? How can it flexibly and easily adapt its security model, practices, and tools to ensure that the appropriate levels of security are maintained?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to these challenges, the Great Reset has introduced at least one new security factor to consider. Health risk. An enterprise information security strategist might have cared about worker health in the abstract. But suppose now that a worker comes into the office, and a week later her co-workers fall ill. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is it the organization’s responsibility to track those interactions, and trace back to find out who was in contact with whom? Does that have an impact on how the organization will manage resource access and co-worker interactions? Would a worker who has tested positive for a disease be flagged on building entry in the same way as someone who had breached information security?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new enterprise cybersecurity model needs to be built on fuzzy thinking. The constantly changing landscape of workers, tasks, roles, resources, and geographical location itself will remain fuzzy for some time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even when many organizations ultimately shift into the Thrive phase of the Great Reset, hopefully with the capacity to build their businesses even better than before, leaders will find their organizations have become inevitably and perpetually fluid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those organizations that embrace this new model in their businesses—as well as in their approach to cybersecurity—are the ones that will truly thrive from the insights gained in and around the Great Reset. </span></p>

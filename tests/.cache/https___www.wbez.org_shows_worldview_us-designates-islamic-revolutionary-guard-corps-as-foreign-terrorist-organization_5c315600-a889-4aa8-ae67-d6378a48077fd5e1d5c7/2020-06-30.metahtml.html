<article class="story"><p>Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced, this week, that the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) will be designated as a foreign terrorist organization. The IRGC is a branch of Iran&#8217;s armed forces. Pompeo&#8217;s announcement marks the first time that U.S. has given that designation to part of another country&#8217;s government. Just prior to Israel&#8217;s elections on April 9, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tweeted his gratitude, writing in Hebrew, &#8220;Thank you, my dear friend, President Donald Trump, for answering another one of my important requests.&#8221; Worldview producer Julian Hayda went to Chicago's Lincoln Park neighborhood this morning to ask people on the street whether they'd heard of any terrorist attacks conducted by the Revolutionary Guards.</p></article>

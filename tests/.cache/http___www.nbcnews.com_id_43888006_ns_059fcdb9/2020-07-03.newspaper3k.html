        July marks one year since the world learned of Stuxnet, the mysterious computer worm that launched the first successful cyberattack on infrastructure facilities. 
    </p>
    
<p>Stuxnet, which crippled an Iranian nuclear-fuel processing plant, served notice that <a href="http://www.securitynewsdaily.com/chinese-military-admits-cyberwarfare-unit-exists-0824/">state-sponsored hackers are out there</a> &#8212; and that everything from power grids to water supplies could be the next target. </p>
<p>But is that likely? Maybe not. For a number of reasons, security experts think it might be a long time before we ever see anything like Stuxnet again. </p>
<p>[<a href="http://www.securitynewsdaily.com/cyberwar-unlikely-deterrence-cyber-war-0931/">Why Cyberwar Is Unlikely</a>] </p>
<p>Stuxnet <a href="http://www.securitynewsdaily.com/microsoft-fixes-security-flaws-repairs-dangerous-malware-hole--0502/">spread from USB drive to USB drive</a> in Asia for months until it infected computers that controlled centrifuges at Natanz, Iran's main uranium-enrichment facility. </p>
<p>The worm stealthily sped up Natanz's centrifuges to their breaking points, even as it hijacked the facility's monitoring system to falsely show that the machines were functioning normally. </p>
<p>It took the Iranians weeks to catch on to what was happening, and the resulting damage set back the suspected Iranian nuclear-weapons program by years. </p>
<p><strong>Not a rogue operation
<br></strong>No similar piece of malware has since appeared, but some experts say that if one does, it will almost certainly be state-supported. </p>
<p>"Stuxnet was a highly specific operation which could only have been carried out with a nation-state's backing," said Roel Schouwenberg, senior malware researcher in the Boston-area office of the Russian information-security firm Kaspersky Lab. </p>
<p>The reason is the sophistication. Stuxnet attacked a very specific type of computer system &#8212; <a href="http://www.securitynewsdaily.com/power-grids-oil-refineries-staggering-level-cyberattacks-0710/">industrial supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems</a> built by the German company Siemens. </p>
<p>No nation has admitted creating Stuxnet, but suspicion immediately fell on Israel, Iran's arch-enemy. Investigative journalists <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/16/world/middleeast/16stuxnet.html">found evidence</a> that Israel and the United States co-operated to make the worm. </p>
<p>Stuxnet launched a multilayered attack, first exploiting four "zero-day" (previously unknown) vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows, then exploiting vulnerabilities in Siemens applications for Windows, and finally taking over the programmable logic controllers &#8212; specialized industrial-control computers &#8212; that ran on Siemens' own operating system. </p>
<p>Exploiting multiple zero-day vulnerabilities at once was highly unusual, as was the specifically targeted nature of the malware (the worm was designed to attack uranium-refinement facilities that exactly matched Natanz). </p>
<p>Those features are precisely what make it unlikely that a lone hacker will ever make anything quite like it. </p>
<p><strong>Out of reach of civilian budgets
<br></strong>Costin Raiu, Kaspersky&#8217;s director of global research and analysis, noted that the source code for Stuxnet has never been released to the public. </p>
<p>The hacker sites that claim to have it have so far offered only fakes, making it more unlikely that anyone except a state-sponsored actor with a lot of money and time could re-create it. </p>
<p>Schouwenberg said that in any case, the data-security industry is now so aware of Stuxnet, as well as the vulnerabilities that allowed it to work, that any new variants would have to try a very different approach. </p>
<p>"While perhaps some of the philosophies behind Stuxnet could be used in a new piece of malware," Schouwenberg said, "it is very unlikely to see any code re-used for an attack on a different type of network/hardware." </p>
<p>It would also be very difficult to design another piece of malware that could go undetected for so long. </p>
<p>Stuxnet was originally released into the wild in 2009, but <a href="http://www.securitynewsdaily.com/stuxnet-malware-hit-five-sites-before-target-report-says-0520/">it took several months</a> &#8212; it was designed to use USB sticks as the infection &#8220;vector,&#8221; because Natanz's SCADA systems were not Internet-connected &#8212; before the worm hit enough targets to make itself noticed. </p>
<p> Then there's the cost factor. Stuxnet was likely a multi-million-dollar project. It would have required not only people very familiar with industrial processes to develop it, but expensive industrial hardware to test it on &#8212; not the kind of things the average lone hacker is likely to have lying around. </p>
<p>(The New York Times alleges that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/16/world/middleeast/16stuxnet.html">a full-scale mock-up of Natanz</a> was built for testing purposes in the Israeli desert.) </p>
<p><strong>Heightened awareness
<br></strong>Schouwenberg said the simplest way for systems administrators to protect against a future Stuxnet-like attack would be to have their machines run only approved, or "white-listed,&#8221; software. </p>
<p>Stuxnet did prompt a rethinking of security, agreed John Burnham, vice president of corporate marketing at Massachusetts' Q1 Labs. For example, Microsoft has since <a href="http://www.securitynewsdaily.com/microsoft-fixes-security-flaws-repairs-dangerous-malware-hole--0502/">disabled the "autorun" feature</a> that allowed the worm to quietly infect computers from USB drives, and vice versa. </p>
<p>Such attacks have to be hardware specific, which makes it harder to "mutate" a virus or malware &#8212; but that doesn't mean it can't happen, Burnham said. </p>

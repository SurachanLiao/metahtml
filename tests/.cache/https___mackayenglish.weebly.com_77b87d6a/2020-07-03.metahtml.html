				<p class="paragraph"><span><span>Animal Farm</span><span> was a literary masterpiece that was made to bring an entertaining and enlightening viewpoint to the Soviet Union. &#160;In other words, the book was a satirical masterpiece. In today's culture satire is used all the time in pop culture such as in songs and T.V shows. South Park is an extremely popular T.V show that is known for its controversial topics, but it is most widely known for its social and political satire. Most commonly, the show covers common events such as political, racial and social disputes. Like </span><span>Animal Farm,</span><span> the show is banned in some countries because it conflicts with the interests of some countries. Such countries include China and North Korea. </span><span>South Park undergoes criticism after all of its episodes. Its creators are even banned in a few &#160;countries. George Orwell, the creator of Animal Farm was banned from Russia after he had written and published book. Like the creators of South Park, many of George Orwell&#8217;s books were banned from Russia, and its communist allies. Some of South Park&#8217;s most controversial episodes include episodes about racial, political, and social issues. South Park resembles Animal farm in that it is not afraid to bring up sensitive topics. Unlike Animal Farm, &#160;South Park is produced in a country that allows free speech, and freedom of press. George Orwell had taken a huge risk by publishing such an insulting piece of work during an extremely sensitive point in time. Although, South Parks episodes may not challenge the US government as Animal Farm had challenged the Soviet Union's government, it is still able to stir up some criticism from numerous groups of people. One episode from South Park that took a satirical viewpoint on the US government and its war in Afghanistan was an episode called, </span><span>Osama Bin Laden Has Farty Pants. </span><span>In the episode, the creators make fun of issues concerning the reactions of the general public to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, even after a decades time period had gone by, and the US's intervention in the middle east. It also highlights the unstable relationship between the United states government and the Afghans. This is similar to how George had emphasized the unstable relationship between the human and the animals. He had intended the humans to represent the old monarchy , and the animals to represent the incoming communist group. For the creators of South Park, they had taken a huge risk in talking about an extremely traumatic event, and then making fun of it. Although the show is maybe seen as vulgar and is banned by many groups, it is an extremely successful program that has received numerous awards. Both the novella and the TV show are masterpieces that would not have been as influential as they are if it weren&#8217;t for their use of satire&#160;</span></span></p>

				<p class="paragraph"><span><span id="selectionBoundary_1432870367504_8444863317999989" class="rangySelectionBoundary">&#65279;</span>Power and corruption in animal farm starts small, seemingly mindless or even logical things, such as the pigs keeping the milk and apples for themselves. But, soon the pigs obtain absolute power and therefore <a href="http://www.shmoop.com/animal-farm/power-leadership-corruption-theme.html" title="">absolute corruption</a>. Along the way, the other animal&#8217;s concerns and/or even slightly rebellious notions are quickly simmered and persuaded away by the pig&#8217;s smooth logic and words. </span>   <span>In today&#8217;s society, that&#8217;s not how things work. People are not so easily shushed. People stand up for what they believe is right whether is be peaceful protest, violent riots, awareness groups, making something that goes viral, art, stand-up comedy, music, and so much more. People stand up against the government, stand up for their equal rights, and oppose customs and ideas for valid reasons and even just for the sake of opposing.</span>   <span>In no way am I trying to say that people are not easily persuaded. Conformity and propaganda are prominent issue and the human race is reasonably gullible. However, there will always be people who will try to right things when they&#8217;ve been wronged. No matter the consequences or restrictions people will rebel and stand up for themselves. </span>   <span>In Animal Farm, this idea of rebelling against the rebellion never crosses any of the animal&#8217;s minds. When the pigs are suppressing the other animals and when the pigs begin to break their own set rules none of the other animals have the guts or maybe just not the brains to stand up for what&#8217;s right.</span>   &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <span>Intellectual rebellion is more effective, not just f!#% The man stuff, but real facts and a strong argument or powerful way of presentation. The best examples of these are:<span id="selectionBoundary_1432870367504_7031054948456585" class="rangySelectionBoundary">&#65279;</span></span></p><p>   <span>Speaking out through art (Banksy)</span></p>          <p class="paragraph"><span>It's beautiful, the art, the statement, Banksy is known for his power to cause viewers to think</span></p><p><span>Satirical stand up comedians</span></p>          <p class="paragraph">-Hilarious, Clever, Relatable all perfect factors to make his point stick in your mind and stick out in your mind</p><p>Rap and/or hip-hop <a href="http://www.hiphoparea.com/rap/hip-hops-ideologies-of-rebellion.html" title="">examples</a></p><p>"Cops is anxious to put niggaz in handcuffs&#160; They wanna hang us, see us dead, enslave us&#160; Keep us trapped in the same place we raised in&#160; Then they wonder why we act so outrageous&#160; Run around stressed out and pull out gauges&#160; Cause every time you let the animal out cages&#160; It's dangerous, to people who look like strangers&#160;" ~"The Watcher" by Dr. Dre</p><p><span>People use these methods to express themselves and their ideas. However, they not only use it for expression but for awareness and even to promote people to rally against or for certain ideas. Art uses class and cleverness to express these ideas making it more effective. Comedians use humor and cleverness to make their opinions and points effective and memorable. Rap and hip hop use rhyme, pop culture, and once again, of course, cleverness. All of these things have a common variable, wit. So, maybe the animals didn&#8217;t have the smarts to see there was a problem with their society, or perhaps they just didn&#8217;t have the wit to express it in a meaningful or convincing way.</span></p><p>Want more?

				   <p class="paragraph"><span><span><span><span>&#160; &#160; &#160;While reading </span>Animal Farm, I began to see many parallels between the relationships of the animals on the farm and my relationships with my family. This first became apparent when Old Major began to use his wisdom and life experiences, to help educate younger animals and lead them in a positive direction. Due to his old age along with his extensive knowledge he is a comparable to my grandfather. Soon after Napoleon took over the farm I also begin to notice that the way he exercises his power is relatable to the way my parents use their authority to control me. On the other hand related strongly to the position of snowball on the farm. This most likely due his ability to stand up for his beliefs against Napoleon, &#8220;a much more powerful and intimidating character than him&#8221;. This trait is made clear when Snowball rebels Napoleon, in hopes of building &#160;a windmill despite the fact others were murdered for going against him. Similar scenarios often take place between my parents and I, For instance the constant discussion of whether or not i should receive my own car often becomes an argument within my house. Often demand that I will be able to run errands for my mom if i have my own car. However no matter what I say or do it will ultimately be up the them whether or not I receive a car, just like Napoleon having absolute power to prevent &#160;Snowball&#8217;s windmill from being constructed. </span></span></span></p>  <p class="paragraph">&#160; &#160; M<span>y younger sisters are easily comparable to squealer, due to their tendency to agree with my parents. Along with similarities between characters in the novel and my family members, I also noticed other similarities to modern day families in America. For instance Napoleon is reprehensive of the stereotypical father in America. Considering he has a he says goes mentality. The animals other than pigs may be compared to the younger generation as a whole. Due to their inexperienced and naive attitudes. Snowball however could be characterized as someone who can see what is wrong with society. His ability to question Napoleon and laws is similar to modern day Americans in favor of changing the&#160;discriminative and unfit laws against those of different sexual orientation. Clearly Animal Farm&#160;is relatable to individual families and the United States as a whole.</span></p>

One of these themes would be a corrupted leadership. In the book, Napoleon is a dictator and his opinion and only his opinion matters. Things on Animal farm are run one way and one way only. That is similar to what is happening just a few hours away in the city of Baltimore.</span>&#160;&#160;&#160; <span>Currently in Baltimore, Maryland, there is a riot amongst the streets due to the death of Freddie Gray. One man started the riot leading others to follow. Soon after the riot began, the local CVS was on fire showing that what one man has done has corrupted others to make a statement in the city of Baltimore. In the book Animal Farm, Old Major came up with the idea to take over Manor Farm because of the unfair treatment that Farmer Jones provides to the animals. &#160;</span>&#160;&#160;&#160; <span>After the death of Old Major, the &#160;animals revolt against Farmer Jones and later on take over Manor Farm changing the name to Animal Farm. The theme of a corrupted leader occurs in both of these events. Just one person/ animal&#8217;s actions can change a group&#8217;s perspective in such a short period of time. These actions affect everyone that was/ was not originally on board to revolt. For example, in Animal Farm, Napoleon ran the farm as a dictatorship having the other animals believe that whatever he says goes. Similarly, during the start of the riot, the actions of one person dictated how the rest of the city would react causing burning of buildings, injuries, and police and National Guard assistance. In Animal Farm things did not get quite as severe as Baltimore, but when Old Major came up with the idea to revolt against Farmer Jones he did intend to have a huge riot to occur. However in both Baltimore and Animal Farm, the revolts ended into something bigger. These actions of revolt occurred because the people of Baltimore and of Animal farm wanted to stand up for something that they believe was right. In the case of the Animal Farm, the animals wanted to be treated better and have better lives in their opinion. Because of the actions of a corrupted leader, this caused an outcome that got way out of hand.&#160;<span>Similar to Baltimore, the people of the city revolted because they are standing up for something they believe in. The riot became very largely spread through the city and has gotten out of control. This is proving that corrupted leadership turns into a bad outcome.</span> The intentions of both the people of Baltimore and the animals of Animal Farm were to state a point. However, these revolts occurred due to a corrupted leadership. This common theme has/ was carried throughout both events. Comment_Lorenzo:</span></span></p><p><span><span>Im just going to put a comment here. Deal with it. I agree completely with the idea that anyone can make a change in society. One of my favorite quotes from the Dalai Lama &#160;Today's youth seems to be more open to change, and radically new ideas</span></span></p>   					 				</td>			</tr> 		</tbody> 	</table> </p>

				  <p class="paragraph"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda" title="">Propaganda</a> as we know is everywhere now a days but who knew Animal Farm written by George Orwell in 1945 also be full of different types of propaganda. Seventy years have past yet you the same strategies are use to sway the opinion of an individual.</p><p>Name calling is pretty self explanatory, it is the use of abusive language and insults. Animal Farm uses name calling as a tactic of propaganda when&#160;Napoleon calls Snowball a traitor and a criminal. Napoleon really just wants to be in control. He was willing to do anything for that power. Sometimes it seems like name calling is the easiest way. Like you don&#8217;t really know how to express what you are truly feeling so you just say something that may not be entirely true to get the result you want. To this day name calling occurs all the time especially over social media. Just a few days ago on twitter @cle_84 tweeted at actress, Emma Stone, &#8220;Emma Stone looks like and smells like cat piss.&#8221; The person doesn&#8217;t even know Emma Stone but they felt the need to publicly insult her. The reason was probably not even about but it&#8217;s easier to attack someone over the internet than to face what is really happening in reality. &#160;</p><p>Another type of propaganda used when Animal Farm would be &#8220;card stacking&#8221;. This is when one seeks to manipulate audience perception of an issue by emphasizing one side and repressing another. Within Animal Farm this occurs when Squealer lies to the animals about how much food the farm has; when in reality the farm has very little food. Squealer used this tactic to gain control of the animals. As we know the pigs were considered to be the most intelligent animals on the farm, so Squealer took this opportunity to be preeminent. This can easily relate to the <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/04/the-baltimore-riots-that-didnt-happen/391931/" title="">riot</a> that is occurring in Baltimore right now. The press has chosen to make all the african americans look like the antagonist and highlighting the white people as the victims but in reality there are many blacks who aren&#8217;t the enemy are actually helping the destruction that was occurring. </p><p><span>Bandwagon is everywhere. It&#8217;s because people really just want to feel like they fit in. Probably because it&#8217;s easier than standing out and risk putting their real self out there. &#160;Within Animal Farm the whole revolution against humans was due to bandwagon. The whole concept of &#8216;two legs are good fo</span><span>ur legs are bad&#8217; encouraged the bandwagon the animals all got behind the idea. I feel as a good way to relate bandwagon to current day would be commericals. Advertising companies tend to use celebrities to endorse their products. For example, Proactive uses all type of celebrities including Adam Levine. As you watch the commercial, seeing amazing results after amazing results, it leads you to the conclusion that this product not only works, but it will change your life like it already has for so many other people, even a celebrity.</span></p>         <p class="paragraph"><span><span>All of these parallels between Animal Farm and current day is showing that as times evolve the basis still remains the same. </span></span></p>  <p class="paragraph"><span>"Emma Stone."

With these advertisements is usually some sort of slogan or catchphrase to describe themselves or those who use their products. For example: Wal-Mart&#8217;s &#8220;Save Money. Live Better&#8221; slogan is used so that consumers almost grow an emotional bond with the company. Wal-Mart want to be seen more as a &#8220;Family Friend&#8221; than a major world corporation. This use of slogan corresponds with those used in </span><span>Animal Farm</span><span>. &#8220;Four Legs Good. Two Legs Bad.&#8221; was the slogan created by Napoleon that the animals on the farm stood by for a large portion of the novel. The slogan was used to bring the animals on the farm together and give them a common enemy: Man.</span><span>Another popular form of propaganda used by major corporations is one known as &#8220;Glittering Generalities&#8221;. This form of propaganda is used to create favorable emotions. This can be done by using specific words: freedom, values, family, ect. An example of this use in society is seen by Coca-Cola's "Life" product. In advertisements for this new beverage, family values are shown and used to sell the product. "Glittering Generalities" can be seen all throughout </span><span>Animal Farm. </span><span>The commandments scrawled on the wall of the barn were written to keep the values of Animal Farm alive. At the same time however they were written vaguely enough that the could potentially be changed which they are indeed. </span><span> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Propaganda is associated with totalitarian governments as a way to promote the government. It is often used that way, but propaganda has a wider definition than that. George Orwell's </span><span>Animal Farm</span><span> may having been written almost 70 years ago is still very much so relevant to modern society. This relevance can easily be seen simply by comparing the propaganda in the novel to that in modern society. The correlation between the two are fairly similar. </span></span></span></span></span></p>    					 				</td>				<td class="wsite-multicol-col"> 					 						  <p class="paragraph"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Propaganda plays a very dominating role within the plot of George Orwell&#8217;s </span><span>Animal Farm</span><span>.  While propaganda is usually seen as a product of &#160;governments or  political groups, propaganda also plays a very present role in todays  modern society. From the advertisements and slogans seen by corporations  on TV and billboards, propaganda is seen by the public on a daily  basis. In </span><span>Animal Farm</span><span>,  Squealer is a sort of propaganda machine. Constantly spouting lies that  Napoleon and his government want the farm to believe. Private  corporations put out numerous advertisements every year that follow the  same path as Squealer&#8217;s speeches fairly closely. They usually are not  politically based, but they use propaganda in a very similar way in  order to get the public to believe in their products and give them their  money.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>                    					 				</td>			</tr> 		</tbody> 	</table> </p>  <p class="paragraph"><span>Orwell, George.

				  <p class="paragraph"><span><span>Animal Farm</span><span>, written by George Orwell, was a book written in the middle of the cold war, where Russia&#8217;s communist system was failing and flailing. And while the infamous novel captured near perfectly the corruption in the cogs and gears deep inside Russia, the novel </span><span>Feed </span><span>by M.T. Anderson predicts how the capitalist state in the United States could collapse with scary accuracy</span><span>Feed</span><span> was written in 2002 but has recently resurfaced in the media because its message has become more and more relevant as consumerism in America has grown and as corporations have begun to really take over. (It was republished in 2012.) It&#8217;s focal point, the Feed, is a chip placed in the brains of young children that directly connects them to the Stream Feed: a sort-of internet on steroids. Through the Feed, you can watch movies, talk virtually, buy anything you could possibly need, and be directly advertised to by those same big corporations. And since everything down to the schools (where usage of the Feed and how to spend your money are taught, since anything you could ever want to know is available to you in less than a second) are owned by these absolutely massive corporations, they are in absolute control of the seventy three percent of Americans who have the chip in their brain. Sounds kinda like the present, huh? </span><span>Well, minus the Feed.</span><span>Except not really. M.T. Anderson said in an interview about his book that he intended for the Feed to symbolize propaganda and its control on the human mind. The &#8220;character&#8221;, if you will, of the feed symbolizes almost exactly what Squealer does in </span><span>Animal Farm</span><span>. Squealer&#8217;s entire job is to brainwash all the animals on the farm into believing that there were no problems- that the country and communism were existing and that those &#8220;outside problems&#8221; like Snowball and the other farmers were but afterthoughts. The farm was safe and prosperous. Now if you compare this to </span><span>Feed</span><span>, (and even to the modern United States) you can very clearly see situations where people in power try to cover up their wrong doings. In the case of </span><span>Feed</span><span>, the president of the United States (President Trumbull) states that the lesions that begin appearing on everybody&#8217;s bodies are &#8220;Not a result of any manufacturing wrongdoings&#8221; and that &#8220;they will go away.&#8221; (They don&#8217;t) </span><span>But so what? Big deal, right? Governments lie to their citizens all the time. Usually it's in the best interest of the citizens for the government to lie- similar to a parent telling a white lie about, say, Santa. </span><span>And you&#8217;d be right. It&#8217;s not a huge deal until the rebellious equivalent of a UN forms to stop your country from destroying the world. Which is exactly what happens in Feed: the Global Alliance (headed in South America, where the pollution is so bad that people become consumed by black sludge waves and die en-masse) threatens all throughout the book of issuing total war on the States. Strangely enough, even though they can hear of the news, the 73% of citizens with a Feed seem to not even care a little. They are so overwhelmed with the advertisements being streamed into their brains, that they assume that their livelihoods. They believe any war, any threat, is insignificant. They, as citizens, are clearly, fully, 100%-fully safe from any measly global alliance.</span><span>Right?</span><span>Now look at Animal Farm under the same circumstances. The Animals were never really overcome with fear of any other farms or farmers (except for when Squealer used the other farms as a fear tactic- but even at that it was to make the farm seem safer and more protected from the evils of the humans. Even when the animals end up fighting and losing a war on their own turf, they celebrate like&#160;they've&#160;won. The propaganda that is fed to them leads them to believe they are right, which in turn makes it even more wrong. </span><span>So what does this mean about capitalism? Basically: it&#8217;s just as broken. The big heads can get away with doing very much in almost every form of government. Not to say that the States are worse than Communist Russia, but it can happen to anything, anyone. Humans cannot handle power. We have over two thousand years of proof to support that, as not one system has lasted even a quarter of that time. </span><span>And as for propaganda, it is the tool humans use for stealing. Stealing thoughts, stealing energy, stealing land. It exists in every facet of our lives in areas where you cannot even imagine. </span><span>The takeaway I want people to have from this, the moral, if you will, is that we are surrounded by voices that cannot be supported. People can know how to talk but not govern. We are surrounded by propaganda and need to be careful, but also recognize that it can be used in our best interests. </span> CITATIONS:</span></p><p><span>Anderson, M.

Teens are naive and easily manipulated by social media and their peers because they are afraid to stand out. These social standards restrict teens from being able to express themselves in appearance and actions in order to avoid being bullied.</span><span>While you may not see any direct connections between the characters in the novel and teens, they are surprisingly similar. When Napoleon and Snowball immediately take charge of the animals once Mr. Jones is chased off the farm they aren't opposed by any other animals because they are too clueless to realize that the pigs are assuming a higher authoritative position (Orwell 37). This can also be seen in high-schools today among different social groups. "Popular" teens have influence over the rest of their peers, especially in fashion trends, and the peers will conform to these trends without question. </span><span>Propaganda is a main factor of maintaining the pigs authority on animal farm. During Squealer's speech he primarily uses rhetorical questions to make the other animals feel guilty for being suspicious of the pigs taking all the apples and milk for themselves (Orwell 14). The guilt Squealer provoked in the other animals is like peer pressure among teens.&#160;</span></span><span><span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_manipulation" title=""> Guilt can be used to pressure teens into doing things against their own beliefs because it puts them in the wrong if they don't do what they're being asked</a>.&#160;</span></span></p><p><span><span>Another way teens pressure their peers into doing things is by having a group of people gang up on one person and scare them into doing what others want. You see this when Napoleon has his dogs chase Snowball off the farm (Orwell 21). These dogs are a parallel to bullies in high-school because they use violence to force Snowball off the farm just as bullies use violence to make the other person do as they are asked. </span></span></p>    <span><span class="wsite-caption">http://aubreydaniels.com/pmezine/sites/aubreydaniels.com.pmezine/files/Bullying.bmp</span></span> <p class="paragraph">Citation</p><p>Orwell, George.&#160;Animal Farm.

				<p class="paragraph"><span><span><span><span>Animal Farm by George Orwell, can be compared to the <a title="" href="http://www.vox.com/cards/israel-palestine/intro">Palestinian conflict </a>which is still happening today. The history of the Palestine conflict starts with WWI, when Britain promised the land to both Arabs and Jews in exchange for military participation. After the war, Britain produced two documents promising the land to both groups. The Arabs and Jews should have appealed to Great Britain, but instead they fought each other. Decades later, this conflict still exists. In Animal Farm, Snowball is used as the scapegoat to take the blame off of Napoleon for the failures of the farm. Throughout the book Snowball is blamed for random misfortunes, the first destruction of the windmill and the human attack on the farm. Eventually the animals are told that he was never on their side at all, but a spy for Jones.</span><span> The animals start to lose comradery as other animals confess to crimes against Napoleon.This causes a divide between the classes of animals. The solution to the Palestinian issue was to divide the country into a Jewish and an Arab section. This has only been a temporary solution. On Animal Farm, the animals experience a divide as the pigs rise to power. The barn becomes below Napoleon and he then moves into the farm house. </span><span>The <a title="" href="http://www.merip.org/primer-palestine-israel-arab-israeli-conflict-new">fight in Palestine </a>started not just as an argument over land but the religious freedom of those who have worked honestly and been persecuted. The Arabs already occupied the land but the Jews also needed to escape religious persecution after the holocaust. In Animal Farm, the war that is raged between humans and animals is not simply over a plot of land. To the animals, this piece of land is the start to a future where those who have worked honestly can feel safe and escape the whip of humanity. It is important in both examples for the groups to have a place where a common factor unifies them. In these cases, religion or species. </span><span>The animals view old Major as a wise prophet who can help them on the road to freedom. It&#8217;s him who has the vision of the animals being free to live comfortably and collect the fruit of their labors. The Jews believe that Palestine is their homeland because of the biblical promise made to Abraham and his descendents, along with the fact that it was the historical site of the Jewish kingdoms of Israel and Judea. The Arabs believe they should have the land because they have occupied it for hundreds of years. Also because Abraham&#8217;s son, Ishmael is the forefather of Islam, therefore the land is for Arabs as well. The story of Animal Farm portrays humans as those who have a divine right to rule of animals. For example, one aspect that sets humans apart from animals are hands, the tools of manipulation. Along with their superior brain power. &#160;</span><span>Animal Farm and Palestine share a common goal because of the fact that they want to be free of persecution and slavery from &#8220;superior&#8221; groups. Their common mistake is that by the end they forget who the real enemy should be. The Jews and the Arabs fight each other instead the country that promised them both the land. The animals turn on each other instead of sticking with the common goal of expelling the humans and being independent.</span></span></span></span></p>

				<p class="paragraph"><span><span>Fear, Loyalty, and Control. Some of the many words that link the conditions in North Korea to George Orwell&#8217;s </span><span>Animal Farm.</span><span> The oppressed animals of Animal Farm, though not physically, resemble the citizens of North Korea.</span><span>In a recent Documentary called Inside North Korea, a doctor went to Korea and performed 1,000 eye surgeries that removed cataracts to heal blindness. After each successful procedure, the patient would rush over to a painting of Kim Jong Un, or as they said, &#8220;the Great Leader&#8221;, and fall to their knees praising him. They would thank him for allowing them to see again. However, none of the patients uttered a single thanks to the doctor or his team despite the fact that only the doctor&#8217;s operations allowed them to see. When interviewed, they said that is was only because of the Great Leader&#8217;s generosity and guidance they were able to see again...and only because of his guidance and generosity.</span><span>What a great guy.</span></span></p>     <p>Patients thanking Kim Jong Un after getting back their eyesight.</p>   <p class="paragraph"><span><span>This is very similar to how the later generations of animals in </span><span>Animal Farm</span><span>  treat Napoleon. They give thanks to anything he has done and believe  that it was his personal grace and generosity that allowed them to drink  water or lay eggs. To any person who has read the novel, they know  Napoleon is manipulating them and it is not because of his &#8220;generosity&#8221;  that they were able to do everyday things. Unfortunately, the animals  are unaware of this act and proceed to treat him as a god.</span><span>However,  these are not the only differences. Napoleon uses fear to control the  other animals on the farm. He makes examples of those who have confessed  to crimes they did not commit. He has them brutally murdered in front  of the whole farm. This destroys any feeling of rebellion towards  Napoleon.</span><span>These  methods are not unlike those used by North Korea Dictator Kim Jong Un.  Whenever anyone, no matter rank or relationship, speaks out against him  or the North Korean Government, he has them executed in the most brutal  of manners. Most of the executed people are innocent have not done  anything wrong, but they are brought out in front of large crowds and  shot, hacked apart, or eaten by rabid dogs, but the last form is only a  rumor.</span></span></p>     <p>North Korean guards walking a feral dog.</p>   <p class="paragraph"><span><span><span><span>Another way that </span><span>Animal Farm</span><span> is relatable to North Korea is the secret police. While they do not act publically, like the Napoleon&#8217;s dogs in </span><span>Animal Farm</span><span>,  the Ministry of State Security(MSS) basically serves the same function.  They are primarily used to root out rebellion against Kim Jong Un or  the North Korean Government. They are ruthless and ensure that the will  of the Great Leader is carried out. They are also similar to Napoleon&#8217;s  dogs in the way that they are eyes and ears of the Great Leader. based  on tales from defectors, one in every five households are members of the  MSS.</span></span></span></span></p>  <p class="paragraph"><span>Picture Sources<a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/north-korean-defector-says-she-believed-kim-jongil-was-a-god-who-could-read-her-mind-9251983.html"><span>http://www.independent.co.uk/news/north-korean-defector-says-she-believed-kim-jongil-was-a-god-who-could-read-her-mind-9251983.html</span></a><a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/01/05/north-korea-s-monstrous-murder-methods.html"><span>http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/01/05/north-korea-s-monstrous-murder-methods.html</span></a><a href="http://www.nknews.org/2014/02/neighborhood-watch-inside-north-koreas-secret-service-system/"><span>http://www.nknews.org/2014/02/neighborhood-watch-inside-north-koreas-secret-service-system/</span></a><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxLBywKrTf4"><span>www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxLBywKrTf4 Animal Farm citation</span></a><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxLBywKrTf4">http://www.george-orwell.org/animal_farm/0.html</a></span></p>

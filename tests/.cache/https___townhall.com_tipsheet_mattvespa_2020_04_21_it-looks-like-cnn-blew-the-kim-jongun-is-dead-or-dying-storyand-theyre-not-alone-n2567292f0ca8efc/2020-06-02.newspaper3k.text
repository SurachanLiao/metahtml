Well, it finally happened. North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un reportedly had heart surgery and suffered a severe complication that left him in a dire medical situation. He could also be dead. That’s what CNN and NBC News’ Katy Tur peddled out respectively. Granted, this is a closed society, so be cautious and after China totally botched a science experiment in one of their virology labs in Wuhan which led to the current COVID-19 pandemic—I’m not trusting their sources either. It led to some excellent memes and social media posts. There were also very serious discussions about who would take over. Kim’s children are very young. He has one daughter and two other children who we really don’t know about.

BREAKING: The US is monitoring intelligence that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is in grave danger after surgery, according to a US official https://t.co/WyprxoyV94 — CNN International (@cnni) April 21, 2020

When KJU dies, what will the Washington Post call him in their obituary? — Matthew Foldi (@MatthewFoldi) April 21, 2020

Tur dropped an atom bomb that Kim Jong-un was brain dead after he slipped into a coma. She later deleted the tweet out of an abundance of caution and for good reason because the South Korean government pretty much refuted the entire story, adding that there isn’t anything unusual occurring across the 38th Parallel. No movements—nothing.

NEW: Trump admin received information that Kim Jong Un had heart surgery last week and if he's alive, his health is poor, I'm told. KJU hasn't been seen at key events in recent days. It's unclear to US officials if he's dead or alive. (CNN 1st reported his condition's grave.) — Jennifer Jacobs (@JenniferJJacobs) April 21, 2020

I’ve deleted that last tweet out of an abundance of caution. Waiting on more info. Apologies. — Katy Tur (@KatyTurNBC) April 21, 2020

Now, come tomorrow, we may find out more—but for now, it looks like CNN and NBC News, especially jumped the gun on this one. Look, even writers at the left-wing Nation knew to take this story with a grain of salt, but then we got the brain dead angle. Dear Lord.

WARNING: The mainstream press often gets North Korea completely wrong. @CNN is putting out alarming and unverified reports, apparently from US intelligence sources, that Kim Jong Un's life is in "grave danger" after surgery. Others report brain injury. Be wary. Don't RT wildly. — There are no kings inside the Gates of Eden. (@TimothyS) April 21, 2020

An official from the presidential office in Seoul has said that there are no particular signs or developments within North Korea amid reports that Kim Jong Un is seriously ill after heart surgery. — Laura Bicker (@BBCLBicker) April 21, 2020

A South Korean source tells me Blue House is very much aware of the reports about Kim Jong Un's health status but cannot independently verify.



The source acknowledged that Kim's issues related to weight & smoking were well known but made clear they are waiting for more info. — Zachary Cohen (@ZcohenCNN) April 21, 2020

<p>Well, it finally happened. North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un reportedly had heart surgery and suffered a severe complication that left him in a dire medical situation. He could also be dead. That&#8217;s what CNN and NBC News&#8217; Katy Tur peddled out respectively. Granted, this is a closed society, so be cautious and after China totally botched a science experiment in one of their virology labs in Wuhan which led to the current COVID-19 pandemic&#8212;I&#8217;m not trusting their sources either. It led to some excellent memes and social media posts. There were also very serious discussions about who would take over. Kim&#8217;s <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/who-kim-jong-un-children-does-north-korea-have-heir-765818">children are very young</a>. He has one daughter and two other children <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-41081356">who we really don&#8217;t know about</a>.&#160;</p><p class="thm-piano-mop"></p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">BREAKING: The US is monitoring intelligence that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is in grave danger after surgery, according to a US official <a href="https://t.co/WyprxoyV94">https://t.co/WyprxoyV94</a></p>&#8212; CNN International (@cnni) <a href="https://twitter.com/cnni/status/1252413501793951744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 21, 2020</a></blockquote><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">When KJU dies, what will the Washington Post call him in their obituary?</p>&#8212; Matthew Foldi (@MatthewFoldi) <a href="https://twitter.com/MatthewFoldi/status/1252422196376428545?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 21, 2020</a></blockquote><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Attempting to predict the Washington Post obituary for Kim Jong Un... <a href="https://t.co/lU3Y0NfOD4">pic.twitter.com/lU3Y0NfOD4</a></p>&#8212; ForAmerica (@ForAmerica) <a href="https://twitter.com/ForAmerica/status/1252432052592377856?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 21, 2020</a></blockquote><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Kim Jong Un dying on 4/20 is the most Seth Rogan and James Franco shit EVER. <a href="https://t.co/zqdPNgraNd">pic.twitter.com/zqdPNgraNd</a></p>&#8212; SMOKESCREEN SZN ETHAN (@EthanGSN) <a href="https://twitter.com/EthanGSN/status/1252426882076688385?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 21, 2020</a></blockquote><p>Tur dropped an atom bomb that Kim Jong-un was brain dead after he slipped into a coma. She later deleted the tweet out of an abundance of caution and for good reason because the South Korean government pretty much refuted the entire story, adding that there isn&#8217;t anything unusual occurring across the 38th Parallel.

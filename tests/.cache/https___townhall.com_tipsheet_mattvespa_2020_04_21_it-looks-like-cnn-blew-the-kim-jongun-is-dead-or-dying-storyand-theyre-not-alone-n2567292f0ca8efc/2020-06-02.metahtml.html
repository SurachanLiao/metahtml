North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un reportedly had heart surgery and suffered a severe complication that left him in a dire medical situation. He could also be dead. That&#8217;s what CNN and NBC News&#8217; Katy Tur peddled out respectively. Granted, this is a closed society, so be cautious and after China totally botched a science experiment in one of their virology labs in Wuhan which led to the current COVID-19 pandemic&#8212;I&#8217;m not trusting their sources either. It led to some excellent memes and social media posts. There were also very serious discussions about who would take over. Kim&#8217;s <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/who-kim-jong-un-children-does-north-korea-have-heir-765818">children are very young</a>.

She later deleted the tweet out of an abundance of caution and for good reason because the South Korean government pretty much refuted the entire story, adding that there isn&#8217;t anything unusual occurring across the 38th Parallel.

The information came from three individuals familiar with the matter who <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/29/politics/donald-trump-brad-parscale-campaign-coronavirus/index.html">spoke</a> to CNN.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s p*ssed because he knows he messed up in those briefings,&#8221; one Republican told reporters, noting that Trump has become increasingly concerned about his chances for reelection.</p>
<p>Parscale, Republican National Committee (RNC) Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, and other advisers have warned the president that polls show he is losing ground in key battleground states. The polls both showed Trump trailing his opponent, Joe Biden, in swing states. Trump claimed not to believe the information even though it came from his campaign and RNC.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was just in a terrible mood with everyone late last week,&#8221; an anonymous official <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-presented-with-grim-internal-polling-showing-him-losing-to-biden/2020/04/29/33544208-8a4e-11ea-9759-6d20ba0f2c0e_story.html">said</a>.</p>
<p>Trump&#8217;s mood later improved, but only after Parscale came to the Oval Office on Tuesday with polling numbers that were more positive for the president.</p>

<div><p>Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq: MSFT) had to scramble to fix a Y2K problem late Friday night, the company told the Associated Press. Starting at about 11 PM PT, Microsoft had to work with Intuit Inc. (Nasdaq: INTU), which makes Quicken, to fix a glitch in the data feed between Intuit and Microsoft's MoneyCentral Web site. The glitch caused some customers' portfolios to appear larger than they were, the AP reported. The glitch was fixed by midnight. Also, on Saturday Microsoft engineers were fixing a Hotmail problem that caused e-mails from before October 1999 to appear as though they were sent in 2099. Microsoft officials told the AP that no e-mails were lost. -- Michael Fitzgerald, ZDNN &#8230; <a href="https://www.itbnews.info/1999/12/microsoft-fixes-two-y2k-glitches/" class="more-link">[Read more...] about Microsoft fixes two Y2K glitches</a></p></div>

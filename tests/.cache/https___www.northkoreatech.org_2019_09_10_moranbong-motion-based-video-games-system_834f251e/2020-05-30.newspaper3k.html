<div><p>North Korea appears to have developed its own version of the Nintendo Wii. The Moranbong games console comes with a couple of motion-sensitive controllers and a sensor bar that includes a camera.</p>
<p>It was briefly detailed by the state-run Arirang Meari website on Monday with a few small images of the device.</p>

<p>Through the console, users can experience various physical activities that are good&#160;for physical fitness, obesity, and whole body, the report said.</p>
<p>It highlighted a shooting game and a running game that appears to use a floor mat as part of the system. These are all similar components to those offered with the Nintendo Wii and PlayStation Move.</p>
<p>Arirang Meari didn&#8217;t disclose any details about the manufacturer of the device. It&#8217;s possible the device was developed in North Korea although it&#8217;s much more likely that it has been acquired from a Chinese electronics maker and branded with the Moranbong name.</p>

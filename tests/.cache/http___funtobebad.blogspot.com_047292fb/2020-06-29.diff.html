Stock markets in Asia also fell on Friday with benchmark indexes losing ground in Japan, Hong Kong and China.  The falls followed a weeks-long rally that had helped shares recover some ground from the lows seen in March. </ins></p><p><ins><span>Canadian stocks</span> opened lower on Thursday, June 11. The market has been rallying because they were looking to 2021 and saying we’re going to get past this and then things will sort of get back to normal. That, plus the easing of lockdowns and a massive stimulus program to help the economy bounce back  to pre-pandemic levels have been pivotal in the S&amp;P 500 staging a stunning recovery from a deep, virus-induced selloff.</ins></p><p><ins>The S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones indexes ended lower after Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged it could take years for the millions of people laid off due to COVID-19, to get back to work. </ins></p><p><ins>Not to mention, a second wave could drive the market down again.</ins></p><p><ins>Energy and travel stocks were among the biggest losers, as global crude oil prices also took a hit. European shares also dropped; all losing 4% or more.</ins></p><p><ins>"Government, companies and people would be better prepared for a second wave than for the first one," said Roland Kaloyan, European equity strategist at Societe Generale. </ins></p><p><ins>"But the problem is there is a limit to  long governments can keep injecting money."</ins></p><p><ins></ins></p><h2 class="story-body__crosshead"><ins>Slow recovery</ins></h2><ins> Share prices had gained in recent weeks amid hopes that the economy would rebound as authorities loosened restrictions put in place to try to slow the spread of the virus. Last week's surprise report showing US employers had restarted hiring in May helped to push the tech-heavy Nasdaq index to new highs.</ins><p><ins>But the recovery remains tentative. On Thursday, the US Labor Department reported that another 1.5 million people had filed new unemployment claims last week. More than 30 million continue to collect the benefits, it said.</ins></p><p><ins>US Federal Reserve policymakers said on Wednesday that the unemployment rate could remain above 9% at the end of the year - close to the worst level of the financial crisis,  At a news conference, Fed chairman Jerome Powell warned that this assessment may prove optimistic, if coronavirus infection and hospitalisation rates rise.</ins></p><p><ins>Several states that have moved to reopen, including Arizona and South Carolina, have seen a definite rise in Covid-19 cases in recent days.</ins></p><p><ins>"It could hurt the recovery, even if you don't have a national level pandemic. Just a series of local ones, of local spikes, could have the effect of undermining people's confidence in travelling, in restaurants and in entertainment," he said. </ins></p><p><ins>US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he did not want to see a return of the lockdowns that had kept the world's largest economy frozen for weeks.</ins></p><p><ins>But economists have warned that people will stay at home voluntarily if they are afraid of becoming ill. </ins></p><p><ins>More and more experts are predicting a second wave. So, lets take what we learned from the first one and tighten our belts and try to budget ourselves accordingly. Also, stock up on everything from hand sanitizer to toilet tissue before it happens. Buying stock in toilet tissue seems like a safe bet.

But if we ever hope to move past it, it can’t just be on people of colour to deal with it. It’s up to all of us – Black, white, everyone – no matter how well-meaning we think we might be, to do the honest, uncomfortable work of rooting it out. It starts with self-examination and listening to those whose lives are different from our own. It ends with justice, compassion, and empathy that manifests in our lives and on our streets." – Michelle Obama in a statement following the harrowing death of George Floyd </ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins><span>ARTISTS FOR BLACK LIVES MATTER:</span></ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>A picture really is worth a thousand words. A painting can speak to us if we are open to it. Art is a window to our time.  It represents the emotions, the philosophy, the soul and even the politics of our time. These paintings are a sad reflection of what is happening. Keep an open mind and keep an open heart. </ins></p><ins> </ins></div> <div><p class="item-snippet"><del>*YOU are gone from my sight but never from my heart. Rather than mourn your

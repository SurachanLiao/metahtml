<p>Jointly affected by the U.S.-China tariff war and the spread of the coronavirus, the value of U.S. apparel imports from China see a significant drop in January 2020.</p>
<p>Specifically, <strong>the value of U.S. apparel imports from China went down by as much as 36.1% month over month in January 2020. </strong>As a result, China&#8217;s market shares also dropped from nearly 30% in 2019 to a new record low of 23.9% in January 2020. However, <strong>it is important to note that such a downward trend started in October 2019</strong>, as U.S. fashion brands and retailers were eager to reduce their exposure to sourcing from China.</p>

<p><strong>China&#8217;s lost market shares have been picked up mostly by other Asian suppliers, particularly Vietnam and Bangladesh.</strong> However, there is no evidence showing that U.S. fashion brands and retailers are giving more apparel sourcing orders to suppliers from the Western Hemisphere. In January 2020, only 8.1% of U.S. apparel imports came from CAFTA-DR members (down from 10.3% in 2019) and 3.7% from NAFTA members (down from 4.5% in 2019). <a href="https://www.just-style.com/analysis/us-apparel-sourcing-patterns-are-changing-heres-how_id138122.aspx">Recent studies show</a> that there&#8217;s more divergence in the products imported into the US&#160; from Asian countries and the western hemisphere.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, according to the latest <a href="http://www.customs.gov.cn/customs/xwfb34/302425/2879130/index.html">statistics from China&#8217;s Customs</a>, the value of China&#8217;s apparel exports in the first two months of 2020 dropped by nearly 20% from a year earlier.</p>

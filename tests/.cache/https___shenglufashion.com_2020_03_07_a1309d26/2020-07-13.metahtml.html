As a result, China&#8217;s market shares also dropped from nearly 30% in 2019 to a new record low of 23.9% in January 2020. However, it is important to note that such a downward trend started in October 2019, as U.S. fashion brands and retailers were eager to reduce their exposure to sourcing from China.</p><p>China&#8217;s lost market shares have been picked up mostly by other Asian suppliers, particularly Vietnam and Bangladesh. However, there is no evidence showing that U.S. fashion brands and retailers are giving more apparel sourcing orders to suppliers from the Western Hemisphere. In January 2020, only 8.1% of U.S. apparel imports came from CAFTA-DR members (down from 10.3% in 2019) and 3.7% from NAFTA members (down from 4.5% in 2019). <a href="https://www.just-style.com/analysis/us-apparel-sourcing-patterns-are-changing-heres-how_id138122.aspx">Recent studies show</a> that there&#8217;s more divergence in the products imported into the US&#160; from Asian countries and the western hemisphere.</p><p>Meanwhile, according to the latest <a href="http://www.customs.gov.cn/customs/xwfb34/302425/2879130/index.html">statistics from China&#8217;s Customs</a>, the value of China&#8217;s apparel exports in the first two months of 2020 dropped by nearly 20% from a year earlier.</p></article>

"In fact, not only is there no seven-headed dragon, but there appears to be no evidence of dragons of any sort, seven-headed or not, in the East or anywhere else." &#8230; <a href="https://www.xbuy.info/1999/12/no-seven-headed-dragon-rising-in-east/" class="more-link">[Read more...] <span class="screen-reader-text">about No Seven-Headed Dragon Rising In East</span></a></p></article><article class="post-31207107 post type-post status-publish format-standard entry"><p>Sagittarius | Nov. 22 to Dec. 21 You are a melding of light and shadow, sunset and dawn, a multitude of wonders fused in mortal flesh.

My apartment's in a good part of town: reasonably close to shops, right between two nursing colleges, and a five-minute van ride from the deep section of the river. And, like I said, the interior's totally redone. I've got a nice collection of Native American pottery, some cozy floor rugs and plenty of world-music CDs. What could possibly be more woman-safe than that? It's perfect! At least, so I thought until I tripped over that waitress in the shower one morning. &#8230; <a href="https://www.xbuy.info/1999/12/i-cant-seem-to-make-my-apartment-a-safe-space-for-women/" class="more-link">[Read more...] <span class="screen-reader-text">about I Can&#8217;t Seem To Make My Apartment A Safe Space For Women</span></a></p></article><article class="post-31207095 post type-post status-publish format-standard entry"><p>I can think of dozens of other cases in which Robert's Rules have been flagrantly disregarded by these same co-workers.

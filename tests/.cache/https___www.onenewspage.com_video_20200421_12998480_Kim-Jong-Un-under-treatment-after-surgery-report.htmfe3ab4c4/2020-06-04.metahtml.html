<p><a href="/current/mq7b50/North-Korea.htm" title="North Korea" class="kln">North Korean</a> leader Kim Jong Un is receiving treatment after undergoing a cardiovascular procedure earlier this month.</p>
<p>That's according to a South Korean media report, amid speculation over Kim's health after his absence from a key anniversary event last week.</p>
<p>That occasion marked the birthday of <a href="/current/mjbb40/Kim-Il-sung.htm" title="Kim Il-sung" class="kln">Kim Il Sung</a>, Kim's grandfather and the nation's founding father.</p>
<p><a href="/current/mdt8dg90/Daily-NK.htm" title="Daily NK" class="kln">Daily NK</a>, a website run mostly by North Korean defectors, cited unidentified sources inside the isolated state saying Kim is recovering at a villa after getting the procedure on April 12.</p>
<p>The report said Kim's health has deteriorated in recent months due to heavy smoking, obesity and overwork.</p>
<p>A source was quoted as saying Kim had been struggling with cardiovascular problems since last August, which worsened after repeated visits to the country's sacred mountain, Mount Paektu.</p>
<p>The report said Kim was last seen publicly on April 11, leaving for the hospital after presiding over a meeting of the ruling Workers' Party.</p>
<p>Pyongyang fired multiple short-range missiles last week, which South Korean officials said were part of the Kim Il Sung celebration.</p>
<p>Kim would usually observe these military events, but there was no report on the test at all from <a href="/current/mj4sy20/Korean-Central-News-Agency.htm" title="Korean Central News Agency" class="kln">KCNA</a>, North Korea's state-run news agency.</p>
<p>Reporting on North Korea's leadership is notoriously difficult, given tight controls on information.</p>
<p>South Korea's Unification Ministry, which handles <a href="/current/mzf840/Korea.htm" title="Korea" class="kln">inter-Korean</a> affairs, declined to comment on the report.</p>

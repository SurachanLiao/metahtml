A Chinese man has undergone plastic surgery to look like North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un. 
 
Wang Lei is the spitting image of the 32-year-old 'Dear Leader' of North Korea, and has reportedly gone under the knife to enhance his likeness. 
 
He was caught by photographers in Nanjing, capital of east China’s Jiangsu Province, after bumping into a fellow plastic surgery lover - and going on a date. 
 
Wang Lei met Liu Zixuan, an actress based in Nanjing, at a plastic surgery clinic when she went for a check-up following a breast enlargement. 
 
The couple discovered their mutual interest in artificial body alterations and arranged to go on a gold date - inviting photographers to come along. 
 
The pair attracted crowd attention as they walked through town and Wang Lei took it in his stride, waving back to 'fans' and posed for pictures. 
 
Many people could not help but say that he was too into his character, local media reports. 
 
Liu Zixuan, 31, has been attracting media attention after announcing that she opted to have a boob job after her favourite social media celebrity revealed that a sizeable chest is what attracts him to a partner. 
 
The object of her affection is Wang Sicong, the son of China's richest man Wang Jianlin, who is worth £25billion. 
 
Wang Sicong has made a name for himself in China for his flamboyant posts on social media since he returned to his home country after graduating from University College London. 
 
The 27-year-old and has almost 13million followers and recently made headlines for buying his dog two £800 Apple Watches and posting a picture of her wearing them on her front paws. 
 
Miss Liu said that her ultimate wish was for Wang Sicong to follow her back on Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter.

Most people wouldn't use an international nuclear weapons summit to try out their latest comedy material.

Most people aren't President Trump.

At lunchtime during Trump's Singapore summit Tuesday, the president joked to photographers that they should make him and Kim Jong-un look "handsome and thin."

“Getting a good picture everybody? So we look nice and handsome and thin? Perfect,” Trump joked.

Watch the North Korean leader's reaction:

Translators are available on the summit, so it doesn't appear that Kim Jong-un missed the joke. In the past, Trump has called the North Korean leader "short and fat" in a tweet.

Why would Kim Jong-un insult me by calling me "old," when I would NEVER call him "short and fat?" Oh well, I try so hard to be his friend - and maybe someday that will happen! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 12, 2017

In other words ... I never thought I would have anything in common with a spectacularly violent, brutally oppressive North Korean dictator who starves his own people, but I was glad we could share this join moment of horror together.

Progress, people!

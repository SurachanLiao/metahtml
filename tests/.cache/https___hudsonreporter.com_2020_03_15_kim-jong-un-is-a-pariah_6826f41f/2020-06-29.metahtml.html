So far, there are some 117,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 (Coronavirus) in 110 nations. Approximately 4,000 souls have succumbed to the dreaded Coronavirus.</p><p>Italy has some 9,000 confirmed cases; and, regrettably, 460 have perished in that country. Consequently, the Italian government has locked down the Italian peninsula. Resultant of this government response to the health crisis, the Italian people are in extreme distress.</p><p>Yet, in the midst of this global health crisis, Kim Jong-un callously decides to rattle the saber by firing missiles into the East Sea. His bellicose behavior during this horrible pandemic clearly demonstrates megalomania. Without doubt, Kim Jong-un is a pathological egotist who is convinced of his own absolute power. Instead of working harmoniously with the international community to alleviate the impact that COVID-19 has had throughout the world, Kim Jong-un decides to displayed his military might.</p><p>The impunity that Kim Jong-un has shown the world during this crisis merits separation and sanctions. Kim Jong-un should be treated as an outcast, a persona non grata on the world stage, and an international pariah.</p></article>

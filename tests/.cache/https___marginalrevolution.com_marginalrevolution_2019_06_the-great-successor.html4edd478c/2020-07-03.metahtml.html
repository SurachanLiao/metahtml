<p>At the time he left North Korea, Mr. Kang estimated that about 80 percent of the adults in Hoeryong were using ice [meth], consuming almost two pounds of the highly potent drug every single day&#8230;</p>
<p>For many North Koreans, taking meth became an essential part of daily life, a way ot ease the grinding boredom and deprivations of their existence.&#160; For that reason, drugs can never be eradicated, he said.</p></blockquote><p>Men are not allowed to have long hair, the concentration camps are reputed to be worse than those of the Nazis, and there is a detailed account of the rise of the &#8220;new rich&#8221; class in Pyongyang.&#160; Plastic surgery has arrived as well.</p><p>Definitely recommended, the book also serves up the inside story on the Dennis Rodman visit to North Korea.&#160; By the way, Kim hates the showiness of the Harlem Globetrotters.</p></article>

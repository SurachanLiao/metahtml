        <h1>Ending the Cycle of Crisis and Complacency in U.S. Global Health Security</h1>
<p class="subtitle">A Report of the CSIS Commission on Strengthening America&#8217;s Health Security</p><p>November 20, 2019</p><p class="purchase-info__content"></p>

<p>When health crises strike&#8212;measles, MERS, Zika, dengue, Ebola, pandemic flu&#8212;and the American people grow alarmed, the U.S. government springs into action. But all too often, when the crisis fades and fear subsides, urgency morphs into complacency. Investments dry up, attention shifts, and a false sense of security takes hold. The CSIS Commission on Strengthening America&#8217;s Health Security urges the U.S. government to replace the cycle of crisis and complacency that has long plagued health security preparedness with a doctrine of continuous prevention, protection, and resilience. Such a strategic approach can restore U.S. leadership, strengthen financing and the speed of response, foster resilient health systems abroad, enhance the U.S. government&#8217;s ability to operate in disordered settings, and accelerate select technological innovations to secure the future.</p>

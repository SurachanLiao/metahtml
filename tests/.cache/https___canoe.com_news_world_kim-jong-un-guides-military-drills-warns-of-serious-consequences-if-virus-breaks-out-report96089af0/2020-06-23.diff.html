The report also said other countries with diplomatic missions were seeking to scale down their operations.</p><p>KCNA released photographs of Kim presiding over the meeting as well as overseeing the drills without wearing a surgical mask. All of the aides who accompanied Kim on the military inspection had identical black masks, whereas none of the participants at the meeting did.</p><p>“Kim’s activities appear to be intended to highlight to his people that his campaign to build a self-reliant economy is business as usual while boosting military morale and also showing they were not affected by the virus,” said Kim Dong-yup, a professor at Kyungnam University in Seoul.</p></article>

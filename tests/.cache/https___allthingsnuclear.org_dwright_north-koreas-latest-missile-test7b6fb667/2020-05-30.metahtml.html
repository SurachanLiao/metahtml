                         <p>Various <a href="https://twitter.com/nktpnd/status/1179215094179336192">sources</a> are reporting that North Korea test-launched two ballistic missiles tonight on lofted trajectories.</p>
<p>One of the missiles is reported to have reached a maximum altitude of 910 km (570 miles) and splashed down at a range of 450 km (280 miles) from the launch point. This missile would have had a burnout speed of about 3.74 km/s with a loft angle of 81.5 degrees, and a flight time of about 17 minutes.</p>
<p>If flown on a standard trajectory with the same payload, that missile would have a maximum range of about 1,900 km (1,200 miles).</p>
<p>This would classify the missile as medium range (1,000 to 3,500 km).</p>

            <p>I would fact check that 570 miles altitude.</p>

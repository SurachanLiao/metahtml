This missile would have had a burnout speed of about 3.74 km/s with a loft angle of 81.5 degrees, and a flight time of about 17 minutes.</p> <p>If flown on a standard trajectory with the same payload, that missile would have a maximum range of about 1,900 km (1,200 miles).</p> <p>This would classify the missile as medium range (1,000 to 3,500 km).</p> <p>Posted in: <a href="https://allthingsnuclear.org/category/missiles-missile-defense" rel="category tag">Missiles and Missile Defense</a> Tags: <a href="https://allthingsnuclear.org/tag/missile" rel="tag">missile</a>, <a href="https://allthingsnuclear.org/tag/north-korea" rel="tag">North Korea</a> </p> <p>Support from UCS members make work like this possible. <a href="https://secure.ucsusa.org/onlineactions/5WsPdhRNl0KNw4k74H9EPg2?MS=blogartcl" target="_blank">Will you join us?</a> Help UCS advance independent science for a healthy environment and a safer world.</p> <p class="comment_toggle" id="comment_toggle"><ins>Show Comments</ins></p><p><ins>Comment Policy</ins></p><p><ins>UCS welcomes comments that foster civil conversation and debate.

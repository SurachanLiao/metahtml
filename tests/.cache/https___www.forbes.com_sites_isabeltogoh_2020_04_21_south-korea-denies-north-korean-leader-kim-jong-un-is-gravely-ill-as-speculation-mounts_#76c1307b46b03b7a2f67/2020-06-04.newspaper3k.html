<h2>KEY FACTS</h2> 
<p class="key-facts-element">Speculation about Kim Jong-un&#8217;s health was triggered when, for the first time, he failed to attend the 108th anniversary event celebrating state founder Kim Il-sung on April 15, 2020.</p> 
 <p class="key-facts-element">But the spokesman for South Korea&#8217;s president was forced to deny the reports after CNN reported that the U.S. was &#8216;<a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/04/20/politics/kim-jong-un-north-korea/index.html" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/04/20/politics/kim-jong-un-north-korea/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">monitoring intelligence</a>&#8217; that Kim Jong-un is in grave danger following surgery.</p> 
  
 <p class="key-facts-element">Kim Jong-un was last seen in state media on April 11, 2020, chairing a meeting of the ruling Workers&#8217; Party about tackling coronavirus, according to South Korea&#8217;s <a href="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20200421003653325?section=nk/nk" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20200421003653325?section=nk/nk" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Yonhap</a> news agency.</p> 
 <p class="key-facts-element">He also skipped North Korea&#8217;s latest weapons test, an event that he has keenly presided over previously, as well as a major parliamentary session.</p> 
 <p class="key-facts-element">Various rumors about the state of the leader&#8217;s health have emerged from South Korean lawmakers, including claims that he underwent heart or ankle surgery to rumors he may be infected with coronavirus, Representative Yoon Sang-hyun said.</p> 
 <p class="vestpocket"></p> 
 <p class="key-facts-element">But diplomats cited by Yonhap dismissed the rumours as speculation.</p> 
<p><strong>Crucial quote</strong>: &#8220;No unusual signs have been identified inside North Korea . . . there is nothing we can confirm with regard to Chairman Kim&#8217;s alleged health problem,&#8221; South Korea&#8217;s presidential spokesman Kang Min-seok <a href="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20200421003653325?section=nk/nk" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20200421003653325?section=nk/nk" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">said</a>.</p> 
<p><strong>What we don&#8217;t know</strong>: Apart from what has happened to Kim Jong-un, it is not known where he is currently staying. According to online news site Daily NK, which publishes news about North Korea, Kim Jong-un underwent cardiovascular surgery on April 12, 2020, because of &#8220;obesity, prolific smoking and overwork,&#8221; a source at the news site <a href="https://www.dailynk.com/english/source-kim-jong-un-recently-received-heart-surgery/" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.dailynk.com/english/source-kim-jong-un-recently-received-heart-surgery/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">said</a>.</p> 
<p><strong>What to watch for</strong>: Who could potentially succeed Kim Jong-un, if he becomes incapacitated? Reuters has compiled <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-northkorea-politics-succession-factbo/factbox-questions-hang-over-north-korea-succession-amid-reports-on-kim-health-idUKKBN223152" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-northkorea-politics-succession-factbo/factbox-questions-hang-over-north-korea-succession-amid-reports-on-kim-health-idUKKBN223152" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">a list</a> of potential successors that includes sister Kim Yo Jong, his estranged brother and his aunt. Kim Jong-un assumed power in 2011, and his family has ruled North Korea since its founding in 1948.</p> 
<p><strong>Key background</strong>: This is not the first time that Kim Jong-un has disappeared from view. In 2014, the leader was not seen out for 40 days, before he reemerged with a limp and a cane. At the time, state media reported he had suffered from &#8220;an uncomfortable medical condition.&#8221; Efforts to confirm the state of Kim Jong-un&#8217;s health are particularly challenging given the opaque nature of the North Korean state.</p>

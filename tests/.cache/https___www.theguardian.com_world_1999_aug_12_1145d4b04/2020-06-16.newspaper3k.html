<div><p class="css-h6rhrn">Satanism is so common, says the report, that a special police force must be set up to tackle the problem. It says many schools and colleges have been infiltrated with devil worshippers, and calls the Mormons and the Freemasons "gateways to devil worship". </p><p class="css-h6rhrn">The report has been embargoed since July 1995, when it was first presented to President Daniel arap Moi. He announced that it would not be made public because it contained sensitive information with "legal implications". </p><p class="css-h6rhrn">But last week the report, written by a Catholic archbishop and leading members of Christian churches, was leaked to The Daily Nation newspaper, which serialised it. </p><p class="css-h6rhrn">Citing a case study, The Nation wrote about a student who witnessed a satanic ritual: "A human body was brought into the room and roasted at an altar. Those present drank human blood and ate the flesh with relish." </p><p class="css-h6rhrn">The four-day serialisation has triggered national debate. </p><p class="css-h6rhrn">Kirk Waldron, director of the Kenya mission of the Mormons, said: "We cannot accept judgmental and pernicious lies about our church." </p><p class="css-h6rhrn">But the majority of ordinary Kenyans have taken the report seriously. "Kenya is under the control of devil worshippers," said Tasneem Rehamanji, a 24-year-old secretary. </p><p class="css-h6rhrn">Journalist Gitau Warigi wrote: "The report is no more than narrow-minded prejudice from the mainstream churches, who sniff the hand of Satan in anything that does not fit into their religious world view." </p><p class="css-h6rhrn">John Githongo, a director of the African Strategic Research Institute, said there had never been a proven case of Satanism in Kenya. </p><p class="css-h6rhrn">"Religious superstition had inspired a ridiculous commission to investigate a ridiculous thing and write a ridiculous report," he said. </p><p class="css-h6rhrn">"The commission's findings... read likes a who's who of groups that deviate even slightly from Christian orthodoxy and their conclusions end up reeking of shaky evidence and a Christian bias." </p><p class="css-h6rhrn">The Weekly Citizen newsletter claimed that Nairobi businessmen Samuel Macharia and Chris Kirubi were the "gurus of devil worship". </p><p class="css-h6rhrn">Mr Macharia said: "People are desperate to explain why there is so much hardship and adversity in their lives, but their problems have more to do with politics and the economy than with the devil."</p></div>

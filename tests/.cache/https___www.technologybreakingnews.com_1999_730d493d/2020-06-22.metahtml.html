(Nasdaq: MSFT) had to scramble to fix a Y2K problem late Friday night, the company told the Associated Press. Starting at about 11 PM PT, Microsoft had to work with Intuit Inc. (Nasdaq: INTU), which makes Quicken, to fix a glitch in the data feed between Intuit and Microsoft's MoneyCentral Web site. The glitch caused some customers' portfolios to appear larger than they were, the AP reported. The glitch was fixed by midnight. Also, on Saturday Microsoft engineers were fixing a Hotmail problem that caused e-mails from before October 1999 to appear as though they were sent in 2099. Microsoft officials told the AP that no e-mails were lost. -- Michael Fitzgerald, ZDNN &#8230; <a href="https://www.technologybreakingnews.com/1999/12/microsoft-fixes-two-y2k-glitches/" class="more-link">[Read more...] <span class="screen-reader-text">about Microsoft fixes two Y2K glitches</span></a></p></article><article class="post-48830385 post type-post status-publish format-standard entry"><p>Microsoft creates even more problems for itself by refusing to make token gestures that might appease at least some of the Linux advocates. I'm not talking about anything as monumental as putting Windows and/or its programming interfaces into open source. Just something simple, like refunding Linux and other non-Windows users the cost of their Windows licenses during last February's Linux Refund Day (and then donating that money to charity), would give Microsoft some much-needed PR relief. &#8230; <a href="https://www.technologybreakingnews.com/1999/12/the-linux-monkey-on-microsofts-back/" class="more-link">[Read more...] <span class="screen-reader-text">about The Linux monkey on Microsoft&#8217;s back</span></a></p></article><article class="post-48830412 post type-post status-publish format-standard entry"><p>Koskinen said it would take an extra day or two after that ''before we can start to close the books on Y2K for the world.'' But in the short-term, Koskinen added that he was "pleasantly surprised" at the lack of disruptions from the computer bug as of early Saturday morning in the U.S. &#8230; <a href="https://www.technologybreakingnews.com/1999/12/y2k-watch-turns-to-monday/" class="more-link">[Read more...] <span class="screen-reader-text">about Y2K watch turns to Monday</span></a></p></article><article class="post-48830409 post type-post status-publish format-standard entry"><p>The Center for Democracy's Schwartz also thinks the issue of protecting critical infrastructure will take center stage next year, as the government tries to exert more control over systems such as utilities in the digital age in an effort to combat cyber-terrorism. The issue first gained massive attention last summer, when The Washington Post reported that the U.S. Department of Justice was seeking new powers to bug personal computers so it could further track criminal activity. &#8230; <a href="https://www.technologybreakingnews.com/1999/12/the-beltways-byte-factor/" class="more-link">[Read more...] <span class="screen-reader-text">about The beltway&#8217;s byte factor</span></a></p></article><article class="post-48830397 post type-post status-publish format-standard entry"><p>Are you working the Y2K weekend?

However, the closed-door policy has been proven wrong in history. If North Korea wants to develop, it has to emerge into the current of globalization.   <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/885023.shtml">GT editorial: Speculation over NK's future may be rash</a></p><p>Noticeably, under the current state system, <span>it's more difficult for Pyongyang to mend fences with South Korea, Japan and the US than to develop relations with Beijing.</span> The key divergence between North Korea and China lies in the nuclear issue, but there are multiple conflicts among North Korea, South Korea, Japan and the US. South Korea aims at dictating the unification process of the Korean Peninsula, while the US longs for a revamp to North Korea's system, which is unacceptable to Pyongyang.    Web Editors: <a href="mailto:liyingxa@globaltimes.com.cn">liyingxa@globaltimes.com.cn</a><a href="mailto:guwei@globaltimes.com.cn">guwei@globaltimes.com.cn</a> </p> </div>

AFP</p><p>Books by pro-democracy figures have been removed from public libraries in Hong Kong in the wake of a controversial new security law. The works will be reviewed to see if they violate the new law, the authority which runs the libraries said.</p><p>The legislation targets secession, subversion and terrorism with punishments of up to life in prison. Opponents say it erodes the territory&#8217;s freedoms as a semi-autonomous region of China. Beijing rejects this.</p><p>Hong Kong&#8217;s sovereignty was handed back to China by Britain in 1997 and certain rights were supposed to be guaranteed for at least 50 years under the &#8220;one country, two systems&#8221; agreement.</p><p>Since the security law came into effect on Tuesday, several leading pro-democracy activists have stepped down from their roles.&#160;<a class="story-body__link" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-53271740">One of them &#8211; one-time student leader and local legislator Nathan Law &#8211; has fled the territory</a>. <a href="https://u.osu.edu/mclc/2020/07/06/pro-democracy-books-pulled-from-hk-libraries/#more-34251" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a></p></article><article id="post-34247" class="post-34247 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-news-in-the-field"><p> The 2021 Newman Prize for Chinese Literature Nominations are in! Its an amazing group of authors (and jurors)!: Xu Xiaobin &#24464;&#23567;&#25996; nominated by Chen Xiaoming (Beijing University); Lung Yingtai &#40845;&#25033;&#21488; nominated by Eileen Chow (Duke University); Su Tong &#33487;&#31461; nominated by Huang Yunte (UC Santa Barbara); Wu He &#33310;&#40372; nominated by Andrea Bachner (Cornell University); and Yan Lianke &#38414;&#36830;&#31185; nominated by Eric Abrahamsen (Paper Republic).</p><p>The Newman Prize is sponsored by the University of Oklahoma&#8217;s Institute for US-China Issues, and is awarded every other year in recognition of outstanding achievement in prose or poetry that best captures the human condition. It is given solely on the basis of literary merit: any living author writing in Chinese is eligible. A jury of five literary experts nominated the five candidates and will select the winner in October through a transparent voting process. The winner will receive $10,000USD, a commemorative plaque, and a bronze medallion at an academic symposium and award banquet at OU in Norman in early March 2021. The event will be hosted by Jonathan Stalling, the Harold J. and Ruth Newman Chair for US-China Issues and Co-Director of the OU Institute for US-China Issues, which seeks to advance mutual trust in US-China relations. The inaugural Newman laureate Mo Yan (2009) went on to win the 2012 Nobel Prize in Literature, and other Newman Prize winners have included Han Shaogong, Yang Mu, Chu T&#8217;ien-wen, Wang Anyi, and Xi Xi. The Newman Prize honors Harold J. and Ruth Newman, whose generous endowment of a chair at the University of Oklahoma enabled the creation of the OU Institute for US-China Issues. The University of Oklahoma is also home to Chinese Literature Today, the Chinese Literature Translation Archive, World Literature Today, and the Neustadt International Prize for Literature.</p></article><article id="post-34260" class="post-34260 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-culture category-hong-kong category-politics"><p>Soundcloud recording of the radio show &#8220;<a href="https://soundcloud.com/wrfihumanrightsshow/magnus-fiskesjo-july-3">Human rights and social justice</a>&#8221; on WRFI.org in Ithaca, NY, USA, July 3, 2020, Friday.</p><p>I speak with program host Ute Ritz-Deutch, about China&#8217;s crackdown on Hong Kong, and genocide in Xinjiang (East Turkestan):</p><p>&#8220;Magnus Fiskesj&#246;, anthropology professor at Cornell University, talks about China&#8217;s new security law for Hong Kong, which makes it easier to prosecute demonstrators and further undermines the city&#8217;s autonomy. The details of the law were not revealed until after it already passed. This is a blow to the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong, where Chinese officials can now arrest critics (even foreigners) without involving local authorities. He also gives an update on the Muslim Uyghur minority on mainland China. Over one million have been detained in camps and many are now working in slave labor conditions in manufacturing sites across China.

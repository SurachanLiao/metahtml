2020 Hong Kong Studies Research School (Targets: Current PhD Students)

Established in July 2015, The Academy of Hong Kong Studies (AHKS) of The Education University of Hong Kong (EdUHK) is the first academy dedicated to fostering Hong Kong studies within local tertiary institutions.

To encourage young scholars to conduct research on Hong Kong-related topics, the AHKS is organizing the “2020 Hong Kong Studies Research School”. The initiative is a FREE and intensive training program targeting current PhD students with opportunities provided to participants to present their papers at the Hong Kong Studies Annual Conference.

Detailed programme information and application forms are attached and also available at the AHKS website: https://www.eduhk.hk/ahks/view.php?m=52866&secid=52874

We would be most grateful if you could kindly disseminate the message to your students or friends who are currently pursuing a PhD. Thank you very much for your kind assistance.

Best regards,

The Academy of Hong Kong Studies

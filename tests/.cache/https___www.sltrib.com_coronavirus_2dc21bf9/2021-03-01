His wife had previously tested positive and was quarantining in Japan.","type":"text"},{"content":"At the time, he felt “totally normal” and experienced no symptoms despite the diagnosis.","type":"text"},{"content":"“It was puzzling to me as to why all this fuss was being made,” the 56-year-old said during a Zoom news conference Sunday, reflecting on his thoughts from a year ago.","type":"text"},{"content":"Since Jorgensen’s diagnosis, COVID-19 has raged across the globe. <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/health/2021/02/28/utah-coronavirus-cases/\" target=_blank>Nearly 2,000 people have died in Utah</a>, and more than 500,000 have died in the United States alone. <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/sports/jazz/2020/03/11/live-utah-jazz-take/\" target=_blank>Sports shut down for months worldwide</a>.

The scientific community and the public at large know more about COVID-19 now than they did a year ago.","type":"text"},{"content":"Jorgensen said the situation “got real” for him when his test came back positive after he initially tested negative. He thinks he caught the virus while en route back to the U.S. from Asia in a cargo plane. He said the positive, symptomatic patients were separated from the rest of the passengers by only a curtain.","type":"text"},{"content":"“I’m sure there was a lot of transmission going on,” Jorgensen said.","type":"text"},{"content":"Once his plane landed, Jorgensen received a test and got his diagnosis. From there, he was taken to a hospital in Fairfield, Calif., that did not have a containment area for coronavirus patients. He remembers lab technicians scurrying out of his room after drawing his blood.","type":"text"},{"content":"And moving Jorgensen around was like something out of an espionage movie.","type":"text"},{"content":"“It felt very surreal — the whole experience,” Jorgensen said. “It was just the police escorts and the precautions and the ambulance and kind of the stealth way they got me into the hospital.”","type":"text"},{"content":"There was talk of transferring to Oakland, Jorgensen said, but he suggested in passing that maybe he could go somewhere in his home state. That’s where the Intermountain Healthcare facility came in.","type":"text"},{"content":"“That was kind of one step close to home, so I was excited,” said Jorgensen, who is from St. George.","type":"text"},{"content":"Jorgensen said he stayed in Intermountain’s isolation unit for about seven days before taking another police-escorted ambulance ride back to his St. George home, where he quarantined for another three weeks — him sleeping in the basement, his wife upstairs.","type":"text"},{"content":"Dr. Todd Vento, an infectious disease expert at Intermountain, recalled how quickly things changed just in the initial stages of treating Jorgensen. He kept testing positive for the virus, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told Vento that Jorgensen was no longer infectious — meaning he could leave isolation — indicating a shift in thinking on the national level.","type":"text"},{"content":"“The lesson there is that we learn things, we have to change, we have to adjust,” Vento said. “People said not to use masks. That probably set us back quite a bit. Now we know that the data is incredible for masks, and we need to use masks and we need to accept that.”","type":"text"},{"content":"Jorgensen said the past year has been “uneventful” for him. However, he is feeling some lingering effects that could be attributed to COVID-19. He said he has been experiencing “memory fog,” as well as an eye condition his ophthalmologist believes is related to the coronavirus. While Jorgensen was asymptomatic when he had COVID-19, the number of “long-haulers” experiencing long-term symptoms after being considered “recovered” <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/2020/09/06/utah-coronavirus-patients/\" target=_blank>continues to grow</a>.","type":"text"},{"content":"Jorgensen said he has not yet received a coronavirus vaccine and does not know when he plans to do so. While he described himself as someone who “kind of likes to see how it plays out” when it comes to the vaccine, he imagines he will follow the advice of his doctor, who has recommended to him that he receive it.","type":"text"},{"content":"Even though Jorgensen and his wife probably contracted COVID-19 on that 2020 cruise, he doesn’t regret going on it, he says. In fact, he is currently on vacation in Costa Rica with her in the couple’s first international venture since the pandemic reached Utah.","type":"text"},{"content":"“Obviously, we’re not letting any fear of that stop us,” Jorgensen said. “That’s just kind of our philosophy of life.”","type":"text"},{"content":"In Vento’s opinion, COVID-19 isn’t going away. While numbers are down in Utah, there has been a plateau across the county, which Vento said could be due to “sustained transmissions of newer strains.” But that doesn’t mean there isn’t an upside.","type":"text"},{"content":"“For that reason, I think the reality is it’s probably here to stay,” Vento said, “but that shouldn’t be a fear-inducing statement because we have vaccines, and we even have vaccines now with the mRNA platforms that are already being modified to address new variants.”","type":"text"},{"content":"Vento used the analogy of a marathon to describe that people should not be complacent, even as the numbers of cases, hospitalizations and deaths are down generally.","type":"text"},{"content":"“Marathons are 26 miles,” Vento said. “We’re probably somewhere in the teens, 20s, who knows? The point is you don’t stop the marathon at that point.

And would it in fact be a better system?”","type":"text"},{"content":"Requiring people to jump through hoops to prove they have an underlying health condition could be “terribly invasive” for people with disabilities he said, and it could also pose equity issues in gaining access to the vaccine.

That’s when the <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/2020/11/09/how-navigate-utahs/\" target=_blank>state of Utah</a> issued its emergency order prohibiting people from meeting socially with people outside of their household. This was the one with the scary late night emergency warning on our phones.","type":"text"},{"content":"The number of people visiting each other outside of their household still hasn’t recovered fully. Even once that order ended, I suspect the seriousness of it taught many about how much spread occurs through out-of-household social contact.","type":"text"},{"content":"You can see this pattern repeated in the other parts of the survey data. Fewer people are attending large events than in September and October, fewer people are leaving home for work or school, and fewer people are going to stores and restaurants. The upturn really had an impact on our social behaviors, an impact that’s verified by a look at the <a href=\"https://tracktherecovery.org/\" target=_blank>cellphone tracking data</a>.","type":"text"},{"content":"But how much did it change? Well, about 46% of Utahns spent time with someone outside of their household in the week before the order, and about 33% did after. This week, we’re at about 40% of Utahns.","type":"text"},{"content":"Of course, it’s not just whether or not you spend time with someone new, but how many people you spend time with. In the week before the state’s order, about 15% of people said they went to an event with at least 10 people in the last 24 hours; in the week after, that reduced to about 7%. Now, we’re at about 11%. A sick person spending time around dozens of other people means a potential super-spreading event.","type":"text"},{"content":"Overall, I’d estimate the role of changing behaviors to be the second largest factor of the three: somewhat less than the role of those who already were infected, but more than the impact of the vaccine so far.","type":"text"},{"content":"You can see this reflected in the Rt graph, too. If immunity was the only thing playing a role in Utah’s transmission rate, you’d expect to see a constant negative slope. But instead, Rt has stayed pretty flat since the middle of January. Well, this data shows us one reason why: people are spending more time with more other people in the last month, after they saw cases were declining.","type":"text"},{"content":"We’ll need to keep a close eye on it, though. With coronavirus variants starting to spread in Utah — the variants are somewhat more transmissible — our Rt might be a tad more unpredictable moving forward.","type":"text"},{"content":"The extremely good news is that the cumulative impact of Utah’s behavior changes and the spreading variants to this point hasn’t exceeded the rate of increasing immunity. So far in 2021, we’ve done a really good job of finding that balance. Both residents and the state Health Department will have to continue to work together on that, but so far, so good.","type":"text"},{"content":"We can’t open everything up right away. But as immunity increases — mostly through vaccinations this time, thank goodness — we can implement even more relaxed coronavirus standards.","type":"text"},{"content":"So yes, relatively soon, we’ll be able to be able to gather in groups, and yes, we’ll be able to shed the mask.

Remarkably, we invented, tested, began manufacturing and distributing multiple very safe and effective coronavirus vaccines in under 12 months. It is wildly impressive that we did this. Yay, science!","type":"text"},{"content":"But that speed also means that my articles from recent weeks need a bit of an update, because we’re learning so much so fast.

In particular, Utah being able to get back unused vaccine from a few pharmacies added thousands of extra doses I didn’t account for, and some second doses that we were holding back earlier in the pandemic went in arms instead.","type":"text"},{"content":"The result is that we are vaccinating more people sooner. Last week, <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/health/2021/02/14/utah-reaches-vaccinations/\" target=_blank>we were able to use 100,000 doses</a>, whereas my earlier models didn’t have that happening until next week. Instead, next week, Utah is slated to receive about 108,000 doses from the federal government.","type":"text"},{"content":"Getting shots in 100,000 arms so soon does mean that those people will need second doses more quickly than expected, so expanding availability will be key.","type":"text"},{"content":"And in this arena, the news is a little more wishy-washy. The good news is that Moderna announced it would deliver 100 million doses by the end of March and 100 million more by the end of May to the federal government, matching Pfizer’s accelerated timeline. These companies are exceeding their delivery contracts, which means they should meet the pace of <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/2021/02/05/when-should-all-utah/\" target=_blank>my most optimistic model</a> and Gov. Spencer Cox’s optimistic projections.","type":"text"},{"content":"On the other hand, the Johnson and Johnson vaccine will <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/17/world/only-a-few-million-johnson-johnson-doses-will-be-ready-when-the-vaccine-is-likely-to-be-authorized-the-white-house-says.html\" target=_blank>only have a few million vaccines manufactured</a> and ready to go when the federal government gives the company the go ahead, which should happen in the next couple of weeks. That authorization is a bit delayed; the company would need to pump out a few million vaccines <i>per week</i> in order to meet Cox’s announced projections of 33,000 J&amp;J doses per week to Utahns by the end of February. My “average” model, which projected 50% of that number, might be more accurate with regards to this vaccine.","type":"text"},{"content":"Still, with the overall good news, we’ve been able to open up vaccine availability to more groups, sooner. Cox even announced Thursday that <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2021/02/18/watch-live-utah-gov/\" target=_blank>appointments would be immediately available for those between 65 and 69</a>, about 10 days before they were originally slated to open March 1.

Well, that hasn’t been announced. Utah leaders could open it up to 55+, but I wouldn’t be surprised to see the governor just open the doors to everyone. Either way, we’re talking about realistic vaccine availability to the general public quite soon. I might bet on April for the first general public appointments, with everyone being able to schedule one in May.","type":"text"},{"content":"Coronavirus variants","type":"header"},{"content":"Of course, we want to know if the vaccines will actually work on the new variants spreading among us. My original article focused on the <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/health/2021/02/14/utah-reaches-vaccinations/\" target=_blank>variant that started in the United Kingdom labeled B.1.1.7</a>, but now we’re getting a greater understanding of all of the ways the coronavirus has mutated.","type":"text"},{"content":"These variants, all mutating in different people in different places, have developed some of the same changes to the coronavirus structure. Those changes — and the epidemiological record confirms this — mean that the virus benefits from mutating in these specific ways. In other words, these variants spread more quickly than what we’ll call “coronavirus classic” in a mostly unvaccinated population.","type":"text"},{"content":"There are two families of variants you should know about.","type":"text"},{"content":"• The B.1.1.7 variant is the U.K. variant. It is now spreading in the U.S. in a major way, doubling cases <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/07/health/coronavirus-variant-us-spread.html\" target=_blank>every 10 days</a> and is <a href=\"https://www.fox13now.com/news/coronavirus/local-coronavirus-news/third-case-of-covid-19-variant-found-in-utah\" target=_blank>definitely spreading</a> in Utah. U.S. evidence shows it’s between 35% and 45% more likely to be spread than standard coronavirus. U.K. evidence also showed it’s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/13/world/europe/covid-uk-variant-deadlier.html\" target=_blank>likely to have a higher risk of death</a> than the regular virus.","type":"text"},{"content":"The good B.1.1.7 news is that the vaccines <a href=\"https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/pfizer-biontech-vaccine-likely-to-be-effective-against-b117-strain-of-sars-cov-2\" target=_blank>still seem to work well</a> against it. Effectiveness might be impacted by just a few percentage points.","type":"text"},{"content":"• The B.1.351 variant started in South Africa, and is pretty similar to the P.1 variant, which was discovered in Brazil. This group is more worrisome because studies showed that the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine didn’t work as well against them. In fact, South Africa stopped vaccinating people while it figured out what was going on. So far, we’ve seen B.1.351 and P.1 in a combined 12 U.S. states, but not in Utah — yet.","type":"text"},{"content":"But as we know, the Oxford vaccine is less effective than the two mRNA vaccines we have in the U.S. One study compared how the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines performed against the two variants in a lab.","type":"text"},{"type":"image"},{"content":"In the middle of each graph is a common form of coronavirus classic, while the left and right show how many antibodies were generated when the two vaccines were used against the two variants. As you can see, the U.K. variant antibodies saw a small decrease, but the South African antibodies decreased much more significantly.","type":"text"},{"content":"Still, even these decreased antibody amounts will be more helpful than nothing. Notice the scale in the charts — antibody creation is being cut significantly, but not knocked out entirely. T-cells <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2102017\" target=_blank>should still be created</a>, too. In other words, the vaccines we have right now still will provide some good protection against<a href=\"https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2021/01/27/vaccination-against-the-new-variants-real-world-data\" target=_blank> this variant</a>.","type":"text"},{"content":"The other cool thing about the mRNA vaccine technology is that it should be easily editable. If we want to create a version of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines that specifically target this, or any other coronavirus variant, we can just change the mRNA used while keeping the rest of the recipe the same. That wouldn’t impact the safety of the vaccine at all, so we could skip some of the lengthy trial periods.","type":"text"},{"content":"In the coming weeks, we’ll get a better idea if we need to do that. Studies are ongoing for the U.S. vaccines against the South African variant in more human subjects. If it’s still around 90% effective, we probably won’t have to change much. If it’s around 50%, it’s time to develop a new recipe, and might mean booster shots for the new variants would be required — similar to how we get a yearly flu shot.","type":"text"},{"content":"Vaccines and transmissibility","type":"header"},{"content":"Because the vaccines were tested for their effectiveness in tamping down disease in an individual, we didn’t really know how much they would prevent the coronavirus from being spread from person to person. That meant we had to do <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/2021/01/14/can-vaccinated-people/\" target=_blank>some guessing with preliminary data</a>.","type":"text"},{"content":"But now, we’re getting more evidence that transmission is significantly down among the vaccinated. What’s going on in Israel is perhaps the best example: over half of the population has been vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine, and that country is starting to see real decreases in transmission.","type":"text"},{"content":"Those vaccinated are in a great spot. Of the 416,900 people that Maccabi Healthcare Services in Israel had vaccinated, only 254 picked up COVID-19 after the second dose. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/05/world/middleeast/israel-virus-vaccination.html\" target=_blank>All 254 cases were mild, too</a>.","type":"text"},{"content":"But it appears that those hundreds of thousands of healthy people aren’t spreading the virus as much, either. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/05/world/middleeast/israel-virus-vaccination.html\" target=_blank>Cases dropped 41% in a six-week period</a>, even among the non-vaccinated.","type":"text"},{"content":"Even better, <a href=\"https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/pfizers-covid-19-vaccine-reduces-viral-load-study--68439\" target=_blank>a new study this week</a> looked at how Israelis were impacted after just the first dose, not having yet received the second. And in the 12-28 day period after getting the first dose, even those who were infected had significantly less viral load in their respiratory system, about four times less. That means they’re going to be less effective at spreading the virus.","type":"text"},{"content":"Between this and the preliminary data that showed a 63% reduction in asymptomatic infections in Moderna’s vaccine, we have a pretty good idea now: The U.S. vaccines definitely reduce transmissibility. It’s probably not 100%, as they appear to reduce severe disease, probably not 95%, as they appear to reduce mild disease, but very likely in the 60-90% range.","type":"text"},{"content":"So to sum all of this up: We are getting people vaccinated quicker than originally planned, those vaccines appear to work against the variants or can be easily adjusted, and when you get vaccinated you are less likely to get someone else sick.","type":"text"},{"content":"This definitely counts as progress.","type":"text"},{"content":"<i>Andy Larsen is a data columnist.

Usually, there’s a big push toward the end of the session for money to pay for projected student growth plus a bump in the weighted pupil unit (WPU), the basic unit of education funding in Utah. That was already allocated before the session. Leaders voted to include $400 million in new money in the base budget, which included $122 million to pay for cash bonuses to public school teachers and staffers.","type":"text"},{"content":"That shift is the result of Utah voters approving Amendment G in November, which opened up the constitutional earmark reserving income tax collections for public and higher education to also include programs for children and services for disabled people. In the 2020 session, Utah lawmakers agreed to automatically include increases for enrollment growth and inflation in the budget as part of a deal to win support for the constitutional amendment from the education community.

He was sent to Intermountain Medical Center in Murray after testing positive at an Air Force base in California and was among only three Utahns who had the coronavirus at that time. His wife had previously tested positive and was quarantining in Japan.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;At the time, he felt “totally normal” and experienced no symptoms despite the diagnosis.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“It was puzzling to me as to why all this fuss was being made,” the 56-year-old said during a Zoom news conference Sunday, reflecting on his thoughts from a year ago.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Since Jorgensen’s diagnosis, COVID-19 has raged across the globe. &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/health/2021/02/28/utah-coronavirus-cases/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;Nearly 2,000 people have died in Utah&lt;/a&gt;, and more than 500,000 have died in the United States alone. &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/sports/jazz/2020/03/11/live-utah-jazz-take/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;Sports shut down for months worldwide&lt;/a&gt;.

People are receiving vaccines. The scientific community and the public at large know more about COVID-19 now than they did a year ago.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Jorgensen said the situation “got real” for him when his test came back positive after he initially tested negative. He thinks he caught the virus while en route back to the U.S. from Asia in a cargo plane. He said the positive, symptomatic patients were separated from the rest of the passengers by only a curtain.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“I’m sure there was a lot of transmission going on,” Jorgensen said.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Once his plane landed, Jorgensen received a test and got his diagnosis. From there, he was taken to a hospital in Fairfield, Calif., that did not have a containment area for coronavirus patients. He remembers lab technicians scurrying out of his room after drawing his blood.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;And moving Jorgensen around was like something out of an espionage movie.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“It felt very surreal — the whole experience,” Jorgensen said. “It was just the police escorts and the precautions and the ambulance and kind of the stealth way they got me into the hospital.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;There was talk of transferring to Oakland, Jorgensen said, but he suggested in passing that maybe he could go somewhere in his home state. That’s where the Intermountain Healthcare facility came in.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“That was kind of one step close to home, so I was excited,” said Jorgensen, who is from St. George.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Jorgensen said he stayed in Intermountain’s isolation unit for about seven days before taking another police-escorted ambulance ride back to his St. George home, where he quarantined for another three weeks — him sleeping in the basement, his wife upstairs.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Dr. Todd Vento, an infectious disease expert at Intermountain, recalled how quickly things changed just in the initial stages of treating Jorgensen. He kept testing positive for the virus, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told Vento that Jorgensen was no longer infectious — meaning he could leave isolation — indicating a shift in thinking on the national level.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“The lesson there is that we learn things, we have to change, we have to adjust,” Vento said. “People said not to use masks. That probably set us back quite a bit. Now we know that the data is incredible for masks, and we need to use masks and we need to accept that.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Jorgensen said the past year has been “uneventful” for him. However, he is feeling some lingering effects that could be attributed to COVID-19. He said he has been experiencing “memory fog,” as well as an eye condition his ophthalmologist believes is related to the coronavirus. While Jorgensen was asymptomatic when he had COVID-19, the number of “long-haulers” experiencing long-term symptoms after being considered “recovered” &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/2020/09/06/utah-coronavirus-patients/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;continues to grow&lt;/a&gt;.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Jorgensen said he has not yet received a coronavirus vaccine and does not know when he plans to do so. While he described himself as someone who “kind of likes to see how it plays out” when it comes to the vaccine, he imagines he will follow the advice of his doctor, who has recommended to him that he receive it.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Even though Jorgensen and his wife probably contracted COVID-19 on that 2020 cruise, he doesn’t regret going on it, he says. In fact, he is currently on vacation in Costa Rica with her in the couple’s first international venture since the pandemic reached Utah.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“Obviously, we’re not letting any fear of that stop us,” Jorgensen said. “That’s just kind of our philosophy of life.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;In Vento’s opinion, COVID-19 isn’t going away. While numbers are down in Utah, there has been a plateau across the county, which Vento said could be due to “sustained transmissions of newer strains.” But that doesn’t mean there isn’t an upside.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“For that reason, I think the reality is it’s probably here to stay,” Vento said, “but that shouldn’t be a fear-inducing statement because we have vaccines, and we even have vaccines now with the mRNA platforms that are already being modified to address new variants.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Vento used the analogy of a marathon to describe that people should not be complacent, even as the numbers of cases, hospitalizations and deaths are down generally.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“Marathons are 26 miles,” Vento said. “We’re probably somewhere in the teens, 20s, who knows? The point is you don’t stop the marathon at that point. You can’t say, ‘Now we’re going to finish the race.’ You have to keep running.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;}],&quot;credits&quot;:{&quot;by&quot;:[{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;avejar&quot;,&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/sltrib/7b5a6415-d88e-47fe-a2ec-6c567526e130.png&quot;},&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Alex Vejar&quot;}]},&quot;display_date&quot;:&quot;2021-02-28T22:14:03.716Z&quot;,&quot;headlines&quot;:{&quot;basic&quot;:&quot;One year later, Utah’s first COVID-19 patient recalls ‘surreal’ experience &quot;},&quot;last_updated_date&quot;:&quot;2021-02-28T23:29:55.016Z&quot;,&quot;promo_items&quot;:{&quot;basic&quot;:{&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;(Photo courtesy of Mark Jorgensen)  Mark Jorgensen, the first Utahn to be treated for COVID-19, takes a ride in an ambulance.

It’s an effort to get shots into arms as quickly as possible, but it will almost surely result in abuse as people find there are relatively few obstacles that prevent them from skipping forward in line.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“It is possible for people to lie about whether or not they have one of these underlying health conditions,” Gov. Spencer Cox acknowledged at a news conference on Thursday, where he pleaded with Utahns to play by the rules.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;But Tom Hudachko, a spokesman with the Utah Department of Health, said in an email that the department has determined it’s more important to ensure the process is simple and efficient &lt;a href=\&quot;https://coronavirus.utah.gov/vaccine-distribution/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;for the approximately 275,000 Utah residents who have qualifying medical conditions&lt;/a&gt; than it is to make it overly cumbersome just so “a few others don’t get in line early,” he said.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Requiring paperwork as proof of eligibility would not only “significantly slow the process of getting vaccines into these peoples’ arms,” Hudachko said, but it would also place an “unnecessary burden on health care workers who would be responsible for providing such documentation.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;This shift to more widespread vaccine access comes as Utah’s death toll from the coronavirus approaches 2,000. But the seven-day average for the rate of positive coronavirus tests has been dropping, under both the state’s traditional measure — which still stood above 10% last week — and its new methodology, which hovered around 6% last week. The number of Utahns who are fully vaccinated with two doses topped 225,000 midweek, with that total likely to top 250,000 over the weekend.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;What’s happening elsewhere?&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;header&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;As states begin making larger groups of residents eligible for vaccinations, they’ve taken different approaches to the question of whether to require paperwork to vaccinate people in a priority group.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;It can be difficult to find information on each state’s rollout, but &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/are-you-eligible-for-a-covid-19-vaccine-washington-state-to-launch-tool-rely-on-honor-system/\&quot; target=\&quot;_blank\&quot;&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.nj.com/coronavirus/2021/01/nj-covid-vaccine-people-begging-for-vaccine-in-nj-as-officials-ask-them-not-to-jump-the-line.html\&quot; target=\&quot;_blank\&quot;&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\&quot;https://boston.cbslocal.com/2021/02/17/massachusetts-coronavirus-vaccine-medical-conditions-eligibility-honor-system/\&quot; target=\&quot;_blank\&quot;&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.waaytv.com/content/news/Alabama-using-honor-system-to-verify-frontline-workers-getting-the-coronavirus-vaccine-573705441.html\&quot; target=\&quot;_blank\&quot;&gt;Alabama&lt;/a&gt; have so far reported using the honor system.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;In Texas, health care providers have been told to look at people’s medical records to determine their status for the shots, when possible. In other circumstances, people can disclose their underlying health conditions and receive the vaccine with no paperwork required, &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.dallasnews.com/news/2021/01/22/do-north-texans-have-to-prove-they-have-underlying-health-conditions-to-get-the-covid-19-vaccine/\&quot;&gt;according to the Dallas Morning News. &lt;/a&gt;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;At vaccination clinics operated by New York state, residents are required to provide proof of eligibility for underlying conditions with a doctor’s letter, medical information that shows evidence of their health condition or a signed certification, &lt;a href=\&quot;https://covid19vaccine.health.ny.gov/frequently-asked-questions-0\&quot;&gt;according to the state’s coronavirus information website. &lt;/a&gt;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;While it remains to be seen how well the honor system will be implemented here, Margaret Battin, a professor of philosophy at the University of Utah, said she wondered whether the community influence of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints could affect the success of the policy.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“The teachings of the church ... I think would tend to discourage behavior like cutting in line,” said Battin, who is also an adjunct professor&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;in the U.’s medical ethics and humanities program within the Department of Internal Medicine. “All that ‘do the right’ and ‘choose the right,’ that kind of moral teaching might well play a role in the behavior of many people in this state that might not be so true in a more heterogenous state like New York.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Hudachko said the decision was made primarily based on feedback from vaccine and health care providers that requiring paperwork would create “significant bottlenecks.” He said he hasn’t been able to make comparisons on which approach is more effective and noted that several states haven’t yet started vaccinating people with underlying health conditions.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;quote&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Equity issues?&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;header&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;While the honor system poses its own problems, Jim Tabery, an associate professor of philosophy at the U., said he thinks the vaccine rollout as planned is the “ethically appropriate way to go.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“Obviously when you’re thinking about something like this, your mind naturally goes to kind of the vaccine line jumpers or the freeloaders,” he said. “There might be some of that out there, but the question is: What system are you envisioning creating that would weed them out? And would it in fact be a better system?”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Requiring people to jump through hoops to prove they have an underlying health condition could be “terribly invasive” for people with disabilities he said, and it could also pose equity issues in gaining access to the vaccine. Individuals within hard-hit communities of color, for example, may not have access to a health care provider to obtain proof of their condition or might struggle to get work off to get an appointment.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“If you’re dealing with someone [in that situation] who’s got diabetes and you’re saying, ‘In order to get the vaccine, we also need some sort of confirmation that you have diabetes,’ you’re essentially asking them to kind of go see a health care provider that they don’t have access to,” he said. “And so most likely what you’re doing is guaranteeing someone is not going to get access to a vaccine.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Up to this point, it’s been “relatively simple” for vaccination providers to determine eligibility in Utah, Hudachko noted.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The first round of inoculations &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/2020/12/15/health-care-workers/\&quot; target=\&quot;_blank\&quot;&gt;was largely based on employment,&lt;/a&gt; and it was easy for health care workers, teachers, first responders and long-term care facility staff to prove they qualified based on pay stubs or badges. And older adults have been able to “easily provide proof of age with a government-issued ID or similar document with their birth date listed,” he said.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Even so, Salt Lake County Health Department spokesman Nicholas Rupp said there have been a few instances where people have tried to “cheat the system” and have been turned away at a vaccination site.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“Fortunately, it isn’t a widespread problem,” he said. “We’ve had more people genuinely misunderstand their eligibility, but even those aren’t widespread.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The county has not taken a position on the use of an honor system, but Rupp said the health department will follow the directions of the state and governor “and encourage people to be honest so vaccine goes first to those truly at the greatest risk of serious illness.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Vaccine chasers&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;header&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;In announcing Thursday that the vaccines would be open to people with underlying conditions immediately, rather than the March 1 date previously planned, Cox noted that those who now qualify are at the highest risk for hospitalization and death because of COVID-19.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;And he urged Utahns who aren’t eligible not to schedule appointments.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“We have so many more vaccines coming and they’re coming soon but we’re prioritizing these individuals — again based on age and these underlying comorbidities — because they are at the greatest risk of hospitalization or death,” he said. “So if you jump ahead in line, that means there is someone else who won’t get the vaccine as soon as they could have and it’s very possible that they could end up hospitalized, or even worse, dying.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Those who follow the rules “can sleep well at night by knowing you didn��t cheat the system, that you were willing to give it to those who needed it the most,” he added.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Hudachko noted that every Utahn who is 16 and older who wants one is &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2021/02/11/utah-health-officials-say/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;expected to have the opportunity to receive a vaccination by the end of May&lt;/a&gt;. People who are considering gaming the system to get their shot a few weeks early, he said, need to consider that “the person you are skipping ahead of is far more likely than you are to become seriously ill or even die if they were to become infected with COVID-19.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;As the state opens vaccines up to more people, Tabery said the most ethical thing those who aren’t eligible for one yet can do is wait their turn.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;There are legitimate questions about fairness within the vaccine rollout, he noted. But if, say, a grocery store employee felt like he or she should have been included in the latest round of inoculations, the way to deal with that is to contact state leaders to voice that concern — not for someone to take matters into their own hands.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The exception to that rule, Tabery said, is a scenario in which there are excess doses that need to be used and will go bad if they aren’t.&lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/11/17/935563377/why-does-pfizers-covid-19-vaccine-need-to-be-kept-colder-than-antarctica\&quot; target=_blank&gt; Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines must be stored at freezing temperatures&lt;/a&gt; and, once unthawed, have to be used within a certain time frame.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“If somebody were to find themselves in a situation where they just so happened to be at the hospital or at the pharmacy and the pharmacist or the nurse says, ‘Hey, we’ve got an extra dose. This is going to go to waste if you don’t use it,’ then it would be it would be wrong not to take that,” he said.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;It’s likely many people will make these ethical calculations during this phase of the state’s rollout, but Battin indicated that social stigma and disapproval of people who do cut the line will be the primary defense against that behavior.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Tabery said he anticipates there will be times where people cut the vaccine line and that those instances, when identified, will make the news.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;But he’s confident most Utahns will “play by these rules.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“I do think there’s a kind of underlying communal mentality to the state of Utah, which serves it well in situations like this,” he said. “And so I’m sure there will be line cutters. I’m sorry that they found themselves in a situation where they felt like they had to or could do that.

Things are significantly less awful than they used to be! It is far too soon to declare victory, but it is honestly very pleasing to see us take positive steps. And we know the decline is true, because we see it from a variety of sources: cases, deaths, hospitalizations, even the amount of coronavirus detected in our sewer systems, it’s all down. Coronavirus in our state hasn’t been at these levels since September.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;As you’d expect, the decrease in cases also means a decrease in our transmission rate, or Rt. Remember, Rt is the &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/2020/04/18/this-is-one-key-metric/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;average number of people infected by each person with the coronavirus&lt;/a&gt;, and this is one of the most important measures of the pandemic. If Rt is above 1, even by just a little, cases will rise. If Rt falls below 1, cases will fall.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Here’s Utah’s Rt graph over the course of the pandemic, as calculated by &lt;a href=\&quot;https://rt.live/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;Rt.live&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\&quot;https://epiforecasts.io/covid/posts/national/united-states/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;Epiforecasts.io&lt;/a&gt;:&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;div class=\&quot;flourish-embed flourish-chart\&quot; data-src=\&quot;visualisation/5381874\&quot;&gt;&lt;script src=\&quot;https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js\&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;raw_html&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;For months, Utah’s been playing this game with its contagion rate, dancing above and now below the Rt = 1 line. You can compare the last two graphs: When Rt was above 1 for months, cases rose and rose. As it’s fallen below 1, cases have fallen.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;So what’s working? Well, the decrease in Rt can only be due to three reasons:&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;1. People are getting vaccinated — making them immune to the virus. Vaccinations&lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/health/2021/02/19/good-news-biggest/\&quot; target=_blank&gt; significantly reduce transmission&lt;/a&gt;.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;2. People have already caught COVID-19 — making them quite immune to the virus (slightly less than if they were vaccinated). The antibodies also significantly reduce transmission.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;3. People have modified their behaviors — we’re doing things differently than in the months of rapid COVID-19 acceleration. There could be a bunch of factors at play here: fewer holidays in January and February, less travel, government orders, and so on.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Figuring out the relative role of these three reasons is really important. If the biggest factor is modified behavior, then we’ll have to continue doing whichever behaviors are necessary to keep our Rt below 1. If this decrease in cases is because most people are immune now, then we can be more aggressive in removing coronavirus restrictions.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;So which of those factors is playing the biggest role? Let’s find out.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Vaccinated people&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;header&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;This is the easy one to figure out. At this writing, there have been about 420,000 vaccinated with at least one dose of the vaccine, about 13% of Utah’s population.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;That being said, the vaccine doesn’t work immediately. It does seem to work relatively well after one dose:&lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.01.21250957v1\&quot; target=_blank&gt; recent estimates&lt;/a&gt; put it as high as 90%, but that’s after 21 days. In that first week or two, it’s not very effective yet.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Only about 250,000 Utahns had received at least one dose 21 days ago, which is about 8% of Utah’s population. So at this point, vaccinations have probably reduced the number of people who can catch the virus by about 8%.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Now, that doesn’t necessarily mean an 8% decrease in the average transmission rate. We vaccinated a whole lot of elderly folks, who probably weren’t seeing as many people in their everyday lives as many Utahns. On the other hand, we also vaccinated a whole lot of health care workers, teachers, police officers, and so on, who see more people in their everyday lives than the average.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;So far, about half of our vaccinations have gone to people over 60, and half below, according to Utah state data, so maybe those two groups even out. That 8% is just an estimate, but it’s what we have to work with.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;People who already had COVID-19&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;header&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;People who have been infected are significantly less likely to be infected again. &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.15.21249731v1\&quot; target=_blank&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt; followed people for over seven months and found that the protection that previous infection gives is over 90% — hey, just like the vaccines!&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;We’re less sure about how long some degree of immunity lasts, but the evidence here is &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/17/health/coronavirus-immunity.html\&quot; target=_blank&gt;largely positive&lt;/a&gt;. Even if the antibody levels don’t last very long, the responses &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-01143-2\&quot; target=_blank&gt;in other parts of the immune system&lt;/a&gt; can last for years and years — people with the original SARS-CoV-1 saw an immune response that lasted for over a decade.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Overall, 368,601 Utahns have had a positive test for the coronavirus, or about 11% of the population.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;But testing was very sparse early in the pandemic. And at the beginning of the school year, there were all of those &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/2020/10/12/some-utahns-refuse-get/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;remarkably foolish people&lt;/a&gt; who refused to get tested. And of course, there are legitimately people who got it but were asymptomatic — and yes, even people who don’t show symptoms &lt;a href=\&quot;https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/27/3/20-4543_article\&quot; target=_blank&gt;largely get immune system protection anyway&lt;/a&gt;. Lucky ducks.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;So how can we estimate how many people had the virus without getting a positive test? Well, we have a bunch of methods of tracking the pandemic that aren’t as reliant on testing: hospitalizations, deaths, the number of times people Google Search various symptoms, wastewater surveillance, and so forth.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention did &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/burden.html\&quot; target=_blank&gt;this through December&lt;/a&gt; and estimated that only 1 out of every 4.6 coronavirus infections was actually reported to a health department. That ratio, if it stayed stagnant, would mean 52% of Utahns have been infected with the virus. That’s probably a little high, as testing has continued to improve throughout the pandemic.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;A research team at Columbia University built a second model that &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2021/02/06/964527835/why-the-pandemic-is-10-times-worse-than-you-think#:~:text=One%2Dthird%20of%20the%20U.S.%20population%20has%20already%20been%20infected.&amp;text=Nationwide%2C%20Shaman%20estimates%20that%20about,third%20of%20the%20U.S.%20population.\&quot; target=_blank&gt;also found about a 1 in 4 rate&lt;/a&gt; nationally. But even better, they provided state-by-state estimates. At the beginning of February, the Columbia model estimated about 1.3 million Utahns have been infected at some point, or about 41% of Utah’s population.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;A third model, at &lt;a href=\&quot;https://covidestim.org/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;COVIDestim.org&lt;/a&gt;, uses a different approach to estimate that 29% of Utahns have been infected.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Regardless of the actual number, whether it is closer to 29% or 52%, it &lt;i&gt;well&lt;/i&gt; exceeds the number of people who have been vaccinated, and explains the drop in Rt in the past few months to a huge degree — as more and more people caught the virus especially in November and December, there would naturally be downward pressure on the number of people available to catch it again.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Changed behaviors&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;header&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;How do people spread the coronavirus? By hanging around other people, of course.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;So we want to track how much time Utahns spend around other people and how those measures have changed. To do so, we can ask people what they’ve been doing in self-reported surveys, and then verify those answers with real data from their cellphones.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;a href=\&quot;https://delphi.cmu.edu/covidcast/survey-results/?date=20210221&amp;region=UT\&quot; target=_blank&gt;Carnegie Mellon’s Delphi Group&lt;/a&gt; have been compiling data from Facebook surveys that do just that, asking a whole bunch of people every day about their activities. People then self-report if they spent time with someone outside their household, went to a store, went to a bar or restaurant, or attended an event that had more than 10 people in the last 24 hours. They’ve been doing this since Sept. 8.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Here are Utah’s results. Click the drop down to change the question people were asked.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;div class=\&quot;flourish-embed flourish-chart\&quot; data-src=\&quot;visualisation/5382199\&quot;&gt;&lt;script src=\&quot;https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js\&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;raw_html&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;You can see the biggest shift in behavior wasn’t actually at the holidays, but came in early November. That’s when the &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/2020/11/09/how-navigate-utahs/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;state of Utah&lt;/a&gt; issued its emergency order prohibiting people from meeting socially with people outside of their household. This was the one with the scary late night emergency warning on our phones.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The number of people visiting each other outside of their household still hasn’t recovered fully. Even once that order ended, I suspect the seriousness of it taught many about how much spread occurs through out-of-household social contact.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;You can see this pattern repeated in the other parts of the survey data. Fewer people are attending large events than in September and October, fewer people are leaving home for work or school, and fewer people are going to stores and restaurants. The upturn really had an impact on our social behaviors, an impact that’s verified by a look at the &lt;a href=\&quot;https://tracktherecovery.org/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;cellphone tracking data&lt;/a&gt;.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;But how much did it change? Well, about 46% of Utahns spent time with someone outside of their household in the week before the order, and about 33% did after. This week, we’re at about 40% of Utahns.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Of course, it’s not just whether or not you spend time with someone new, but how many people you spend time with. In the week before the state’s order, about 15% of people said they went to an event with at least 10 people in the last 24 hours; in the week after, that reduced to about 7%. Now, we’re at about 11%. A sick person spending time around dozens of other people means a potential super-spreading event.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Overall, I’d estimate the role of changing behaviors to be the second largest factor of the three: somewhat less than the role of those who already were infected, but more than the impact of the vaccine so far.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;You can see this reflected in the Rt graph, too. If immunity was the only thing playing a role in Utah’s transmission rate, you’d expect to see a constant negative slope. But instead, Rt has stayed pretty flat since the middle of January. Well, this data shows us one reason why: people are spending more time with more other people in the last month, after they saw cases were declining.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;We’ll need to keep a close eye on it, though. With coronavirus variants starting to spread in Utah — the variants are somewhat more transmissible — our Rt might be a tad more unpredictable moving forward.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The extremely good news is that the cumulative impact of Utah’s behavior changes and the spreading variants to this point hasn’t exceeded the rate of increasing immunity. So far in 2021, we’ve done a really good job of finding that balance. Both residents and the state Health Department will have to continue to work together on that, but so far, so good.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;We can’t open everything up right away. But as immunity increases — mostly through vaccinations this time, thank goodness — we can implement even more relaxed coronavirus standards.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;So yes, relatively soon, we’ll be able to be able to gather in groups, and yes, we’ll be able to shed the mask. We’re approaching the light at the end of the tunnel.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;i&gt;Andy Larsen is a data columnist.

Like, a heap of dirty diapers on rotten eggs adorned with some radioactive waste kind of garbage.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;We’ve now &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/nation-world/2021/02/22/ripple-effect-loss-us/\&quot;&gt;lost 500,000 Americans to COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;, leaving so many to grieve. That’s more than a &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/past-seasons.html\&quot;&gt;decade of estimated influenza deaths&lt;/a&gt; and is more lives lost than in three of our country’s major wars combined.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The economy has suffered, women particularly, women of color horrifically. Indiginous and low-income communities have bore the brunt of strain and sickness, while having access to the fewest accommodations (but what’s new?).&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Even racoons would refuse this swill.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;And yet, friends, among the amassing detritus, there have been a handful of golden nuggets worth recognizing and working to keep post-pandemic.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Now, maybe it’s just that there’s more light at the end of each day, but I feel like I’m sensing the faintest light at the end of the tunnel. And if we are, in fact, on the downward slope, I want to make sure we acknowledge the changes we made that we maybe shouldn’t unmake.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;With the &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.facebook.com/29001601/posts/10101517300360001/?d=n\&quot;&gt;help of some of my pals&lt;/a&gt;, I’ve started a list. I welcome your additions via email or comments. Let’s make this more complete.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Why didn’t we know this already?&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;header&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;• As grown adults, we had to relearn how to properly wash our hands. And it took video tutorials and celebrity skits/songs to do it. I feel surprised this was a 21st century lesson for an industrialized nation. Nevertheless, can we agree to ride this sudsy momentum for the foreseeable future?&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;• Many professionals are able to do their jobs without wearing uncomfortable clothes (or, in some cases, much clothing at all). Blazers, button-ups and slacks don’t actually correlate with productivity. (And, if my friends are any indicator, pantlessness might be advantageous for morale.) So, unless it’s necessary for the job, let’s reevaluate dress codes. (Side note: Not advocating being pantless in offices).&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;• We have the technology to experience people and events regardless of our locations. Do you have family you love but are unlikely to visit in Branson, Missouri? Have Zoom cocktails with those dears. That performance in Seattle? Stream it with your dog by your side. It might not be as good as live interactions or viewing, but we can access and make accessible more than ever before. And we should! This includes court/legal appearances, parent teacher conferences, work meetings and other necessary gatherings.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;• We shouldn’t go to work when we’re sick. If the idea of resting when you’re ill isn’t compelling enough, we’re threats to others in ways we might never imagine when we’re around them while contagious. Work shouldn’t supersede our care for our bodies and the respect of others’ bodies around us.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;• We should rethink how much we touch each other. As much as I love a good embrace and a firm handshake with eye contact, I’m noticing how we’ve woven a fair amount of physicality — even with strangers — into our social rituals and not everybody wants it. Plus, it’s germ swapping heaven. So, maybe we reserve that for our closer contacts, seek consent and find new ways to acknowledge the beginnings and ends of interactions.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Safety measure that feel like amenities&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;header&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;• I admit, we were having groceries and food delivered long before the pandemic, but this is more than just a convenience now — it’s increased accessibility and it’s mitigated risk. More than serving the lazy, curbside pick-up and home delivery can serve the less-mobile and higher-risk members of our communities.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;• Overcrowding is not just annoying, it’s a hazard. Giving people space on planes, in museums and parks might not allow for maximum profits, but it maximizes safety, comfort and enjoyment.

Let’s continue, as a society (not just certain organizations or people), to prioritize those in greatest need.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;• Teachers, medical professionals and frontline/essential workers deserve our generous appreciation always. They teach (and discipline and nurse and counsel) our children, they care for our unwell and they keep society functioning. More celebratory signs and equitable pay, please!&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;• Significant swaths of society live in poverty all the time. But, if you exist, you deserve a chance to succeed. Stimulus money, or better yet, a universal basic income and a functional minimum wage, should flow consistently to low-income families. Sure, a tiny fraction will use it poorly, but by and large, &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/new-leaf-project-results-1.5752714\&quot;&gt;giving money to poor people&lt;/a&gt; is proving an effective way to reduce food insecurity, increase stable housing opportunities and reduce spending on substances like alcohol, cigarettes and drugs.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;• Childcare and other unpaid family care falls primarily on women, &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/2021/02/16/how-will-utah-lawmakers/\&quot;&gt;costing us equity in our homes, status at our places of employment and buying power in the marketplace&lt;/a&gt;. Seeing the exacerbated results of this due to the pandemic should compel us to address it when times aren’t so dire.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;• Essential healthcare should be accessible to everyone regardless of the ability to pay. We have figured out how to COVID test and vaccinate all who want/need it; let’s do that with all necessary medical care. Sick people aren’t profit centers and healthcare is a human right.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;We have the need and means to solve really big problems (and even small elastic waistband ones), but we have to be intentional.

If they can find an appointment in another county, they can sign up and go there to be inoculated.

Otherwise, Cox said, “that is a dose that could go to waste.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The state saw a dip in vaccine distribution last week, Cox said, because a shipment of 36,000 doses of the Moderna version was delayed by storms on the East coast. “We are rapidly working to make up the decrease we saw last week,” Cox said.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Cox said Utah has been approved to get 20,000 doses of the new Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine by early next week — pending federal approval of the vaccine, which is expected as soon as Saturday.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine is a single-dose shot, not the two-shot formula of the Pfizer and Moderna versions, which, Cox said, “will help us with some of our harder-to-reach populations.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;State epidemiologist Dr. Angela Dunn said the state is “headed in the right direction,” with the number of COVID-19 cases declining.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“We need to continue doing what we know works with physical distancing, mask-wearing, avoiding large gatherings, and most importantly, getting the vaccine when it’s your turn to get it,” she said.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Cox expressed optimism that every Utahn will have access to the vaccine by late April or mid-May. “In just a few weeks, we’re going to have more vaccine than we know what to do with,” Cox said, adding health officials will then concentrate on encouraging people who are hesitant about the vaccine to get their shots.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;He reiterated the formula for when the state’s mask mandates can be lifted, released in the state’s updated public health order Tuesday: First the state must have 1,633,000 first doses of the vaccine allocated — then add eight weeks.

Some jurisdictions did choose to reopen schools in fall 2020 and spring 2021, though others have remained remote.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Throughout the pandemic, researchers have studied whether in-person learning at schools contributes significantly to the spread of COVID-19.

And the effectiveness went up to 85.4% if a cloth mask was worn over a surgical mask.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Another experiment from the study showed that a person in a mask emits fewer aerosol particles that can be passed on to an unmasked person.

These changes, though, would not represent a return to normal, but a new normal for students and teachers.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The remainder of Sexton’s statement strays further from current science. Research indicates that you’re safer outdoors than indoors, but public health experts still recommend wearing masks in public, even outside. Science does not support the idea that the time is right for some people to resume life as normal. That would allow the virus to continue to spread and have a large human cost in hospitalizations and deaths, said the experts.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Sexton’s post is inaccurate.

The same owners operate all three establishments.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The department also issued warnings recently to three other downtown bars — Soundwell, Wasted Space and London Belle. Those establishments were able to stay open but would face closure upon repeated violations.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Rupp said the bars that were closed “have aggressively been ignoring” the health rules. “Everyone that has been closed had at least one, but generally two or more, written warnings.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Health Department officials received a complaint about Echo on Jan. 4, and then again on Feb. 1 and Feb. 4, according to complaint records provided to The Salt Lake Tribune.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“Overcrowded, no one is wearing masks, tables have more than 10 people at them, and it looks like clubbing before a pandemic,” the written complaint said. “It doesn’t look like there is any guidelines being followed.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The department did not receive a complaint about Karma, but because it shares a kitchen with Echo, Rupp said, it also was inspected and found to be noncompliant. &quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Echo had been shut down in September due to previous violations of the state’s health order, and &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/2020/11/06/salt-lake-city-bar-sues/\&quot;&gt;sued the county Health Department&lt;/a&gt; in November over the restrictions.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;To reopen, businesses must send a written plan to the department demonstrating how they will comply and enforce the health order, which requires staffers to wear face coverings at all times; patrons to wear face masks when not eating at a table; and establishments to keep parties and tables at a minimum 6-foot distance.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The health department cleared Echo and Karma for reopening on Feb. 19, Rupp said.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Health departments are not the only ones monitoring compliance. The &lt;a href=\&quot;https://laborcommission.utah.gov/divisions/uosh/\&quot;&gt;Utah Occupational Safety and Health Division&lt;/a&gt; has cited 24 businesses for violating the mask mandate that then-Gov. Gary Herbert issued in November, according to &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.fox13now.com/news/fox-13-investigates/fox-13-investigates-utah-cites-24-businesses-for-employees-not-wearing-masks\&quot; target=_blank&gt;a recent investigation by FOX 13.&lt;/a&gt;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The fines were issued across the state and in all types of businesses. They range from a $1,500 penalty at a chicken wing restaurant in Spanish Fork to $4,500 at a car dealership in West Valley City.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Not all the complaints that the Salt Lake County Health Department has been investigating are related to COVID-19. Investigators are still sent out when they hear restaurants and bars might not be following the normally required cleaning procedures.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;For example, the department received a complaint Jan. 11 about a Salt Lake City brewery with a pet.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“Brewery has a cat that lives in the dining area,” the complaint said. “Walking all over the counters, into the restrooms and on the tables.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Inspectors cited the business, because — even during a pandemic — animals are prohibited in food establishments.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;b&gt;Editor’s note &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;• The Salt Lake Tribune and FOX 13 are content-sharing partners.&lt;/i&gt;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;}],&quot;credits&quot;:{&quot;by&quot;:[{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;kstephenson&quot;,&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/sltrib/53048f8e-41fe-4083-a446-2c3d9ac26315.png&quot;},&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Kathy Stephenson&quot;}]},&quot;display_date&quot;:&quot;2021-02-23T14:04:47.531Z&quot;,&quot;headlines&quot;:{&quot;basic&quot;:&quot;Salt Lake County has investigated hundreds of COVID complaints.

The bill from Senate Majority Leader Evan Vickers, R-Cedar City, is a response to the continuous state of emergency the state has been under for almost a year in response to the coronavirus outbreak.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2021/02/16/lawmakers-take-aim/801-237-2900/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;As previously reported&lt;/a&gt;, the bill would not impact the governor’s ability to respond to an emergency as it happens, but if the emergency declaration lasts beyond 30 days, then lawmakers could get involved. State and local health departments could do the same.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“We’ve looked back on what happened and asked ourselves the question, how can we do it better next time around? And, that’s a hard thing to do,” said Vickers.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Under the bill, if an emergency lasts beyond the 30-day limit, then the Legislature would weigh in with an emergency response committee, made up of current legislative leadership, plus other legislators who have experience relevant to the situation. For example, lawmakers with a health care background could be consulted during a long-term health emergency. If appropriate, that committee would solicit public input on what comes next.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“We wanted to get the public’s input and expertise on what’s going on with that particular emergency,” said Vickers. “Then we can make recommendations back to the Legislature.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;There’s also a motivation to maintain a check on the power of the governor. During the early days of the pandemic, when an emergency declaration from then-Gov. Gary Herbert was set to expire, lawmakers realized they had little recourse as he could just issue another immediately, which he did.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The bill would block the extension of a declaration, or the issuance of a new one, without the signoff of lawmakers.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“Not one citizen has had a voice in the policies that have been implemented since COVID began,” said Sen. Curt Bramble, R-Provo, saying the restrictions imposed because of the pandemic, including business closures and mask mandates, were never vetted by lawmakers.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“We are the citizen’s voice on policy. Not one citizen has had a vote on this floor of this body representing their voice on these long-term policies,” added Bramble.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Legislators &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2021/02/19/utah-politics-podcast/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;have been careful&lt;/a&gt; to say Herbert responded appropriately to the pandemic and collaborated well with them, but they felt the monthslong emergency gave authority to the governor that should rightly belong to the Legislature.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;There has been some controversy surrounding the legislation, which was made public less than two weeks ago. Gov. Spencer Cox, who has been negotiating with lawmakers over the bill, said last week &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2021/02/18/gov-spencer-cox-suggests/\&quot;&gt;there are changes he would like to see made to the legislation&lt;/a&gt;. He would not detail what those are, except suggesting the 30-day timeframe may need to be adjusted.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;However, if lawmakers can muster a veto-proof vote in favor of the bill, and the Senate’s unanimous vote indicates there’s plenty of support, then Cox’s objections could be moot.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Sen. Jake Anderegg, R-Lehi, said he’s encountered misunderstanding about what the bill does from members of the public who think it is giving public authorities sweeping new powers to shut down businesses that some believe infringes on individual liberties.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“Until this pandemic, we had never seen this used on a mass portion of society or an entire state or entire segment of an economy. We have never seen it used on such a broad scale,” he said. “What we’re doing is incorporating that concept into this bill and defining it in such a way that when the Legislature does intervene, we have the scope of the powers we can use. It’s wholly constitutional and wholly appropriate.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Sen.

Pavia added that masks, hand-washing and social distancing are known to dampen the spread of the flu — and taking those public health measures for COVID-19 is “a natural experiment where we’re controlling [the flu] really dramatically,” Pavia said.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The drop in RSV, which stands for respiratory syncytial virus, “is somewhat more perplexing,” Pavia said. A major symptom of RSV is a runny nose, and nasal secretions are a prime way the virus spreads — so masks and hand-washing are likely limiting how much those secretions get around. &quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Kids under age 3, who are most susceptible to RSV, are not congregating as much during the pandemic, with fewer play dates and day care visits, Pavia said. He also noted that older siblings who are learning online or having fewer in-person school days aren’t bringing as many viruses home.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;All that explains why RSV numbers would drop, Pavia said, but not why “it’s practically zero across the nation.” &quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;One theory experts are discussing, though there’s not a lot of evidence to support it yet, Pavia said, “is that viruses interfere with each other. And when one virus dominates the jungle, it forces all the other animals out, essentially. … Viruses have these weird interplays that we don’t fully understand.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Those low rates of flu and RSV aren’t likely to last into next year, Pavia said.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“It’s very likely that when both flu and RSV have been away for a while, you’ll have more people fully susceptible to it,” Pavia said. “So when it arrives, it spreads more dramatically and we see more severe disease.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Flu rates tend to oscillate, Pavia said, with a mild year often followed by a severe one. RSV, on the other hand, “depends a lot on, every year, having a new crop of babies who are completely susceptible to RSV. In Utah, that’s another 50,000 good hosts for the virus to attack. This year, we’re going to have a whole year of infants who never saw RSV. So next year, we’ll have twice as many naive infants who are susceptible to it.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Doctors in Western Australia, Pavia said, noticed that RSV was largely absent there in June and July — when it’s winter in the southern hemisphere — while the country brought its COVID-19 spread under control. Recently, as COVID-19 restrictions have been loosened there, doctors saw a huge surge of RSV during the Australian summer.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“RSV’s going to do something really strange when it comes back,” Pavia said. “We really can’t predict it very well. Our gut feeling is that it will come roaring back, and we’ll have a bad RSV year when it does return.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;}],&quot;credits&quot;:{&quot;by&quot;:[{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;spmeans&quot;,&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/sltrib/58277bb7-8a94-4709-b6c9-9f548aa1c141.png&quot;},&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Sean P.

Timothy Hawkes, R-Centerville, and Steve Waldrip, R-Eden, addresses the 21st-century convenience that consumers have been clamoring, especially during the pandemic.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;If approved, online ordering of beer at grocery stores would be allowed as long as the retailer does not process payment before it verifies that the customer — who still must go into the store — “is the patron who placed the order” and that she or he is 21 or older.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“The only difference is that you can now order online and give your credit card online,” said Waldrip. “You still have to go into the store” to present your ID.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Under current state law, consumers cannot place a beer order online. Grocery store employees can bring everything from milk and carrots to soap and toilet paper to a car for curbside pickup. But if shoppers want beer, they have to go inside to buy it. The restriction has been in place to prevent underage buyers from purchasing alcohol.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The curbside sales ban came to light several years ago, when Utah grocery stores started offering the “click and collect” online service for busy consumers. But the issue has become more pronounced over the past 11 months as Utahns have been encouraged to order online for pickup and delivery, hoping to avoid the spread of COVID-19.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Along those same lines, the newly unveiled bill also would allow customers to place an online order at a licensed distillery, brewery or winery.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The manufacturer would not be allowed to process the payment, the measure says, until the customer goes into the business and an employee determines that it is “the patron who placed the order” and that person is of legal age to buy alcohol.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The online ordering would not apply to Utah’s state-run liquor stores or smaller “package agencies” operated on a contract basis in rural areas.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The bill has not yet been assigned to a committee for debate.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;It also does not address the issue of home delivery of alcohol. That convenience likely will remain illegal in the Beehive State for the foreseeable future.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Amid the coronavirus, several states have relaxed laws on alcohol purchases temporarily and are allowing curbside pickup and/or delivery of beer, wine and spirits, according to the &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.nabca.org/\&quot;&gt;National Alcohol Beverage Control Association&lt;/a&gt;.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;In Utah, &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/2019/11/01/hallelujah-utahns/\&quot;&gt;grocery stores can sell beer up to 5% alcohol by volume&lt;/a&gt;. Stronger beer is sold in state-run liquor stores.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Another item HB371 does not tackle is Utah’s shortage of bar licenses.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The state currently has seven businesses waiting for bar licenses, but the next permit won’t become available until April. Business owners as well as members of the state liquor commission say the delay could be remedied if the Legislature lowered the population ratio now in state code. Currently, Utah can have one bar for every 10,200 residents.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;HB371 — which is 83 pages long — makes several other tweaks to state alcohol code, such as:&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;• Allowing hotels built within “a community reinvestment project area” to qualify for state liquor licenses — even if they are located close to a school, church and other community location. This provision is specifically designed to help the &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/2020/01/04/construction-salt-lake/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;26-story convention center hotel being built in downtown Salt Lake City&lt;/a&gt;. It doesn’t meet the current distance requirement under the law. The hotel would qualify as long as the bars, restaurants and other liquor sales areas are on the upper floors and not accessible from street level.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;• Changing the definition of a “small brewer” and creating a tiered markup for independent producers — such as Uinta Brewing Co. — that make between 40,000 and 60,000 barrels of beer each year.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;b&gt;Correction&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt; • &lt;/i&gt;Feb. 22, 9:45 a.m.: This bill would allow consumers to order beer online for pick up inside stores.

And most districts are teaching it, accelerated in part by $27 million set aside by the Legislature in 2019 to create mental health programs to improve student safety, engagement, culture and academics.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Here are some programs and pilots underway:&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Opening wellness centers inside schools&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;header&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;A classroom at Monte Vista Elementary in the Jordan School District has been transformed into a Wellness Center, where students who feel sad, anxious, upset or distracted find a space to take a breath, identify their emotions and choose a tool to help them refocus. That may be building with Legos, sitting alone in a tepee or reading a book.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;After 10 minutes, the South Jordan students head back to class, calm and ready to learn.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“It’s never a way to get out of work. It’s a way to help them better prepare to get the work done,” says Jodee Packer, the school’s social emotional specialist who oversees the center.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Such centers are gaining in popularity in Utah. Canyons District is creating wellness rooms in 18 of its schools. Davis, Salt Lake and Jordan districts use them as well.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Monte Vista’s center opened in the fall and already is showing results. Principal Nanette Ririe estimates that 10 to 15 students had been referred to her office for aggressive behavior this school year, compared to around 50 last year — a “phenomenal” drop that happened even as she and teachers are seeing students who are uneasier than ever because of the pandemic.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Students pick up on their parents’ anxieties, over finances and politics and fear of the coronavirus. “There’s more anxiety,” says school psychologist Lisa Stillman. Students may notice a missing friend and wonder, “Do they have COVID and are they going to die, are they coming back?”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;As of mid-January, the center had averaged 22 students a day, for over 1,200 visits since mid-August. By mid-February, it had reached just over 1,500 visits, Packer said. Children can ask to go to the center, or a teacher can refer them if they notice a fidgeting, distracted or wound-up student who seems to need the break.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Packer asks them to identify their emotions coming in and going out. Almost half report feeling sad, depressed, tired, sick, bored or disappointed coming in, followed by a category that includes distracted, annoyed, embarrassed or nervous. Nearly 100 percent report feeling better (happy, proud, calm, content or thankful) and ready to learn at the end of their visit.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The goal is to get the students in the center before they escalate to feeling angry, stressed, aggressive or out of control. That requires helping them learn how to recognize their emotions and what those emotions feel like in their body (racing heartbeat, getting teary, clenching fists).&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The school teaches students about self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationship skills and decision-making. It uses its own curriculum based on tools from&lt;a href=\&quot;https://casel.org/about-2/\&quot;&gt; The Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning&lt;/a&gt; and a curriculum for sixth graders bought by the district after a series of&lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/2018/04/04/were-racking-our-brains-a-series-of-teen-suicides-has-left-the-herriman-high-school-community-searching-for-answers/\&quot;&gt; suicides at Herriman High School in 2018&lt;/a&gt;.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;At the beginning of the year, first graders who visited would come in missing their moms, Packer said. Through the lessons on emotions, they now come in saying, “I’m stressed out about math or Chinese [the school includes Chinese immersion] or whatever it is and that is making me miss mom and I need help,” Packer says. “That is amazing that first graders can identify the transfer of emotion.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Asking questions to support positive discipline&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;header&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Sixth grade teacher Cindi Dunford never would have gotten to the heart of why a student was causing disruptions in her class if she had reacted in the standard way and asked him to stop it or else go to the office. Instead, she pulled him aside and tried the positive discipline skills she is now teaching others to use at Granite Park Junior High in South Salt Lake.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Dunford pointed out to the student that he seemed distracted and anxious and asked what he could do to help himself focus. He acknowledged he missed his mother, who was working double shifts at the time, so he never got to see her. Using “results-based coaching,” Dunford asked him what he could do about it. Empowered to find a solution, he decided to call his mother at lunch each day.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“Students are trying to communicate to us through their behavior,” she says. “There are ways we can communicate back to them that are more effective than rewards and punishments. … I wanted to have a better approach that’s more respectful to my students and their differences.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;With help with her colleagues, Dunford earned a grant from United Way of Salt Lake to implement her ideas, which use methods in the books “&lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Escalate-Calm-Angry-Person-Seconds/dp/1582706557\&quot; target=_blank&gt;De-Escalate: How to Calm an Angry Person in 90 Seconds or Less&lt;/a&gt;” by Douglas E. Noll and “&lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/220225/positive-discipline-in-the-classroom-by-jane-nelsen-edd-lynn-lott-ma-and-h-stephen-glenn/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;Positive Discipline in the Classroom&lt;/a&gt;” by Jane Nelsen, Lynn Lott and H. Stephen Glenn. They’re offering book studies and workshops for some teachers and counselors at her Granite District school in this pilot year.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Already the program is contributing to a plummet in the number of major problems referred to the principal’s office, from 901 to 237 in the first semester. That’s occurred as the number of students attending in person has remained the same as last year, because sixth grade was added to the school.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Dunford said rewards and punishments can work in the short term to get students to complete tasks. But they aren’t the best way to build the intrinsic motivation that drives students to want to learn.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;She tries to find the why behind such problems as seeking attention or avoiding work, while giving students the language to label their feelings and the tools to fix their behavior. Recognizing different perspectives is important in a school like hers, where a large number of immigrants and refugees attend, she said.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;For example, one student who was suspended for fighting explained he came from a culture where disagreements were handled with fights, and then the quarreling students were able to move on.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“This approach can address equity issues,” Dunford says. “If we’re looking at each child as an individual with their own private logic about why they’re doing this, it will make it easier for us to differentiate their instruction to meet those needs no matter who they are.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Using Second Step curriculum&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;header&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;When children on the playground at Midvalley Elementary School in Midvale disagree about whether a ball went out of bounds, they don’t fight or seek a recess aide for help. They play roshambo, (another name for rock, paper, scissors) and get back to the game, knowing that “being friends is more important than being right,” says Principal Tamra Baker.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;And when a first grader recently was hurt by something a classmate said, she and her friends formed a circle to work through their feelings. “The brilliance of it is they don’t go back to it,” Baker adds. “They’ve healed the relationship.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The peaceful negotiations are the result of a variety of measures taken by the Canyons School District to boost social emotional learning. They include circle time/morning meetings to check in with each student as a group, along with the &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.secondstep.org/what-is-second-step\&quot; target=_blank&gt;national Second Step curriculum&lt;/a&gt; developed by the nonprofit Committee for Children in Seattle, which the district will have implemented in all elementary and middle schools by next year. A high school curriculum is in the works, too.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Second Step also is used by the Murray, Jordan and Salt Lake City school districts, and the program provides weekly lessons to teach skills for learning empathy, problem-solving and emotional regulation.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Midvalley Elementary has used Second Step for four years. The school tackles a concept each month, with whole-school assemblies to bring all students on board. The school recently finished lessons on emotion management, helping kids name their feelings and find ways to calm down, like belly breathing.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Teachers often include the month’s concept in their morning meetings, where every student is greeted by name and each has a chance to share what’s going on in their lives, from being upset that a cat died to being super excited about a new baby brother, says BJ Weller, director of the district’s responsive services.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;He says students who can express those emotions early in the day are able to focus on school and learning. The curriculum includes catchy songs explaining big concepts like empathy and compassion that students hum in the halls, Baker says.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“One of the keys to having a healthy school is having healthy relationships,” she says. “Second Step excels at teaching kids the skills they need to build relationships with peers and with adults.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Trying telehealth&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;header&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The pandemic has exacerbated anxiety and depression among some children and teens, who can feel lonely and confused about what’s happening. That’s why the Salt Lake City School District expanded its partnership with Odyssey House to offer telehealth therapy to all students.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The web-based therapy sessions started in the summer and have continued through the school year, for the state’s only district in which &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/education/2020/07/30/salt-lake-city-schools/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;all of the students were attending school online&lt;/a&gt; before &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/education/2021/01/25/elementary-students-are/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;a shift began in January&lt;/a&gt;. But even as students return to the classroom, telehealth is expected to remain an option for those who prefer the convenience, removing another barrier to accessing mental health care.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Grants allowed Odyssey to hire four mental health professionals to build on the services provided by counselors and social workers who work at every city school. Odyssey staffers have met virtually with 77 students in 17 of the city schools.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Cami Clark, Odyssey’s director of youth services, says students whose parents have sought treatment may be depressed, anxious or angry. Even though counselors aren’t able to meet in person, they are establishing strong relationships online to help struggling students.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“They get very creative as far as engaging even 6- and 7-year-olds,” she said, with therapists asking parents to have art supplies at the ready for them to do “expressive therapy” online.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Stacey Lindsay, district counselor specialist, said staffers are being asked to watch for students who may be struggling and need additional help as they return to the classroom after almost a year of remote learning.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“I would describe the pandemic as a traumatic event in all of our lives. There’s been some loss whether you’ve lost a parent or lost some freedoms or your ability to predict what’s coming next,” she said. “If you’re not putting in these supports to help kids feel safe, feel calm, feel supported and connected, then their learning is really impacted.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The Jordan District also offers telehealth counseling. And school counselors have been trained in BRISC, or brief intervention strategy for school clinicians, to offer four to six intensive evidence-based counseling sessions. If students need additional help, the district refers them to counselors in the community for up to eight sessions paid by the district through a state grant. If parents can’t afford more, the district will pay for up to eight more sessions.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“School counselors are making referrals on a daily basis,” says Stacee Worthen, Jordan’s secondary counselor specialist.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The district’s 100 counselors have logged more than 17,000 meetings with students for mental health, on track to surpass the nearly 28,000 visits last school year. Worthen attributes the growth to the ways the pandemic has upended teens’ lives, from whether or not their school is closed or they are in quarantine, to how their traditional outlets like sports and extracurriculars have been canceled or altered.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Add political unrest and “there is a lot of uncertainty. Helping them to be resilient and giving them solid coping skills is dependent on the adults in the building,” she says. “There are some studies that show outside of parents, your school counselor is the person those kids are going to talk to about some of those issues.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Adding mindful movement&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;header&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;When the Davis School District decided to implement social emotional learning, it focused first on adults, knowing that it needed to help staffers — from educators to secretaries to bus drivers — work on self-care, because their jobs are so demanding. Plus, adults who can prioritize their own health and well-being are better able to help their students.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The district implemented Pure Edge, training staffers how to use breath and movement to calm their minds and focus their attention. The timing couldn’t have been better — before the pandemic hit and stress skyrocketed, says Chronister, whose goal is to make social emotional learning “something we do everyday, all day … to develop a culture and climate that is respectful and inclusive and creates the best learning environment for our students.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Students can be given a “mindful minute” at the start of the school day to check in with themselves, mindful breathing exercises to settle as they transition between classes, and a brain break during longer lessons or before a test.

Remarkably, we invented, tested, began manufacturing and distributing multiple very safe and effective coronavirus vaccines in under 12 months. It is wildly impressive that we did this. Yay, science!&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;But that speed also means that my articles from recent weeks need a bit of an update, because we’re learning so much so fast. In particular, I’ve written about three topics that I wanted to share the latest info about:&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;• How quickly will &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/2021/02/05/when-should-all-utah/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;vaccine manufacturing ramp up&lt;/a&gt; and when can you get one?&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;• What impact will the &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/2020/12/27/what-you-should-know/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;new coronavirus variants&lt;/a&gt; have on the pandemic?&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;• How much &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/2021/01/14/can-vaccinated-people/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;can you still spread COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; even if you’ve been vaccinated?&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Let’s dive in.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Vaccine distribution&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;header&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;To recap, I created some models to help identify when the general public in Utah may get the vaccine and I was able to narrow it down to somewhere between early April to mid-June depending on how optimistic we wanted to get.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;On this front, I have mostly good news to report.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;First, we’ve been able to distribute more of the coronavirus vaccine more quickly than I expected. In particular, Utah being able to get back unused vaccine from a few pharmacies added thousands of extra doses I didn’t account for, and some second doses that we were holding back earlier in the pandemic went in arms instead.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The result is that we are vaccinating more people sooner. Last week, &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/health/2021/02/14/utah-reaches-vaccinations/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;we were able to use 100,000 doses&lt;/a&gt;, whereas my earlier models didn’t have that happening until next week. Instead, next week, Utah is slated to receive about 108,000 doses from the federal government.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Getting shots in 100,000 arms so soon does mean that those people will need second doses more quickly than expected, so expanding availability will be key.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;And in this arena, the news is a little more wishy-washy. The good news is that Moderna announced it would deliver 100 million doses by the end of March and 100 million more by the end of May to the federal government, matching Pfizer’s accelerated timeline. These companies are exceeding their delivery contracts, which means they should meet the pace of &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/2021/02/05/when-should-all-utah/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;my most optimistic model&lt;/a&gt; and Gov. Spencer Cox’s optimistic projections.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;On the other hand, the Johnson and Johnson vaccine will &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/17/world/only-a-few-million-johnson-johnson-doses-will-be-ready-when-the-vaccine-is-likely-to-be-authorized-the-white-house-says.html\&quot; target=_blank&gt;only have a few million vaccines manufactured&lt;/a&gt; and ready to go when the federal government gives the company the go ahead, which should happen in the next couple of weeks. That authorization is a bit delayed; the company would need to pump out a few million vaccines &lt;i&gt;per week&lt;/i&gt; in order to meet Cox’s announced projections of 33,000 J&amp;amp;J doses per week to Utahns by the end of February. My “average” model, which projected 50% of that number, might be more accurate with regards to this vaccine.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Still, with the overall good news, we’ve been able to open up vaccine availability to more groups, sooner. Cox even announced Thursday that &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2021/02/18/watch-live-utah-gov/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;appointments would be immediately available for those between 65 and 69&lt;/a&gt;, about 10 days before they were originally slated to open March 1. On that date, any adult of any age with&lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2021/02/04/watch-live-utah-gov/\&quot; target=_blank&gt; a qualifying preexisting condition &lt;/a&gt;will be able to be vaccinated.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;quote&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;After that? Well, that hasn’t been announced. Utah leaders could open it up to 55+, but I wouldn’t be surprised to see the governor just open the doors to everyone. Either way, we’re talking about realistic vaccine availability to the general public quite soon. I might bet on April for the first general public appointments, with everyone being able to schedule one in May.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Coronavirus variants&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;header&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Of course, we want to know if the vaccines will actually work on the new variants spreading among us. My original article focused on the &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/health/2021/02/14/utah-reaches-vaccinations/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;variant that started in the United Kingdom labeled B.1.1.7&lt;/a&gt;, but now we’re getting a greater understanding of all of the ways the coronavirus has mutated.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;These variants, all mutating in different people in different places, have developed some of the same changes to the coronavirus structure. Those changes — and the epidemiological record confirms this — mean that the virus benefits from mutating in these specific ways. In other words, these variants spread more quickly than what we’ll call “coronavirus classic” in a mostly unvaccinated population.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;There are two families of variants you should know about.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;• The B.1.1.7 variant is the U.K. variant. It is now spreading in the U.S. in a major way, doubling cases &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/07/health/coronavirus-variant-us-spread.html\&quot; target=_blank&gt;every 10 days&lt;/a&gt; and is &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.fox13now.com/news/coronavirus/local-coronavirus-news/third-case-of-covid-19-variant-found-in-utah\&quot; target=_blank&gt;definitely spreading&lt;/a&gt; in Utah. U.S. evidence shows it’s between 35% and 45% more likely to be spread than standard coronavirus. U.K. evidence also showed it’s &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/13/world/europe/covid-uk-variant-deadlier.html\&quot; target=_blank&gt;likely to have a higher risk of death&lt;/a&gt; than the regular virus.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The good B.1.1.7 news is that the vaccines &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/pfizer-biontech-vaccine-likely-to-be-effective-against-b117-strain-of-sars-cov-2\&quot; target=_blank&gt;still seem to work well&lt;/a&gt; against it. Effectiveness might be impacted by just a few percentage points.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;• The B.1.351 variant started in South Africa, and is pretty similar to the P.1 variant, which was discovered in Brazil. This group is more worrisome because studies showed that the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine didn’t work as well against them. In fact, South Africa stopped vaccinating people while it figured out what was going on. So far, we’ve seen B.1.351 and P.1 in a combined 12 U.S. states, but not in Utah — yet.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;But as we know, the Oxford vaccine is less effective than the two mRNA vaccines we have in the U.S. One study compared how the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines performed against the two variants in a lab.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;In the middle of each graph is a common form of coronavirus classic, while the left and right show how many antibodies were generated when the two vaccines were used against the two variants. As you can see, the U.K. variant antibodies saw a small decrease, but the South African antibodies decreased much more significantly.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Still, even these decreased antibody amounts will be more helpful than nothing. Notice the scale in the charts — antibody creation is being cut significantly, but not knocked out entirely. T-cells &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2102017\&quot; target=_blank&gt;should still be created&lt;/a&gt;, too. In other words, the vaccines we have right now still will provide some good protection against&lt;a href=\&quot;https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2021/01/27/vaccination-against-the-new-variants-real-world-data\&quot; target=_blank&gt; this variant&lt;/a&gt;.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The other cool thing about the mRNA vaccine technology is that it should be easily editable. If we want to create a version of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines that specifically target this, or any other coronavirus variant, we can just change the mRNA used while keeping the rest of the recipe the same. That wouldn’t impact the safety of the vaccine at all, so we could skip some of the lengthy trial periods.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;In the coming weeks, we’ll get a better idea if we need to do that. Studies are ongoing for the U.S. vaccines against the South African variant in more human subjects. If it’s still around 90% effective, we probably won’t have to change much. If it’s around 50%, it’s time to develop a new recipe, and might mean booster shots for the new variants would be required — similar to how we get a yearly flu shot.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Vaccines and transmissibility&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;header&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Because the vaccines were tested for their effectiveness in tamping down disease in an individual, we didn’t really know how much they would prevent the coronavirus from being spread from person to person. That meant we had to do &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/2021/01/14/can-vaccinated-people/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;some guessing with preliminary data&lt;/a&gt;.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;But now, we’re getting more evidence that transmission is significantly down among the vaccinated. What’s going on in Israel is perhaps the best example: over half of the population has been vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine, and that country is starting to see real decreases in transmission.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Those vaccinated are in a great spot. Of the 416,900 people that Maccabi Healthcare Services in Israel had vaccinated, only 254 picked up COVID-19 after the second dose. &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/05/world/middleeast/israel-virus-vaccination.html\&quot; target=_blank&gt;All 254 cases were mild, too&lt;/a&gt;.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;But it appears that those hundreds of thousands of healthy people aren’t spreading the virus as much, either. &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/05/world/middleeast/israel-virus-vaccination.html\&quot; target=_blank&gt;Cases dropped 41% in a six-week period&lt;/a&gt;, even among the non-vaccinated.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Even better, &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/pfizers-covid-19-vaccine-reduces-viral-load-study--68439\&quot; target=_blank&gt;a new study this week&lt;/a&gt; looked at how Israelis were impacted after just the first dose, not having yet received the second. And in the 12-28 day period after getting the first dose, even those who were infected had significantly less viral load in their respiratory system, about four times less. That means they’re going to be less effective at spreading the virus.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Between this and the preliminary data that showed a 63% reduction in asymptomatic infections in Moderna’s vaccine, we have a pretty good idea now: The U.S. vaccines definitely reduce transmissibility. It’s probably not 100%, as they appear to reduce severe disease, probably not 95%, as they appear to reduce mild disease, but very likely in the 60-90% range.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;So to sum all of this up: We are getting people vaccinated quicker than originally planned, those vaccines appear to work against the variants or can be easily adjusted, and when you get vaccinated you are less likely to get someone else sick.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;This definitely counts as progress.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;i&gt;Andy Larsen is a data columnist.

It was tiny black rocks embedded in tar. For some reason, my dog saw that shiny wet black tar and decided his entire purpose in life was to run through it and leave his mark. Or more like 840 marks in the shape of paw prints. I like to imagine his doggie thought process.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;i&gt;“I’m a good boy.

It depicted a river full of alligators with a person on one side of it.

How do I get rid of the pain? Is there a way?”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;I only had two answers, and they weren’t great.

The ranking combines measures of growth in jobs, incomes, productivity and the technology sector as well as housing affordability and access to broadband.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The annual index from the California-based economic think tank ranked Utah’s capital city fourth in 2021 among its top-tier larger cities, vaulting from 25th last year, and Ogden-Clearfield came in ninth, up from 22nd.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The wider Provo-Orem metropolitan area at the heart of Utah County and spanning the state’s nexus of tech firms centered on Silicon Slopes was a standout due largely to that sector, according to analysts at the Milken Institute, both for its productivity and sheer number of high-tech industries.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The study called Provo-Orem “a relatively new innovations center” but said it offers “a high quality of life and amenities in the mountain region.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Provo Mayor Michelle Kaufusi agrees, saying that with mountains to the east and a lake to the west, Provo is a great place to live. She says it also naturally attracts innovators.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“Honestly, it’s in our heritage to be self-efficient,” said Kaufusi. “We’re all about being creative thinkers in Provo and not [being] afraid of starting and running a business.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Kaufusi said the city is lucky to be a college town that is home to Brigham Young University and close to Utah Valley University. She said the schools produce young, educated hard workers who aren’t afraid to think big.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Kaufusi said her administration has worked hard to make the city business-friendly. She said she is grateful to tech company Qualtrics and home security company Vivint, which were founded in Provo, for choosing to keep local headquarters after they became major companies.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“I’m sure they could have gone anywhere in the world to do their business ... especially as [they] got bigger,” she said of Qualtrics’ founders.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Logan placed second on the study’s list of 201 smaller cities studied, after coming in third last year. St. George finished fourth on that list, as it did in the 2020 study.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Idaho Falls, the Gem State’s second largest metropolitan area, topped the list of best-performing small cities, attributed to its high short-term job growth and solid productivity gains among that city’s high-tech firms.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The Best-Performing Cities index has been mainly built around jobs, wages and high-tech growth in past years but has been modified in light of the pandemic to add metrics on economic inclusion, the authors wrote. The yearly calculation now also takes into account the percentage of city households spending under 30% of their incomes on housing as well as household access to some form of broadband internet access.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Utah homes still more affordable&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;header&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Cities in the Intermountain West — Salt Lake City, Provo, Ogden, Boise, Phoenix, Denver and Fort Collins, Colo. — saw jobs and wage grow far above the national median, pushing them up in the rankings in 2021. And while many of those cities — including the ones in Utah — are seeing rapidly &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/2021/01/27/sizzling-wasatch-front/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;escalating home prices&lt;/a&gt;, analysts reported, their housing costs remain relatively affordable compared to other U.S. population centers.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The study said significantly lower costs have made Provo-Orem, for example, “a recipient of the tech sector’s outmigration from the expensive West Coast.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Fueled by those new patterns of telecommuting, the migration trend is also thought to be driving a recent &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/2021/02/14/so-youre-ready-go-house/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;spike in housing demand across the Wasatch Front&lt;/a&gt; and in Park City and Summit and Wasatch counties, where home prices continue to escalate and housing inventories are at or near all-time lows.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Kaufusi said her administration is planning 30 years down the road to try to retain Provo’s high standard of living, even as the state’s population grows. She said the city wants to make sure there is affordable housing, that crime stays low, that development is sustainable and that the city retain its community feeling. She said this means planning for more infrastructure and trying to increase high-density housing around transportation hubs while protecting residential neighborhoods.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“It all comes back to baby steps. We have to get the infrastructure in the ground, we have to make sure it is what the citizens want, and then we are going from there,” she said of the city’s long-term planning.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;In contrast to Utah, several California metro areas — including San Francisco, San Jose and Riverside — declined in their overall standings, dramatically in some cases, largely due to housings costs and unemployment.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“This may indicate the outsized effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on so-called ‘superstar cities’ that have suffered the most local job losses,” the study’s authors wrote, “and the migration of high-tech workers to lower-cost areas as they work from home.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Global and national forces, including the coronavirus pandemic, have also shaken many cities’ underlying economic performances over the past year, authors wrote. But the top-performing metro areas, including those in Utah, have managed to leverage what they have to remain competitive from a business perspective, “regardless of the nation’s overall economic trajectory.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“These cities combine steady growth on one hand and dynamic innovation on the other,” they wrote, “particularly through concentrated investment in high-tech sectors that generate positive spillover effects for local communities.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Utah is better positioned after the pandemic&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;header&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Salt Lake City and the Ogden-Clearfield area saw some of the highest leaps in the rankings, although Huntsville, Ala., jumped 49 places to reach this year’s 10th spot among larger cities. That, the study said, was part of a national shift upward in the rankings for cities in the South and Intermountain West.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Utah was the only state to have three cities among the top 10 highest-tier metropolitan areas.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;In addition to past performance, the index rankings also offer a glimpse of how well cities are likely to recover economically from the impacts of COVID-19. That ability to bounce back, authors wrote, “also relies on the alignment of opportunities in high-tech industries and affordable costs of living.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Cities with strong and diverse tech sectors “are more likely to demonstrate resiliency in the face of unprecedented economic upheaval” from the pandemic, the institute said. But at the same time, cities will also benefit in their COVID-19 recoveries from greater levels of economic inclusion by offering “a foundation that attracts additional firms and workers — particularly those prioritizing quality of life.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;i&gt;— Tribune reporter Sara Tabin contributed to this story.&lt;/i&gt;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;}],&quot;credits&quot;:{&quot;by&quot;:[{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;tsemerad&quot;,&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/sltrib/e923835e-e096-4fe7-bd87-ea31d9322b96.png&quot;},&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Tony Semerad&quot;}]},&quot;display_date&quot;:&quot;2021-02-19T03:01:57.889Z&quot;,&quot;headlines&quot;:{&quot;basic&quot;:&quot;Provo-Orem, Salt Lake City, Ogden, Logan, St. George all rank among best-performing cities&quot;},&quot;last_updated_date&quot;:&quot;2021-02-19T12:50:02.529Z&quot;,&quot;promo_items&quot;:{&quot;basic&quot;:{&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;(Francisco Kjolseth  |  Tribune file photo) Traffic moves along Center Street in Provo on Monday, as seen April 6, 2020.

But he said behind-the-scenes discussions are ongoing.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“We’ll do those privately, and when the final version of that bill comes out, we’ll let you know whether we support it or not,” he told reporters during his monthly news conference in the studios of PBS Utah at the University of Utah. “I think that’s the better way to negotiate these and so we will continue to do that.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Cox had declined to say anything publicly about the bill until Thursday.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2021/02/16/lawmakers-take-aim/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;Utah legislative leaders unveiled the bill sponsored by Senate Majority Leader Evan Vickers on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;, and it has so far attracted support from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. Backers say the state’s current emergency powers law, enacted in the 1950s, is not designed to grapple with long-term events like the COVID-19 pandemic.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The bill would make a number of significant changes to the handling of long-term crises, including limiting how long an emergency declaration remains in effect and granting authority to the Legislature to override those declarations.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Emergency orders could be extended beyond 30 days by the Legislature, but they must have a definite end date. If the emergency order was terminated by lawmakers, it could not be reinstated by public health departments.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Under the bill, a county legislative body — either a commission or council — also would be empowered to end a public health emergency declared by a local health department earlier than 30 days. And the bill would cap fines for individuals violating public health orders at $150, down from up to $10,000 currently.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Additionally, the bill says religious services can not be subject to more restrictive requirements than applied to other organizations or businesses. &quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“The one thing that you need to realize is that all the powers that are being exercised by the governor and executive branch or the health department during a long-term emergency are legislative powers,” Vickers told reporters earlier in the week. “And so it’s appropriate that we would have some oversight over those powers.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Sen. Luz Escamilla, D-Salt Lake City and the Democratic whip in the Senate, also endorsed the concept of the bill, noting that she sees the proposal as moving decision-making to people who can be held accountable by the voters.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Pressed specifically on the 30-day requirement in the bill, Cox indicated that the timeframe is one of the items that remains under discussion.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“Whether 30 days is the right number or 60 days is the right number, there is a number in there and we’ll continue to work to figure out which is the right one,” he said.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Most states have some sort of check on executive emergency powers, according to &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.ncsl.org/research/about-state-legislatures/legislative-oversight-of-executive-orders.aspx\&quot;&gt;a roundup by the National Conference of State Legislatures&lt;/a&gt;. It summarizes Utah’s by saying that the governor cannot extend an emergency declaration beyond 30 days without a resolution by the Legislature, but that hasn’t precluded the executive from doing so by issuing new orders.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The bipartisan group also said that legislatures in at least 37 states are considering bills or resolutions that would limit governors’ powers or executive spending during the COVID-19 pandemic or other emergencies.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Cox told reporters that he recognized and respected the ability of the Legislature to make changes to the emergency powers act and agrees that it did not contemplate long-term emergencies like a pandemic. But he noted that the executive branch has the the ability to move more quickly in a crisis than the legislative branch can and indicated that he’s urged lawmakers “to not overreact to something that happens every 100 years.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“There’s nothing quick about what happens in the Legislature, although we do have a 45-day session and a lot happens in 45 days,” he said. “Some — like me — argue that too much happens within those 45 days but it’s a very, very important function and it is their function.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Cox also said Thursday that he recognizes there were mistakes in the way the executive branch interfaced with the legislative branch in the early days of the pandemic and said he has tried to remedy those communication gaps as governor, including with more face-to-face conversations.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;But while he committed to working with the Legislature on the bill moving forward, Cox also took aim at its leaders during his comments, arguing that they could have done more to address the threat of the coronavirus.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“I will remind the Legislature that they now have the ability to call themselves into session at any time and overrule any order that has been done from the very beginning,” he said. “They have that authority now. They don’t need a bill to change that. And I will also note that they failed to exercise that authority at almost every turn because they didn’t want to make these decisions either.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The Senate Government Operations and Political Subdivisions Committee endorsed SB195 on &lt;a href=\&quot;https://le.utah.gov/mtgvotes.jsp?voteid=19869\&quot; target=_blank&gt;a 6-0 bipartisan vote Thursday&lt;/a&gt;.

The date of availability for those with certain underlying conditions will remain the first of next month, as previously announced.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“We will ask for your continued patience as this will flood phone lines and servers and more and more people will be trying to sign up as those slots become available,” Cox said Thursday during a monthly news conference with PBS Utah Thursday morning. “If you can’t find an appointment immediately, keep trying and you will get your turn.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Even before the governor finished speaking, the Salt Lake County Health Department website took down its warning that only those 70 and older could schedule an appointment, and opened up registration on a sliding scale over the next few days.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;oembed_response&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The department said in a tweet that it would allow those 69 and older to begin registering at 6 p.m. Thursday, those 68 and older at 6 p.m. Friday, and so on in one-year increments until registration was fully opened to those 65 and older at 6 p.m. Monday.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The details and appointment signup are available at the county’s website at &lt;a href=\&quot;https://slco.org/health/COVID-19/vaccine/seniors/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;https://slco.org/health/COVID-19/vaccine/seniors/&lt;/a&gt;. The county also offers an appointment phone line at 385-468-7468, which is staffed 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Saturday.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;In Utah County, the second most populous in the state after Salt Lake, the health department said appointment registration was immediately opening up to those 65 and older.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;oembed_response&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The Utah County Health Department warned that appointment slots “will fill up quickly.” It suggested texting the message “UCHEALTH” to 888777 to be notified about new slots opening. It also provided a hotline help number at 801-851-4357, operated from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday-Friday.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Davis County also said it would begin scheduling appointments right away for those 65 and over.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;oembed_response&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“Davis County residents can make appointments now! (Yes, you can schedule for this afternoon!),” the department said in a tweet.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;It encouraged residents to use online registration at its website, &lt;a href=\&quot;https://webportal.daviscountyutah.gov/App/CovidPublic/home\&quot; target=_blank&gt;https://webportal.daviscountyutah.gov/App/CovidPublic/home&lt;/a&gt;, but also said people needing help could call 801-525-4900.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Cox said he anticipates those 65 and older and Utahns with certain underlying conditions — which together comprise about 400,000 people — could be vaccinated by mid-to-late March, after which point he said the state plans to open up distribution to those 55 and up.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Additionally, he said, state leaders are “working with the experts at the health department to layer in the rest of the co-morbidities, those underlying health conditions that aren’t as serious as this first wave but are still serious,” he said. “We’re doing a complete risk assessment — so we really are looking at risk of death and hospitalization — and that’s how we’re making these decisions.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;quote&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;With the anticipated number of vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna expected to increase in the coming months, and if the single-dose Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine gets authorization soon, Cox said he anticipates that “every adult who wants a vaccine should be eligible for a vaccine” sometime in April or May.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;That’s even as President Joe Biden this week gave a slower timeline, saying &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/02/16/live-updates-biden-seeks-return-attention-combating-coronavirus-with-televised-town-hall/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;during a town hall that every American who wants a coronavirus vaccine will have access to one by the end of July. &lt;/a&gt;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Asked whether Utah’s projections were too optimistic, Cox said he’s noticed that the Biden administration likes to “underpromise and overdeliver” on the coronavirus response and that the state is working off the hard data it’s been given from the federal government to form timelines.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“This week in our meeting with the Biden administration, they were talking about the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine as if it will receive its approval and that they were still on course for their manufacturing deadlines,” he said. “So we’ll revise [our projections] as they come. That’s what we’ve done from the very beginning. But we’re also far ahead of the projections that were given in December and even into January. We feel very confident about that.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Vaccine rollout could be slowed, Cox noted, if something happens in the production cycle or the delivery cycle, as happened this week when a St. George shipment was delayed because of severe weather conditions across the Midwest. Those doses should be coming to the state “very quickly,” he said.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;As the state has so far gotten 563,608 doses of the vaccine into arms (a number that includes first and second doses), Cox noted that case counts, the percent positivity rate of COVID-19 tests, and hospitalizations are all decreasing, which is “very good news for our state.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Along with those changes, he said six counties have moved from a high transmission index to a moderate transmission index. That puts eight counties in the moderate level and five counties in the low transmission level.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;But Cox encouraged people not to throw caution to the wind as cases decline and to continue taking safety precautions even in those lower-transmission areas as research shows the presence of more contagious variants in the United States.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“If [state epidemiologist] Dr. [Angela] Dunn were here today, she would tell you and she would have me tell you that it is not a good time to let up on the things that keep us safe and protect us, that will continue to drive down those rates and hospitalizations and deaths, including especially mask wearing,” Cox said.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;He also encouraged people to continue to get tested so they can isolate and avoid spreading the virus if they have it.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;More information&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;header&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The grocery store pharmacies that have been authorized to give COVID-19 vaccinations posted on their websites Thursday that all available appointments this week had been filled. But they suggested checking back at 9 a.m. Monday to see if new appointment slots had been opened up.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;You can find the information and online registration at these stores: &lt;a href=\&quot;https://vaccines.dansfoods.com/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;Dan’s&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\&quot;https://vaccines.dicksmarket.com/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;Dick’s&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.harmonsgrocery.com/covid-vaccine-update/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;Harmons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\&quot;https://vaccines.freshmarketstores.com/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;Fresh Market&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\&quot;https://vaccines.maceys.com/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;Maceys&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.smithsfoodanddrug.com/rx/guest/get-vaccinated\&quot; target=_blank&gt;Smiths&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.walmart.com/cp/1228302\&quot; target=_blank&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.

But, if the emergency is to extend beyond that, then the Legislature gets involved.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“When we look at the emergency declaration, that’s really about giving legislative powers to the executive branch,” says House Assistant Majority Whip Val Peterson, R-Orem. “Which of those powers do we want to give to the executive branch and do it in such a way that we don’t hamstring them at all, so they still have the ability to respond to any emergency they might encounter.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“For the first 30 days, the governor has pretty much open rein to do what he needs to do now. The same with the state health department or local health departments,” says Senate Majority Leader Evan Vickers, R-Cedar City. “From that point on, we are trying to get the involvement of the Legislature and the public in the process.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;An emergency order could last beyond 30 days only if the Legislature approved the extension. It could not simply be extended by the governor. In fact, the proposal would block the governor from extending an emergency unilaterally. Lawmakers also would have the authority to override any emergency declaration by a majority vote, and the emergency could not then be reinstated by public health departments.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Vickers’ bill would create a new legislative committee with the power to review any requests to extend an emergency declaration beyond the initial 30-day period. If extending the emergency was a no-brainer, then there wouldn’t be much the committee needed to do and the Legislature could move forward with little delay.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“But, if they do need to meet, then they are required to take public input,” said Vickers, who noted there really wasn’t a way for the public to weigh in on the issue under the current law.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“They were weighing in on social media, but that’s not a very efficient way to weigh in with lawmakers,” he noted.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;At the local level, county legislative bodies — commissions and councils — would have power to overturn a local emergency declaration by an executive or local health department, and would make a decision whether such an order could be extended beyond the initial 30 days.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Legislative leaders have been careful to not criticize former Gov. Gary Herbert who was responsible for responding to the early days of the pandemic, including stay-at-home orders, noting that he was making decisions based on the best data available. But, lawmakers have been eager for months to make changes to the emergency statute. Some were pushing to address the changes in a special session last year, but there simply wasn’t enough support.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Instead, lawmakers stress they’ve been taking a more deliberate approach to altering Utah’s response to emergency situations, and have been working with new Gov. Spencer Cox and his administration, specifically Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson, a former state senator.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“They’ve been working with us and helped to make some refinements that are better,” said Vickers.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Cox and Henderson issued a joint statement in response to the legislation on Wednesday, expressing support for the process.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“The Legislature has an important role to play and we believe legislators do not want to hamper the state’s ability to respond to crisis situations. We’re still working through the details, but we’re confident the Legislature will keep the best interests of Utahns at heart,” they said.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;But the political reality is if lawmakers can find enough support to pass the bill with a veto-proof majority, then objections from Cox wouldn’t be a deal killer. Vickers and other leaders have repeatedly said they are hoping the process remains a collaborative one.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The bill was set for a committee debate on Thursday.

After reporting 462 cases on Monday, the Department of Health reported 591 positive tests on Tuesday.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Webb said the state is in a “race between vaccines and variants,” adding: “We can’t go fast enough. That’s the bottom line here.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;He said it’s “hard to know” if Utah is being hit by coronavirus variants, because so little testing is being done for them. Health experts are monitoring reinfection rates and vaccine failures, which provide indirect evidence of variants, and “at least at this point, we’re not seeing strong signals that we have a dominating strain here in the state. But we’re continuing to watch really carefully.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Webb also cautioned people who have gotten their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine to continue to take precautions — to social distance and wear masks.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“We are seeing too many cases of acute COVID in people who received their first dose. … You have very little immunity for the first two weeks after receiving the first dose,” he said. The data, he added, shows that “you’re not fully immune until you’ve had the full two dose series for those MRNA vaccines. ... With the availability of these vaccines, we still need people to be vigilant even after that first dose and through the second dose series.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;b&gt;Vaccinations reported in past day/total vaccinations •&lt;/b&gt; 7,952 / 532,985.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;b&gt;Number of Utahns who have received two doses • &lt;/b&gt;164,775.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;b&gt;Cases reported in past day • &lt;/b&gt;591.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;b&gt;Deaths reported in past day •&lt;/b&gt; One — a man age 85 or older in Salt Lake County.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;b&gt;Hospitalizations reported in past day • &lt;/b&gt;272.

Emergency orders could be extended beyond 30 days by the Legislature, but they must have a definite end date. If the emergency order is terminated by lawmakers, it could not be reinstated by public health departments.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;A county legislative body also would be empowered to end a public health emergency declared by a local health department earlier than 30 days. And the bill would cap fines for individuals violating public health orders at $150, down from up to $10,000 currently.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;A health authority could ask to extend a public health emergency declaration beyond 30 days under the bill, so long as it provides written notice to the Senate President and Speaker of the House.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Asked by reporters whether the bill would limit the role of public health leaders in a pandemic, Adams said that could be a “matter of perspective” but noted that their existing powers would remain in place during the first 30 days of such an emergency. Afterward, their input would continue, but in an advisory capacity.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“We have many people in the state that give us advice,” he said, pointing to the example of “the Department of Transportation; they recommend speed limits — we set them.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Sen. Luz Escamilla, D-Salt Lake City, also dismissed those concerns, noting that she sees the proposal as moving decision-making to people who can be held accountable by the voters.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Vickers’ proposal would also restrict the governor from taking executive action in response to a long-term emergency, unless he or she informs a newly-created legislative “emergency response committee” at least 24 hours beforehand. That committee could approve or nix an extension of a public health emergency declaration.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“This bill says if an emergency is going to last more than 30 days, the Legislature needs to be consulted and decide whether or not the state of emergency should remain,” says House Speaker Brad Wilson, R-Kaysville&lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The proposed legislative committee would be made up of the current members of the Executive Appropriations Committee, plus other members appointed by the House speaker and Senate president.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Lawmakers have been frustrated with the length and scope of the coronavirus emergency, but have been unable to find a legislative solution. This proposal comes out of discussions between legislative leaders and the governor’s office, which did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. A spokesperson for Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall said she was not prepared to take a position on the just-released legislation.

His company, Prestige Ameritech, can churn out 1 million masks every four days, but he doesn’t have orders for nearly that many. So he recently got approval from the government to export them.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“I’m drowning in these respirators,” Bowen said.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;On the same day 1000 miles north, Mary Turner, a COVID-19 intensive care nurse at a hospital outside Minneapolis, strapped on the one disposable N-95 respirator allotted for her entire shift.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Before &lt;a href=\&quot;https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-pandemic\&quot;&gt;the coronavirus pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, Turner would have thrown out her mask and grabbed a new one after each patient to prevent the spread of disease. But on this day, she’ll wear that mask from one infected person to the next because N95s — they filter out 95% of infectious particles — have supposedly been &lt;a href=\&quot;https://apnews.com/article/automated-insights-earnings-virus-outbreak-pandemics-1295eae6f73d1870a23cb8e2cb66ad05\&quot;&gt;in short supply&lt;/a&gt; since last March.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Turner’s employer, North Memorial Health, said in a statement that supplies have stabilized, but the company is still limiting use because “we must remain mindful of that supply” to ensure everyone’s safety.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;One year into the COVID-19 pandemic, many millions of N95 masks are pouring out of American factories and heading into storage. Yet doctors and nurses like Turner say there still aren’t nearly enough in the “ICU rooms with high-flow oxygen and COVID germs all over.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;While supply and demand issues surrounding N95 respirators are well-documented, until now the reasons for this discrepancy have been unclear.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The logistical breakdown is rooted in federal failures over the past year to coordinate supply chains and provide hospitals with clear rules about how to manage their medical equipment.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Internal government emails obtained by The Associated Press show there were deliberate decisions to withhold vital information about new mask manufacturers and availability. Exclusive trade data and interviews with manufacturers, hospital procurement officials and frontline medical workers reveal a communication breakdown — not an actual shortage — that is depriving doctors, nurses, paramedics and other people risking exposure to COVID-19 of first-rate protection.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Before the pandemic, medical providers followed manufacturer and government guidelines that called for N95s to be discarded after each use, largely to protect doctors and nurses from catching infectious diseases themselves. As N95s ran short, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention modified those guidelines to allow for extended use and reuse only if supplies are “depleted,” a term left undefined.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Hospitals have responded in a variety of ways, the AP has found. Some are back to pre-COVID-19, one-use-per-patient N95 protocols, but most are doling out one mask a day or fewer to each employee. Many hospital procurement officers say they are relying on CDC guidelines for depleted supplies, even if their own stockpiles are robust.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Chester “Trey” Moeller, a political appointee who served as the CDC’s deputy chief of staff until President Joe Biden’s inauguration last month, said efforts to increase U.S. mask production were successful, but there has since been a federal breakdown in connecting those who need them with this new supply.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“We are forcing our health care industry to reuse sanitized N95s or even worse, wear one N95 all day long,” he said.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Before the pandemic tore through the U.S., the demand for N95 masks was 1.7 billion per year, with 80% going to industrial uses and 20% into medical, trade groups say. In 2021, demand for N95 masks for medical use is estimated by industry sources to be 5.7 billion.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;With the increased demand and prodding from the federal government, U.S. manufacturers stepped in. Bowen’s company, Prestige Ameritech, boosted production from 75,000 N95 respirators a month to almost 10 million during the COVID-19 pandemic.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Still, many hospitals are building their stockpiles over fears of a future surge, and restricting the number given directly to health care workers.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The AP spoke with a dozen procurement officers who buy supplies for more than 300 hospitals across the U.S. All said they have enough N95s now, between two and 12 months worth, sitting in storage.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Even so, all but two of those hospital systems are limiting their doctors, nurses and other workers to one mask per day, or even one per week. Some say they are waiting for the supply to grow even more, while others say they never plan to go back to pre-COVID-19 usage.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Dean Weber, vice president of corporate supply chain management for Sioux Falls, South Dakota, Sanford Health, said the one-N95-per-patient guidelines were established with the help of manufacturers.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“You know, the mask manufacturers are in the business of selling masks,” Weber said. He said he prioritizes safety over cost, but he doesn’t believe these respirators need to be tossed after each use. “We were all, in fact, you know, just infatuated with an N95.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;But John Wright, vice president of supply chains for Salt Lake City-based Intermountain Healthcare, says reusing masks or wearing them longer “would not be appropriate” once they have enough supplies. He hopes his 23 hospitals and hundreds of clinics will be back to single use within two weeks.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;As the coronavirus spread through spring and summer, demand for N95 masks surged to unprecedented levels and the respirators disappeared from stockpiles and distributors’ shelves. Hospitals and distributors looked overseas to fill the need.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;In March 2020, just six shipping containers arrived in the U.S. with N95s in them, and almost all of those masks were for industrial use, not medical. By September 2020, orders had soared — in one month, almost 3,000 shipping containers of N95s arrived at U.S. ports, almost entirely medical-grade.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Federal officials saw the reliance on imports as a security problem and worked to boost domestic supply, The federal agency that oversees N95 manufacturers, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, approved 94 new brands, including 19 new domestic manufacturers, according to the internal government emails.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Over the fall and winter, those domestic producers hired thousands of employees and invested millions in supplies to churn out masks,&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;As U.S. production rose through the fall and winter, imports plunged. Shipment data maintained by ImportGenius and Panjiva Inc., services that independently track global trade, shows arrivals dropped sharply to about 150 in January 2021.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;In Shanghai, Cameron Johnson, a trade consultant at the Tidalwave Solutions recruitment firm and an adjunct business faculty member at New York University, says “the bottom has fallen out of the mask market.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;But the U.S. government failed to help link buyers to the growing supplies. Now some of those U.S.-based makers are facing major financial losses, potential layoffs and bankruptcies.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;In December, Moeller, an appointee of President Donald Trump, grew frustrated while working in the office of CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“(NIOSH) had approved almost 20 U.S. manufacturers to make N95 masks, but had not published any guidance or notice of what is ultimately more than 100 million N95 mask-making capacity a month going unsold,” Moeller told the AP.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The Food and Drug Administration was monitoring N95 supply chains, and received $80 million in emergency pandemic funds “to prevent, prepare for and respond to coronavirus.” Of that amount, about $38 million was for efforts related to tracking medical product shortages.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;But the agency has still not solved the problem. “There have been a good number of new NIOSH (mask) approvals that have been granted,” said Suzanne Schwartz, director of the FDA’s Office of Strategic Partnerships &amp;amp; Technology Innovation. “Yet the access to those new manufacturers, there seems to be a hurdle there. FDA ... is trying to identify that blockage.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Schwartz said the agency is working with President Joe Biden’s pandemic response team and the health care industry to find answers.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The internal emails show that Moeller in December alerted NIOSH head Dr. John Howard about the unused U.S. N95 manufacturing capacity.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;In a Dec. 22 email, Howard acknowledged he was still hearing of shortages: “Apparently, there is a significant domestic production capacity going unused for the lack of orders and we have tried to address this supplier/purchaser disconnect.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;A few weeks later, as a suggested remedy, Howard said the list of domestic N95 manufacturers had now been published for potential buyers. But the list shows up on page 3 of an obscure newsletter published by a University of Cincinnati toxicologist, after a satirical column on “chin warmers,” or improperly worn surgical masks.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;NIOSH was not actively promoting the new mask producers, Howard wrote, saying that “to avoid the perception of inequitable treatment and because of the dynamic production landscape, we have not posted information on our website regarding respirator availability.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Howard, through an agency spokesperson, declined a request for an interview. In a statement, NIOSH also acknowledged “a supply and demand disconnect” exists and said it is working with FEMA and other federal agencies, as well as online sales platforms like &lt;a href=\&quot;http://amazon.com/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;Amazon.com&lt;/a&gt; Inc., to better connect purchasers with U.S.-made mask producers.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“How could this be happening? You have an obvious need, and you have a tremendous engine of supply,” said Tony Uphoff, president and CEO of Thomas, an online platform for product sourcing. Uphoff said that for decades the N95 market was stable, so when the virus upended the supply chain, procurement officers were unprepared to respond.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Meanwhile, the U.S. finds itself in a paradox. The more N95s are rationed to alleviate a perceived shortage, the fewer masks are actually reaching the front lines.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;N95s still appear on the FDA shortage list, in part because of reports from doctors and nurses who say they still don’t have enough. The American Hospital Association also says there’s a scarcity of N95s, citing global demand. But the government shortage list triggers distributors to limit how many masks they can sell to each hospital.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“The concept is similar to when trading is halted on Wall Street,” said David Hargraves, senior vice president of supply chain for Premier, a group purchasing organization that helps buy equipment and supplies for thousands of hospitals across the U.S. “You put the protective allocation in place to prevent folks from hoarding and overbuying, therefore exacerbating the shortage situation.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;But without clear guidance, hospitals are left to make their own decisions.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Some procurement officers are loath to trust masks from unfamiliar suppliers. Others balk at federally approved domestic manufacturers, some of whom charge more than international makers. And adding new products into a hospital’s inventory can be tricky: Every health care worker must be fit-tested before using a new brand.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“It’s not easy to pivot from one brand to another,” said Katie Dean, health care supply chain director at Stanford Health Care in California, where they are back to using one N95 mask per patient, as needed.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Dr. Robert Hancock, an emergency room doctor and president of the Texas College of Emergency Physicians, said hospitals are taking risks by continuing to ration N95s, even when they have enough. He said some doctors tell him they get one N95 mask every five to seven days.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“All the N95s currently out there were designed to be worn once. They were never designed to be reused,” Hancock said. “Hospitals are going to have to come up with some hard data to back up that a mask built for single use is OK to use repeatedly if there are other masks available. It was one thing when we had no choice. But you can’t just say something works because it favors you financially.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;i&gt;AP Medical Writer Linda A.

But it faced intense pushback from the state for doing so. Administrators and school board members eventually &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/education/2021/01/20/salt-lake-city-school/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;came to an agreement to reopen in January, under a staggered schedule, &lt;/a&gt;to align with when school staff would get immunized.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;And it has defended that decision, noting that teachers have elected to get the vaccines at higher rates than most other districts.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Of the 1,000 that didn’t get it through the district, Chatwin noted, too, some of them qualified to get it sooner under the state’s earlier priority groups, such as individuals over the age of 70.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/2021/01/28/heres-what-utah-doctors/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;Some also are early in a pregnancy&lt;/a&gt; and couldn’t get the vaccine immediately, so they deferred; they’ll still be given priority, as school staff, by the county health department when they are able to get the shot.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;And, Chatwin added, it’s not a requirement to get it. But the district wanted to make sure teachers had the option.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Since most schools reopened in August, there have been &lt;a href=\&quot;https://coronavirus.utah.gov/case-counts/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;31,188 cases tied to K-12 in Utah. &lt;/a&gt;Teachers have accounted for 3,298 of those.

Holker was healthy, active and had been working her tail off for months, helping to care for the coronavirus patients in her hospital.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Then, in the fall, Holker contracted COVID-19. By Nov. 5, she was admitted to the hospital and days later a tube was inserted into her trachea to help her breathe.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Her condition worsened and she was put on an ECMO — extracorporeal membrane oxygenation — machine, which is used in place of a patient’s lungs during transplant surgery but has become a last-ditch effort to keep coronavirus patients alive.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;On Dec. 6, Holker was flown to Gainesville, Fla., where, if a donor could be located, she would receive a double lung transplant.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Now here’s the good news: On Jan. 20, Holker got her transplant and is on the road to recovery — although after such an intensive surgery, it could be a long one.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The University of Florida is one of just a couple places that perform lung transplants on patients with coronavirus infections, said Dr. John Stringham, surgical director of lung transplant at the University of Utah. There have only been about 15 performed nationwide.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Stringham’s team was consulted on Holker’s case, but the hospital currently doesn’t pursue transplants with patients on ECMO, since the outcomes are so much worse. “She was really, really sick,” he said.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The typical transplant, Stringham said, begins with trying to get the recipient healthy enough for the surgery and identifying a good donor candidate. Once a donor is identified a surgical team will open the donor’s chest, inspect the lungs and, if they’re suitable for a transplant, remove them and put them on ice.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Meantime, another team prepares the recipient, opening the chest cavity and removing the lungs while the ECMO machine functions in their place. COVID-19 can complicate that process, Stringham said, because the tissue surrounding the lung can be inflamed making it harder to cut.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Once the donor lungs are in place, the windpipe and a large vein and artery are attached. When the lungs are inflated, Stringham said, they start to draw in oxygen and turn a bright pink color.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“Once that happens, hopefully you’re able to come off the cardio-pulmonary support and they’re able to breath on their own,” Stringham said. “It’s a big operation. It usually takes anywhere from six to seven or eight hours.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Recovery can take time, too. Patients are put on a cocktail of medications to suppress the immune system to keep the body from rejecting the new organs. The patients are moved off of oxygen and undergo physical therapy to strengthen the new lungs.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Holker was breathing on her own by Feb. 1, according to Holly Pike, her friend and fellow nurse, and she was moved out of the intensive care unit shortly after.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“She says she’s feeling good. It’s definitely a transition,” Pike told me. “Right now I think we’re taking it one step at a time.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Holker has been able to talk to her kids — which she hadn’t been able to do for months — and will have to stay in Florida (where she has a brother) while she continues her recovery.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“She’s just working on getting stronger, physical therapy, working on those short term goals,” Pike said. Her next goal: Get out of the hospital.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;One of the advantages Holker has going for her, Stringham said, is apart from her bout with COVID-19 she is young and healthy.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;In a recent photo, Holker is waif thin and gaunt, but sitting upright and smiling. It’s a stark contrast to the image of her from December, unconscious in a hospital bed with a tube down her throat and wired to machines with her daughter at her bedside.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“As long as things go well and she’s got a good pulmonologist, she’ll probably keep doing well and have a good, long life,” Stringham said. “She has a good chance of living many more years and having a good quality of life and being able to hike and ski and do all those things we all want to do.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Holker has traveled a remarkable road and she is luckier than some. Of the nearly 18,500 Utah health care workers who have tested positive for COVID, &lt;a href=\&quot;https://coronavirus-dashboard.utah.gov/#risk-factors\&quot;&gt;446 have been hospitalized and 16 have died&lt;/a&gt;.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;It’s a stark reminder of the sacrifices our health care workers have made during the pandemic — the grueling hours, the strain on families, the staggering emotional toll of daily death, the risk to their own well-being, and for many serious illnesses and even death. We all owe them a debt of gratitude.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Thankfully, for Holker and her friends and family, it appears there will be a happy ending.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;i&gt;Friends of Holker have set up a GoFundMe page to help pay for her children’s expenses.

Coming into the session, there was an expectation that there would be a blockbuster amount of extra cash to spend, mostly because lawmakers cut $1 billion out of this year’s budget last spring out of fears the COVID-19 pandemic could crater the state’s economy.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;That didn’t happen. Utah’s unemployment rate is currently fifth-lowest in the nation, meaning income tax revenues did not take as large of a hit as expected. Sales tax collections, too, are outdoing what fiscal analysts believed would happen due to the pandemic.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;But, there are indications the economic outlook is going to be even rosier when those revenue numbers are made public next week. Privately, legislative leaders say the economy could be growing twice as fast as those projections, and they are convinced the amount of extra revenue available to spend will be significantly higher than previously thought.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;That’s not necessarily good news for legislative budgeters as the demands for spending this year are outpacing even the most optimistic of forecasts.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“This is my ninth year in leadership doing budget negotiations, and I’ve never seen a year with this many big requests for spending,” said House Speaker Brad Wilson, R-Kaysville.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;After the revenue numbers are released, the four House and Senate chairs and co-chairs of the Executive Appropriations Committee will essentially lock themselves in a room to hammer out most of the budget. Legislative leaders will join those negotiations later to move the final pieces into place.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;One of the big pieces of the budget that is mostly decided is education funding. Usually, there’s a big push toward the end of the session for money to pay for projected student growth plus a bump in the weighted pupil unit (WPU), the basic unit of education funding in Utah. That was already allocated before the session. Leaders voted to include $400 million in new money in the base budget, which included $122 million to pay for cash bonuses to public school teachers and staffers.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;That shift is the result of Utah voters approving Amendment G in November, which opened up the constitutional earmark reserving income tax collections for public and higher education to also include programs for children and services for disabled people. In the 2020 session, Utah lawmakers agreed to automatically include increases for enrollment growth and inflation in the budget as part of a deal to win support for the constitutional amendment from the education community. The practical result is most of the big pieces of the education budget are already in place before lawmakers begin setting the overall spending plan during the session.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;There’s another big chunk of money, about $274 million, from the federal government that’s part of the COVID relief package passed last year. Legislative leaders want to make sure those dollars go toward helping students who are lagging behind because of remote learning. To that end, &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2021/01/29/lawmakers-target-m/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;legislators added language to the base budget&lt;/a&gt; making it clear that if those COVID relief dollars go toward another purpose, then their annual allocation from the State Board of Education will be reduced by an equal amount.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;That’s not to say there won’t be more spending on public education this year. The&lt;a href=\&quot;https://le.utah.gov/interim/2021/pdf/00001418.pdf\&quot;&gt; final funding priority list from the Public Education Appropriations Subcommittee&lt;/a&gt; equals more than half of all the funding currently available to the state in its entire budget. Legislative leaders believe they’ll be able to fund a big chunk of those requests, but not all of them.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;One unexpected pressure point in this year’s budget is Medicaid expansion, specifically keeping up with growing enrollment. As it stands, there’s a funding imbalance due to enrollment growth. &lt;a href=\&quot;https://le.utah.gov/interim/2021/pdf/00001427.pdf\&quot;&gt;According to projections&lt;/a&gt;, ongoing expenses will exceed revenues by $8 million in next year’s budget and $21 million in 2022. In order to fix that budget hole, the state will have to spend more than $55 million this year to fix that imbalance. But this is more than just a one-time problem.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“Spending on social services is about to outstrip education as the most expensive item on our state budget,” according to Rep. Robert Spendlove, R-Sandy, who says if it weren’t for federal funds to bolster the program, Utah’s budget would really be in trouble.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“It’s not an issue of wanting to help people or take care of people,” he says. “It’s an issue of deciding what our priorities are. Do we want to be funding education or do we want to be funding health care coverage?”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Spendlove says it’s not as simple as a binary choice, but there are only two solutions.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“As far as Medicaid and other social programs growing as a share of the budget, there are only two choices. You can cut the other budgets to pay for this, or you can increase taxes. There’s really nothing else you can do when you have these programs people rely on,” he said.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;On top of that, budgeters have to decide what infrastructure projects they want to tackle next year. &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2021/02/10/what-will-lawmakers-spend/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;There are about $500 million in funding requests for buildings&lt;/a&gt;, which includes more than $300 million in construction that was defunded last year due to budget cuts as part of the pandemic response.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;There’s also a desire to tackle hundreds of long-delayed maintenance projects at state parks, as well as adding an extra track on parts of the FrontRunner commuter rail. Budget leaders say they may use bonding to pay for some transportation projects, which will allow them to shift the expected revenue surplus elsewhere.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;}],&quot;credits&quot;:{&quot;by&quot;:[{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;bschott&quot;,&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/sltrib/d116c567-15c2-4250-914c-638eb5af4458.png&quot;},&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Bryan Schott&quot;}]},&quot;display_date&quot;:&quot;2021-02-15T13:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;headlines&quot;:{&quot;basic&quot;:&quot;Despite a rosy budget picture, lawmakers have more requests for spending than cash available&quot;},&quot;last_updated_date&quot;:&quot;2021-02-15T14:55:02.859Z&quot;,&quot;promo_items&quot;:{&quot;basic&quot;:{&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;(Rick Bowmer | AP file photo) Utah lawmakers will soon gather at the state Capitol to begin the process of setting the final budget for the next fiscal year.

He was sent to Intermountain Medical Center in Murray after testing positive at an Air Force base in California and was among only three Utahns who had the coronavirus at that time. His wife had previously tested positive and was quarantining in Japan.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;At the time, he felt “totally normal” and experienced no symptoms despite the diagnosis.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“It was puzzling to me as to why all this fuss was being made,” the 56-year-old said during a Zoom news conference Sunday, reflecting on his thoughts from a year ago.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Since Jorgensen’s diagnosis, COVID-19 has raged across the globe. &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/health/2021/02/28/utah-coronavirus-cases/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;Nearly 2,000 people have died in Utah&lt;/a&gt;, and more than 500,000 have died in the United States alone. &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/sports/jazz/2020/03/11/live-utah-jazz-take/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;Sports shut down for months worldwide&lt;/a&gt;.

People are receiving vaccines. The scientific community and the public at large know more about COVID-19 now than they did a year ago.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Jorgensen said the situation “got real” for him when his test came back positive after he initially tested negative. He thinks he caught the virus while en route back to the U.S. from Asia in a cargo plane. He said the positive, symptomatic patients were separated from the rest of the passengers by only a curtain.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“I’m sure there was a lot of transmission going on,” Jorgensen said.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Once his plane landed, Jorgensen received a test and got his diagnosis. From there, he was taken to a hospital in Fairfield, Calif., that did not have a containment area for coronavirus patients. He remembers lab technicians scurrying out of his room after drawing his blood.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;And moving Jorgensen around was like something out of an espionage movie.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“It felt very surreal — the whole experience,” Jorgensen said. “It was just the police escorts and the precautions and the ambulance and kind of the stealth way they got me into the hospital.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;There was talk of transferring to Oakland, Jorgensen said, but he suggested in passing that maybe he could go somewhere in his home state. That’s where the Intermountain Healthcare facility came in.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“That was kind of one step close to home, so I was excited,” said Jorgensen, who is from St. George.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Jorgensen said he stayed in Intermountain’s isolation unit for about seven days before taking another police-escorted ambulance ride back to his St. George home, where he quarantined for another three weeks — him sleeping in the basement, his wife upstairs.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Dr. Todd Vento, an infectious disease expert at Intermountain, recalled how quickly things changed just in the initial stages of treating Jorgensen. He kept testing positive for the virus, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told Vento that Jorgensen was no longer infectious — meaning he could leave isolation — indicating a shift in thinking on the national level.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“The lesson there is that we learn things, we have to change, we have to adjust,” Vento said. “People said not to use masks. That probably set us back quite a bit. Now we know that the data is incredible for masks, and we need to use masks and we need to accept that.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Jorgensen said the past year has been “uneventful” for him. However, he is feeling some lingering effects that could be attributed to COVID-19. He said he has been experiencing “memory fog,” as well as an eye condition his ophthalmologist believes is related to the coronavirus. While Jorgensen was asymptomatic when he had COVID-19, the number of “long-haulers” experiencing long-term symptoms after being considered “recovered” &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/2020/09/06/utah-coronavirus-patients/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;continues to grow&lt;/a&gt;.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Jorgensen said he has not yet received a coronavirus vaccine and does not know when he plans to do so. While he described himself as someone who “kind of likes to see how it plays out” when it comes to the vaccine, he imagines he will follow the advice of his doctor, who has recommended to him that he receive it.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Even though Jorgensen and his wife probably contracted COVID-19 on that 2020 cruise, he doesn’t regret going on it, he says. In fact, he is currently on vacation in Costa Rica with her in the couple’s first international venture since the pandemic reached Utah.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“Obviously, we’re not letting any fear of that stop us,” Jorgensen said. “That’s just kind of our philosophy of life.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;In Vento’s opinion, COVID-19 isn’t going away. While numbers are down in Utah, there has been a plateau across the county, which Vento said could be due to “sustained transmissions of newer strains.” But that doesn’t mean there isn’t an upside.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“For that reason, I think the reality is it’s probably here to stay,” Vento said, “but that shouldn’t be a fear-inducing statement because we have vaccines, and we even have vaccines now with the mRNA platforms that are already being modified to address new variants.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Vento used the analogy of a marathon to describe that people should not be complacent, even as the numbers of cases, hospitalizations and deaths are down generally.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“Marathons are 26 miles,” Vento said. “We’re probably somewhere in the teens, 20s, who knows? The point is you don’t stop the marathon at that point. You can’t say, ‘Now we’re going to finish the race.’ You have to keep running.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;}],&quot;credits&quot;:{&quot;by&quot;:[{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;avejar&quot;,&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/sltrib/7b5a6415-d88e-47fe-a2ec-6c567526e130.png&quot;},&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Alex Vejar&quot;}]},&quot;display_date&quot;:&quot;2021-02-28T22:14:03.716Z&quot;,&quot;headlines&quot;:{&quot;basic&quot;:&quot;One year later, Utah’s first COVID-19 patient recalls ‘surreal’ experience &quot;},&quot;last_updated_date&quot;:&quot;2021-02-28T23:29:55.016Z&quot;,&quot;promo_items&quot;:{&quot;basic&quot;:{&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;(Photo courtesy of Mark Jorgensen)  Mark Jorgensen, the first Utahn to be treated for COVID-19, takes a ride in an ambulance.

In other circumstances, people can disclose their underlying health conditions and receive the vaccine with no paperwork required, &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.dallasnews.com/news/2021/01/22/do-north-texans-have-to-prove-they-have-underlying-health-conditions-to-get-the-covid-19-vaccine/\&quot;&gt;according to the Dallas Morning News. &lt;/a&gt;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;At vaccination clinics operated by New York state, residents are required to provide proof of eligibility for underlying conditions with a doctor’s letter, medical information that shows evidence of their health condition or a signed certification, &lt;a href=\&quot;https://covid19vaccine.health.ny.gov/frequently-asked-questions-0\&quot;&gt;according to the state’s coronavirus information website. &lt;/a&gt;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;While it remains to be seen how well the honor system will be implemented here, Margaret Battin, a professor of philosophy at the University of Utah, said she wondered whether the community influence of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints could affect the success of the policy.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“The teachings of the church ... I think would tend to discourage behavior like cutting in line,” said Battin, who is also an adjunct professor&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;in the U.’s medical ethics and humanities program within the Department of Internal Medicine. “All that ‘do the right’ and ‘choose the right,’ that kind of moral teaching might well play a role in the behavior of many people in this state that might not be so true in a more heterogenous state like New York.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Hudachko said the decision was made primarily based on feedback from vaccine and health care providers that requiring paperwork would create “significant bottlenecks.” He said he hasn’t been able to make comparisons on which approach is more effective and noted that several states haven’t yet started vaccinating people with underlying health conditions.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;quote&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Equity issues?&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;header&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;While the honor system poses its own problems, Jim Tabery, an associate professor of philosophy at the U., said he thinks the vaccine rollout as planned is the “ethically appropriate way to go.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“Obviously when you’re thinking about something like this, your mind naturally goes to kind of the vaccine line jumpers or the freeloaders,” he said. “There might be some of that out there, but the question is: What system are you envisioning creating that would weed them out? And would it in fact be a better system?”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Requiring people to jump through hoops to prove they have an underlying health condition could be “terribly invasive” for people with disabilities he said, and it could also pose equity issues in gaining access to the vaccine. Individuals within hard-hit communities of color, for example, may not have access to a health care provider to obtain proof of their condition or might struggle to get work off to get an appointment.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“If you’re dealing with someone [in that situation] who’s got diabetes and you’re saying, ‘In order to get the vaccine, we also need some sort of confirmation that you have diabetes,’ you’re essentially asking them to kind of go see a health care provider that they don’t have access to,” he said. “And so most likely what you’re doing is guaranteeing someone is not going to get access to a vaccine.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Up to this point, it’s been “relatively simple” for vaccination providers to determine eligibility in Utah, Hudachko noted.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The first round of inoculations &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/2020/12/15/health-care-workers/\&quot; target=\&quot;_blank\&quot;&gt;was largely based on employment,&lt;/a&gt; and it was easy for health care workers, teachers, first responders and long-term care facility staff to prove they qualified based on pay stubs or badges. And older adults have been able to “easily provide proof of age with a government-issued ID or similar document with their birth date listed,” he said.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Even so, Salt Lake County Health Department spokesman Nicholas Rupp said there have been a few instances where people have tried to “cheat the system” and have been turned away at a vaccination site.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“Fortunately, it isn’t a widespread problem,” he said. “We’ve had more people genuinely misunderstand their eligibility, but even those aren’t widespread.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The county has not taken a position on the use of an honor system, but Rupp said the health department will follow the directions of the state and governor “and encourage people to be honest so vaccine goes first to those truly at the greatest risk of serious illness.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Vaccine chasers&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;header&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;In announcing Thursday that the vaccines would be open to people with underlying conditions immediately, rather than the March 1 date previously planned, Cox noted that those who now qualify are at the highest risk for hospitalization and death because of COVID-19.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;And he urged Utahns who aren’t eligible not to schedule appointments.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“We have so many more vaccines coming and they’re coming soon but we’re prioritizing these individuals — again based on age and these underlying comorbidities — because they are at the greatest risk of hospitalization or death,” he said. “So if you jump ahead in line, that means there is someone else who won’t get the vaccine as soon as they could have and it’s very possible that they could end up hospitalized, or even worse, dying.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Those who follow the rules “can sleep well at night by knowing you didn��t cheat the system, that you were willing to give it to those who needed it the most,” he added.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Hudachko noted that every Utahn who is 16 and older who wants one is &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2021/02/11/utah-health-officials-say/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;expected to have the opportunity to receive a vaccination by the end of May&lt;/a&gt;. People who are considering gaming the system to get their shot a few weeks early, he said, need to consider that “the person you are skipping ahead of is far more likely than you are to become seriously ill or even die if they were to become infected with COVID-19.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;As the state opens vaccines up to more people, Tabery said the most ethical thing those who aren’t eligible for one yet can do is wait their turn.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;There are legitimate questions about fairness within the vaccine rollout, he noted. But if, say, a grocery store employee felt like he or she should have been included in the latest round of inoculations, the way to deal with that is to contact state leaders to voice that concern — not for someone to take matters into their own hands.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The exception to that rule, Tabery said, is a scenario in which there are excess doses that need to be used and will go bad if they aren’t.&lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/11/17/935563377/why-does-pfizers-covid-19-vaccine-need-to-be-kept-colder-than-antarctica\&quot; target=_blank&gt; Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines must be stored at freezing temperatures&lt;/a&gt; and, once unthawed, have to be used within a certain time frame.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“If somebody were to find themselves in a situation where they just so happened to be at the hospital or at the pharmacy and the pharmacist or the nurse says, ‘Hey, we’ve got an extra dose. This is going to go to waste if you don’t use it,’ then it would be it would be wrong not to take that,” he said.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;It’s likely many people will make these ethical calculations during this phase of the state’s rollout, but Battin indicated that social stigma and disapproval of people who do cut the line will be the primary defense against that behavior.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Tabery said he anticipates there will be times where people cut the vaccine line and that those instances, when identified, will make the news.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;But he’s confident most Utahns will “play by these rules.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“I do think there’s a kind of underlying communal mentality to the state of Utah, which serves it well in situations like this,” he said. “And so I’m sure there will be line cutters. I’m sorry that they found themselves in a situation where they felt like they had to or could do that. But I think they’re certainly going to be the exception — not the rule.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;}],&quot;credits&quot;:{&quot;by&quot;:[{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;tstevens&quot;,&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/sltrib/552b549d-0874-4a30-a916-6f26498fb3e6.png&quot;},&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Taylor Stevens&quot;}]},&quot;display_date&quot;:&quot;2021-02-28T13:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;headlines&quot;:{&quot;basic&quot;:&quot;Will Utahns wait their turn in line once vaccines open up for those with underlying conditions?&quot;},&quot;last_updated_date&quot;:&quot;2021-02-28T13:00:00.913Z&quot;,&quot;promo_items&quot;:{&quot;basic&quot;:{&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;(Rick Egan | The Salt Lake Tribune)   Julyn Shepherd fills syringes for Utah County residents to get their COVID-19 vaccinations in a former Shopko store in Spanish Fork, Wednesday, Jan. 27, 2021.\r\r&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/sltrib/NEKBJFMZRFBPNFDAYJYGEK5HVE.JPG&quot;}},&quot;publish_date&quot;:&quot;2021-02-28T13:00:00.919Z&quot;,&quot;subheadlines&quot;:{&quot;basic&quot;:&quot;The state will rely on the honor system for coronavirus protection, with no proof required that someone meets the new requirements for underlying conditions.&quot;},&quot;taxonomy&quot;:{&quot;primary_section&quot;:{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;/news&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;News&quot;,&quot;parent_id&quot;:&quot;/&quot;,&quot;path&quot;:&quot;/news&quot;},&quot;sites&quot;:[{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;News&quot;,&quot;path&quot;:&quot;/news&quot;}],&quot;tags&quot;:[{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Coronavirus&quot;,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;coronavirus&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Coronavirus&quot;}]},&quot;website_url&quot;:&quot;/news/2021/02/28/will-utahns-wait-their&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;JVHGQ7Q3FVCEFNVMJVOHO3RBYM&quot;,&quot;canonical_url&quot;:&quot;/news/health/2021/02/27/there-were-new-deaths&quot;,&quot;content_elements&quot;:[{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;b&gt;Editor’s note&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt; • The Salt Lake Tribune is providing free access to critical stories about the coronavirus.

The federal Food and Drug Administration is expected to approve emergency use of the new vaccine as soon as Saturday.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“Does it prevent severe and critical disease? Does it prevent deaths? The answer to those things is ‘yes,’” Briesacher said.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“It’s going to be really great for Utah, overall, because it is a simpler vaccine” than the Pfizer or Moderna versions now available, Briesacher said. “It’s only a single dose. It’s stored more easily. That gives us a lot of flexibility to focus on delivering this in an equitable way across the state.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The prospect of three vaccines available for COVID-19 is a far cry from Feb. 28, 2020 — a year ago this Sunday — when Briesacher sat in on the first meeting of the state’s incident command, “all focused on preparing to accept that first [COVID-19] patties in Utah,” he said.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“It’s been a tough, challenging year,” Briesacher said. “We’re all going to look back on this year and think of it as some of the most challenging times, and some of the more rewarding times. … And yet we find ourselves in a really great place where there’s a lot of optimism about the future.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;}],&quot;credits&quot;:{&quot;by&quot;:[{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;spmeans&quot;,&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/sltrib/58277bb7-8a94-4709-b6c9-9f548aa1c141.png&quot;},&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Sean P.

Things are significantly less awful than they used to be! It is far too soon to declare victory, but it is honestly very pleasing to see us take positive steps. And we know the decline is true, because we see it from a variety of sources: cases, deaths, hospitalizations, even the amount of coronavirus detected in our sewer systems, it’s all down. Coronavirus in our state hasn’t been at these levels since September.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;As you’d expect, the decrease in cases also means a decrease in our transmission rate, or Rt. Remember, Rt is the &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/2020/04/18/this-is-one-key-metric/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;average number of people infected by each person with the coronavirus&lt;/a&gt;, and this is one of the most important measures of the pandemic. If Rt is above 1, even by just a little, cases will rise. If Rt falls below 1, cases will fall.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Here’s Utah’s Rt graph over the course of the pandemic, as calculated by &lt;a href=\&quot;https://rt.live/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;Rt.live&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\&quot;https://epiforecasts.io/covid/posts/national/united-states/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;Epiforecasts.io&lt;/a&gt;:&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;div class=\&quot;flourish-embed flourish-chart\&quot; data-src=\&quot;visualisation/5381874\&quot;&gt;&lt;script src=\&quot;https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js\&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;raw_html&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;For months, Utah’s been playing this game with its contagion rate, dancing above and now below the Rt = 1 line. You can compare the last two graphs: When Rt was above 1 for months, cases rose and rose. As it’s fallen below 1, cases have fallen.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;So what’s working? Well, the decrease in Rt can only be due to three reasons:&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;1. People are getting vaccinated — making them immune to the virus. Vaccinations&lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/health/2021/02/19/good-news-biggest/\&quot; target=_blank&gt; significantly reduce transmission&lt;/a&gt;.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;2. People have already caught COVID-19 — making them quite immune to the virus (slightly less than if they were vaccinated). The antibodies also significantly reduce transmission.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;3. People have modified their behaviors — we’re doing things differently than in the months of rapid COVID-19 acceleration. There could be a bunch of factors at play here: fewer holidays in January and February, less travel, government orders, and so on.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Figuring out the relative role of these three reasons is really important. If the biggest factor is modified behavior, then we’ll have to continue doing whichever behaviors are necessary to keep our Rt below 1. If this decrease in cases is because most people are immune now, then we can be more aggressive in removing coronavirus restrictions.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;So which of those factors is playing the biggest role? Let’s find out.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Vaccinated people&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;header&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;This is the easy one to figure out. At this writing, there have been about 420,000 vaccinated with at least one dose of the vaccine, about 13% of Utah’s population.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;That being said, the vaccine doesn’t work immediately. It does seem to work relatively well after one dose:&lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.01.21250957v1\&quot; target=_blank&gt; recent estimates&lt;/a&gt; put it as high as 90%, but that’s after 21 days. In that first week or two, it’s not very effective yet.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Only about 250,000 Utahns had received at least one dose 21 days ago, which is about 8% of Utah’s population. So at this point, vaccinations have probably reduced the number of people who can catch the virus by about 8%.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Now, that doesn’t necessarily mean an 8% decrease in the average transmission rate. We vaccinated a whole lot of elderly folks, who probably weren’t seeing as many people in their everyday lives as many Utahns. On the other hand, we also vaccinated a whole lot of health care workers, teachers, police officers, and so on, who see more people in their everyday lives than the average.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;So far, about half of our vaccinations have gone to people over 60, and half below, according to Utah state data, so maybe those two groups even out. That 8% is just an estimate, but it’s what we have to work with.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;People who already had COVID-19&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;header&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;People who have been infected are significantly less likely to be infected again. &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.15.21249731v1\&quot; target=_blank&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt; followed people for over seven months and found that the protection that previous infection gives is over 90% — hey, just like the vaccines!&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;We’re less sure about how long some degree of immunity lasts, but the evidence here is &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/17/health/coronavirus-immunity.html\&quot; target=_blank&gt;largely positive&lt;/a&gt;. Even if the antibody levels don’t last very long, the responses &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-01143-2\&quot; target=_blank&gt;in other parts of the immune system&lt;/a&gt; can last for years and years — people with the original SARS-CoV-1 saw an immune response that lasted for over a decade.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Overall, 368,601 Utahns have had a positive test for the coronavirus, or about 11% of the population.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;But testing was very sparse early in the pandemic. And at the beginning of the school year, there were all of those &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/2020/10/12/some-utahns-refuse-get/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;remarkably foolish people&lt;/a&gt; who refused to get tested. And of course, there are legitimately people who got it but were asymptomatic — and yes, even people who don’t show symptoms &lt;a href=\&quot;https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/27/3/20-4543_article\&quot; target=_blank&gt;largely get immune system protection anyway&lt;/a&gt;. Lucky ducks.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;So how can we estimate how many people had the virus without getting a positive test? Well, we have a bunch of methods of tracking the pandemic that aren’t as reliant on testing: hospitalizations, deaths, the number of times people Google Search various symptoms, wastewater surveillance, and so forth.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention did &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/burden.html\&quot; target=_blank&gt;this through December&lt;/a&gt; and estimated that only 1 out of every 4.6 coronavirus infections was actually reported to a health department. That ratio, if it stayed stagnant, would mean 52% of Utahns have been infected with the virus. That’s probably a little high, as testing has continued to improve throughout the pandemic.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;A research team at Columbia University built a second model that &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2021/02/06/964527835/why-the-pandemic-is-10-times-worse-than-you-think#:~:text=One%2Dthird%20of%20the%20U.S.%20population%20has%20already%20been%20infected.&amp;text=Nationwide%2C%20Shaman%20estimates%20that%20about,third%20of%20the%20U.S.%20population.\&quot; target=_blank&gt;also found about a 1 in 4 rate&lt;/a&gt; nationally. But even better, they provided state-by-state estimates. At the beginning of February, the Columbia model estimated about 1.3 million Utahns have been infected at some point, or about 41% of Utah’s population.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;A third model, at &lt;a href=\&quot;https://covidestim.org/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;COVIDestim.org&lt;/a&gt;, uses a different approach to estimate that 29% of Utahns have been infected.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Regardless of the actual number, whether it is closer to 29% or 52%, it &lt;i&gt;well&lt;/i&gt; exceeds the number of people who have been vaccinated, and explains the drop in Rt in the past few months to a huge degree — as more and more people caught the virus especially in November and December, there would naturally be downward pressure on the number of people available to catch it again.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Changed behaviors&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;header&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;How do people spread the coronavirus? By hanging around other people, of course.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;So we want to track how much time Utahns spend around other people and how those measures have changed. To do so, we can ask people what they’ve been doing in self-reported surveys, and then verify those answers with real data from their cellphones.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;a href=\&quot;https://delphi.cmu.edu/covidcast/survey-results/?date=20210221&amp;region=UT\&quot; target=_blank&gt;Carnegie Mellon’s Delphi Group&lt;/a&gt; have been compiling data from Facebook surveys that do just that, asking a whole bunch of people every day about their activities. People then self-report if they spent time with someone outside their household, went to a store, went to a bar or restaurant, or attended an event that had more than 10 people in the last 24 hours. They’ve been doing this since Sept. 8.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Here are Utah’s results. Click the drop down to change the question people were asked.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;div class=\&quot;flourish-embed flourish-chart\&quot; data-src=\&quot;visualisation/5382199\&quot;&gt;&lt;script src=\&quot;https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js\&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;raw_html&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;You can see the biggest shift in behavior wasn’t actually at the holidays, but came in early November. That’s when the &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/2020/11/09/how-navigate-utahs/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;state of Utah&lt;/a&gt; issued its emergency order prohibiting people from meeting socially with people outside of their household. This was the one with the scary late night emergency warning on our phones.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The number of people visiting each other outside of their household still hasn’t recovered fully. Even once that order ended, I suspect the seriousness of it taught many about how much spread occurs through out-of-household social contact.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;You can see this pattern repeated in the other parts of the survey data. Fewer people are attending large events than in September and October, fewer people are leaving home for work or school, and fewer people are going to stores and restaurants. The upturn really had an impact on our social behaviors, an impact that’s verified by a look at the &lt;a href=\&quot;https://tracktherecovery.org/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;cellphone tracking data&lt;/a&gt;.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;But how much did it change? Well, about 46% of Utahns spent time with someone outside of their household in the week before the order, and about 33% did after. This week, we’re at about 40% of Utahns.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Of course, it’s not just whether or not you spend time with someone new, but how many people you spend time with. In the week before the state’s order, about 15% of people said they went to an event with at least 10 people in the last 24 hours; in the week after, that reduced to about 7%. Now, we’re at about 11%. A sick person spending time around dozens of other people means a potential super-spreading event.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Overall, I’d estimate the role of changing behaviors to be the second largest factor of the three: somewhat less than the role of those who already were infected, but more than the impact of the vaccine so far.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;You can see this reflected in the Rt graph, too. If immunity was the only thing playing a role in Utah’s transmission rate, you’d expect to see a constant negative slope. But instead, Rt has stayed pretty flat since the middle of January. Well, this data shows us one reason why: people are spending more time with more other people in the last month, after they saw cases were declining.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;We’ll need to keep a close eye on it, though. With coronavirus variants starting to spread in Utah — the variants are somewhat more transmissible — our Rt might be a tad more unpredictable moving forward.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The extremely good news is that the cumulative impact of Utah’s behavior changes and the spreading variants to this point hasn’t exceeded the rate of increasing immunity. So far in 2021, we’ve done a really good job of finding that balance. Both residents and the state Health Department will have to continue to work together on that, but so far, so good.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;We can’t open everything up right away. But as immunity increases — mostly through vaccinations this time, thank goodness — we can implement even more relaxed coronavirus standards.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;So yes, relatively soon, we’ll be able to be able to gather in groups, and yes, we’ll be able to shed the mask. We’re approaching the light at the end of the tunnel.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;i&gt;Andy Larsen is a data columnist.

Like, a heap of dirty diapers on rotten eggs adorned with some radioactive waste kind of garbage.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;We’ve now &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/nation-world/2021/02/22/ripple-effect-loss-us/\&quot;&gt;lost 500,000 Americans to COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;, leaving so many to grieve. That’s more than a &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/past-seasons.html\&quot;&gt;decade of estimated influenza deaths&lt;/a&gt; and is more lives lost than in three of our country’s major wars combined.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The economy has suffered, women particularly, women of color horrifically. Indiginous and low-income communities have bore the brunt of strain and sickness, while having access to the fewest accommodations (but what’s new?).&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Even racoons would refuse this swill.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;And yet, friends, among the amassing detritus, there have been a handful of golden nuggets worth recognizing and working to keep post-pandemic.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Now, maybe it’s just that there’s more light at the end of each day, but I feel like I’m sensing the faintest light at the end of the tunnel. And if we are, in fact, on the downward slope, I want to make sure we acknowledge the changes we made that we maybe shouldn’t unmake.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;With the &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.facebook.com/29001601/posts/10101517300360001/?d=n\&quot;&gt;help of some of my pals&lt;/a&gt;, I’ve started a list. I welcome your additions via email or comments. Let’s make this more complete.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Why didn’t we know this already?&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;header&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;• As grown adults, we had to relearn how to properly wash our hands. And it took video tutorials and celebrity skits/songs to do it. I feel surprised this was a 21st century lesson for an industrialized nation. Nevertheless, can we agree to ride this sudsy momentum for the foreseeable future?&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;• Many professionals are able to do their jobs without wearing uncomfortable clothes (or, in some cases, much clothing at all). Blazers, button-ups and slacks don’t actually correlate with productivity. (And, if my friends are any indicator, pantlessness might be advantageous for morale.) So, unless it’s necessary for the job, let’s reevaluate dress codes. (Side note: Not advocating being pantless in offices).&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;• We have the technology to experience people and events regardless of our locations. Do you have family you love but are unlikely to visit in Branson, Missouri? Have Zoom cocktails with those dears. That performance in Seattle? Stream it with your dog by your side. It might not be as good as live interactions or viewing, but we can access and make accessible more than ever before. And we should! This includes court/legal appearances, parent teacher conferences, work meetings and other necessary gatherings.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;• We shouldn’t go to work when we’re sick. If the idea of resting when you’re ill isn’t compelling enough, we’re threats to others in ways we might never imagine when we’re around them while contagious. Work shouldn’t supersede our care for our bodies and the respect of others’ bodies around us.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;• We should rethink how much we touch each other. As much as I love a good embrace and a firm handshake with eye contact, I’m noticing how we’ve woven a fair amount of physicality — even with strangers — into our social rituals and not everybody wants it. Plus, it’s germ swapping heaven. So, maybe we reserve that for our closer contacts, seek consent and find new ways to acknowledge the beginnings and ends of interactions.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Safety measure that feel like amenities&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;header&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;• I admit, we were having groceries and food delivered long before the pandemic, but this is more than just a convenience now — it’s increased accessibility and it’s mitigated risk. More than serving the lazy, curbside pick-up and home delivery can serve the less-mobile and higher-risk members of our communities.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;• Overcrowding is not just annoying, it’s a hazard. Giving people space on planes, in museums and parks might not allow for maximum profits, but it maximizes safety, comfort and enjoyment. Remember, people can only spend money if they’re alive and have it.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Legit societal shifts&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;header&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;• We benefit from understanding and addressing the unique needs of aging adults and marginalized communities. Pandemic or not, this is that proverbial rising tide that lifts all boats. Let’s continue, as a society (not just certain organizations or people), to prioritize those in greatest need.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;• Teachers, medical professionals and frontline/essential workers deserve our generous appreciation always. They teach (and discipline and nurse and counsel) our children, they care for our unwell and they keep society functioning. More celebratory signs and equitable pay, please!&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;• Significant swaths of society live in poverty all the time. But, if you exist, you deserve a chance to succeed. Stimulus money, or better yet, a universal basic income and a functional minimum wage, should flow consistently to low-income families. Sure, a tiny fraction will use it poorly, but by and large, &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/new-leaf-project-results-1.5752714\&quot;&gt;giving money to poor people&lt;/a&gt; is proving an effective way to reduce food insecurity, increase stable housing opportunities and reduce spending on substances like alcohol, cigarettes and drugs.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;• Childcare and other unpaid family care falls primarily on women, &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/2021/02/16/how-will-utah-lawmakers/\&quot;&gt;costing us equity in our homes, status at our places of employment and buying power in the marketplace&lt;/a&gt;. Seeing the exacerbated results of this due to the pandemic should compel us to address it when times aren’t so dire.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;• Essential healthcare should be accessible to everyone regardless of the ability to pay. We have figured out how to COVID test and vaccinate all who want/need it; let’s do that with all necessary medical care. Sick people aren’t profit centers and healthcare is a human right.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;We have the need and means to solve really big problems (and even small elastic waistband ones), but we have to be intentional. As Winston Churchill said, “Never let a good crisis go to waste.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;b&gt;Marina Gomberg&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;is a communications professional and lives in Salt Lake City with her wife, Elenor Gomberg, and their son, Harvey.

For example, in the first week that Utahns between the ages of 65 and 69 could make appointments, 29% received their first dose of vaccine.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;As Utah now invites residents with qualifying health conditions to be vaccinated, the state is working on the honor system, he noted.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“Please, please, please, do not jump ahead in line,” Cox asked Utahns during &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zin4soxmmAQ&amp;feature=emb_title\&quot; target=_blank&gt;his weekly COVID-19 briefing&lt;/a&gt;. “If you jump ahead in line, that means there is someone else who won’t get the vaccine as soon as they could have — and it’s very possible that they could end up hospitalized or, even worse, dying. … Those vaccines are coming, and we’re all going to get one sooner rather than later.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Cox also announced that people who are eligible to be vaccinated are no longer required to wait for appointments in the county where they live. If they can find an appointment in another county, they can sign up and go there to be inoculated. They must return to that county, he added, to get their second dose.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;quote&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Sixteen- and 17-year-olds, Cox cautioned, can only receive the Pfizer version of the vaccine, because of federal guidelines. So those making appointments for these teenagers must go to sites that have the Pfizer vaccine.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;He also urged people to keep their appointments, or inform the clinic or pharmacy in advance that they have to cancel. Otherwise, Cox said, “that is a dose that could go to waste.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The state saw a dip in vaccine distribution last week, Cox said, because a shipment of 36,000 doses of the Moderna version was delayed by storms on the East coast. “We are rapidly working to make up the decrease we saw last week,” Cox said.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Cox said Utah has been approved to get 20,000 doses of the new Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine by early next week — pending federal approval of the vaccine, which is expected as soon as Saturday.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine is a single-dose shot, not the two-shot formula of the Pfizer and Moderna versions, which, Cox said, “will help us with some of our harder-to-reach populations.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;State epidemiologist Dr. Angela Dunn said the state is “headed in the right direction,” with the number of COVID-19 cases declining.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“We need to continue doing what we know works with physical distancing, mask-wearing, avoiding large gatherings, and most importantly, getting the vaccine when it’s your turn to get it,” she said.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Cox expressed optimism that every Utahn will have access to the vaccine by late April or mid-May. “In just a few weeks, we’re going to have more vaccine than we know what to do with,” Cox said, adding health officials will then concentrate on encouraging people who are hesitant about the vaccine to get their shots.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;He reiterated the formula for when the state’s mask mandates can be lifted, released in the state’s updated public health order Tuesday: First the state must have 1,633,000 first doses of the vaccine allocated — then add eight weeks. Then, any county in Utah that is designated as having a low transmission rate should have the mask order lifted&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;So far, the federal government has allocated 444,905 first doses to Utah.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Cox expressed optimism that Utah’s mask mandates could gone by the middle of summer.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“I’m telling you,” Cox told reporters, holding up his face mask, “I’m not going to be wearing this on the Fourth of July.

Huge numbers of students finished the 2020 spring semester remotely. Some jurisdictions did choose to reopen schools in fall 2020 and spring 2021, though others have remained remote.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Throughout the pandemic, researchers have studied whether in-person learning at schools contributes significantly to the spread of COVID-19. The findings have shown that if K-12 schools adhere to mitigation measures — masking, physical distancing and frequent hand-washing — then there is a relatively low risk of transmission.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;And getting kids back into the classroom is a&lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/blog/meet-press-blog-latest-news-analysis-data-driving-political-discussion-n988541/ncrd1234195#blogHeader\&quot;&gt; high priority&lt;/a&gt; for the Biden administration.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;In a&lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2021/02/03/press-briefing-white-house-covid-19-response-team-and-public-health-officials/\&quot;&gt; Feb. 3 White House press briefing&lt;/a&gt;, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said data suggests “schools can safely reopen.” The CDC on Feb. 12 released&lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/schools-childcare/operation-strategy.html\&quot;&gt; guidance&lt;/a&gt; on how schools should approach reopening. It recommends the standard risk-mitigation measures, as well as universal masking, contact tracing, creating student learning cohorts or pods, conducting testing and monitoring community transmission of the virus.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;a href=\&quot;https://sph.tulane.edu/epid/susan-hassig\&quot;&gt;Susan Hassig&lt;/a&gt;, associate professor of epidemiology at Tulane University, said science shows that schools can open safely if “mitigation measures are implemented and maintained in the school space.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Here’s some of the latest research that tracks with these positions:&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;list&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Of course, there are some limitations to these studies, which often rely on contact tracing, a process that can’t always pinpoint where cases originate. Some of the studies also rely on self-reporting of mask-wearing by individuals, which could be inaccurate.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Additionally, Hassig pointed out that not all school districts have the resources, such as physical space, personnel or high-quality masks, to open safely.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Sexton’s assertion that schools can reopen leaves out a key piece of information: that safe reopening is highly dependent upon use of mitigation measures that have been shown to tamp down on virus spread.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;‘Stop wearing masks outside’&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;header&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Because the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is relatively new, the research on outdoor mask use is limited. But so far science has shown that masks prevent virus transmission.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The CDC study&lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/pdfs/mm7007e1-H.pdf?ACSTrackingID=USCDC_921-DM49152&amp;ACSTrackingLabel=MMWR%20Early%20Release%20-%20Vol.%2070%2C%20February%2010%2C%202021&amp;deliveryName=USCDC_921-DM49152\&quot;&gt; published Feb. 10&lt;/a&gt; reported that a medical procedure mask (commonly known as a surgical mask) blocked 56.1% of simulated cough particles. A cloth mask blocked 51.4% of cough particles. And the effectiveness went up to 85.4% if a cloth mask was worn over a surgical mask.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Another experiment from the study showed that a person in a mask emits fewer aerosol particles that can be passed on to an unmasked person. And if both are masked, then aerosol exposure to both is reduced by more than 95%.

To be sure, public health experts agree the risk of transmitting coronavirus is lower outdoors than indoors. But the experts also said that doesn’t mean people should stop wearing masks.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“The wind might help you a bit outside, but you are still at risk of breathing in this virus from people around you,” said&lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.mountsinai.org/about/newsroom/2020/rachel-vreeman-md-ms-appointed-chair-of-global-health-and-director-of-the-arnhold-institute-for-global-health-at-the-icahn-school-of-medicine-at-mount-sinai-pr\&quot;&gt; Dr. Rachel Vreeman&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Arnhold Institute for Global Health at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Being outside is “not a guarantee of safety,” reiterated&lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/people/our-faculty/ssm20\&quot;&gt; Stephen Morse&lt;/a&gt;, an epidemiology professor at Columbia University Medical Center. “Especially when those people without masks are close together.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The CDC addressed the issue of whether masks are needed outside in the&lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover-guidance.html\&quot;&gt; agency’s mask guidelines&lt;/a&gt;: “Masks may not be necessary when you are outside by yourself away from others, or with other people who live in your household. However, some areas may have mask mandates while out in public, so please check for the rules in your local area.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Overall, the prevailing scientific opinion is that, while it may be OK to go maskless outside if you are physically distant from others, mask-wearing is still recommended if you are around others.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;‘Everyone at low risk should start living normal lives’&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;header&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;All the public health experts we consulted agreed this part of the claim is absolutely false. It flies in the face of what scientists recommend should be done to get through the pandemic.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;While it’s unclear what exactly the post means by “low-risk” people, let’s assume it’s referring to younger people or those without health conditions that make them more vulnerable to COVID-19. And that “living normal lives” refers to no longer wearing masks, physical distancing or washing hands with increased frequency.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.statnews.com/2020/11/10/restaurants-gyms-were-spring-superspreader-sites-occupancy-limits-could-control-spread/\&quot;&gt;News reports&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/coronavirus-and-covid-19-younger-adults-are-at-risk-too\&quot;&gt; scientific evidence&lt;/a&gt; show that bars, parties and other large gatherings can quickly become spreader events. Moreover, even young people and those without preexisting health conditions have gotten severely ill with COVID-19 or died of it.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Even if a low-risk person doesn’t get severely sick, they could still infect others in higher-risk groups.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The sentiment of this post is similar to calls early in the pandemic to let life return to normal in an attempt to achieve herd immunity. But, on the way to achieving that goal, many would die, said&lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.kff.org/person/josh-michaud/\&quot;&gt; Josh Michaud&lt;/a&gt;, associate director for global health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“Everyone going back to ‘normal’ right now, especially in the presence of more transmissible and more deadly variants, would be a recipe for further public health disasters on top of what we’ve already experienced,” he added.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Already&lt;a href=\&quot;https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/\&quot;&gt; almost half a million Americans&lt;/a&gt; have died of COVID-19.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The push to “return to normal” is precisely what let the new variants form and multiply, said Vreeman. “If we can ramp up getting people vaccinated and keep wearing masks in the meantime, only then will we have a chance at getting back to ‘normal.’”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Indeed, because of the new variants circulating in the U.S., Walensky and Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, have urged Americans not to relax their efforts to control the virus’s spread.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Our ruling&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;header&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;A blog post by conservative talk show host Buck Sexton claims scientific evidence shows that right now we should “open the schools, stop wearing masks outside, and everyone at low risk should start living normal lives.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Scientific research shows that in order for schools to reopen safely, risk mitigation measures must be put in place, such as requiring masks, rigorous hand-washing and limiting the number of students in classrooms. These changes, though, would not represent a return to normal, but a new normal for students and teachers.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The remainder of Sexton’s statement strays further from current science. Research indicates that you’re safer outdoors than indoors, but public health experts still recommend wearing masks in public, even outside. Science does not support the idea that the time is right for some people to resume life as normal. That would allow the virus to continue to spread and have a large human cost in hospitalizations and deaths, said the experts.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Sexton’s post is inaccurate.

And we are still in desperate, desperate need. And so we ask that you all support this bill and this program.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Jacey Skinner, executive vice president of public policy and general counsel at the Salt Lake Chamber, said during public comment on the bill that people might be fatigued from talking about stimulus programs and coronavirus relief. And she believes a lot of money from the federal CARES Act went to businesses that “probably did not need it.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“But what we’ve also seen are many businesses, many well-established businesses, that have struggled in ways that in many instances are well beyond their control,” she said. “Many businesses have made significant efforts to pivot and to adapt, and they have worked hard and they followed the rules and they’ve complied with those things that have been asked of them, but have been impacted significantly throughout.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Skinner said she thought Cullimore’s bill was a “narrowly tailored approach” that would provide assistance to those businesses that are genuinely struggling.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Cullimore’s bill, &lt;a href=\&quot;https://le.utah.gov/~2021/bills/static/SB0202.html\&quot; target=_blank&gt;SB202&lt;/a&gt;, received unanimous support from the Senate Business and Labor Committee on Tuesday, after several lawmakers peppered him with questions about how the program would ensure the money would do just that.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Sen. Curt Bramble, R-Provo and a certified public accountant, said he’s sat across the table over the past 12 months with many businesses that felt entitled to getting “free cash,” whether they needed it or not.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“My primary concern is when government starts handing out money, there’s never enough to go around and everyone deserves — according to their own evaluation — their fair share,” he said. “And how do we identify those businesses that really need the grant?”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Bramble was particularly uneasy about a portion of the bill that would allow relief for a business that began operations on or after Jan. 1, 2020, and could demonstrate that it had “incurred expenses and is operating at a net loss due to the public health emergency related to COVID-19.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Most startups die within the first three to five years, with or without a pandemic, Bramble noted, and he worried it would be difficult to tell which had actually been impacted by the coronavirus and which would be struggling either way.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;While more established businesses would be required under the bill to show a loss in revenue from March to June 2020 compared to the same period in 2019, Cullimore noted that wouldn’t be possible for a startup. But there are still businesses that fall into that category that need relief, he said.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Kori Ann Edwards, managing director of operations at GOED, acknowledged there’s “no magic way to know if a company just started up is going to make it or not based on on the valuation of it” but reiterated that the state agency would ask companies to fulfill certain requirements before they received any money.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;As part of the bill, businesses that apply for the grants would be required to sign a declaration under penalty of perjury that their application is complete and correct and to submit to a possible audit. If an audit found that the company had misrepresented its losses, GOED could recapture those grant funds and require the business to pay a fine to the state.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The bill passed received unanimous support in the Senate and now requires one final procedural vote there before moving to the House for further consideration.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;}],&quot;credits&quot;:{&quot;by&quot;:[{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;tstevens&quot;,&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/sltrib/552b549d-0874-4a30-a916-6f26498fb3e6.png&quot;},&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Taylor Stevens&quot;}]},&quot;display_date&quot;:&quot;2021-02-23T17:44:51.415Z&quot;,&quot;headlines&quot;:{&quot;basic&quot;:&quot;$30 million COVID relief package for Utah small businesses gets Senate OK&quot;},&quot;last_updated_date&quot;:&quot;2021-02-23T21:10:29.011Z&quot;,&quot;promo_items&quot;:{&quot;basic&quot;:{&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;(Trent Nelson  |  Tribune file photo) A sign encouraging social distancing at City Creek in Salt Lake City on Tuesday, Nov. 24, 2020.

The bill from Senate Majority Leader Evan Vickers, R-Cedar City, is a response to the continuous state of emergency the state has been under for almost a year in response to the coronavirus outbreak.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2021/02/16/lawmakers-take-aim/801-237-2900/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;As previously reported&lt;/a&gt;, the bill would not impact the governor’s ability to respond to an emergency as it happens, but if the emergency declaration lasts beyond 30 days, then lawmakers could get involved. State and local health departments could do the same.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“We’ve looked back on what happened and asked ourselves the question, how can we do it better next time around? And, that’s a hard thing to do,” said Vickers.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Under the bill, if an emergency lasts beyond the 30-day limit, then the Legislature would weigh in with an emergency response committee, made up of current legislative leadership, plus other legislators who have experience relevant to the situation. For example, lawmakers with a health care background could be consulted during a long-term health emergency. If appropriate, that committee would solicit public input on what comes next.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“We wanted to get the public’s input and expertise on what’s going on with that particular emergency,” said Vickers. “Then we can make recommendations back to the Legislature.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;There’s also a motivation to maintain a check on the power of the governor. During the early days of the pandemic, when an emergency declaration from then-Gov. Gary Herbert was set to expire, lawmakers realized they had little recourse as he could just issue another immediately, which he did.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The bill would block the extension of a declaration, or the issuance of a new one, without the signoff of lawmakers.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“Not one citizen has had a voice in the policies that have been implemented since COVID began,” said Sen. Curt Bramble, R-Provo, saying the restrictions imposed because of the pandemic, including business closures and mask mandates, were never vetted by lawmakers.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“We are the citizen’s voice on policy. Not one citizen has had a vote on this floor of this body representing their voice on these long-term policies,” added Bramble.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Legislators &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2021/02/19/utah-politics-podcast/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;have been careful&lt;/a&gt; to say Herbert responded appropriately to the pandemic and collaborated well with them, but they felt the monthslong emergency gave authority to the governor that should rightly belong to the Legislature.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;There has been some controversy surrounding the legislation, which was made public less than two weeks ago. Gov. Spencer Cox, who has been negotiating with lawmakers over the bill, said last week &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2021/02/18/gov-spencer-cox-suggests/\&quot;&gt;there are changes he would like to see made to the legislation&lt;/a&gt;. He would not detail what those are, except suggesting the 30-day timeframe may need to be adjusted.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;However, if lawmakers can muster a veto-proof vote in favor of the bill, and the Senate’s unanimous vote indicates there’s plenty of support, then Cox’s objections could be moot.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Sen. Jake Anderegg, R-Lehi, said he’s encountered misunderstanding about what the bill does from members of the public who think it is giving public authorities sweeping new powers to shut down businesses that some believe infringes on individual liberties.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“Until this pandemic, we had never seen this used on a mass portion of society or an entire state or entire segment of an economy. We have never seen it used on such a broad scale,” he said. “What we’re doing is incorporating that concept into this bill and defining it in such a way that when the Legislature does intervene, we have the scope of the powers we can use. It’s wholly constitutional and wholly appropriate.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Sen. Gene Davis, D-Salt Lake City, worried the bill may hamstring the governor too much in responding to an emergency.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“We’re a part-time Legislature and the governor is given those powers because he’s a full-time administrator,” said Davis. “I think limiting the powers of the governor to 30 days really raises some questions that we need to rethink. Are 30 days really enough for the governor to respond?”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;}],&quot;credits&quot;:{&quot;by&quot;:[{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;bschott&quot;,&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/sltrib/d116c567-15c2-4250-914c-638eb5af4458.png&quot;},&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Bryan Schott&quot;}]},&quot;display_date&quot;:&quot;2021-02-23T03:10:14.514Z&quot;,&quot;headlines&quot;:{&quot;basic&quot;:&quot;Bill limiting governor’s emergency powers wins final Senate OK and House will take it up next&quot;},&quot;last_updated_date&quot;:&quot;2021-02-23T19:07:21.390Z&quot;,&quot;promo_items&quot;:{&quot;basic&quot;:{&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;(Leah Hogsten | The Salt Lake Tribune) Senate Majority Leader Evan Vickers, R-Cedar City, was commended by Senate leaders and a minority leader for Vickers&#x27; SB195 bill Feb. 16, 2021.

Pavia added that masks, hand-washing and social distancing are known to dampen the spread of the flu — and taking those public health measures for COVID-19 is “a natural experiment where we’re controlling [the flu] really dramatically,” Pavia said.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The drop in RSV, which stands for respiratory syncytial virus, “is somewhat more perplexing,” Pavia said. A major symptom of RSV is a runny nose, and nasal secretions are a prime way the virus spreads — so masks and hand-washing are likely limiting how much those secretions get around. &quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Kids under age 3, who are most susceptible to RSV, are not congregating as much during the pandemic, with fewer play dates and day care visits, Pavia said. He also noted that older siblings who are learning online or having fewer in-person school days aren’t bringing as many viruses home.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;All that explains why RSV numbers would drop, Pavia said, but not why “it’s practically zero across the nation.” &quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;One theory experts are discussing, though there’s not a lot of evidence to support it yet, Pavia said, “is that viruses interfere with each other. And when one virus dominates the jungle, it forces all the other animals out, essentially. … Viruses have these weird interplays that we don’t fully understand.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Those low rates of flu and RSV aren’t likely to last into next year, Pavia said.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“It’s very likely that when both flu and RSV have been away for a while, you’ll have more people fully susceptible to it,” Pavia said. “So when it arrives, it spreads more dramatically and we see more severe disease.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Flu rates tend to oscillate, Pavia said, with a mild year often followed by a severe one. RSV, on the other hand, “depends a lot on, every year, having a new crop of babies who are completely susceptible to RSV. In Utah, that’s another 50,000 good hosts for the virus to attack. This year, we’re going to have a whole year of infants who never saw RSV. So next year, we’ll have twice as many naive infants who are susceptible to it.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Doctors in Western Australia, Pavia said, noticed that RSV was largely absent there in June and July — when it’s winter in the southern hemisphere — while the country brought its COVID-19 spread under control. Recently, as COVID-19 restrictions have been loosened there, doctors saw a huge surge of RSV during the Australian summer.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“RSV’s going to do something really strange when it comes back,” Pavia said. “We really can’t predict it very well. Our gut feeling is that it will come roaring back, and we’ll have a bad RSV year when it does return.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;}],&quot;credits&quot;:{&quot;by&quot;:[{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;spmeans&quot;,&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/sltrib/58277bb7-8a94-4709-b6c9-9f548aa1c141.png&quot;},&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Sean P.

White House coronavirus response coordinator Andy Slavitt on Monday attributed the improved timeline to an “all-out, round-the-clock” effort over the weekend that included employees at one vaccine distributor working night shifts to pack vaccines.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;In Louisiana, state health officials said some doses from last week’s shipments were delivered over the weekend and were expected to continue arriving through Wednesday.

Grocery store employees can bring everything from milk and carrots to soap and toilet paper to a car for curbside pickup. But if shoppers want beer, they have to go inside to buy it. The restriction has been in place to prevent underage buyers from purchasing alcohol.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The curbside sales ban came to light several years ago, when Utah grocery stores started offering the “click and collect” online service for busy consumers. But the issue has become more pronounced over the past 11 months as Utahns have been encouraged to order online for pickup and delivery, hoping to avoid the spread of COVID-19.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Along those same lines, the newly unveiled bill also would allow customers to place an online order at a licensed distillery, brewery or winery.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The manufacturer would not be allowed to process the payment, the measure says, until the customer goes into the business and an employee determines that it is “the patron who placed the order” and that person is of legal age to buy alcohol.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The online ordering would not apply to Utah’s state-run liquor stores or smaller “package agencies” operated on a contract basis in rural areas.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The bill has not yet been assigned to a committee for debate.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;It also does not address the issue of home delivery of alcohol.

Business owners as well as members of the state liquor commission say the delay could be remedied if the Legislature lowered the population ratio now in state code. Currently, Utah can have one bar for every 10,200 residents.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;HB371 — which is 83 pages long — makes several other tweaks to state alcohol code, such as:&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;• Allowing hotels built within “a community reinvestment project area” to qualify for state liquor licenses — even if they are located close to a school, church and other community location. This provision is specifically designed to help the &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/2020/01/04/construction-salt-lake/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;26-story convention center hotel being built in downtown Salt Lake City&lt;/a&gt;.

That may be building with Legos, sitting alone in a tepee or reading a book.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;After 10 minutes, the South Jordan students head back to class, calm and ready to learn.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“It’s never a way to get out of work. It’s a way to help them better prepare to get the work done,” says Jodee Packer, the school’s social emotional specialist who oversees the center.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Such centers are gaining in popularity in Utah. Canyons District is creating wellness rooms in 18 of its schools. Davis, Salt Lake and Jordan districts use them as well.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Monte Vista’s center opened in the fall and already is showing results. Principal Nanette Ririe estimates that 10 to 15 students had been referred to her office for aggressive behavior this school year, compared to around 50 last year — a “phenomenal” drop that happened even as she and teachers are seeing students who are uneasier than ever because of the pandemic.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Students pick up on their parents’ anxieties, over finances and politics and fear of the coronavirus. “There’s more anxiety,” says school psychologist Lisa Stillman. Students may notice a missing friend and wonder, “Do they have COVID and are they going to die, are they coming back?”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;As of mid-January, the center had averaged 22 students a day, for over 1,200 visits since mid-August. By mid-February, it had reached just over 1,500 visits, Packer said. Children can ask to go to the center, or a teacher can refer them if they notice a fidgeting, distracted or wound-up student who seems to need the break.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Packer asks them to identify their emotions coming in and going out. Almost half report feeling sad, depressed, tired, sick, bored or disappointed coming in, followed by a category that includes distracted, annoyed, embarrassed or nervous. Nearly 100 percent report feeling better (happy, proud, calm, content or thankful) and ready to learn at the end of their visit.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The goal is to get the students in the center before they escalate to feeling angry, stressed, aggressive or out of control. That requires helping them learn how to recognize their emotions and what those emotions feel like in their body (racing heartbeat, getting teary, clenching fists).&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The school teaches students about self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationship skills and decision-making. It uses its own curriculum based on tools from&lt;a href=\&quot;https://casel.org/about-2/\&quot;&gt; The Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning&lt;/a&gt; and a curriculum for sixth graders bought by the district after a series of&lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/2018/04/04/were-racking-our-brains-a-series-of-teen-suicides-has-left-the-herriman-high-school-community-searching-for-answers/\&quot;&gt; suicides at Herriman High School in 2018&lt;/a&gt;.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;At the beginning of the year, first graders who visited would come in missing their moms, Packer said. Through the lessons on emotions, they now come in saying, “I’m stressed out about math or Chinese [the school includes Chinese immersion] or whatever it is and that is making me miss mom and I need help,” Packer says. “That is amazing that first graders can identify the transfer of emotion.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Asking questions to support positive discipline&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;header&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Sixth grade teacher Cindi Dunford never would have gotten to the heart of why a student was causing disruptions in her class if she had reacted in the standard way and asked him to stop it or else go to the office. Instead, she pulled him aside and tried the positive discipline skills she is now teaching others to use at Granite Park Junior High in South Salt Lake.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Dunford pointed out to the student that he seemed distracted and anxious and asked what he could do to help himself focus. He acknowledged he missed his mother, who was working double shifts at the time, so he never got to see her. Using “results-based coaching,” Dunford asked him what he could do about it. Empowered to find a solution, he decided to call his mother at lunch each day.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“Students are trying to communicate to us through their behavior,” she says. “There are ways we can communicate back to them that are more effective than rewards and punishments. … I wanted to have a better approach that’s more respectful to my students and their differences.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;With help with her colleagues, Dunford earned a grant from United Way of Salt Lake to implement her ideas, which use methods in the books “&lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Escalate-Calm-Angry-Person-Seconds/dp/1582706557\&quot; target=_blank&gt;De-Escalate: How to Calm an Angry Person in 90 Seconds or Less&lt;/a&gt;” by Douglas E. Noll and “&lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/220225/positive-discipline-in-the-classroom-by-jane-nelsen-edd-lynn-lott-ma-and-h-stephen-glenn/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;Positive Discipline in the Classroom&lt;/a&gt;” by Jane Nelsen, Lynn Lott and H. Stephen Glenn. They’re offering book studies and workshops for some teachers and counselors at her Granite District school in this pilot year.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Already the program is contributing to a plummet in the number of major problems referred to the principal’s office, from 901 to 237 in the first semester. That’s occurred as the number of students attending in person has remained the same as last year, because sixth grade was added to the school.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Dunford said rewards and punishments can work in the short term to get students to complete tasks. But they aren’t the best way to build the intrinsic motivation that drives students to want to learn.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;She tries to find the why behind such problems as seeking attention or avoiding work, while giving students the language to label their feelings and the tools to fix their behavior. Recognizing different perspectives is important in a school like hers, where a large number of immigrants and refugees attend, she said.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;For example, one student who was suspended for fighting explained he came from a culture where disagreements were handled with fights, and then the quarreling students were able to move on.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“This approach can address equity issues,” Dunford says. “If we’re looking at each child as an individual with their own private logic about why they’re doing this, it will make it easier for us to differentiate their instruction to meet those needs no matter who they are.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Using Second Step curriculum&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;header&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;When children on the playground at Midvalley Elementary School in Midvale disagree about whether a ball went out of bounds, they don’t fight or seek a recess aide for help. They play roshambo, (another name for rock, paper, scissors) and get back to the game, knowing that “being friends is more important than being right,” says Principal Tamra Baker.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;And when a first grader recently was hurt by something a classmate said, she and her friends formed a circle to work through their feelings. “The brilliance of it is they don’t go back to it,” Baker adds. “They’ve healed the relationship.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The peaceful negotiations are the result of a variety of measures taken by the Canyons School District to boost social emotional learning. They include circle time/morning meetings to check in with each student as a group, along with the &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.secondstep.org/what-is-second-step\&quot; target=_blank&gt;national Second Step curriculum&lt;/a&gt; developed by the nonprofit Committee for Children in Seattle, which the district will have implemented in all elementary and middle schools by next year. A high school curriculum is in the works, too.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Second Step also is used by the Murray, Jordan and Salt Lake City school districts, and the program provides weekly lessons to teach skills for learning empathy, problem-solving and emotional regulation.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Midvalley Elementary has used Second Step for four years. The school tackles a concept each month, with whole-school assemblies to bring all students on board. The school recently finished lessons on emotion management, helping kids name their feelings and find ways to calm down, like belly breathing.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Teachers often include the month’s concept in their morning meetings, where every student is greeted by name and each has a chance to share what’s going on in their lives, from being upset that a cat died to being super excited about a new baby brother, says BJ Weller, director of the district’s responsive services.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;He says students who can express those emotions early in the day are able to focus on school and learning. The curriculum includes catchy songs explaining big concepts like empathy and compassion that students hum in the halls, Baker says.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“One of the keys to having a healthy school is having healthy relationships,” she says. “Second Step excels at teaching kids the skills they need to build relationships with peers and with adults.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Trying telehealth&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;header&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The pandemic has exacerbated anxiety and depression among some children and teens, who can feel lonely and confused about what’s happening. That’s why the Salt Lake City School District expanded its partnership with Odyssey House to offer telehealth therapy to all students.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The web-based therapy sessions started in the summer and have continued through the school year, for the state’s only district in which &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/education/2020/07/30/salt-lake-city-schools/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;all of the students were attending school online&lt;/a&gt; before &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/education/2021/01/25/elementary-students-are/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;a shift began in January&lt;/a&gt;. But even as students return to the classroom, telehealth is expected to remain an option for those who prefer the convenience, removing another barrier to accessing mental health care.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Grants allowed Odyssey to hire four mental health professionals to build on the services provided by counselors and social workers who work at every city school. Odyssey staffers have met virtually with 77 students in 17 of the city schools.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Cami Clark, Odyssey’s director of youth services, says students whose parents have sought treatment may be depressed, anxious or angry. Even though counselors aren’t able to meet in person, they are establishing strong relationships online to help struggling students.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“They get very creative as far as engaging even 6- and 7-year-olds,” she said, with therapists asking parents to have art supplies at the ready for them to do “expressive therapy” online.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Stacey Lindsay, district counselor specialist, said staffers are being asked to watch for students who may be struggling and need additional help as they return to the classroom after almost a year of remote learning.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“I would describe the pandemic as a traumatic event in all of our lives. There’s been some loss whether you’ve lost a parent or lost some freedoms or your ability to predict what’s coming next,” she said. “If you’re not putting in these supports to help kids feel safe, feel calm, feel supported and connected, then their learning is really impacted.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The Jordan District also offers telehealth counseling. And school counselors have been trained in BRISC, or brief intervention strategy for school clinicians, to offer four to six intensive evidence-based counseling sessions. If students need additional help, the district refers them to counselors in the community for up to eight sessions paid by the district through a state grant. If parents can’t afford more, the district will pay for up to eight more sessions.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“School counselors are making referrals on a daily basis,” says Stacee Worthen, Jordan’s secondary counselor specialist.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The district’s 100 counselors have logged more than 17,000 meetings with students for mental health, on track to surpass the nearly 28,000 visits last school year. Worthen attributes the growth to the ways the pandemic has upended teens’ lives, from whether or not their school is closed or they are in quarantine, to how their traditional outlets like sports and extracurriculars have been canceled or altered.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Add political unrest and “there is a lot of uncertainty. Helping them to be resilient and giving them solid coping skills is dependent on the adults in the building,” she says. “There are some studies that show outside of parents, your school counselor is the person those kids are going to talk to about some of those issues.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Adding mindful movement&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;header&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;When the Davis School District decided to implement social emotional learning, it focused first on adults, knowing that it needed to help staffers — from educators to secretaries to bus drivers — work on self-care, because their jobs are so demanding. Plus, adults who can prioritize their own health and well-being are better able to help their students.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The district implemented Pure Edge, training staffers how to use breath and movement to calm their minds and focus their attention. The timing couldn’t have been better — before the pandemic hit and stress skyrocketed, says Chronister, whose goal is to make social emotional learning “something we do everyday, all day … to develop a culture and climate that is respectful and inclusive and creates the best learning environment for our students.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Students can be given a “mindful minute” at the start of the school day to check in with themselves, mindful breathing exercises to settle as they transition between classes, and a brain break during longer lessons or before a test. And Pure Edge suggests a one- to two-minute gratitude reflection as they end the day.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“Even those little brain breaks make a huge difference,” says Nicole Deaton, a health teacher at Shoreline Junior High in Layton. She implements the breathing and movement work in her classes as well as during the school’s advisory periods, where students also learn a curriculum called Move This World, which incorporates movement, too.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Students report using some of the techniques, like “starfish breathing” (where they trace the outline of their hand as they breathe) to settle before doing homework or a test.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“It’s not just the content we teach,” Deaton says, “ ... we’re teaching a child, and we need to teach the whole child.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;i&gt;Heather May is a freelance writer in Salt Lake City and can be reached at &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=\&quot;mailto:heathermayslc@gmail.com\&quot; target=_blank&gt;&lt;i&gt;heathermayslc@gmail.com&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;i&gt;Correction, 9 p.m. Feb. 21, 2021: This story has been updated to correct the number of student visits to the Wellness Center at Monte Vista Elementary. &lt;/i&gt;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;}],&quot;credits&quot;:{&quot;by&quot;:[{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Heather May | Special to The Tribune&quot;}]},&quot;display_date&quot;:&quot;2021-02-19T14:07:11.134Z&quot;,&quot;headlines&quot;:{&quot;basic&quot;:&quot;COVID-19 is fueling innovation in Utah schools to help students focus and cope &quot;},&quot;last_updated_date&quot;:&quot;2021-02-22T04:07:13.930Z&quot;,&quot;promo_items&quot;:{&quot;basic&quot;:{&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;(Rick Egan | The Salt Lake Tribune) Olivia Harmon waves her arms with her class in movement exercises, at the beginning of Nicole Deaton&#x27;s 8th grade health class at Shoreline Junior High in Layton, on Wednesday, Feb. 3, 2021.&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/sltrib/5NFSYG3UJNANVBMF3GBSRDLVMY.JPG&quot;}},&quot;publish_date&quot;:&quot;2021-02-22T04:07:13.667Z&quot;,&quot;subheadlines&quot;:{&quot;basic&quot;:&quot;Supporters say social-emotional learning helps students manage stress while reducing disciplinary problems, boosting grades and morale.&quot;},&quot;taxonomy&quot;:{&quot;primary_section&quot;:{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;/news/education&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Education&quot;,&quot;parent_id&quot;:&quot;/news&quot;,&quot;path&quot;:&quot;/news/education&quot;},&quot;sites&quot;:[{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Education&quot;,&quot;path&quot;:&quot;/news/education&quot;},{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;News&quot;,&quot;path&quot;:&quot;/news&quot;}],&quot;tags&quot;:[{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Walton grant&quot;,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;walton&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Walton&quot;},{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Coronavirus&quot;,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;coronavirus&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Coronavirus&quot;}]},&quot;website_url&quot;:&quot;/news/education/2021/02/19/covid-is-fueling&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;UF4S36AYDVCF3O6U6IOFVQ77UM&quot;,&quot;canonical_url&quot;:&quot;/news/health/2021/02/19/good-news-biggest&quot;,&quot;content_elements&quot;:[{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;There aren’t a lot of silver linings to the pandemic.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;One of them, from my eyes, is learning the speed at which the scientific community can progress when highly focused on a problem. Remarkably, we invented, tested, began manufacturing and distributing multiple very safe and effective coronavirus vaccines in under 12 months. It is wildly impressive that we did this. Yay, science!&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;But that speed also means that my articles from recent weeks need a bit of an update, because we’re learning so much so fast. In particular, I’ve written about three topics that I wanted to share the latest info about:&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;• How quickly will &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/2021/02/05/when-should-all-utah/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;vaccine manufacturing ramp up&lt;/a&gt; and when can you get one?&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;• What impact will the &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/2020/12/27/what-you-should-know/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;new coronavirus variants&lt;/a&gt; have on the pandemic?&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;• How much &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/2021/01/14/can-vaccinated-people/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;can you still spread COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; even if you’ve been vaccinated?&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Let’s dive in.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Vaccine distribution&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;header&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;To recap, I created some models to help identify when the general public in Utah may get the vaccine and I was able to narrow it down to somewhere between early April to mid-June depending on how optimistic we wanted to get.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;On this front, I have mostly good news to report.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;First, we’ve been able to distribute more of the coronavirus vaccine more quickly than I expected. In particular, Utah being able to get back unused vaccine from a few pharmacies added thousands of extra doses I didn’t account for, and some second doses that we were holding back earlier in the pandemic went in arms instead.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The result is that we are vaccinating more people sooner. Last week, &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/health/2021/02/14/utah-reaches-vaccinations/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;we were able to use 100,000 doses&lt;/a&gt;, whereas my earlier models didn’t have that happening until next week. Instead, next week, Utah is slated to receive about 108,000 doses from the federal government.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Getting shots in 100,000 arms so soon does mean that those people will need second doses more quickly than expected, so expanding availability will be key.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;And in this arena, the news is a little more wishy-washy. The good news is that Moderna announced it would deliver 100 million doses by the end of March and 100 million more by the end of May to the federal government, matching Pfizer’s accelerated timeline. These companies are exceeding their delivery contracts, which means they should meet the pace of &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/2021/02/05/when-should-all-utah/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;my most optimistic model&lt;/a&gt; and Gov. Spencer Cox’s optimistic projections.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;On the other hand, the Johnson and Johnson vaccine will &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/17/world/only-a-few-million-johnson-johnson-doses-will-be-ready-when-the-vaccine-is-likely-to-be-authorized-the-white-house-says.html\&quot; target=_blank&gt;only have a few million vaccines manufactured&lt;/a&gt; and ready to go when the federal government gives the company the go ahead, which should happen in the next couple of weeks. That authorization is a bit delayed; the company would need to pump out a few million vaccines &lt;i&gt;per week&lt;/i&gt; in order to meet Cox’s announced projections of 33,000 J&amp;amp;J doses per week to Utahns by the end of February. My “average” model, which projected 50% of that number, might be more accurate with regards to this vaccine.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Still, with the overall good news, we’ve been able to open up vaccine availability to more groups, sooner. Cox even announced Thursday that &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2021/02/18/watch-live-utah-gov/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;appointments would be immediately available for those between 65 and 69&lt;/a&gt;, about 10 days before they were originally slated to open March 1. On that date, any adult of any age with&lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2021/02/04/watch-live-utah-gov/\&quot; target=_blank&gt; a qualifying preexisting condition &lt;/a&gt;will be able to be vaccinated.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;quote&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;After that? Well, that hasn’t been announced. Utah leaders could open it up to 55+, but I wouldn’t be surprised to see the governor just open the doors to everyone. Either way, we’re talking about realistic vaccine availability to the general public quite soon. I might bet on April for the first general public appointments, with everyone being able to schedule one in May.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Coronavirus variants&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;header&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Of course, we want to know if the vaccines will actually work on the new variants spreading among us. My original article focused on the &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/health/2021/02/14/utah-reaches-vaccinations/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;variant that started in the United Kingdom labeled B.1.1.7&lt;/a&gt;, but now we’re getting a greater understanding of all of the ways the coronavirus has mutated.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;These variants, all mutating in different people in different places, have developed some of the same changes to the coronavirus structure. Those changes — and the epidemiological record confirms this — mean that the virus benefits from mutating in these specific ways. In other words, these variants spread more quickly than what we’ll call “coronavirus classic” in a mostly unvaccinated population.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;There are two families of variants you should know about.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;• The B.1.1.7 variant is the U.K. variant. It is now spreading in the U.S. in a major way, doubling cases &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/07/health/coronavirus-variant-us-spread.html\&quot; target=_blank&gt;every 10 days&lt;/a&gt; and is &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.fox13now.com/news/coronavirus/local-coronavirus-news/third-case-of-covid-19-variant-found-in-utah\&quot; target=_blank&gt;definitely spreading&lt;/a&gt; in Utah. U.S. evidence shows it’s between 35% and 45% more likely to be spread than standard coronavirus. U.K. evidence also showed it’s &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/13/world/europe/covid-uk-variant-deadlier.html\&quot; target=_blank&gt;likely to have a higher risk of death&lt;/a&gt; than the regular virus.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The good B.1.1.7 news is that the vaccines &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/pfizer-biontech-vaccine-likely-to-be-effective-against-b117-strain-of-sars-cov-2\&quot; target=_blank&gt;still seem to work well&lt;/a&gt; against it. Effectiveness might be impacted by just a few percentage points.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;• The B.1.351 variant started in South Africa, and is pretty similar to the P.1 variant, which was discovered in Brazil. This group is more worrisome because studies showed that the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine didn’t work as well against them. In fact, South Africa stopped vaccinating people while it figured out what was going on. So far, we’ve seen B.1.351 and P.1 in a combined 12 U.S. states, but not in Utah — yet.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;But as we know, the Oxford vaccine is less effective than the two mRNA vaccines we have in the U.S. One study compared how the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines performed against the two variants in a lab.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;In the middle of each graph is a common form of coronavirus classic, while the left and right show how many antibodies were generated when the two vaccines were used against the two variants. As you can see, the U.K. variant antibodies saw a small decrease, but the South African antibodies decreased much more significantly.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Still, even these decreased antibody amounts will be more helpful than nothing. Notice the scale in the charts — antibody creation is being cut significantly, but not knocked out entirely. T-cells &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2102017\&quot; target=_blank&gt;should still be created&lt;/a&gt;, too. In other words, the vaccines we have right now still will provide some good protection against&lt;a href=\&quot;https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2021/01/27/vaccination-against-the-new-variants-real-world-data\&quot; target=_blank&gt; this variant&lt;/a&gt;.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The other cool thing about the mRNA vaccine technology is that it should be easily editable. If we want to create a version of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines that specifically target this, or any other coronavirus variant, we can just change the mRNA used while keeping the rest of the recipe the same. That wouldn’t impact the safety of the vaccine at all, so we could skip some of the lengthy trial periods.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;In the coming weeks, we’ll get a better idea if we need to do that. Studies are ongoing for the U.S. vaccines against the South African variant in more human subjects. If it’s still around 90% effective, we probably won’t have to change much. If it’s around 50%, it’s time to develop a new recipe, and might mean booster shots for the new variants would be required — similar to how we get a yearly flu shot.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Vaccines and transmissibility&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;header&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Because the vaccines were tested for their effectiveness in tamping down disease in an individual, we didn’t really know how much they would prevent the coronavirus from being spread from person to person. That meant we had to do &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/2021/01/14/can-vaccinated-people/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;some guessing with preliminary data&lt;/a&gt;.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;But now, we’re getting more evidence that transmission is significantly down among the vaccinated. What’s going on in Israel is perhaps the best example: over half of the population has been vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine, and that country is starting to see real decreases in transmission.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Those vaccinated are in a great spot. Of the 416,900 people that Maccabi Healthcare Services in Israel had vaccinated, only 254 picked up COVID-19 after the second dose. &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/05/world/middleeast/israel-virus-vaccination.html\&quot; target=_blank&gt;All 254 cases were mild, too&lt;/a&gt;.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;But it appears that those hundreds of thousands of healthy people aren’t spreading the virus as much, either. &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/05/world/middleeast/israel-virus-vaccination.html\&quot; target=_blank&gt;Cases dropped 41% in a six-week period&lt;/a&gt;, even among the non-vaccinated.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Even better, &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/pfizers-covid-19-vaccine-reduces-viral-load-study--68439\&quot; target=_blank&gt;a new study this week&lt;/a&gt; looked at how Israelis were impacted after just the first dose, not having yet received the second. And in the 12-28 day period after getting the first dose, even those who were infected had significantly less viral load in their respiratory system, about four times less. That means they’re going to be less effective at spreading the virus.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Between this and the preliminary data that showed a 63% reduction in asymptomatic infections in Moderna’s vaccine, we have a pretty good idea now: The U.S. vaccines definitely reduce transmissibility. It’s probably not 100%, as they appear to reduce severe disease, probably not 95%, as they appear to reduce mild disease, but very likely in the 60-90% range.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;So to sum all of this up: We are getting people vaccinated quicker than originally planned, those vaccines appear to work against the variants or can be easily adjusted, and when you get vaccinated you are less likely to get someone else sick.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;This definitely counts as progress.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;i&gt;Andy Larsen is a data columnist.

It was tiny black rocks embedded in tar. For some reason, my dog saw that shiny wet black tar and decided his entire purpose in life was to run through it and leave his mark. Or more like 840 marks in the shape of paw prints. I like to imagine his doggie thought process.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;i&gt;“I’m a good boy.

The one where we flip our middle finger at the fact my dad had cancer way too young. The one where we fought that cancer for four years. The one where a dear friend recently lost her son to the grip of drug addiction, and another lost her loved one to the pandemic.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Recently, this last friend asked me very honestly and sincerely, “How do I get through this? How do I get rid of the pain? Is there a way?”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;I only had two answers, and they weren’t great. One answer was “time.” The other was, “The only way out is through.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;I feel like we’ve all been through something these last few (four) years.

The ranking combines measures of growth in jobs, incomes, productivity and the technology sector as well as housing affordability and access to broadband.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The annual index from the California-based economic think tank ranked Utah’s capital city fourth in 2021 among its top-tier larger cities, vaulting from 25th last year, and Ogden-Clearfield came in ninth, up from 22nd.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The wider Provo-Orem metropolitan area at the heart of Utah County and spanning the state’s nexus of tech firms centered on Silicon Slopes was a standout due largely to that sector, according to analysts at the Milken Institute, both for its productivity and sheer number of high-tech industries.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The study called Provo-Orem “a relatively new innovations center” but said it offers “a high quality of life and amenities in the mountain region.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Provo Mayor Michelle Kaufusi agrees, saying that with mountains to the east and a lake to the west, Provo is a great place to live. She says it also naturally attracts innovators.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“Honestly, it’s in our heritage to be self-efficient,” said Kaufusi. “We’re all about being creative thinkers in Provo and not [being] afraid of starting and running a business.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Kaufusi said the city is lucky to be a college town that is home to Brigham Young University and close to Utah Valley University. She said the schools produce young, educated hard workers who aren’t afraid to think big.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Kaufusi said her administration has worked hard to make the city business-friendly. She said she is grateful to tech company Qualtrics and home security company Vivint, which were founded in Provo, for choosing to keep local headquarters after they became major companies.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“I’m sure they could have gone anywhere in the world to do their business ... especially as [they] got bigger,” she said of Qualtrics’ founders.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Logan placed second on the study’s list of 201 smaller cities studied, after coming in third last year.

The yearly calculation now also takes into account the percentage of city households spending under 30% of their incomes on housing as well as household access to some form of broadband internet access.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Utah homes still more affordable&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;header&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Cities in the Intermountain West — Salt Lake City, Provo, Ogden, Boise, Phoenix, Denver and Fort Collins, Colo. — saw jobs and wage grow far above the national median, pushing them up in the rankings in 2021. And while many of those cities — including the ones in Utah — are seeing rapidly &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/2021/01/27/sizzling-wasatch-front/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;escalating home prices&lt;/a&gt;, analysts reported, their housing costs remain relatively affordable compared to other U.S. population centers.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The study said significantly lower costs have made Provo-Orem, for example, “a recipient of the tech sector’s outmigration from the expensive West Coast.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Fueled by those new patterns of telecommuting, the migration trend is also thought to be driving a recent &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/2021/02/14/so-youre-ready-go-house/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;spike in housing demand across the Wasatch Front&lt;/a&gt; and in Park City and Summit and Wasatch counties, where home prices continue to escalate and housing inventories are at or near all-time lows.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Kaufusi said her administration is planning 30 years down the road to try to retain Provo’s high standard of living, even as the state’s population grows. She said the city wants to make sure there is affordable housing, that crime stays low, that development is sustainable and that the city retain its community feeling. She said this means planning for more infrastructure and trying to increase high-density housing around transportation hubs while protecting residential neighborhoods.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“It all comes back to baby steps. We have to get the infrastructure in the ground, we have to make sure it is what the citizens want, and then we are going from there,” she said of the city’s long-term planning.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;In contrast to Utah, several California metro areas — including San Francisco, San Jose and Riverside — declined in their overall standings, dramatically in some cases, largely due to housings costs and unemployment.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“This may indicate the outsized effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on so-called ‘superstar cities’ that have suffered the most local job losses,” the study’s authors wrote, “and the migration of high-tech workers to lower-cost areas as they work from home.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Global and national forces, including the coronavirus pandemic, have also shaken many cities’ underlying economic performances over the past year, authors wrote. But the top-performing metro areas, including those in Utah, have managed to leverage what they have to remain competitive from a business perspective, “regardless of the nation’s overall economic trajectory.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“These cities combine steady growth on one hand and dynamic innovation on the other,” they wrote, “particularly through concentrated investment in high-tech sectors that generate positive spillover effects for local communities.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Utah is better positioned after the pandemic&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;header&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Salt Lake City and the Ogden-Clearfield area saw some of the highest leaps in the rankings, although Huntsville, Ala., jumped 49 places to reach this year’s 10th spot among larger cities. That, the study said, was part of a national shift upward in the rankings for cities in the South and Intermountain West.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Utah was the only state to have three cities among the top 10 highest-tier metropolitan areas.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;In addition to past performance, the index rankings also offer a glimpse of how well cities are likely to recover economically from the impacts of COVID-19. That ability to bounce back, authors wrote, “also relies on the alignment of opportunities in high-tech industries and affordable costs of living.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Cities with strong and diverse tech sectors “are more likely to demonstrate resiliency in the face of unprecedented economic upheaval” from the pandemic, the institute said. But at the same time, cities will also benefit in their COVID-19 recoveries from greater levels of economic inclusion by offering “a foundation that attracts additional firms and workers — particularly those prioritizing quality of life.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;i&gt;— Tribune reporter Sara Tabin contributed to this story.&lt;/i&gt;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;}],&quot;credits&quot;:{&quot;by&quot;:[{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;tsemerad&quot;,&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/sltrib/e923835e-e096-4fe7-bd87-ea31d9322b96.png&quot;},&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Tony Semerad&quot;}]},&quot;display_date&quot;:&quot;2021-02-19T03:01:57.889Z&quot;,&quot;headlines&quot;:{&quot;basic&quot;:&quot;Provo-Orem, Salt Lake City, Ogden, Logan, St. George all rank among best-performing cities&quot;},&quot;last_updated_date&quot;:&quot;2021-02-19T12:50:02.529Z&quot;,&quot;promo_items&quot;:{&quot;basic&quot;:{&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;(Francisco Kjolseth  |  Tribune file photo) Traffic moves along Center Street in Provo on Monday, as seen April 6, 2020.

And the bill would cap fines for individuals violating public health orders at $150, down from up to $10,000 currently.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Additionally, the bill says religious services can not be subject to more restrictive requirements than applied to other organizations or businesses. &quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“The one thing that you need to realize is that all the powers that are being exercised by the governor and executive branch or the health department during a long-term emergency are legislative powers,” Vickers told reporters earlier in the week. “And so it’s appropriate that we would have some oversight over those powers.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Sen. Luz Escamilla, D-Salt Lake City and the Democratic whip in the Senate, also endorsed the concept of the bill, noting that she sees the proposal as moving decision-making to people who can be held accountable by the voters.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Pressed specifically on the 30-day requirement in the bill, Cox indicated that the timeframe is one of the items that remains under discussion.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“Whether 30 days is the right number or 60 days is the right number, there is a number in there and we’ll continue to work to figure out which is the right one,” he said.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Most states have some sort of check on executive emergency powers, according to &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.ncsl.org/research/about-state-legislatures/legislative-oversight-of-executive-orders.aspx\&quot;&gt;a roundup by the National Conference of State Legislatures&lt;/a&gt;. It summarizes Utah’s by saying that the governor cannot extend an emergency declaration beyond 30 days without a resolution by the Legislature, but that hasn’t precluded the executive from doing so by issuing new orders.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The bipartisan group also said that legislatures in at least 37 states are considering bills or resolutions that would limit governors’ powers or executive spending during the COVID-19 pandemic or other emergencies.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Cox told reporters that he recognized and respected the ability of the Legislature to make changes to the emergency powers act and agrees that it did not contemplate long-term emergencies like a pandemic. But he noted that the executive branch has the the ability to move more quickly in a crisis than the legislative branch can and indicated that he’s urged lawmakers “to not overreact to something that happens every 100 years.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“There’s nothing quick about what happens in the Legislature, although we do have a 45-day session and a lot happens in 45 days,” he said. “Some — like me — argue that too much happens within those 45 days but it’s a very, very important function and it is their function.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Cox also said Thursday that he recognizes there were mistakes in the way the executive branch interfaced with the legislative branch in the early days of the pandemic and said he has tried to remedy those communication gaps as governor, including with more face-to-face conversations.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;But while he committed to working with the Legislature on the bill moving forward, Cox also took aim at its leaders during his comments, arguing that they could have done more to address the threat of the coronavirus.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“I will remind the Legislature that they now have the ability to call themselves into session at any time and overrule any order that has been done from the very beginning,” he said. “They have that authority now. They don’t need a bill to change that. And I will also note that they failed to exercise that authority at almost every turn because they didn’t want to make these decisions either.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The Senate Government Operations and Political Subdivisions Committee endorsed SB195 on &lt;a href=\&quot;https://le.utah.gov/mtgvotes.jsp?voteid=19869\&quot; target=_blank&gt;a 6-0 bipartisan vote Thursday&lt;/a&gt;.

The date of availability for those with certain underlying conditions will remain the first of next month, as previously announced.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“We will ask for your continued patience as this will flood phone lines and servers and more and more people will be trying to sign up as those slots become available,” Cox said Thursday during a monthly news conference with PBS Utah Thursday morning. “If you can’t find an appointment immediately, keep trying and you will get your turn.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Even before the governor finished speaking, the Salt Lake County Health Department website took down its warning that only those 70 and older could schedule an appointment, and opened up registration on a sliding scale over the next few days.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;oembed_response&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The department said in a tweet that it would allow those 69 and older to begin registering at 6 p.m. Thursday, those 68 and older at 6 p.m. Friday, and so on in one-year increments until registration was fully opened to those 65 and older at 6 p.m. Monday.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The details and appointment signup are available at the county’s website at &lt;a href=\&quot;https://slco.org/health/COVID-19/vaccine/seniors/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;https://slco.org/health/COVID-19/vaccine/seniors/&lt;/a&gt;.

That’s what we’ve done from the very beginning. But we’re also far ahead of the projections that were given in December and even into January. We feel very confident about that.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Vaccine rollout could be slowed, Cox noted, if something happens in the production cycle or the delivery cycle, as happened this week when a St. George shipment was delayed because of severe weather conditions across the Midwest. Those doses should be coming to the state “very quickly,” he said.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;As the state has so far gotten 563,608 doses of the vaccine into arms (a number that includes first and second doses), Cox noted that case counts, the percent positivity rate of COVID-19 tests, and hospitalizations are all decreasing, which is “very good news for our state.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Along with those changes, he said six counties have moved from a high transmission index to a moderate transmission index. That puts eight counties in the moderate level and five counties in the low transmission level.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;But Cox encouraged people not to throw caution to the wind as cases decline and to continue taking safety precautions even in those lower-transmission areas as research shows the presence of more contagious variants in the United States.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“If [state epidemiologist] Dr. [Angela] Dunn were here today, she would tell you and she would have me tell you that it is not a good time to let up on the things that keep us safe and protect us, that will continue to drive down those rates and hospitalizations and deaths, including especially mask wearing,” Cox said.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;He also encouraged people to continue to get tested so they can isolate and avoid spreading the virus if they have it.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;More information&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;header&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The grocery store pharmacies that have been authorized to give COVID-19 vaccinations posted on their websites Thursday that all available appointments this week had been filled.

Utah has essentially been under a rolling emergency declaration since March of last year because of the virus, with those emergencies being renewed by the governor every 30 days.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Lawmakers have been digging into the issue for six months, with small bipartisan working groups in the House and Senate suggesting changes to the law. There’s one phrase legislators kept returning to during a Wednesday news conference to discuss those changes: “checks and balances.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“This is bringing transparency for our constituents. A lot of people throughout this COVID pandemic have had a lot of questions of how decisions are being made,” said Sen. Luz Escamilla, D-Salt Lake City.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The result is &lt;a href=\&quot;https://le.utah.gov/~2021/bills/static/SB0195.html\&quot;&gt;SB195&lt;/a&gt;, which essentially preserves the full authority of the governor and public health officials to respond to an emergency for the first 30 days. But, if the emergency is to extend beyond that, then the Legislature gets involved.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“When we look at the emergency declaration, that’s really about giving legislative powers to the executive branch,” says House Assistant Majority Whip Val Peterson, R-Orem. “Which of those powers do we want to give to the executive branch and do it in such a way that we don’t hamstring them at all, so they still have the ability to respond to any emergency they might encounter.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“For the first 30 days, the governor has pretty much open rein to do what he needs to do now. The same with the state health department or local health departments,” says Senate Majority Leader Evan Vickers, R-Cedar City. “From that point on, we are trying to get the involvement of the Legislature and the public in the process.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;An emergency order could last beyond 30 days only if the Legislature approved the extension. It could not simply be extended by the governor. In fact, the proposal would block the governor from extending an emergency unilaterally. Lawmakers also would have the authority to override any emergency declaration by a majority vote, and the emergency could not then be reinstated by public health departments.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Vickers’ bill would create a new legislative committee with the power to review any requests to extend an emergency declaration beyond the initial 30-day period. If extending the emergency was a no-brainer, then there wouldn’t be much the committee needed to do and the Legislature could move forward with little delay.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“But, if they do need to meet, then they are required to take public input,” said Vickers, who noted there really wasn’t a way for the public to weigh in on the issue under the current law.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“They were weighing in on social media, but that’s not a very efficient way to weigh in with lawmakers,” he noted.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;At the local level, county legislative bodies — commissions and councils — would have power to overturn a local emergency declaration by an executive or local health department, and would make a decision whether such an order could be extended beyond the initial 30 days.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Legislative leaders have been careful to not criticize former Gov. Gary Herbert who was responsible for responding to the early days of the pandemic, including stay-at-home orders, noting that he was making decisions based on the best data available. But, lawmakers have been eager for months to make changes to the emergency statute. Some were pushing to address the changes in a special session last year, but there simply wasn’t enough support.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Instead, lawmakers stress they’ve been taking a more deliberate approach to altering Utah’s response to emergency situations, and have been working with new Gov. Spencer Cox and his administration, specifically Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson, a former state senator.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“They’ve been working with us and helped to make some refinements that are better,” said Vickers.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Cox and Henderson issued a joint statement in response to the legislation on Wednesday, expressing support for the process.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“The Legislature has an important role to play and we believe legislators do not want to hamper the state’s ability to respond to crisis situations. We’re still working through the details, but we’re confident the Legislature will keep the best interests of Utahns at heart,” they said.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;But the political reality is if lawmakers can find enough support to pass the bill with a veto-proof majority, then objections from Cox wouldn’t be a deal killer. Vickers and other leaders have repeatedly said they are hoping the process remains a collaborative one.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The bill was set for a committee debate on Thursday. After that, backers expect full Senate consideration next week.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;}],&quot;credits&quot;:{&quot;by&quot;:[{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;bschott&quot;,&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/sltrib/d116c567-15c2-4250-914c-638eb5af4458.png&quot;},&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Bryan Schott&quot;}]},&quot;display_date&quot;:&quot;2021-02-17T23:57:07.130Z&quot;,&quot;headlines&quot;:{&quot;basic&quot;:&quot;Lawmakers fast-tracking proposed changes to Utah’s emergency response&quot;},&quot;last_updated_date&quot;:&quot;2021-02-17T23:57:07.478Z&quot;,&quot;promo_items&quot;:{&quot;basic&quot;:{&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;(Francisco Kjolseth  | Tribune file photo) Gov.

Emergency orders could be extended beyond 30 days by the Legislature, but they must have a definite end date. If the emergency order is terminated by lawmakers, it could not be reinstated by public health departments.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;A county legislative body also would be empowered to end a public health emergency declared by a local health department earlier than 30 days. And the bill would cap fines for individuals violating public health orders at $150, down from up to $10,000 currently.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;A health authority could ask to extend a public health emergency declaration beyond 30 days under the bill, so long as it provides written notice to the Senate President and Speaker of the House.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Asked by reporters whether the bill would limit the role of public health leaders in a pandemic, Adams said that could be a “matter of perspective” but noted that their existing powers would remain in place during the first 30 days of such an emergency. Afterward, their input would continue, but in an advisory capacity.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“We have many people in the state that give us advice,” he said, pointing to the example of “the Department of Transportation; they recommend speed limits — we set them.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Sen. Luz Escamilla, D-Salt Lake City, also dismissed those concerns, noting that she sees the proposal as moving decision-making to people who can be held accountable by the voters.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Vickers’ proposal would also restrict the governor from taking executive action in response to a long-term emergency, unless he or she informs a newly-created legislative “emergency response committee” at least 24 hours beforehand. That committee could approve or nix an extension of a public health emergency declaration.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“This bill says if an emergency is going to last more than 30 days, the Legislature needs to be consulted and decide whether or not the state of emergency should remain,” says House Speaker Brad Wilson, R-Kaysville&lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The proposed legislative committee would be made up of the current members of the Executive Appropriations Committee, plus other members appointed by the House speaker and Senate president.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Lawmakers have been frustrated with the length and scope of the coronavirus emergency, but have been unable to find a legislative solution. This proposal comes out of discussions between legislative leaders and the governor’s office, which did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. A spokesperson for Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall said she was not prepared to take a position on the just-released legislation. Salt Lake County Mayor Jenny Wilson’s spokesperson said she would not comment until she had reviewed the bill further.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“I think everyone sees the system for emergencies that we have set up just wasn’t built for a protracted emergency,” says Rep. Brady Brammer, R-Highland. “We’re just trying to find the right solution.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Vickers says the bill recognizes that there are instances where the executive branch has to be nimble in responding to emergencies in a way the legislative branch can’t, and for the first 30 days of an emergency, “there’s no intrusion upon that process.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“We don’t want to have a situation where we’re disrupting a chemical spill [cleanup] or some of those other immediate [issues],” he said.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;But after the 30 days have passed, he said there’s a need for more accountability and a more deliberative process.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;A statement released from the House and Senate leaders said the proposed changes “are not a condemnation of any agency, individual or action” and noted the collaborative process the bill went through, though it added that the bill will likely “continue to be refined as the bill goes through the legislative process.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;SB195 has yet to be introduced but already appears almost certain to pass in some form.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Most states have some sort of check on executive emergency powers, according to &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.ncsl.org/research/about-state-legislatures/legislative-oversight-of-executive-orders.aspx\&quot; target=_blank&gt;a roundup by the National Conference of State Legislatures&lt;/a&gt;. It summarizes Utah’s by saying that the governor cannot extend an emergency declaration beyond 30 days without a resolution by the Legislature, but that hasn’t precluded the executive from doing so by issuing new orders.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The bipartisan group also said that legislatures in at least 37 states are considering bills or resolutions that would limit governors’ powers or executive spending during the COVID-19 pandemic or other emergencies.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;script type=\&quot;text/javascript\&quot; src=\&quot;https://sltrib.formstack.com/forms/js.php/breaking_news\&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;a href=\&quot;https://sltrib.formstack.com/forms/breaking_news\&quot; title=\&quot;Online Form\&quot;&gt;Online Form - Breaking News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div style=\&quot;text-align:right; font-size:x-small;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=\&quot;http://www.formstack.com?utm_source=jsembed&amp;utm_medium=product&amp;utm_campaign=product+branding&amp;fa=h,4196536\&quot; title=\&quot;Powered by Formstack\&quot;&gt;Powered by Formstack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;raw_html&quot;}],&quot;credits&quot;:{&quot;by&quot;:[{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;bschott&quot;,&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/sltrib/d116c567-15c2-4250-914c-638eb5af4458.png&quot;},&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Bryan Schott&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;tstevens&quot;,&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/sltrib/552b549d-0874-4a30-a916-6f26498fb3e6.png&quot;},&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Taylor Stevens&quot;}]},&quot;display_date&quot;:&quot;2021-02-16T17:32:01.254Z&quot;,&quot;headlines&quot;:{&quot;basic&quot;:&quot;Lawmakers take aim at limiting emergency powers&quot;},&quot;last_updated_date&quot;:&quot;2021-02-17T00:33:17.794Z&quot;,&quot;promo_items&quot;:{&quot;basic&quot;:{&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;(Rick Egan | The Salt Lake Tribune) Nurses test for Covid-19 at the Test Utah site in Herriman, on Friday, Feb. 5, 2021.&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/sltrib/2EN3LEDSAZESFHE36Q3QT7G67A.JPG&quot;}},&quot;publish_date&quot;:&quot;2021-02-17T00:33:17.550Z&quot;,&quot;subheadlines&quot;:{&quot;basic&quot;:&quot;Bill would curtail sweeping emergency authority of governor and health officials.&quot;},&quot;taxonomy&quot;:{&quot;primary_section&quot;:{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;/news/politics&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Politics&quot;,&quot;parent_id&quot;:&quot;/news&quot;,&quot;path&quot;:&quot;/news/politics&quot;},&quot;sites&quot;:[{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Politics&quot;,&quot;path&quot;:&quot;/news/politics&quot;}],&quot;tags&quot;:[{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;legislature&quot;,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;legislature&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;legislature&quot;},{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Politics&quot;,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;politics&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Politics&quot;},{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Coronavirus&quot;,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;coronavirus&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Coronavirus&quot;}]},&quot;website_url&quot;:&quot;/news/politics/2021/02/16/lawmakers-take-aim&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;OQRKMEMPTJDNTBVH3RNXVOP5D4&quot;,&quot;canonical_url&quot;:&quot;/news/2021/02/16/hospitals-still-ration&quot;,&quot;content_elements&quot;:[{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Mike Bowen’s warehouse outside Fort Worth, Texas, was piled high with cases of medical-grade N95 face masks. His company, Prestige Ameritech, can churn out 1 million masks every four days, but he doesn’t have orders for nearly that many. So he recently got approval from the government to export them.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“I’m drowning in these respirators,” Bowen said.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;On the same day 1000 miles north, Mary Turner, a COVID-19 intensive care nurse at a hospital outside Minneapolis, strapped on the one disposable N-95 respirator allotted for her entire shift.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Before &lt;a href=\&quot;https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-pandemic\&quot;&gt;the coronavirus pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, Turner would have thrown out her mask and grabbed a new one after each patient to prevent the spread of disease. But on this day, she’ll wear that mask from one infected person to the next because N95s — they filter out 95% of infectious particles — have supposedly been &lt;a href=\&quot;https://apnews.com/article/automated-insights-earnings-virus-outbreak-pandemics-1295eae6f73d1870a23cb8e2cb66ad05\&quot;&gt;in short supply&lt;/a&gt; since last March.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Turner’s employer, North Memorial Health, said in a statement that supplies have stabilized, but the company is still limiting use because “we must remain mindful of that supply” to ensure everyone’s safety.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;One year into the COVID-19 pandemic, many millions of N95 masks are pouring out of American factories and heading into storage. Yet doctors and nurses like Turner say there still aren’t nearly enough in the “ICU rooms with high-flow oxygen and COVID germs all over.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;While supply and demand issues surrounding N95 respirators are well-documented, until now the reasons for this discrepancy have been unclear.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The logistical breakdown is rooted in federal failures over the past year to coordinate supply chains and provide hospitals with clear rules about how to manage their medical equipment.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Internal government emails obtained by The Associated Press show there were deliberate decisions to withhold vital information about new mask manufacturers and availability. Exclusive trade data and interviews with manufacturers, hospital procurement officials and frontline medical workers reveal a communication breakdown — not an actual shortage — that is depriving doctors, nurses, paramedics and other people risking exposure to COVID-19 of first-rate protection.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Before the pandemic, medical providers followed manufacturer and government guidelines that called for N95s to be discarded after each use, largely to protect doctors and nurses from catching infectious diseases themselves. As N95s ran short, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention modified those guidelines to allow for extended use and reuse only if supplies are “depleted,” a term left undefined.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Hospitals have responded in a variety of ways, the AP has found. Some are back to pre-COVID-19, one-use-per-patient N95 protocols, but most are doling out one mask a day or fewer to each employee. Many hospital procurement officers say they are relying on CDC guidelines for depleted supplies, even if their own stockpiles are robust.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Chester “Trey” Moeller, a political appointee who served as the CDC’s deputy chief of staff until President Joe Biden’s inauguration last month, said efforts to increase U.S. mask production were successful, but there has since been a federal breakdown in connecting those who need them with this new supply.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“We are forcing our health care industry to reuse sanitized N95s or even worse, wear one N95 all day long,” he said.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Before the pandemic tore through the U.S., the demand for N95 masks was 1.7 billion per year, with 80% going to industrial uses and 20% into medical, trade groups say. In 2021, demand for N95 masks for medical use is estimated by industry sources to be 5.7 billion.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;With the increased demand and prodding from the federal government, U.S. manufacturers stepped in. Bowen’s company, Prestige Ameritech, boosted production from 75,000 N95 respirators a month to almost 10 million during the COVID-19 pandemic.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Still, many hospitals are building their stockpiles over fears of a future surge, and restricting the number given directly to health care workers.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The AP spoke with a dozen procurement officers who buy supplies for more than 300 hospitals across the U.S. All said they have enough N95s now, between two and 12 months worth, sitting in storage.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Even so, all but two of those hospital systems are limiting their doctors, nurses and other workers to one mask per day, or even one per week. Some say they are waiting for the supply to grow even more, while others say they never plan to go back to pre-COVID-19 usage.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Dean Weber, vice president of corporate supply chain management for Sioux Falls, South Dakota, Sanford Health, said the one-N95-per-patient guidelines were established with the help of manufacturers.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“You know, the mask manufacturers are in the business of selling masks,” Weber said. He said he prioritizes safety over cost, but he doesn’t believe these respirators need to be tossed after each use. “We were all, in fact, you know, just infatuated with an N95.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;But John Wright, vice president of supply chains for Salt Lake City-based Intermountain Healthcare, says reusing masks or wearing them longer “would not be appropriate” once they have enough supplies. He hopes his 23 hospitals and hundreds of clinics will be back to single use within two weeks.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;As the coronavirus spread through spring and summer, demand for N95 masks surged to unprecedented levels and the respirators disappeared from stockpiles and distributors’ shelves. Hospitals and distributors looked overseas to fill the need.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;In March 2020, just six shipping containers arrived in the U.S. with N95s in them, and almost all of those masks were for industrial use, not medical. By September 2020, orders had soared — in one month, almost 3,000 shipping containers of N95s arrived at U.S. ports, almost entirely medical-grade.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Federal officials saw the reliance on imports as a security problem and worked to boost domestic supply, The federal agency that oversees N95 manufacturers, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, approved 94 new brands, including 19 new domestic manufacturers, according to the internal government emails.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Over the fall and winter, those domestic producers hired thousands of employees and invested millions in supplies to churn out masks,&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;As U.S. production rose through the fall and winter, imports plunged. Shipment data maintained by ImportGenius and Panjiva Inc., services that independently track global trade, shows arrivals dropped sharply to about 150 in January 2021.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;In Shanghai, Cameron Johnson, a trade consultant at the Tidalwave Solutions recruitment firm and an adjunct business faculty member at New York University, says “the bottom has fallen out of the mask market.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;But the U.S. government failed to help link buyers to the growing supplies. Now some of those U.S.-based makers are facing major financial losses, potential layoffs and bankruptcies.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;In December, Moeller, an appointee of President Donald Trump, grew frustrated while working in the office of CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“(NIOSH) had approved almost 20 U.S. manufacturers to make N95 masks, but had not published any guidance or notice of what is ultimately more than 100 million N95 mask-making capacity a month going unsold,” Moeller told the AP.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The Food and Drug Administration was monitoring N95 supply chains, and received $80 million in emergency pandemic funds “to prevent, prepare for and respond to coronavirus.” Of that amount, about $38 million was for efforts related to tracking medical product shortages.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;But the agency has still not solved the problem. “There have been a good number of new NIOSH (mask) approvals that have been granted,” said Suzanne Schwartz, director of the FDA’s Office of Strategic Partnerships &amp;amp; Technology Innovation. “Yet the access to those new manufacturers, there seems to be a hurdle there. FDA ... is trying to identify that blockage.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Schwartz said the agency is working with President Joe Biden’s pandemic response team and the health care industry to find answers.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The internal emails show that Moeller in December alerted NIOSH head Dr. John Howard about the unused U.S. N95 manufacturing capacity.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;In a Dec. 22 email, Howard acknowledged he was still hearing of shortages: “Apparently, there is a significant domestic production capacity going unused for the lack of orders and we have tried to address this supplier/purchaser disconnect.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;A few weeks later, as a suggested remedy, Howard said the list of domestic N95 manufacturers had now been published for potential buyers. But the list shows up on page 3 of an obscure newsletter published by a University of Cincinnati toxicologist, after a satirical column on “chin warmers,” or improperly worn surgical masks.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;NIOSH was not actively promoting the new mask producers, Howard wrote, saying that “to avoid the perception of inequitable treatment and because of the dynamic production landscape, we have not posted information on our website regarding respirator availability.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Howard, through an agency spokesperson, declined a request for an interview. In a statement, NIOSH also acknowledged “a supply and demand disconnect” exists and said it is working with FEMA and other federal agencies, as well as online sales platforms like &lt;a href=\&quot;http://amazon.com/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;Amazon.com&lt;/a&gt; Inc., to better connect purchasers with U.S.-made mask producers.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“How could this be happening? You have an obvious need, and you have a tremendous engine of supply,” said Tony Uphoff, president and CEO of Thomas, an online platform for product sourcing. Uphoff said that for decades the N95 market was stable, so when the virus upended the supply chain, procurement officers were unprepared to respond.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Meanwhile, the U.S. finds itself in a paradox. The more N95s are rationed to alleviate a perceived shortage, the fewer masks are actually reaching the front lines.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;N95s still appear on the FDA shortage list, in part because of reports from doctors and nurses who say they still don’t have enough. The American Hospital Association also says there’s a scarcity of N95s, citing global demand. But the government shortage list triggers distributors to limit how many masks they can sell to each hospital.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“The concept is similar to when trading is halted on Wall Street,” said David Hargraves, senior vice president of supply chain for Premier, a group purchasing organization that helps buy equipment and supplies for thousands of hospitals across the U.S. “You put the protective allocation in place to prevent folks from hoarding and overbuying, therefore exacerbating the shortage situation.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;But without clear guidance, hospitals are left to make their own decisions.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Some procurement officers are loath to trust masks from unfamiliar suppliers. Others balk at federally approved domestic manufacturers, some of whom charge more than international makers.

They were never designed to be reused,” Hancock said. “Hospitals are going to have to come up with some hard data to back up that a mask built for single use is OK to use repeatedly if there are other masks available. It was one thing when we had no choice.

Holker was healthy, active and had been working her tail off for months, helping to care for the coronavirus patients in her hospital.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Then, in the fall, Holker contracted COVID-19. By Nov. 5, she was admitted to the hospital and days later a tube was inserted into her trachea to help her breathe.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Her condition worsened and she was put on an ECMO — extracorporeal membrane oxygenation — machine, which is used in place of a patient’s lungs during transplant surgery but has become a last-ditch effort to keep coronavirus patients alive.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;On Dec. 6, Holker was flown to Gainesville, Fla., where, if a donor could be located, she would receive a double lung transplant.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Now here’s the good news: On Jan. 20, Holker got her transplant and is on the road to recovery — although after such an intensive surgery, it could be a long one.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The University of Florida is one of just a couple places that perform lung transplants on patients with coronavirus infections, said Dr. John Stringham, surgical director of lung transplant at the University of Utah. There have only been about 15 performed nationwide.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Stringham’s team was consulted on Holker’s case, but the hospital currently doesn’t pursue transplants with patients on ECMO, since the outcomes are so much worse. “She was really, really sick,” he said.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The typical transplant, Stringham said, begins with trying to get the recipient healthy enough for the surgery and identifying a good donor candidate. Once a donor is identified a surgical team will open the donor’s chest, inspect the lungs and, if they’re suitable for a transplant, remove them and put them on ice.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Meantime, another team prepares the recipient, opening the chest cavity and removing the lungs while the ECMO machine functions in their place. COVID-19 can complicate that process, Stringham said, because the tissue surrounding the lung can be inflamed making it harder to cut.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Once the donor lungs are in place, the windpipe and a large vein and artery are attached. When the lungs are inflated, Stringham said, they start to draw in oxygen and turn a bright pink color.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“Once that happens, hopefully you’re able to come off the cardio-pulmonary support and they’re able to breath on their own,” Stringham said. “It’s a big operation. It usually takes anywhere from six to seven or eight hours.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Recovery can take time, too.

Her next goal: Get out of the hospital.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;One of the advantages Holker has going for her, Stringham said, is apart from her bout with COVID-19 she is young and healthy.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;In a recent photo, Holker is waif thin and gaunt, but sitting upright and smiling. It’s a stark contrast to the image of her from December, unconscious in a hospital bed with a tube down her throat and wired to machines with her daughter at her bedside.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“As long as things go well and she’s got a good pulmonologist, she’ll probably keep doing well and have a good, long life,” Stringham said. “She has a good chance of living many more years and having a good quality of life and being able to hike and ski and do all those things we all want to do.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Holker has traveled a remarkable road and she is luckier than some. Of the nearly 18,500 Utah health care workers who have tested positive for COVID, &lt;a href=\&quot;https://coronavirus-dashboard.utah.gov/#risk-factors\&quot;&gt;446 have been hospitalized and 16 have died&lt;/a&gt;.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;It’s a stark reminder of the sacrifices our health care workers have made during the pandemic — the grueling hours, the strain on families, the staggering emotional toll of daily death, the risk to their own well-being, and for many serious illnesses and even death. We all owe them a debt of gratitude.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Thankfully, for Holker and her friends and family, it appears there will be a happy ending.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;i&gt;Friends of Holker have set up a GoFundMe page to help pay for her children’s expenses.

Coming into the session, there was an expectation that there would be a blockbuster amount of extra cash to spend, mostly because lawmakers cut $1 billion out of this year’s budget last spring out of fears the COVID-19 pandemic could crater the state’s economy.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;That didn’t happen. Utah’s unemployment rate is currently fifth-lowest in the nation, meaning income tax revenues did not take as large of a hit as expected. Sales tax collections, too, are outdoing what fiscal analysts believed would happen due to the pandemic.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;But, there are indications the economic outlook is going to be even rosier when those revenue numbers are made public next week. Privately, legislative leaders say the economy could be growing twice as fast as those projections, and they are convinced the amount of extra revenue available to spend will be significantly higher than previously thought.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;That’s not necessarily good news for legislative budgeters as the demands for spending this year are outpacing even the most optimistic of forecasts.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“This is my ninth year in leadership doing budget negotiations, and I’ve never seen a year with this many big requests for spending,” said House Speaker Brad Wilson, R-Kaysville.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;After the revenue numbers are released, the four House and Senate chairs and co-chairs of the Executive Appropriations Committee will essentially lock themselves in a room to hammer out most of the budget. Legislative leaders will join those negotiations later to move the final pieces into place.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;One of the big pieces of the budget that is mostly decided is education funding. Usually, there’s a big push toward the end of the session for money to pay for projected student growth plus a bump in the weighted pupil unit (WPU), the basic unit of education funding in Utah. That was already allocated before the session. Leaders voted to include $400 million in new money in the base budget, which included $122 million to pay for cash bonuses to public school teachers and staffers.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;That shift is the result of Utah voters approving Amendment G in November, which opened up the constitutional earmark reserving income tax collections for public and higher education to also include programs for children and services for disabled people. In the 2020 session, Utah lawmakers agreed to automatically include increases for enrollment growth and inflation in the budget as part of a deal to win support for the constitutional amendment from the education community. The practical result is most of the big pieces of the education budget are already in place before lawmakers begin setting the overall spending plan during the session.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;There’s another big chunk of money, about $274 million, from the federal government that’s part of the COVID relief package passed last year. Legislative leaders want to make sure those dollars go toward helping students who are lagging behind because of remote learning. To that end, &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2021/01/29/lawmakers-target-m/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;legislators added language to the base budget&lt;/a&gt; making it clear that if those COVID relief dollars go toward another purpose, then their annual allocation from the State Board of Education will be reduced by an equal amount.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;That’s not to say there won’t be more spending on public education this year. The&lt;a href=\&quot;https://le.utah.gov/interim/2021/pdf/00001418.pdf\&quot;&gt; final funding priority list from the Public Education Appropriations Subcommittee&lt;/a&gt; equals more than half of all the funding currently available to the state in its entire budget. Legislative leaders believe they’ll be able to fund a big chunk of those requests, but not all of them.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;One unexpected pressure point in this year’s budget is Medicaid expansion, specifically keeping up with growing enrollment. As it stands, there’s a funding imbalance due to enrollment growth. &lt;a href=\&quot;https://le.utah.gov/interim/2021/pdf/00001427.pdf\&quot;&gt;According to projections&lt;/a&gt;, ongoing expenses will exceed revenues by $8 million in next year’s budget and $21 million in 2022. In order to fix that budget hole, the state will have to spend more than $55 million this year to fix that imbalance. But this is more than just a one-time problem.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“Spending on social services is about to outstrip education as the most expensive item on our state budget,” according to Rep. Robert Spendlove, R-Sandy, who says if it weren’t for federal funds to bolster the program, Utah’s budget would really be in trouble.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“It’s not an issue of wanting to help people or take care of people,” he says. “It’s an issue of deciding what our priorities are. Do we want to be funding education or do we want to be funding health care coverage?”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Spendlove says it’s not as simple as a binary choice, but there are only two solutions.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“As far as Medicaid and other social programs growing as a share of the budget, there are only two choices. You can cut the other budgets to pay for this, or you can increase taxes. There’s really nothing else you can do when you have these programs people rely on,” he said.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;On top of that, budgeters have to decide what infrastructure projects they want to tackle next year. &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2021/02/10/what-will-lawmakers-spend/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;There are about $500 million in funding requests for buildings&lt;/a&gt;, which includes more than $300 million in construction that was defunded last year due to budget cuts as part of the pandemic response.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;There’s also a desire to tackle hundreds of long-delayed maintenance projects at state parks, as well as adding an extra track on parts of the FrontRunner commuter rail. Budget leaders say they may use bonding to pay for some transportation projects, which will allow them to shift the expected revenue surplus elsewhere.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;}],&quot;credits&quot;:{&quot;by&quot;:[{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;bschott&quot;,&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/sltrib/d116c567-15c2-4250-914c-638eb5af4458.png&quot;},&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Bryan Schott&quot;}]},&quot;display_date&quot;:&quot;2021-02-15T13:00:00Z&quot;,&quot;headlines&quot;:{&quot;basic&quot;:&quot;Despite a rosy budget picture, lawmakers have more requests for spending than cash available&quot;},&quot;last_updated_date&quot;:&quot;2021-02-15T14:55:02.859Z&quot;,&quot;promo_items&quot;:{&quot;basic&quot;:{&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;(Rick Bowmer | AP file photo) Utah lawmakers will soon gather at the state Capitol to begin the process of setting the final budget for the next fiscal year.

Overall, 77.1% of Utah’s ICU beds are full — a number that exceeds the state’s “utilization warning” figure, but falls short of the 85% “utilization threshold.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Still, this past week was a promising step forward in the battle against the coronavirus, thanks to progress made on the vaccination front. As Utah entered six-figures of vaccine doses administered per week for the first time, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/2021/02/11/watch-live-gov-spencer/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;asked for volunteers to help distribute shots at mass vaccination sites&lt;/a&gt;. As of Friday, 2,100 volunteers had signed up to give their time through &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.utahresponds.org/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;UtahResponds.org&lt;/a&gt;.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The state also began releasing demographic information on vaccinated people. Overall, about 60% of Utah’s 70-plus population has been vaccinated with at least one dose. Other age groups, from 16 to 69, have been vaccinated at 7% to 14% rates — the vaccines that have been allocated to health care workers, teachers and first responders are responsible for those figures. The data also shows that vaccination rates have been significantly lower &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/2021/02/14/robert-gehrke-utah-must/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;in Utah’s minority communities&lt;/a&gt; so far.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;So far, San Juan County has had &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/2021/02/12/remote-navajo-mountain/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;the highest vaccination rate&lt;/a&gt;, with just over 30 doses administered for every 100 residents. Utah County has had the lowest vaccination rate, with about 13 doses administered for every 100 residents — and had &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/2021/02/09/utah-county-had-hundreds/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;unfilled vaccination slots early &lt;/a&gt;last week.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Seventeen Walmart stores in Utah and one Sam’s Club &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/2021/02/10/walmarts-utah-will-begin/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;began administering vaccines Friday&lt;/a&gt; to those 70 and over.

But when they both tested positive for a mysterious disease later called COVID-19, they became guinea pigs for doctors racing to figure out what the new coronavirus was and how to treat it.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Mark Jorgensen became the &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/2020/02/29/utahs-intermountain/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;first Utahn to receive treatment for COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; on Feb. 28, 2020, exactly one year ago. He was sent to Intermountain Medical Center in Murray after testing positive at an Air Force base in California and was among only three Utahns who had the coronavirus at that time. His wife had previously tested positive and was quarantining in Japan.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;At the time, he felt “totally normal” and experienced no symptoms despite the diagnosis.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“It was puzzling to me as to why all this fuss was being made,” the 56-year-old said during a Zoom news conference Sunday, reflecting on his thoughts from a year ago.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Since Jorgensen’s diagnosis, COVID-19 has raged across the globe. &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/health/2021/02/28/utah-coronavirus-cases/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;Nearly 2,000 people have died in Utah&lt;/a&gt;, and more than 500,000 have died in the United States alone. &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/sports/jazz/2020/03/11/live-utah-jazz-take/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;Sports shut down for months worldwide&lt;/a&gt;. Preventive health measures such as &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/2020/09/14/jimmy-kimmel-tweets-that/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;mask-wearing have become politicized&lt;/a&gt;.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;But recently, coronavirus infections, hospitalizations and deaths are largely &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/health/2021/02/28/utah-coronavirus-cases\&quot; target=_blank&gt;trending downward&lt;/a&gt;. People are receiving vaccines. The scientific community and the public at large know more about COVID-19 now than they did a year ago.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Jorgensen said the situation “got real” for him when his test came back positive after he initially tested negative. He thinks he caught the virus while en route back to the U.S. from Asia in a cargo plane. He said the positive, symptomatic patients were separated from the rest of the passengers by only a curtain.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“I’m sure there was a lot of transmission going on,” Jorgensen said.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Once his plane landed, Jorgensen received a test and got his diagnosis. From there, he was taken to a hospital in Fairfield, Calif., that did not have a containment area for coronavirus patients. He remembers lab technicians scurrying out of his room after drawing his blood.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;And moving Jorgensen around was like something out of an espionage movie.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“It felt very surreal — the whole experience,” Jorgensen said. “It was just the police escorts and the precautions and the ambulance and kind of the stealth way they got me into the hospital.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;There was talk of transferring to Oakland, Jorgensen said, but he suggested in passing that maybe he could go somewhere in his home state. That’s where the Intermountain Healthcare facility came in.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“That was kind of one step close to home, so I was excited,” said Jorgensen, who is from St. George.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Jorgensen said he stayed in Intermountain’s isolation unit for about seven days before taking another police-escorted ambulance ride back to his St. George home, where he quarantined for another three weeks — him sleeping in the basement, his wife upstairs.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Dr. Todd Vento, an infectious disease expert at Intermountain, recalled how quickly things changed just in the initial stages of treating Jorgensen. He kept testing positive for the virus, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told Vento that Jorgensen was no longer infectious — meaning he could leave isolation — indicating a shift in thinking on the national level.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“The lesson there is that we learn things, we have to change, we have to adjust,” Vento said. “People said not to use masks. That probably set us back quite a bit. Now we know that the data is incredible for masks, and we need to use masks and we need to accept that.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Jorgensen said the past year has been “uneventful” for him. However, he is feeling some lingering effects that could be attributed to COVID-19. He said he has been experiencing “memory fog,” as well as an eye condition his ophthalmologist believes is related to the coronavirus. While Jorgensen was asymptomatic when he had COVID-19, the number of “long-haulers” experiencing long-term symptoms after being considered “recovered” &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/2020/09/06/utah-coronavirus-patients/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;continues to grow&lt;/a&gt;.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Jorgensen said he has not yet received a coronavirus vaccine and does not know when he plans to do so. While he described himself as someone who “kind of likes to see how it plays out” when it comes to the vaccine, he imagines he will follow the advice of his doctor, who has recommended to him that he receive it.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Even though Jorgensen and his wife probably contracted COVID-19 on that 2020 cruise, he doesn’t regret going on it, he says. In fact, he is currently on vacation in Costa Rica with her in the couple’s first international venture since the pandemic reached Utah.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“Obviously, we’re not letting any fear of that stop us,” Jorgensen said. “That’s just kind of our philosophy of life.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;In Vento’s opinion, COVID-19 isn’t going away. While numbers are down in Utah, there has been a plateau across the county, which Vento said could be due to “sustained transmissions of newer strains.” But that doesn’t mean there isn’t an upside.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“For that reason, I think the reality is it’s probably here to stay,” Vento said, “but that shouldn’t be a fear-inducing statement because we have vaccines, and we even have vaccines now with the mRNA platforms that are already being modified to address new variants.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Vento used the analogy of a marathon to describe that people should not be complacent, even as the numbers of cases, hospitalizations and deaths are down generally.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“Marathons are 26 miles,” Vento said. “We’re probably somewhere in the teens, 20s, who knows? The point is you don’t stop the marathon at that point. You can’t say, ‘Now we’re going to finish the race.’ You have to keep running.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;}],&quot;credits&quot;:{&quot;by&quot;:[{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;avejar&quot;,&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/sltrib/7b5a6415-d88e-47fe-a2ec-6c567526e130.png&quot;},&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Alex Vejar&quot;}]},&quot;display_date&quot;:&quot;2021-02-28T22:14:03.716Z&quot;,&quot;headlines&quot;:{&quot;basic&quot;:&quot;One year later, Utah’s first COVID-19 patient recalls ‘surreal’ experience &quot;},&quot;last_updated_date&quot;:&quot;2021-02-28T23:29:55.016Z&quot;,&quot;promo_items&quot;:{&quot;basic&quot;:{&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;(Photo courtesy of Mark Jorgensen)  Mark Jorgensen, the first Utahn to be treated for COVID-19, takes a ride in an ambulance.

Spencer Cox acknowledged at a news conference on Thursday, where he pleaded with Utahns to play by the rules.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;But Tom Hudachko, a spokesman with the Utah Department of Health, said in an email that the department has determined it’s more important to ensure the process is simple and efficient &lt;a href=\&quot;https://coronavirus.utah.gov/vaccine-distribution/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;for the approximately 275,000 Utah residents who have qualifying medical conditions&lt;/a&gt; than it is to make it overly cumbersome just so “a few others don’t get in line early,” he said.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Requiring paperwork as proof of eligibility would not only “significantly slow the process of getting vaccines into these peoples’ arms,” Hudachko said, but it would also place an “unnecessary burden on health care workers who would be responsible for providing such documentation.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;This shift to more widespread vaccine access comes as Utah’s death toll from the coronavirus approaches 2,000. But the seven-day average for the rate of positive coronavirus tests has been dropping, under both the state’s traditional measure — which still stood above 10% last week — and its new methodology, which hovered around 6% last week. The number of Utahns who are fully vaccinated with two doses topped 225,000 midweek, with that total likely to top 250,000 over the weekend.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;What’s happening elsewhere?&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;header&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;As states begin making larger groups of residents eligible for vaccinations, they’ve taken different approaches to the question of whether to require paperwork to vaccinate people in a priority group.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;It can be difficult to find information on each state’s rollout, but &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/are-you-eligible-for-a-covid-19-vaccine-washington-state-to-launch-tool-rely-on-honor-system/\&quot; target=\&quot;_blank\&quot;&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.nj.com/coronavirus/2021/01/nj-covid-vaccine-people-begging-for-vaccine-in-nj-as-officials-ask-them-not-to-jump-the-line.html\&quot; target=\&quot;_blank\&quot;&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\&quot;https://boston.cbslocal.com/2021/02/17/massachusetts-coronavirus-vaccine-medical-conditions-eligibility-honor-system/\&quot; target=\&quot;_blank\&quot;&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.waaytv.com/content/news/Alabama-using-honor-system-to-verify-frontline-workers-getting-the-coronavirus-vaccine-573705441.html\&quot; target=\&quot;_blank\&quot;&gt;Alabama&lt;/a&gt; have so far reported using the honor system.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;In Texas, health care providers have been told to look at people’s medical records to determine their status for the shots, when possible.

I think would tend to discourage behavior like cutting in line,” said Battin, who is also an adjunct professor&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;in the U.’s medical ethics and humanities program within the Department of Internal Medicine. “All that ‘do the right’ and ‘choose the right,’ that kind of moral teaching might well play a role in the behavior of many people in this state that might not be so true in a more heterogenous state like New York.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Hudachko said the decision was made primarily based on feedback from vaccine and health care providers that requiring paperwork would create “significant bottlenecks.” He said he hasn’t been able to make comparisons on which approach is more effective and noted that several states haven’t yet started vaccinating people with underlying health conditions.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;quote&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Equity issues?&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;header&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;While the honor system poses its own problems, Jim Tabery, an associate professor of philosophy at the U., said he thinks the vaccine rollout as planned is the “ethically appropriate way to go.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“Obviously when you’re thinking about something like this, your mind naturally goes to kind of the vaccine line jumpers or the freeloaders,” he said. “There might be some of that out there, but the question is: What system are you envisioning creating that would weed them out? And would it in fact be a better system?”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Requiring people to jump through hoops to prove they have an underlying health condition could be “terribly invasive” for people with disabilities he said, and it could also pose equity issues in gaining access to the vaccine. Individuals within hard-hit communities of color, for example, may not have access to a health care provider to obtain proof of their condition or might struggle to get work off to get an appointment.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“If you’re dealing with someone [in that situation] who’s got diabetes and you’re saying, ‘In order to get the vaccine, we also need some sort of confirmation that you have diabetes,’ you’re essentially asking them to kind of go see a health care provider that they don’t have access to,” he said. “And so most likely what you’re doing is guaranteeing someone is not going to get access to a vaccine.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Up to this point, it’s been “relatively simple” for vaccination providers to determine eligibility in Utah, Hudachko noted.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The first round of inoculations &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/2020/12/15/health-care-workers/\&quot; target=\&quot;_blank\&quot;&gt;was largely based on employment,&lt;/a&gt; and it was easy for health care workers, teachers, first responders and long-term care facility staff to prove they qualified based on pay stubs or badges. And older adults have been able to “easily provide proof of age with a government-issued ID or similar document with their birth date listed,” he said.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Even so, Salt Lake County Health Department spokesman Nicholas Rupp said there have been a few instances where people have tried to “cheat the system” and have been turned away at a vaccination site.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“Fortunately, it isn’t a widespread problem,” he said. “We’ve had more people genuinely misunderstand their eligibility, but even those aren’t widespread.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The county has not taken a position on the use of an honor system, but Rupp said the health department will follow the directions of the state and governor “and encourage people to be honest so vaccine goes first to those truly at the greatest risk of serious illness.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Vaccine chasers&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;header&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;In announcing Thursday that the vaccines would be open to people with underlying conditions immediately, rather than the March 1 date previously planned, Cox noted that those who now qualify are at the highest risk for hospitalization and death because of COVID-19.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;And he urged Utahns who aren’t eligible not to schedule appointments.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“We have so many more vaccines coming and they’re coming soon but we’re prioritizing these individuals — again based on age and these underlying comorbidities — because they are at the greatest risk of hospitalization or death,” he said. “So if you jump ahead in line, that means there is someone else who won’t get the vaccine as soon as they could have and it’s very possible that they could end up hospitalized, or even worse, dying.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Those who follow the rules “can sleep well at night by knowing you didn��t cheat the system, that you were willing to give it to those who needed it the most,” he added.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Hudachko noted that every Utahn who is 16 and older who wants one is &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2021/02/11/utah-health-officials-say/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;expected to have the opportunity to receive a vaccination by the end of May&lt;/a&gt;. People who are considering gaming the system to get their shot a few weeks early, he said, need to consider that “the person you are skipping ahead of is far more likely than you are to become seriously ill or even die if they were to become infected with COVID-19.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;As the state opens vaccines up to more people, Tabery said the most ethical thing those who aren’t eligible for one yet can do is wait their turn.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;There are legitimate questions about fairness within the vaccine rollout, he noted. But if, say, a grocery store employee felt like he or she should have been included in the latest round of inoculations, the way to deal with that is to contact state leaders to voice that concern — not for someone to take matters into their own hands.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The exception to that rule, Tabery said, is a scenario in which there are excess doses that need to be used and will go bad if they aren’t.&lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/11/17/935563377/why-does-pfizers-covid-19-vaccine-need-to-be-kept-colder-than-antarctica\&quot; target=_blank&gt; Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines must be stored at freezing temperatures&lt;/a&gt; and, once unthawed, have to be used within a certain time frame.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“If somebody were to find themselves in a situation where they just so happened to be at the hospital or at the pharmacy and the pharmacist or the nurse says, ‘Hey, we’ve got an extra dose. This is going to go to waste if you don’t use it,’ then it would be it would be wrong not to take that,” he said.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;It’s likely many people will make these ethical calculations during this phase of the state’s rollout, but Battin indicated that social stigma and disapproval of people who do cut the line will be the primary defense against that behavior.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Tabery said he anticipates there will be times where people cut the vaccine line and that those instances, when identified, will make the news.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;But he’s confident most Utahns will “play by these rules.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“I do think there’s a kind of underlying communal mentality to the state of Utah, which serves it well in situations like this,” he said. “And so I’m sure there will be line cutters. I’m sorry that they found themselves in a situation where they felt like they had to or could do that.

Things are significantly less awful than they used to be! It is far too soon to declare victory, but it is honestly very pleasing to see us take positive steps. And we know the decline is true, because we see it from a variety of sources: cases, deaths, hospitalizations, even the amount of coronavirus detected in our sewer systems, it’s all down. Coronavirus in our state hasn’t been at these levels since September.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;As you’d expect, the decrease in cases also means a decrease in our transmission rate, or Rt. Remember, Rt is the &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/2020/04/18/this-is-one-key-metric/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;average number of people infected by each person with the coronavirus&lt;/a&gt;, and this is one of the most important measures of the pandemic. If Rt is above 1, even by just a little, cases will rise. If Rt falls below 1, cases will fall.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Here’s Utah’s Rt graph over the course of the pandemic, as calculated by &lt;a href=\&quot;https://rt.live/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;Rt.live&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\&quot;https://epiforecasts.io/covid/posts/national/united-states/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;Epiforecasts.io&lt;/a&gt;:&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;div class=\&quot;flourish-embed flourish-chart\&quot; data-src=\&quot;visualisation/5381874\&quot;&gt;&lt;script src=\&quot;https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js\&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;raw_html&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;For months, Utah’s been playing this game with its contagion rate, dancing above and now below the Rt = 1 line. You can compare the last two graphs: When Rt was above 1 for months, cases rose and rose. As it’s fallen below 1, cases have fallen.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;So what’s working? Well, the decrease in Rt can only be due to three reasons:&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;1. People are getting vaccinated — making them immune to the virus. Vaccinations&lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/health/2021/02/19/good-news-biggest/\&quot; target=_blank&gt; significantly reduce transmission&lt;/a&gt;.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;2. People have already caught COVID-19 — making them quite immune to the virus (slightly less than if they were vaccinated). The antibodies also significantly reduce transmission.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;3. People have modified their behaviors — we’re doing things differently than in the months of rapid COVID-19 acceleration. There could be a bunch of factors at play here: fewer holidays in January and February, less travel, government orders, and so on.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Figuring out the relative role of these three reasons is really important. If the biggest factor is modified behavior, then we’ll have to continue doing whichever behaviors are necessary to keep our Rt below 1. If this decrease in cases is because most people are immune now, then we can be more aggressive in removing coronavirus restrictions.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;So which of those factors is playing the biggest role? Let’s find out.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Vaccinated people&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;header&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;This is the easy one to figure out. At this writing, there have been about 420,000 vaccinated with at least one dose of the vaccine, about 13% of Utah’s population.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;That being said, the vaccine doesn’t work immediately. It does seem to work relatively well after one dose:&lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.01.21250957v1\&quot; target=_blank&gt; recent estimates&lt;/a&gt; put it as high as 90%, but that’s after 21 days. In that first week or two, it’s not very effective yet.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Only about 250,000 Utahns had received at least one dose 21 days ago, which is about 8% of Utah’s population. So at this point, vaccinations have probably reduced the number of people who can catch the virus by about 8%.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Now, that doesn’t necessarily mean an 8% decrease in the average transmission rate. We vaccinated a whole lot of elderly folks, who probably weren’t seeing as many people in their everyday lives as many Utahns. On the other hand, we also vaccinated a whole lot of health care workers, teachers, police officers, and so on, who see more people in their everyday lives than the average.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;So far, about half of our vaccinations have gone to people over 60, and half below, according to Utah state data, so maybe those two groups even out. That 8% is just an estimate, but it’s what we have to work with.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;People who already had COVID-19&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;header&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;People who have been infected are significantly less likely to be infected again. &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.15.21249731v1\&quot; target=_blank&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt; followed people for over seven months and found that the protection that previous infection gives is over 90% — hey, just like the vaccines!&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;We’re less sure about how long some degree of immunity lasts, but the evidence here is &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/17/health/coronavirus-immunity.html\&quot; target=_blank&gt;largely positive&lt;/a&gt;. Even if the antibody levels don’t last very long, the responses &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-01143-2\&quot; target=_blank&gt;in other parts of the immune system&lt;/a&gt; can last for years and years — people with the original SARS-CoV-1 saw an immune response that lasted for over a decade.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Overall, 368,601 Utahns have had a positive test for the coronavirus, or about 11% of the population.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;But testing was very sparse early in the pandemic. And at the beginning of the school year, there were all of those &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/2020/10/12/some-utahns-refuse-get/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;remarkably foolish people&lt;/a&gt; who refused to get tested. And of course, there are legitimately people who got it but were asymptomatic — and yes, even people who don’t show symptoms &lt;a href=\&quot;https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/27/3/20-4543_article\&quot; target=_blank&gt;largely get immune system protection anyway&lt;/a&gt;. Lucky ducks.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;So how can we estimate how many people had the virus without getting a positive test? Well, we have a bunch of methods of tracking the pandemic that aren’t as reliant on testing: hospitalizations, deaths, the number of times people Google Search various symptoms, wastewater surveillance, and so forth.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention did &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/burden.html\&quot; target=_blank&gt;this through December&lt;/a&gt; and estimated that only 1 out of every 4.6 coronavirus infections was actually reported to a health department. That ratio, if it stayed stagnant, would mean 52% of Utahns have been infected with the virus. That’s probably a little high, as testing has continued to improve throughout the pandemic.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;A research team at Columbia University built a second model that &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2021/02/06/964527835/why-the-pandemic-is-10-times-worse-than-you-think#:~:text=One%2Dthird%20of%20the%20U.S.%20population%20has%20already%20been%20infected.&amp;text=Nationwide%2C%20Shaman%20estimates%20that%20about,third%20of%20the%20U.S.%20population.\&quot; target=_blank&gt;also found about a 1 in 4 rate&lt;/a&gt; nationally. But even better, they provided state-by-state estimates. At the beginning of February, the Columbia model estimated about 1.3 million Utahns have been infected at some point, or about 41% of Utah’s population.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;A third model, at &lt;a href=\&quot;https://covidestim.org/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;COVIDestim.org&lt;/a&gt;, uses a different approach to estimate that 29% of Utahns have been infected.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Regardless of the actual number, whether it is closer to 29% or 52%, it &lt;i&gt;well&lt;/i&gt; exceeds the number of people who have been vaccinated, and explains the drop in Rt in the past few months to a huge degree — as more and more people caught the virus especially in November and December, there would naturally be downward pressure on the number of people available to catch it again.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Changed behaviors&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;header&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;How do people spread the coronavirus? By hanging around other people, of course.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;So we want to track how much time Utahns spend around other people and how those measures have changed. To do so, we can ask people what they’ve been doing in self-reported surveys, and then verify those answers with real data from their cellphones.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;a href=\&quot;https://delphi.cmu.edu/covidcast/survey-results/?date=20210221&amp;region=UT\&quot; target=_blank&gt;Carnegie Mellon’s Delphi Group&lt;/a&gt; have been compiling data from Facebook surveys that do just that, asking a whole bunch of people every day about their activities. People then self-report if they spent time with someone outside their household, went to a store, went to a bar or restaurant, or attended an event that had more than 10 people in the last 24 hours. They’ve been doing this since Sept. 8.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Here are Utah’s results. Click the drop down to change the question people were asked.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;div class=\&quot;flourish-embed flourish-chart\&quot; data-src=\&quot;visualisation/5382199\&quot;&gt;&lt;script src=\&quot;https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js\&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;raw_html&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;You can see the biggest shift in behavior wasn’t actually at the holidays, but came in early November. That’s when the &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/2020/11/09/how-navigate-utahs/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;state of Utah&lt;/a&gt; issued its emergency order prohibiting people from meeting socially with people outside of their household. This was the one with the scary late night emergency warning on our phones.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The number of people visiting each other outside of their household still hasn’t recovered fully. Even once that order ended, I suspect the seriousness of it taught many about how much spread occurs through out-of-household social contact.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;You can see this pattern repeated in the other parts of the survey data. Fewer people are attending large events than in September and October, fewer people are leaving home for work or school, and fewer people are going to stores and restaurants. The upturn really had an impact on our social behaviors, an impact that’s verified by a look at the &lt;a href=\&quot;https://tracktherecovery.org/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;cellphone tracking data&lt;/a&gt;.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;But how much did it change? Well, about 46% of Utahns spent time with someone outside of their household in the week before the order, and about 33% did after. This week, we’re at about 40% of Utahns.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Of course, it’s not just whether or not you spend time with someone new, but how many people you spend time with. In the week before the state’s order, about 15% of people said they went to an event with at least 10 people in the last 24 hours; in the week after, that reduced to about 7%. Now, we’re at about 11%. A sick person spending time around dozens of other people means a potential super-spreading event.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Overall, I’d estimate the role of changing behaviors to be the second largest factor of the three: somewhat less than the role of those who already were infected, but more than the impact of the vaccine so far.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;You can see this reflected in the Rt graph, too. If immunity was the only thing playing a role in Utah’s transmission rate, you’d expect to see a constant negative slope. But instead, Rt has stayed pretty flat since the middle of January. Well, this data shows us one reason why: people are spending more time with more other people in the last month, after they saw cases were declining.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;We’ll need to keep a close eye on it, though. With coronavirus variants starting to spread in Utah — the variants are somewhat more transmissible — our Rt might be a tad more unpredictable moving forward.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The extremely good news is that the cumulative impact of Utah’s behavior changes and the spreading variants to this point hasn’t exceeded the rate of increasing immunity. So far in 2021, we’ve done a really good job of finding that balance. Both residents and the state Health Department will have to continue to work together on that, but so far, so good.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;We can’t open everything up right away. But as immunity increases — mostly through vaccinations this time, thank goodness — we can implement even more relaxed coronavirus standards.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;So yes, relatively soon, we’ll be able to be able to gather in groups, and yes, we’ll be able to shed the mask. We’re approaching the light at the end of the tunnel.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;i&gt;Andy Larsen is a data columnist.

Like, a heap of dirty diapers on rotten eggs adorned with some radioactive waste kind of garbage.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;We’ve now &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/nation-world/2021/02/22/ripple-effect-loss-us/\&quot;&gt;lost 500,000 Americans to COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;, leaving so many to grieve. That’s more than a &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/past-seasons.html\&quot;&gt;decade of estimated influenza deaths&lt;/a&gt; and is more lives lost than in three of our country’s major wars combined.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The economy has suffered, women particularly, women of color horrifically. Indiginous and low-income communities have bore the brunt of strain and sickness, while having access to the fewest accommodations (but what’s new?).&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Even racoons would refuse this swill.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;And yet, friends, among the amassing detritus, there have been a handful of golden nuggets worth recognizing and working to keep post-pandemic.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Now, maybe it’s just that there’s more light at the end of each day, but I feel like I’m sensing the faintest light at the end of the tunnel. And if we are, in fact, on the downward slope, I want to make sure we acknowledge the changes we made that we maybe shouldn’t unmake.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;With the &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.facebook.com/29001601/posts/10101517300360001/?d=n\&quot;&gt;help of some of my pals&lt;/a&gt;, I’ve started a list. I welcome your additions via email or comments. Let’s make this more complete.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Why didn’t we know this already?&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;header&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;• As grown adults, we had to relearn how to properly wash our hands. And it took video tutorials and celebrity skits/songs to do it. I feel surprised this was a 21st century lesson for an industrialized nation. Nevertheless, can we agree to ride this sudsy momentum for the foreseeable future?&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;• Many professionals are able to do their jobs without wearing uncomfortable clothes (or, in some cases, much clothing at all). Blazers, button-ups and slacks don’t actually correlate with productivity. (And, if my friends are any indicator, pantlessness might be advantageous for morale.) So, unless it’s necessary for the job, let’s reevaluate dress codes. (Side note: Not advocating being pantless in offices).&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;• We have the technology to experience people and events regardless of our locations. Do you have family you love but are unlikely to visit in Branson, Missouri? Have Zoom cocktails with those dears. That performance in Seattle? Stream it with your dog by your side. It might not be as good as live interactions or viewing, but we can access and make accessible more than ever before. And we should! This includes court/legal appearances, parent teacher conferences, work meetings and other necessary gatherings.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;• We shouldn’t go to work when we’re sick. If the idea of resting when you’re ill isn’t compelling enough, we’re threats to others in ways we might never imagine when we’re around them while contagious. Work shouldn’t supersede our care for our bodies and the respect of others’ bodies around us.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;• We should rethink how much we touch each other. As much as I love a good embrace and a firm handshake with eye contact, I’m noticing how we’ve woven a fair amount of physicality — even with strangers — into our social rituals and not everybody wants it. Plus, it’s germ swapping heaven. So, maybe we reserve that for our closer contacts, seek consent and find new ways to acknowledge the beginnings and ends of interactions.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Safety measure that feel like amenities&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;header&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;• I admit, we were having groceries and food delivered long before the pandemic, but this is more than just a convenience now — it’s increased accessibility and it’s mitigated risk. More than serving the lazy, curbside pick-up and home delivery can serve the less-mobile and higher-risk members of our communities.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;• Overcrowding is not just annoying, it’s a hazard. Giving people space on planes, in museums and parks might not allow for maximum profits, but it maximizes safety, comfort and enjoyment. Remember, people can only spend money if they’re alive and have it.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Legit societal shifts&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;header&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;• We benefit from understanding and addressing the unique needs of aging adults and marginalized communities. Pandemic or not, this is that proverbial rising tide that lifts all boats. Let’s continue, as a society (not just certain organizations or people), to prioritize those in greatest need.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;• Teachers, medical professionals and frontline/essential workers deserve our generous appreciation always. They teach (and discipline and nurse and counsel) our children, they care for our unwell and they keep society functioning. More celebratory signs and equitable pay, please!&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;• Significant swaths of society live in poverty all the time. But, if you exist, you deserve a chance to succeed. Stimulus money, or better yet, a universal basic income and a functional minimum wage, should flow consistently to low-income families. Sure, a tiny fraction will use it poorly, but by and large, &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/new-leaf-project-results-1.5752714\&quot;&gt;giving money to poor people&lt;/a&gt; is proving an effective way to reduce food insecurity, increase stable housing opportunities and reduce spending on substances like alcohol, cigarettes and drugs.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;• Childcare and other unpaid family care falls primarily on women, &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/2021/02/16/how-will-utah-lawmakers/\&quot;&gt;costing us equity in our homes, status at our places of employment and buying power in the marketplace&lt;/a&gt;. Seeing the exacerbated results of this due to the pandemic should compel us to address it when times aren’t so dire.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;• Essential healthcare should be accessible to everyone regardless of the ability to pay. We have figured out how to COVID test and vaccinate all who want/need it; let’s do that with all necessary medical care. Sick people aren’t profit centers and healthcare is a human right.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;We have the need and means to solve really big problems (and even small elastic waistband ones), but we have to be intentional.

For example, in the first week that Utahns between the ages of 65 and 69 could make appointments, 29% received their first dose of vaccine.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;As Utah now invites residents with qualifying health conditions to be vaccinated, the state is working on the honor system, he noted.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“Please, please, please, do not jump ahead in line,” Cox asked Utahns during &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zin4soxmmAQ&amp;feature=emb_title\&quot; target=_blank&gt;his weekly COVID-19 briefing&lt;/a&gt;. “If you jump ahead in line, that means there is someone else who won’t get the vaccine as soon as they could have — and it’s very possible that they could end up hospitalized or, even worse, dying. … Those vaccines are coming, and we’re all going to get one sooner rather than later.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Cox also announced that people who are eligible to be vaccinated are no longer required to wait for appointments in the county where they live. If they can find an appointment in another county, they can sign up and go there to be inoculated. They must return to that county, he added, to get their second dose.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;quote&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Sixteen- and 17-year-olds, Cox cautioned, can only receive the Pfizer version of the vaccine, because of federal guidelines. So those making appointments for these teenagers must go to sites that have the Pfizer vaccine.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;He also urged people to keep their appointments, or inform the clinic or pharmacy in advance that they have to cancel. Otherwise, Cox said, “that is a dose that could go to waste.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The state saw a dip in vaccine distribution last week, Cox said, because a shipment of 36,000 doses of the Moderna version was delayed by storms on the East coast. “We are rapidly working to make up the decrease we saw last week,” Cox said.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Cox said Utah has been approved to get 20,000 doses of the new Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine by early next week — pending federal approval of the vaccine, which is expected as soon as Saturday.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine is a single-dose shot, not the two-shot formula of the Pfizer and Moderna versions, which, Cox said, “will help us with some of our harder-to-reach populations.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;State epidemiologist Dr. Angela Dunn said the state is “headed in the right direction,” with the number of COVID-19 cases declining.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“We need to continue doing what we know works with physical distancing, mask-wearing, avoiding large gatherings, and most importantly, getting the vaccine when it’s your turn to get it,” she said.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Cox expressed optimism that every Utahn will have access to the vaccine by late April or mid-May. “In just a few weeks, we’re going to have more vaccine than we know what to do with,” Cox said, adding health officials will then concentrate on encouraging people who are hesitant about the vaccine to get their shots.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;He reiterated the formula for when the state’s mask mandates can be lifted, released in the state’s updated public health order Tuesday: First the state must have 1,633,000 first doses of the vaccine allocated — then add eight weeks. Then, any county in Utah that is designated as having a low transmission rate should have the mask order lifted&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;So far, the federal government has allocated 444,905 first doses to Utah.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Cox expressed optimism that Utah’s mask mandates could gone by the middle of summer.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“I’m telling you,” Cox told reporters, holding up his face mask, “I’m not going to be wearing this on the Fourth of July.

Huge numbers of students finished the 2020 spring semester remotely. Some jurisdictions did choose to reopen schools in fall 2020 and spring 2021, though others have remained remote.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Throughout the pandemic, researchers have studied whether in-person learning at schools contributes significantly to the spread of COVID-19. The findings have shown that if K-12 schools adhere to mitigation measures — masking, physical distancing and frequent hand-washing — then there is a relatively low risk of transmission.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;And getting kids back into the classroom is a&lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/blog/meet-press-blog-latest-news-analysis-data-driving-political-discussion-n988541/ncrd1234195#blogHeader\&quot;&gt; high priority&lt;/a&gt; for the Biden administration.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;In a&lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2021/02/03/press-briefing-white-house-covid-19-response-team-and-public-health-officials/\&quot;&gt; Feb. 3 White House press briefing&lt;/a&gt;, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said data suggests “schools can safely reopen.” The CDC on Feb. 12 released&lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/schools-childcare/operation-strategy.html\&quot;&gt; guidance&lt;/a&gt; on how schools should approach reopening. It recommends the standard risk-mitigation measures, as well as universal masking, contact tracing, creating student learning cohorts or pods, conducting testing and monitoring community transmission of the virus.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;a href=\&quot;https://sph.tulane.edu/epid/susan-hassig\&quot;&gt;Susan Hassig&lt;/a&gt;, associate professor of epidemiology at Tulane University, said science shows that schools can open safely if “mitigation measures are implemented and maintained in the school space.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Here’s some of the latest research that tracks with these positions:&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;list&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Of course, there are some limitations to these studies, which often rely on contact tracing, a process that can’t always pinpoint where cases originate. Some of the studies also rely on self-reporting of mask-wearing by individuals, which could be inaccurate.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Additionally, Hassig pointed out that not all school districts have the resources, such as physical space, personnel or high-quality masks, to open safely.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Sexton’s assertion that schools can reopen leaves out a key piece of information: that safe reopening is highly dependent upon use of mitigation measures that have been shown to tamp down on virus spread.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;‘Stop wearing masks outside’&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;header&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Because the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is relatively new, the research on outdoor mask use is limited. But so far science has shown that masks prevent virus transmission.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The CDC study&lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/pdfs/mm7007e1-H.pdf?ACSTrackingID=USCDC_921-DM49152&amp;ACSTrackingLabel=MMWR%20Early%20Release%20-%20Vol.%2070%2C%20February%2010%2C%202021&amp;deliveryName=USCDC_921-DM49152\&quot;&gt; published Feb. 10&lt;/a&gt; reported that a medical procedure mask (commonly known as a surgical mask) blocked 56.1% of simulated cough particles. A cloth mask blocked 51.4% of cough particles. And the effectiveness went up to 85.4% if a cloth mask was worn over a surgical mask.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Another experiment from the study showed that a person in a mask emits fewer aerosol particles that can be passed on to an unmasked person. And if both are masked, then aerosol exposure to both is reduced by more than 95%.

To be sure, public health experts agree the risk of transmitting coronavirus is lower outdoors than indoors. But the experts also said that doesn’t mean people should stop wearing masks.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“The wind might help you a bit outside, but you are still at risk of breathing in this virus from people around you,” said&lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.mountsinai.org/about/newsroom/2020/rachel-vreeman-md-ms-appointed-chair-of-global-health-and-director-of-the-arnhold-institute-for-global-health-at-the-icahn-school-of-medicine-at-mount-sinai-pr\&quot;&gt; Dr. Rachel Vreeman&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Arnhold Institute for Global Health at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Being outside is “not a guarantee of safety,” reiterated&lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/people/our-faculty/ssm20\&quot;&gt; Stephen Morse&lt;/a&gt;, an epidemiology professor at Columbia University Medical Center. “Especially when those people without masks are close together.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The CDC addressed the issue of whether masks are needed outside in the&lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover-guidance.html\&quot;&gt; agency’s mask guidelines&lt;/a&gt;: “Masks may not be necessary when you are outside by yourself away from others, or with other people who live in your household. However, some areas may have mask mandates while out in public, so please check for the rules in your local area.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Overall, the prevailing scientific opinion is that, while it may be OK to go maskless outside if you are physically distant from others, mask-wearing is still recommended if you are around others.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;‘Everyone at low risk should start living normal lives’&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;header&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;All the public health experts we consulted agreed this part of the claim is absolutely false. It flies in the face of what scientists recommend should be done to get through the pandemic.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;While it’s unclear what exactly the post means by “low-risk” people, let’s assume it’s referring to younger people or those without health conditions that make them more vulnerable to COVID-19.

Moreover, even young people and those without preexisting health conditions have gotten severely ill with COVID-19 or died of it.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Even if a low-risk person doesn’t get severely sick, they could still infect others in higher-risk groups.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The sentiment of this post is similar to calls early in the pandemic to let life return to normal in an attempt to achieve herd immunity. But, on the way to achieving that goal, many would die, said&lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.kff.org/person/josh-michaud/\&quot;&gt; Josh Michaud&lt;/a&gt;, associate director for global health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“Everyone going back to ‘normal’ right now, especially in the presence of more transmissible and more deadly variants, would be a recipe for further public health disasters on top of what we’ve already experienced,” he added.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Already&lt;a href=\&quot;https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/\&quot;&gt; almost half a million Americans&lt;/a&gt; have died of COVID-19.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The push to “return to normal” is precisely what let the new variants form and multiply, said Vreeman. “If we can ramp up getting people vaccinated and keep wearing masks in the meantime, only then will we have a chance at getting back to ‘normal.’”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Indeed, because of the new variants circulating in the U.S., Walensky and Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, have urged Americans not to relax their efforts to control the virus’s spread.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Our ruling&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;header&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;A blog post by conservative talk show host Buck Sexton claims scientific evidence shows that right now we should “open the schools, stop wearing masks outside, and everyone at low risk should start living normal lives.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Scientific research shows that in order for schools to reopen safely, risk mitigation measures must be put in place, such as requiring masks, rigorous hand-washing and limiting the number of students in classrooms. These changes, though, would not represent a return to normal, but a new normal for students and teachers.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The remainder of Sexton’s statement strays further from current science. Research indicates that you’re safer outdoors than indoors, but public health experts still recommend wearing masks in public, even outside. Science does not support the idea that the time is right for some people to resume life as normal. That would allow the virus to continue to spread and have a large human cost in hospitalizations and deaths, said the experts.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Sexton’s post is inaccurate.

The funds &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2021/02/19/new-revenue-projections/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;would come from the extra $1.4 billion in one-time money the state has to spend this year&lt;/a&gt; and would likely be distributed this fall.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Many businesses have struggled to make ends meet during the pandemic as Utahns have been directed to socially distance and stay home when possible to avoid spreading the coronavirus, and &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2020/07/07/nearly-utah-businesses/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;some have received coronavirus aid from the federal government or other grant programs&lt;/a&gt; to keep them afloat.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;But nearly a year into the coronavirus pandemic, not all that need it have been able to get access to government aid.

And we are still in desperate, desperate need. And so we ask that you all support this bill and this program.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Jacey Skinner, executive vice president of public policy and general counsel at the Salt Lake Chamber, said during public comment on the bill that people might be fatigued from talking about stimulus programs and coronavirus relief. And she believes a lot of money from the federal CARES Act went to businesses that “probably did not need it.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“But what we’ve also seen are many businesses, many well-established businesses, that have struggled in ways that in many instances are well beyond their control,” she said. “Many businesses have made significant efforts to pivot and to adapt, and they have worked hard and they followed the rules and they’ve complied with those things that have been asked of them, but have been impacted significantly throughout.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Skinner said she thought Cullimore’s bill was a “narrowly tailored approach” that would provide assistance to those businesses that are genuinely struggling.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Cullimore’s bill, &lt;a href=\&quot;https://le.utah.gov/~2021/bills/static/SB0202.html\&quot; target=_blank&gt;SB202&lt;/a&gt;, received unanimous support from the Senate Business and Labor Committee on Tuesday, after several lawmakers peppered him with questions about how the program would ensure the money would do just that.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Sen. Curt Bramble, R-Provo and a certified public accountant, said he’s sat across the table over the past 12 months with many businesses that felt entitled to getting “free cash,” whether they needed it or not.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“My primary concern is when government starts handing out money, there’s never enough to go around and everyone deserves — according to their own evaluation — their fair share,” he said. “And how do we identify those businesses that really need the grant?”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Bramble was particularly uneasy about a portion of the bill that would allow relief for a business that began operations on or after Jan. 1, 2020, and could demonstrate that it had “incurred expenses and is operating at a net loss due to the public health emergency related to COVID-19.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Most startups die within the first three to five years, with or without a pandemic, Bramble noted, and he worried it would be difficult to tell which had actually been impacted by the coronavirus and which would be struggling either way.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;While more established businesses would be required under the bill to show a loss in revenue from March to June 2020 compared to the same period in 2019, Cullimore noted that wouldn’t be possible for a startup. But there are still businesses that fall into that category that need relief, he said.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Kori Ann Edwards, managing director of operations at GOED, acknowledged there’s “no magic way to know if a company just started up is going to make it or not based on on the valuation of it” but reiterated that the state agency would ask companies to fulfill certain requirements before they received any money.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;As part of the bill, businesses that apply for the grants would be required to sign a declaration under penalty of perjury that their application is complete and correct and to submit to a possible audit. If an audit found that the company had misrepresented its losses, GOED could recapture those grant funds and require the business to pay a fine to the state.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The bill passed received unanimous support in the Senate and now requires one final procedural vote there before moving to the House for further consideration.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;}],&quot;credits&quot;:{&quot;by&quot;:[{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;tstevens&quot;,&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/sltrib/552b549d-0874-4a30-a916-6f26498fb3e6.png&quot;},&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Taylor Stevens&quot;}]},&quot;display_date&quot;:&quot;2021-02-23T17:44:51.415Z&quot;,&quot;headlines&quot;:{&quot;basic&quot;:&quot;$30 million COVID relief package for Utah small businesses gets Senate OK&quot;},&quot;last_updated_date&quot;:&quot;2021-02-23T21:10:29.011Z&quot;,&quot;promo_items&quot;:{&quot;basic&quot;:{&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;(Trent Nelson  |  Tribune file photo) A sign encouraging social distancing at City Creek in Salt Lake City on Tuesday, Nov. 24, 2020.

The bill from Senate Majority Leader Evan Vickers, R-Cedar City, is a response to the continuous state of emergency the state has been under for almost a year in response to the coronavirus outbreak.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2021/02/16/lawmakers-take-aim/801-237-2900/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;As previously reported&lt;/a&gt;, the bill would not impact the governor’s ability to respond to an emergency as it happens, but if the emergency declaration lasts beyond 30 days, then lawmakers could get involved. State and local health departments could do the same.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“We’ve looked back on what happened and asked ourselves the question, how can we do it better next time around? And, that’s a hard thing to do,” said Vickers.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Under the bill, if an emergency lasts beyond the 30-day limit, then the Legislature would weigh in with an emergency response committee, made up of current legislative leadership, plus other legislators who have experience relevant to the situation. For example, lawmakers with a health care background could be consulted during a long-term health emergency. If appropriate, that committee would solicit public input on what comes next.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“We wanted to get the public’s input and expertise on what’s going on with that particular emergency,” said Vickers. “Then we can make recommendations back to the Legislature.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;There’s also a motivation to maintain a check on the power of the governor. During the early days of the pandemic, when an emergency declaration from then-Gov. Gary Herbert was set to expire, lawmakers realized they had little recourse as he could just issue another immediately, which he did.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The bill would block the extension of a declaration, or the issuance of a new one, without the signoff of lawmakers.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“Not one citizen has had a voice in the policies that have been implemented since COVID began,” said Sen. Curt Bramble, R-Provo, saying the restrictions imposed because of the pandemic, including business closures and mask mandates, were never vetted by lawmakers.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“We are the citizen’s voice on policy. Not one citizen has had a vote on this floor of this body representing their voice on these long-term policies,” added Bramble.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Legislators &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2021/02/19/utah-politics-podcast/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;have been careful&lt;/a&gt; to say Herbert responded appropriately to the pandemic and collaborated well with them, but they felt the monthslong emergency gave authority to the governor that should rightly belong to the Legislature.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;There has been some controversy surrounding the legislation, which was made public less than two weeks ago. Gov. Spencer Cox, who has been negotiating with lawmakers over the bill, said last week &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2021/02/18/gov-spencer-cox-suggests/\&quot;&gt;there are changes he would like to see made to the legislation&lt;/a&gt;. He would not detail what those are, except suggesting the 30-day timeframe may need to be adjusted.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;However, if lawmakers can muster a veto-proof vote in favor of the bill, and the Senate’s unanimous vote indicates there’s plenty of support, then Cox’s objections could be moot.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Sen. Jake Anderegg, R-Lehi, said he’s encountered misunderstanding about what the bill does from members of the public who think it is giving public authorities sweeping new powers to shut down businesses that some believe infringes on individual liberties.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“Until this pandemic, we had never seen this used on a mass portion of society or an entire state or entire segment of an economy. We have never seen it used on such a broad scale,” he said. “What we’re doing is incorporating that concept into this bill and defining it in such a way that when the Legislature does intervene, we have the scope of the powers we can use. It’s wholly constitutional and wholly appropriate.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Sen. Gene Davis, D-Salt Lake City, worried the bill may hamstring the governor too much in responding to an emergency.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“We’re a part-time Legislature and the governor is given those powers because he’s a full-time administrator,” said Davis. “I think limiting the powers of the governor to 30 days really raises some questions that we need to rethink.

Pavia added that masks, hand-washing and social distancing are known to dampen the spread of the flu — and taking those public health measures for COVID-19 is “a natural experiment where we’re controlling [the flu] really dramatically,” Pavia said.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The drop in RSV, which stands for respiratory syncytial virus, “is somewhat more perplexing,” Pavia said. A major symptom of RSV is a runny nose, and nasal secretions are a prime way the virus spreads — so masks and hand-washing are likely limiting how much those secretions get around. &quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Kids under age 3, who are most susceptible to RSV, are not congregating as much during the pandemic, with fewer play dates and day care visits, Pavia said. He also noted that older siblings who are learning online or having fewer in-person school days aren’t bringing as many viruses home.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;All that explains why RSV numbers would drop, Pavia said, but not why “it’s practically zero across the nation.” &quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;One theory experts are discussing, though there’s not a lot of evidence to support it yet, Pavia said, “is that viruses interfere with each other. And when one virus dominates the jungle, it forces all the other animals out, essentially. … Viruses have these weird interplays that we don’t fully understand.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Those low rates of flu and RSV aren’t likely to last into next year, Pavia said.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“It’s very likely that when both flu and RSV have been away for a while, you’ll have more people fully susceptible to it,” Pavia said. “So when it arrives, it spreads more dramatically and we see more severe disease.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Flu rates tend to oscillate, Pavia said, with a mild year often followed by a severe one. RSV, on the other hand, “depends a lot on, every year, having a new crop of babies who are completely susceptible to RSV. In Utah, that’s another 50,000 good hosts for the virus to attack. This year, we’re going to have a whole year of infants who never saw RSV. So next year, we’ll have twice as many naive infants who are susceptible to it.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Doctors in Western Australia, Pavia said, noticed that RSV was largely absent there in June and July — when it’s winter in the southern hemisphere — while the country brought its COVID-19 spread under control.

Stronger beer is sold in state-run liquor stores.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Another item HB371 does not tackle is Utah’s shortage of bar licenses.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The state currently has seven businesses waiting for bar licenses, but the next permit won’t become available until April. Business owners as well as members of the state liquor commission say the delay could be remedied if the Legislature lowered the population ratio now in state code. Currently, Utah can have one bar for every 10,200 residents.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;HB371 — which is 83 pages long — makes several other tweaks to state alcohol code, such as:&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;• Allowing hotels built within “a community reinvestment project area” to qualify for state liquor licenses — even if they are located close to a school, church and other community location. This provision is specifically designed to help the &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/2020/01/04/construction-salt-lake/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;26-story convention center hotel being built in downtown Salt Lake City&lt;/a&gt;. It doesn’t meet the current distance requirement under the law. The hotel would qualify as long as the bars, restaurants and other liquor sales areas are on the upper floors and not accessible from street level.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;• Changing the definition of a “small brewer” and creating a tiered markup for independent producers — such as Uinta Brewing Co. — that make between 40,000 and 60,000 barrels of beer each year.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;b&gt;Correction&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt; • &lt;/i&gt;Feb. 22, 9:45 a.m.: This bill would allow consumers to order beer online for pick up inside stores.

Only North Dakota and South Dakota (13,025 and 12,566, respectively) and Rhode Island (11,624) have a higher rate of infection among their residents.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;In addition, the Utah Health Department reported Sunday that 10 more people have died from COVID-19. That brings the state’s total death toll to 1,852.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The arrival of the vaccine no doubt has had a positive influence on the rate of transmission within the state.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;While its primary benefit is protecting people from the worst manifestations of COVID-19, The Salt Lake Tribune’s Andy Larsen recently reported that the &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/health/2021/02/19/good-news-biggest/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;vaccine appears to limit a person’s ability to spread the virus&lt;/a&gt; as well.

Elementary students are learning how to name their emotions during circle times in the mornings, while teens delve into relationship skills not just in health class, but also in advisory periods and even driver’s ed.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;This type of curriculum, called social emotional learning, is being added and expanded at Utah schools this year, helping students understand and manage emotions, build positive relationships, make responsible decisions and show empathy for others.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;And there’s no time like a pandemic for students to learn resiliency, goal setting and how to breathe or move through stress and anxiety.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;If they were tiptoeing into social emotional learning before the coronavirus, now educators are racing to implement programs that have shown evidence they can reduce disciplinary problems, boost grades and improve morale.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“COVID just ramped everything up as far as what we needed to do,” says Kathleen Chronister, Davis School District’s social emotional learning director. “Everybody needs to have some skills to manage this new and changing environment.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The state Board of Education encourages social emotional learning. And most districts are teaching it, accelerated in part by $27 million set aside by the Legislature in 2019 to create mental health programs to improve student safety, engagement, culture and academics.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Here are some programs and pilots underway:&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Opening wellness centers inside schools&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;header&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;A classroom at Monte Vista Elementary in the Jordan School District has been transformed into a Wellness Center, where students who feel sad, anxious, upset or distracted find a space to take a breath, identify their emotions and choose a tool to help them refocus. That may be building with Legos, sitting alone in a tepee or reading a book.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;After 10 minutes, the South Jordan students head back to class, calm and ready to learn.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“It’s never a way to get out of work. It’s a way to help them better prepare to get the work done,” says Jodee Packer, the school’s social emotional specialist who oversees the center.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Such centers are gaining in popularity in Utah. Canyons District is creating wellness rooms in 18 of its schools. Davis, Salt Lake and Jordan districts use them as well.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Monte Vista’s center opened in the fall and already is showing results. Principal Nanette Ririe estimates that 10 to 15 students had been referred to her office for aggressive behavior this school year, compared to around 50 last year — a “phenomenal” drop that happened even as she and teachers are seeing students who are uneasier than ever because of the pandemic.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Students pick up on their parents’ anxieties, over finances and politics and fear of the coronavirus. “There’s more anxiety,” says school psychologist Lisa Stillman. Students may notice a missing friend and wonder, “Do they have COVID and are they going to die, are they coming back?”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;As of mid-January, the center had averaged 22 students a day, for over 1,200 visits since mid-August. By mid-February, it had reached just over 1,500 visits, Packer said. Children can ask to go to the center, or a teacher can refer them if they notice a fidgeting, distracted or wound-up student who seems to need the break.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Packer asks them to identify their emotions coming in and going out. Almost half report feeling sad, depressed, tired, sick, bored or disappointed coming in, followed by a category that includes distracted, annoyed, embarrassed or nervous. Nearly 100 percent report feeling better (happy, proud, calm, content or thankful) and ready to learn at the end of their visit.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The goal is to get the students in the center before they escalate to feeling angry, stressed, aggressive or out of control. That requires helping them learn how to recognize their emotions and what those emotions feel like in their body (racing heartbeat, getting teary, clenching fists).&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The school teaches students about self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationship skills and decision-making. It uses its own curriculum based on tools from&lt;a href=\&quot;https://casel.org/about-2/\&quot;&gt; The Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning&lt;/a&gt; and a curriculum for sixth graders bought by the district after a series of&lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/2018/04/04/were-racking-our-brains-a-series-of-teen-suicides-has-left-the-herriman-high-school-community-searching-for-answers/\&quot;&gt; suicides at Herriman High School in 2018&lt;/a&gt;.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;At the beginning of the year, first graders who visited would come in missing their moms, Packer said. Through the lessons on emotions, they now come in saying, “I’m stressed out about math or Chinese [the school includes Chinese immersion] or whatever it is and that is making me miss mom and I need help,” Packer says. “That is amazing that first graders can identify the transfer of emotion.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Asking questions to support positive discipline&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;header&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Sixth grade teacher Cindi Dunford never would have gotten to the heart of why a student was causing disruptions in her class if she had reacted in the standard way and asked him to stop it or else go to the office. Instead, she pulled him aside and tried the positive discipline skills she is now teaching others to use at Granite Park Junior High in South Salt Lake.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Dunford pointed out to the student that he seemed distracted and anxious and asked what he could do to help himself focus. He acknowledged he missed his mother, who was working double shifts at the time, so he never got to see her. Using “results-based coaching,” Dunford asked him what he could do about it. Empowered to find a solution, he decided to call his mother at lunch each day.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“Students are trying to communicate to us through their behavior,” she says. “There are ways we can communicate back to them that are more effective than rewards and punishments. … I wanted to have a better approach that’s more respectful to my students and their differences.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;With help with her colleagues, Dunford earned a grant from United Way of Salt Lake to implement her ideas, which use methods in the books “&lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Escalate-Calm-Angry-Person-Seconds/dp/1582706557\&quot; target=_blank&gt;De-Escalate: How to Calm an Angry Person in 90 Seconds or Less&lt;/a&gt;” by Douglas E. Noll and “&lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/220225/positive-discipline-in-the-classroom-by-jane-nelsen-edd-lynn-lott-ma-and-h-stephen-glenn/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;Positive Discipline in the Classroom&lt;/a&gt;” by Jane Nelsen, Lynn Lott and H. Stephen Glenn. They’re offering book studies and workshops for some teachers and counselors at her Granite District school in this pilot year.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Already the program is contributing to a plummet in the number of major problems referred to the principal’s office, from 901 to 237 in the first semester. That’s occurred as the number of students attending in person has remained the same as last year, because sixth grade was added to the school.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Dunford said rewards and punishments can work in the short term to get students to complete tasks. But they aren’t the best way to build the intrinsic motivation that drives students to want to learn.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;She tries to find the why behind such problems as seeking attention or avoiding work, while giving students the language to label their feelings and the tools to fix their behavior. Recognizing different perspectives is important in a school like hers, where a large number of immigrants and refugees attend, she said.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;For example, one student who was suspended for fighting explained he came from a culture where disagreements were handled with fights, and then the quarreling students were able to move on.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“This approach can address equity issues,” Dunford says. “If we’re looking at each child as an individual with their own private logic about why they’re doing this, it will make it easier for us to differentiate their instruction to meet those needs no matter who they are.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Using Second Step curriculum&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;header&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;When children on the playground at Midvalley Elementary School in Midvale disagree about whether a ball went out of bounds, they don’t fight or seek a recess aide for help. They play roshambo, (another name for rock, paper, scissors) and get back to the game, knowing that “being friends is more important than being right,” says Principal Tamra Baker.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;And when a first grader recently was hurt by something a classmate said, she and her friends formed a circle to work through their feelings. “The brilliance of it is they don’t go back to it,” Baker adds. “They’ve healed the relationship.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The peaceful negotiations are the result of a variety of measures taken by the Canyons School District to boost social emotional learning. They include circle time/morning meetings to check in with each student as a group, along with the &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.secondstep.org/what-is-second-step\&quot; target=_blank&gt;national Second Step curriculum&lt;/a&gt; developed by the nonprofit Committee for Children in Seattle, which the district will have implemented in all elementary and middle schools by next year. A high school curriculum is in the works, too.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Second Step also is used by the Murray, Jordan and Salt Lake City school districts, and the program provides weekly lessons to teach skills for learning empathy, problem-solving and emotional regulation.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Midvalley Elementary has used Second Step for four years. The school tackles a concept each month, with whole-school assemblies to bring all students on board. The school recently finished lessons on emotion management, helping kids name their feelings and find ways to calm down, like belly breathing.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Teachers often include the month’s concept in their morning meetings, where every student is greeted by name and each has a chance to share what’s going on in their lives, from being upset that a cat died to being super excited about a new baby brother, says BJ Weller, director of the district’s responsive services.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;He says students who can express those emotions early in the day are able to focus on school and learning. The curriculum includes catchy songs explaining big concepts like empathy and compassion that students hum in the halls, Baker says.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“One of the keys to having a healthy school is having healthy relationships,” she says. “Second Step excels at teaching kids the skills they need to build relationships with peers and with adults.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Trying telehealth&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;header&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The pandemic has exacerbated anxiety and depression among some children and teens, who can feel lonely and confused about what’s happening. That’s why the Salt Lake City School District expanded its partnership with Odyssey House to offer telehealth therapy to all students.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The web-based therapy sessions started in the summer and have continued through the school year, for the state’s only district in which &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/education/2020/07/30/salt-lake-city-schools/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;all of the students were attending school online&lt;/a&gt; before &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/education/2021/01/25/elementary-students-are/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;a shift began in January&lt;/a&gt;. But even as students return to the classroom, telehealth is expected to remain an option for those who prefer the convenience, removing another barrier to accessing mental health care.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Grants allowed Odyssey to hire four mental health professionals to build on the services provided by counselors and social workers who work at every city school. Odyssey staffers have met virtually with 77 students in 17 of the city schools.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Cami Clark, Odyssey’s director of youth services, says students whose parents have sought treatment may be depressed, anxious or angry. Even though counselors aren’t able to meet in person, they are establishing strong relationships online to help struggling students.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“They get very creative as far as engaging even 6- and 7-year-olds,” she said, with therapists asking parents to have art supplies at the ready for them to do “expressive therapy” online.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Stacey Lindsay, district counselor specialist, said staffers are being asked to watch for students who may be struggling and need additional help as they return to the classroom after almost a year of remote learning.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“I would describe the pandemic as a traumatic event in all of our lives. There’s been some loss whether you’ve lost a parent or lost some freedoms or your ability to predict what’s coming next,” she said. “If you’re not putting in these supports to help kids feel safe, feel calm, feel supported and connected, then their learning is really impacted.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The Jordan District also offers telehealth counseling. And school counselors have been trained in BRISC, or brief intervention strategy for school clinicians, to offer four to six intensive evidence-based counseling sessions. If students need additional help, the district refers them to counselors in the community for up to eight sessions paid by the district through a state grant. If parents can’t afford more, the district will pay for up to eight more sessions.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“School counselors are making referrals on a daily basis,” says Stacee Worthen, Jordan’s secondary counselor specialist.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The district’s 100 counselors have logged more than 17,000 meetings with students for mental health, on track to surpass the nearly 28,000 visits last school year. Worthen attributes the growth to the ways the pandemic has upended teens’ lives, from whether or not their school is closed or they are in quarantine, to how their traditional outlets like sports and extracurriculars have been canceled or altered.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Add political unrest and “there is a lot of uncertainty. Helping them to be resilient and giving them solid coping skills is dependent on the adults in the building,” she says. “There are some studies that show outside of parents, your school counselor is the person those kids are going to talk to about some of those issues.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Adding mindful movement&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;header&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;When the Davis School District decided to implement social emotional learning, it focused first on adults, knowing that it needed to help staffers — from educators to secretaries to bus drivers — work on self-care, because their jobs are so demanding. Plus, adults who can prioritize their own health and well-being are better able to help their students.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The district implemented Pure Edge, training staffers how to use breath and movement to calm their minds and focus their attention. The timing couldn’t have been better — before the pandemic hit and stress skyrocketed, says Chronister, whose goal is to make social emotional learning “something we do everyday, all day … to develop a culture and climate that is respectful and inclusive and creates the best learning environment for our students.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Students can be given a “mindful minute” at the start of the school day to check in with themselves, mindful breathing exercises to settle as they transition between classes, and a brain break during longer lessons or before a test. And Pure Edge suggests a one- to two-minute gratitude reflection as they end the day.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“Even those little brain breaks make a huge difference,” says Nicole Deaton, a health teacher at Shoreline Junior High in Layton. She implements the breathing and movement work in her classes as well as during the school’s advisory periods, where students also learn a curriculum called Move This World, which incorporates movement, too.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Students report using some of the techniques, like “starfish breathing” (where they trace the outline of their hand as they breathe) to settle before doing homework or a test.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“It’s not just the content we teach,” Deaton says, “ ... we’re teaching a child, and we need to teach the whole child.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;i&gt;Heather May is a freelance writer in Salt Lake City and can be reached at &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=\&quot;mailto:heathermayslc@gmail.com\&quot; target=_blank&gt;&lt;i&gt;heathermayslc@gmail.com&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;i&gt;Correction, 9 p.m. Feb. 21, 2021: This story has been updated to correct the number of student visits to the Wellness Center at Monte Vista Elementary. &lt;/i&gt;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;}],&quot;credits&quot;:{&quot;by&quot;:[{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Heather May | Special to The Tribune&quot;}]},&quot;display_date&quot;:&quot;2021-02-19T14:07:11.134Z&quot;,&quot;headlines&quot;:{&quot;basic&quot;:&quot;COVID-19 is fueling innovation in Utah schools to help students focus and cope &quot;},&quot;last_updated_date&quot;:&quot;2021-02-22T04:07:13.930Z&quot;,&quot;promo_items&quot;:{&quot;basic&quot;:{&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;(Rick Egan | The Salt Lake Tribune) Olivia Harmon waves her arms with her class in movement exercises, at the beginning of Nicole Deaton&#x27;s 8th grade health class at Shoreline Junior High in Layton, on Wednesday, Feb. 3, 2021.&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/sltrib/5NFSYG3UJNANVBMF3GBSRDLVMY.JPG&quot;}},&quot;publish_date&quot;:&quot;2021-02-22T04:07:13.667Z&quot;,&quot;subheadlines&quot;:{&quot;basic&quot;:&quot;Supporters say social-emotional learning helps students manage stress while reducing disciplinary problems, boosting grades and morale.&quot;},&quot;taxonomy&quot;:{&quot;primary_section&quot;:{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;/news/education&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Education&quot;,&quot;parent_id&quot;:&quot;/news&quot;,&quot;path&quot;:&quot;/news/education&quot;},&quot;sites&quot;:[{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Education&quot;,&quot;path&quot;:&quot;/news/education&quot;},{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;News&quot;,&quot;path&quot;:&quot;/news&quot;}],&quot;tags&quot;:[{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Walton grant&quot;,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;walton&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Walton&quot;},{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Coronavirus&quot;,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;coronavirus&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Coronavirus&quot;}]},&quot;website_url&quot;:&quot;/news/education/2021/02/19/covid-is-fueling&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;UF4S36AYDVCF3O6U6IOFVQ77UM&quot;,&quot;canonical_url&quot;:&quot;/news/health/2021/02/19/good-news-biggest&quot;,&quot;content_elements&quot;:[{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;There aren’t a lot of silver linings to the pandemic.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;One of them, from my eyes, is learning the speed at which the scientific community can progress when highly focused on a problem. Remarkably, we invented, tested, began manufacturing and distributing multiple very safe and effective coronavirus vaccines in under 12 months. It is wildly impressive that we did this. Yay, science!&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;But that speed also means that my articles from recent weeks need a bit of an update, because we’re learning so much so fast. In particular, I’ve written about three topics that I wanted to share the latest info about:&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;• How quickly will &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/2021/02/05/when-should-all-utah/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;vaccine manufacturing ramp up&lt;/a&gt; and when can you get one?&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;• What impact will the &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/2020/12/27/what-you-should-know/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;new coronavirus variants&lt;/a&gt; have on the pandemic?&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;• How much &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/2021/01/14/can-vaccinated-people/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;can you still spread COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; even if you’ve been vaccinated?&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Let’s dive in.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Vaccine distribution&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;header&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;To recap, I created some models to help identify when the general public in Utah may get the vaccine and I was able to narrow it down to somewhere between early April to mid-June depending on how optimistic we wanted to get.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;On this front, I have mostly good news to report.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;First, we’ve been able to distribute more of the coronavirus vaccine more quickly than I expected. In particular, Utah being able to get back unused vaccine from a few pharmacies added thousands of extra doses I didn’t account for, and some second doses that we were holding back earlier in the pandemic went in arms instead.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The result is that we are vaccinating more people sooner. Last week, &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/health/2021/02/14/utah-reaches-vaccinations/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;we were able to use 100,000 doses&lt;/a&gt;, whereas my earlier models didn’t have that happening until next week. Instead, next week, Utah is slated to receive about 108,000 doses from the federal government.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Getting shots in 100,000 arms so soon does mean that those people will need second doses more quickly than expected, so expanding availability will be key.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;And in this arena, the news is a little more wishy-washy. The good news is that Moderna announced it would deliver 100 million doses by the end of March and 100 million more by the end of May to the federal government, matching Pfizer’s accelerated timeline. These companies are exceeding their delivery contracts, which means they should meet the pace of &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/2021/02/05/when-should-all-utah/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;my most optimistic model&lt;/a&gt; and Gov. Spencer Cox’s optimistic projections.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;On the other hand, the Johnson and Johnson vaccine will &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/17/world/only-a-few-million-johnson-johnson-doses-will-be-ready-when-the-vaccine-is-likely-to-be-authorized-the-white-house-says.html\&quot; target=_blank&gt;only have a few million vaccines manufactured&lt;/a&gt; and ready to go when the federal government gives the company the go ahead, which should happen in the next couple of weeks. That authorization is a bit delayed; the company would need to pump out a few million vaccines &lt;i&gt;per week&lt;/i&gt; in order to meet Cox’s announced projections of 33,000 J&amp;amp;J doses per week to Utahns by the end of February. My “average” model, which projected 50% of that number, might be more accurate with regards to this vaccine.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Still, with the overall good news, we’ve been able to open up vaccine availability to more groups, sooner. Cox even announced Thursday that &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2021/02/18/watch-live-utah-gov/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;appointments would be immediately available for those between 65 and 69&lt;/a&gt;, about 10 days before they were originally slated to open March 1. On that date, any adult of any age with&lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2021/02/04/watch-live-utah-gov/\&quot; target=_blank&gt; a qualifying preexisting condition &lt;/a&gt;will be able to be vaccinated.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;quote&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;After that? Well, that hasn’t been announced. Utah leaders could open it up to 55+, but I wouldn’t be surprised to see the governor just open the doors to everyone. Either way, we’re talking about realistic vaccine availability to the general public quite soon. I might bet on April for the first general public appointments, with everyone being able to schedule one in May.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Coronavirus variants&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;header&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Of course, we want to know if the vaccines will actually work on the new variants spreading among us. My original article focused on the &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/health/2021/02/14/utah-reaches-vaccinations/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;variant that started in the United Kingdom labeled B.1.1.7&lt;/a&gt;, but now we’re getting a greater understanding of all of the ways the coronavirus has mutated.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;These variants, all mutating in different people in different places, have developed some of the same changes to the coronavirus structure. Those changes — and the epidemiological record confirms this — mean that the virus benefits from mutating in these specific ways. In other words, these variants spread more quickly than what we’ll call “coronavirus classic” in a mostly unvaccinated population.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;There are two families of variants you should know about.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;• The B.1.1.7 variant is the U.K. variant. It is now spreading in the U.S. in a major way, doubling cases &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/07/health/coronavirus-variant-us-spread.html\&quot; target=_blank&gt;every 10 days&lt;/a&gt; and is &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.fox13now.com/news/coronavirus/local-coronavirus-news/third-case-of-covid-19-variant-found-in-utah\&quot; target=_blank&gt;definitely spreading&lt;/a&gt; in Utah. U.S. evidence shows it’s between 35% and 45% more likely to be spread than standard coronavirus. U.K. evidence also showed it’s &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/13/world/europe/covid-uk-variant-deadlier.html\&quot; target=_blank&gt;likely to have a higher risk of death&lt;/a&gt; than the regular virus.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The good B.1.1.7 news is that the vaccines &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/pfizer-biontech-vaccine-likely-to-be-effective-against-b117-strain-of-sars-cov-2\&quot; target=_blank&gt;still seem to work well&lt;/a&gt; against it. Effectiveness might be impacted by just a few percentage points.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;• The B.1.351 variant started in South Africa, and is pretty similar to the P.1 variant, which was discovered in Brazil. This group is more worrisome because studies showed that the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine didn’t work as well against them. In fact, South Africa stopped vaccinating people while it figured out what was going on. So far, we’ve seen B.1.351 and P.1 in a combined 12 U.S. states, but not in Utah — yet.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;But as we know, the Oxford vaccine is less effective than the two mRNA vaccines we have in the U.S. One study compared how the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines performed against the two variants in a lab.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;In the middle of each graph is a common form of coronavirus classic, while the left and right show how many antibodies were generated when the two vaccines were used against the two variants. As you can see, the U.K. variant antibodies saw a small decrease, but the South African antibodies decreased much more significantly.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Still, even these decreased antibody amounts will be more helpful than nothing. Notice the scale in the charts — antibody creation is being cut significantly, but not knocked out entirely. T-cells &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2102017\&quot; target=_blank&gt;should still be created&lt;/a&gt;, too. In other words, the vaccines we have right now still will provide some good protection against&lt;a href=\&quot;https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2021/01/27/vaccination-against-the-new-variants-real-world-data\&quot; target=_blank&gt; this variant&lt;/a&gt;.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The other cool thing about the mRNA vaccine technology is that it should be easily editable. If we want to create a version of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines that specifically target this, or any other coronavirus variant, we can just change the mRNA used while keeping the rest of the recipe the same. That wouldn’t impact the safety of the vaccine at all, so we could skip some of the lengthy trial periods.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;In the coming weeks, we’ll get a better idea if we need to do that. Studies are ongoing for the U.S. vaccines against the South African variant in more human subjects. If it’s still around 90% effective, we probably won’t have to change much. If it’s around 50%, it’s time to develop a new recipe, and might mean booster shots for the new variants would be required — similar to how we get a yearly flu shot.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Vaccines and transmissibility&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;header&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Because the vaccines were tested for their effectiveness in tamping down disease in an individual, we didn’t really know how much they would prevent the coronavirus from being spread from person to person. That meant we had to do &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/2021/01/14/can-vaccinated-people/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;some guessing with preliminary data&lt;/a&gt;.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;But now, we’re getting more evidence that transmission is significantly down among the vaccinated. What’s going on in Israel is perhaps the best example: over half of the population has been vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine, and that country is starting to see real decreases in transmission.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Those vaccinated are in a great spot. Of the 416,900 people that Maccabi Healthcare Services in Israel had vaccinated, only 254 picked up COVID-19 after the second dose. &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/05/world/middleeast/israel-virus-vaccination.html\&quot; target=_blank&gt;All 254 cases were mild, too&lt;/a&gt;.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;But it appears that those hundreds of thousands of healthy people aren’t spreading the virus as much, either. &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/05/world/middleeast/israel-virus-vaccination.html\&quot; target=_blank&gt;Cases dropped 41% in a six-week period&lt;/a&gt;, even among the non-vaccinated.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Even better, &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/pfizers-covid-19-vaccine-reduces-viral-load-study--68439\&quot; target=_blank&gt;a new study this week&lt;/a&gt; looked at how Israelis were impacted after just the first dose, not having yet received the second. And in the 12-28 day period after getting the first dose, even those who were infected had significantly less viral load in their respiratory system, about four times less. That means they’re going to be less effective at spreading the virus.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Between this and the preliminary data that showed a 63% reduction in asymptomatic infections in Moderna’s vaccine, we have a pretty good idea now: The U.S. vaccines definitely reduce transmissibility. It’s probably not 100%, as they appear to reduce severe disease, probably not 95%, as they appear to reduce mild disease, but very likely in the 60-90% range.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;So to sum all of this up: We are getting people vaccinated quicker than originally planned, those vaccines appear to work against the variants or can be easily adjusted, and when you get vaccinated you are less likely to get someone else sick.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;This definitely counts as progress.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;i&gt;Andy Larsen is a data columnist.

It was tiny black rocks embedded in tar. For some reason, my dog saw that shiny wet black tar and decided his entire purpose in life was to run through it and leave his mark. Or more like 840 marks in the shape of paw prints. I like to imagine his doggie thought process.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;i&gt;“I’m a good boy. They always say I’m a good boy. I can’t go wrong.”&lt;/i&gt;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Bertrand Ruffle (named after the philosopher Bertrand Russel, because yeah, we’re those people) was off to the races. My dad ran after him and as he did, he uttered a rare four-letter word. “Damn dog!” My dad was fast, but the dog was faster, until the tar built up on his paws and he was soon running in what amounted to the street version of the &lt;a href=\&quot;https://tarpits.org/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;La Brea Tar Pits&lt;/a&gt;.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Bert was not a small dog, but my dad returned, carrying him like a baby. That dog had the biggest grin, his tongue lolling out of the side of his mouth.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;In a way, he was the embodiment of a picture my mom had hanging on her wall. It depicted a river full of alligators with a person on one side of it. Underneath it said, “The only way out is through,” a version of Robert Frost’s famous line “I can see no way but through,” although for Bert, going through seemed to be the whole destination, and it was Disneyland.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;For most of us, “going through” is the hard part. The one where we flip our middle finger at the fact my dad had cancer way too young. The one where we fought that cancer for four years. The one where a dear friend recently lost her son to the grip of drug addiction, and another lost her loved one to the pandemic.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Recently, this last friend asked me very honestly and sincerely, “How do I get through this? How do I get rid of the pain? Is there a way?”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;I only had two answers, and they weren’t great. One answer was “time.” The other was, “The only way out is through.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;I feel like we’ve all been through something these last few (four) years. No matter what side of the aisle you landed on, these past years have felt fraught with… fraughtness.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The river is fraught with alligators.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The woods are fraught with danger.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;My kitchen is fraught with dirty dishes.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;OK, that last one was probably never said aloud. But however you felt about the last few years, if you’re reading this, you made it through. And with COVID, I feel like we have two or three more alligators to dodge. A few more pit vipers to dance around.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;But until then, I’m going to take a deep breath and watch &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDNP-SWgn2w\&quot;&gt;videos of lawyers in very serious meetings, with cat filters&lt;/a&gt; over their real faces. And every time his kitty face rolls his eyes, and insists that he is not a cat, I’m going to let myself have a good belly laugh (Seriously, Google it), and instead of focusing on treacherous rivers we have yet to wade through, I’m going to count all of the ones we’ve navigated.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Call me a soft optimistic marshmallow.

She says it also naturally attracts innovators.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“Honestly, it’s in our heritage to be self-efficient,” said Kaufusi. “We’re all about being creative thinkers in Provo and not [being] afraid of starting and running a business.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Kaufusi said the city is lucky to be a college town that is home to Brigham Young University and close to Utah Valley University. She said the schools produce young, educated hard workers who aren’t afraid to think big.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Kaufusi said her administration has worked hard to make the city business-friendly.

She said the city wants to make sure there is affordable housing, that crime stays low, that development is sustainable and that the city retain its community feeling. She said this means planning for more infrastructure and trying to increase high-density housing around transportation hubs while protecting residential neighborhoods.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“It all comes back to baby steps. We have to get the infrastructure in the ground, we have to make sure it is what the citizens want, and then we are going from there,” she said of the city’s long-term planning.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;In contrast to Utah, several California metro areas — including San Francisco, San Jose and Riverside — declined in their overall standings, dramatically in some cases, largely due to housings costs and unemployment.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“This may indicate the outsized effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on so-called ‘superstar cities’ that have suffered the most local job losses,” the study’s authors wrote, “and the migration of high-tech workers to lower-cost areas as they work from home.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Global and national forces, including the coronavirus pandemic, have also shaken many cities’ underlying economic performances over the past year, authors wrote. But the top-performing metro areas, including those in Utah, have managed to leverage what they have to remain competitive from a business perspective, “regardless of the nation’s overall economic trajectory.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“These cities combine steady growth on one hand and dynamic innovation on the other,” they wrote, “particularly through concentrated investment in high-tech sectors that generate positive spillover effects for local communities.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Utah is better positioned after the pandemic&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;header&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Salt Lake City and the Ogden-Clearfield area saw some of the highest leaps in the rankings, although Huntsville, Ala., jumped 49 places to reach this year’s 10th spot among larger cities.

That ability to bounce back, authors wrote, “also relies on the alignment of opportunities in high-tech industries and affordable costs of living.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Cities with strong and diverse tech sectors “are more likely to demonstrate resiliency in the face of unprecedented economic upheaval” from the pandemic, the institute said.

But he said behind-the-scenes discussions are ongoing.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“We’ll do those privately, and when the final version of that bill comes out, we’ll let you know whether we support it or not,” he told reporters during his monthly news conference in the studios of PBS Utah at the University of Utah. “I think that’s the better way to negotiate these and so we will continue to do that.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Cox had declined to say anything publicly about the bill until Thursday.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2021/02/16/lawmakers-take-aim/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;Utah legislative leaders unveiled the bill sponsored by Senate Majority Leader Evan Vickers on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;, and it has so far attracted support from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. Backers say the state’s current emergency powers law, enacted in the 1950s, is not designed to grapple with long-term events like the COVID-19 pandemic.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The bill would make a number of significant changes to the handling of long-term crises, including limiting how long an emergency declaration remains in effect and granting authority to the Legislature to override those declarations.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Emergency orders could be extended beyond 30 days by the Legislature, but they must have a definite end date. If the emergency order was terminated by lawmakers, it could not be reinstated by public health departments.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Under the bill, a county legislative body — either a commission or council — also would be empowered to end a public health emergency declared by a local health department earlier than 30 days. And the bill would cap fines for individuals violating public health orders at $150, down from up to $10,000 currently.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Additionally, the bill says religious services can not be subject to more restrictive requirements than applied to other organizations or businesses. &quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“The one thing that you need to realize is that all the powers that are being exercised by the governor and executive branch or the health department during a long-term emergency are legislative powers,” Vickers told reporters earlier in the week. “And so it’s appropriate that we would have some oversight over those powers.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Sen. Luz Escamilla, D-Salt Lake City and the Democratic whip in the Senate, also endorsed the concept of the bill, noting that she sees the proposal as moving decision-making to people who can be held accountable by the voters.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Pressed specifically on the 30-day requirement in the bill, Cox indicated that the timeframe is one of the items that remains under discussion.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“Whether 30 days is the right number or 60 days is the right number, there is a number in there and we’ll continue to work to figure out which is the right one,” he said.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Most states have some sort of check on executive emergency powers, according to &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.ncsl.org/research/about-state-legislatures/legislative-oversight-of-executive-orders.aspx\&quot;&gt;a roundup by the National Conference of State Legislatures&lt;/a&gt;. It summarizes Utah’s by saying that the governor cannot extend an emergency declaration beyond 30 days without a resolution by the Legislature, but that hasn’t precluded the executive from doing so by issuing new orders.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The bipartisan group also said that legislatures in at least 37 states are considering bills or resolutions that would limit governors’ powers or executive spending during the COVID-19 pandemic or other emergencies.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Cox told reporters that he recognized and respected the ability of the Legislature to make changes to the emergency powers act and agrees that it did not contemplate long-term emergencies like a pandemic. But he noted that the executive branch has the the ability to move more quickly in a crisis than the legislative branch can and indicated that he’s urged lawmakers “to not overreact to something that happens every 100 years.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“There’s nothing quick about what happens in the Legislature, although we do have a 45-day session and a lot happens in 45 days,” he said. “Some — like me — argue that too much happens within those 45 days but it’s a very, very important function and it is their function.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Cox also said Thursday that he recognizes there were mistakes in the way the executive branch interfaced with the legislative branch in the early days of the pandemic and said he has tried to remedy those communication gaps as governor, including with more face-to-face conversations.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;But while he committed to working with the Legislature on the bill moving forward, Cox also took aim at its leaders during his comments, arguing that they could have done more to address the threat of the coronavirus.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“I will remind the Legislature that they now have the ability to call themselves into session at any time and overrule any order that has been done from the very beginning,” he said. “They have that authority now. They don’t need a bill to change that. And I will also note that they failed to exercise that authority at almost every turn because they didn’t want to make these decisions either.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The Senate Government Operations and Political Subdivisions Committee endorsed SB195 on &lt;a href=\&quot;https://le.utah.gov/mtgvotes.jsp?voteid=19869\&quot; target=_blank&gt;a 6-0 bipartisan vote Thursday&lt;/a&gt;.

The date of availability for those with certain underlying conditions will remain the first of next month, as previously announced.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“We will ask for your continued patience as this will flood phone lines and servers and more and more people will be trying to sign up as those slots become available,” Cox said Thursday during a monthly news conference with PBS Utah Thursday morning. “If you can’t find an appointment immediately, keep trying and you will get your turn.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Even before the governor finished speaking, the Salt Lake County Health Department website took down its warning that only those 70 and older could schedule an appointment, and opened up registration on a sliding scale over the next few days.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;oembed_response&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The department said in a tweet that it would allow those 69 and older to begin registering at 6 p.m. Thursday, those 68 and older at 6 p.m. Friday, and so on in one-year increments until registration was fully opened to those 65 and older at 6 p.m. Monday.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The details and appointment signup are available at the county’s website at &lt;a href=\&quot;https://slco.org/health/COVID-19/vaccine/seniors/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;https://slco.org/health/COVID-19/vaccine/seniors/&lt;/a&gt;.

It also provided a hotline help number at 801-851-4357, operated from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday-Friday.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Davis County also said it would begin scheduling appointments right away for those 65 and over.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;oembed_response&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“Davis County residents can make appointments now!

That’s what we’ve done from the very beginning. But we’re also far ahead of the projections that were given in December and even into January. We feel very confident about that.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Vaccine rollout could be slowed, Cox noted, if something happens in the production cycle or the delivery cycle, as happened this week when a St. George shipment was delayed because of severe weather conditions across the Midwest. Those doses should be coming to the state “very quickly,” he said.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;As the state has so far gotten 563,608 doses of the vaccine into arms (a number that includes first and second doses), Cox noted that case counts, the percent positivity rate of COVID-19 tests, and hospitalizations are all decreasing, which is “very good news for our state.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Along with those changes, he said six counties have moved from a high transmission index to a moderate transmission index. That puts eight counties in the moderate level and five counties in the low transmission level.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;But Cox encouraged people not to throw caution to the wind as cases decline and to continue taking safety precautions even in those lower-transmission areas as research shows the presence of more contagious variants in the United States.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“If [state epidemiologist] Dr. [Angela] Dunn were here today, she would tell you and she would have me tell you that it is not a good time to let up on the things that keep us safe and protect us, that will continue to drive down those rates and hospitalizations and deaths, including especially mask wearing,” Cox said.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;He also encouraged people to continue to get tested so they can isolate and avoid spreading the virus if they have it.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;More information&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;header&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The grocery store pharmacies that have been authorized to give COVID-19 vaccinations posted on their websites Thursday that all available appointments this week had been filled. But they suggested checking back at 9 a.m. Monday to see if new appointment slots had been opened up.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;You can find the information and online registration at these stores: &lt;a href=\&quot;https://vaccines.dansfoods.com/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;Dan’s&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\&quot;https://vaccines.dicksmarket.com/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;Dick’s&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.harmonsgrocery.com/covid-vaccine-update/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;Harmons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\&quot;https://vaccines.freshmarketstores.com/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;Fresh Market&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\&quot;https://vaccines.maceys.com/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;Maceys&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.smithsfoodanddrug.com/rx/guest/get-vaccinated\&quot; target=_blank&gt;Smiths&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.walmart.com/cp/1228302\&quot; target=_blank&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.

Utah has essentially been under a rolling emergency declaration since March of last year because of the virus, with those emergencies being renewed by the governor every 30 days.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Lawmakers have been digging into the issue for six months, with small bipartisan working groups in the House and Senate suggesting changes to the law. There’s one phrase legislators kept returning to during a Wednesday news conference to discuss those changes: “checks and balances.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“This is bringing transparency for our constituents. A lot of people throughout this COVID pandemic have had a lot of questions of how decisions are being made,” said Sen. Luz Escamilla, D-Salt Lake City.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The result is &lt;a href=\&quot;https://le.utah.gov/~2021/bills/static/SB0195.html\&quot;&gt;SB195&lt;/a&gt;, which essentially preserves the full authority of the governor and public health officials to respond to an emergency for the first 30 days. But, if the emergency is to extend beyond that, then the Legislature gets involved.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“When we look at the emergency declaration, that’s really about giving legislative powers to the executive branch,” says House Assistant Majority Whip Val Peterson, R-Orem. “Which of those powers do we want to give to the executive branch and do it in such a way that we don’t hamstring them at all, so they still have the ability to respond to any emergency they might encounter.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“For the first 30 days, the governor has pretty much open rein to do what he needs to do now. The same with the state health department or local health departments,” says Senate Majority Leader Evan Vickers, R-Cedar City. “From that point on, we are trying to get the involvement of the Legislature and the public in the process.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;An emergency order could last beyond 30 days only if the Legislature approved the extension. It could not simply be extended by the governor. In fact, the proposal would block the governor from extending an emergency unilaterally. Lawmakers also would have the authority to override any emergency declaration by a majority vote, and the emergency could not then be reinstated by public health departments.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Vickers’ bill would create a new legislative committee with the power to review any requests to extend an emergency declaration beyond the initial 30-day period. If extending the emergency was a no-brainer, then there wouldn’t be much the committee needed to do and the Legislature could move forward with little delay.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“But, if they do need to meet, then they are required to take public input,” said Vickers, who noted there really wasn’t a way for the public to weigh in on the issue under the current law.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“They were weighing in on social media, but that’s not a very efficient way to weigh in with lawmakers,” he noted.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;At the local level, county legislative bodies — commissions and councils — would have power to overturn a local emergency declaration by an executive or local health department, and would make a decision whether such an order could be extended beyond the initial 30 days.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Legislative leaders have been careful to not criticize former Gov. Gary Herbert who was responsible for responding to the early days of the pandemic, including stay-at-home orders, noting that he was making decisions based on the best data available. But, lawmakers have been eager for months to make changes to the emergency statute.

After reporting 462 cases on Monday, the Department of Health reported 591 positive tests on Tuesday.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Webb said the state is in a “race between vaccines and variants,” adding: “We can’t go fast enough. That’s the bottom line here.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;He said it’s “hard to know” if Utah is being hit by coronavirus variants, because so little testing is being done for them. Health experts are monitoring reinfection rates and vaccine failures, which provide indirect evidence of variants, and “at least at this point, we’re not seeing strong signals that we have a dominating strain here in the state. But we’re continuing to watch really carefully.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Webb also cautioned people who have gotten their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine to continue to take precautions — to social distance and wear masks.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“We are seeing too many cases of acute COVID in people who received their first dose. … You have very little immunity for the first two weeks after receiving the first dose,” he said. The data, he added, shows that “you’re not fully immune until you’ve had the full two dose series for those MRNA vaccines. ... With the availability of these vaccines, we still need people to be vigilant even after that first dose and through the second dose series.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;b&gt;Vaccinations reported in past day/total vaccinations •&lt;/b&gt; 7,952 / 532,985.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;b&gt;Number of Utahns who have received two doses • &lt;/b&gt;164,775.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;b&gt;Cases reported in past day • &lt;/b&gt;591.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;b&gt;Deaths reported in past day •&lt;/b&gt; One — a man age 85 or older in Salt Lake County.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;b&gt;Hospitalizations reported in past day • &lt;/b&gt;272.

Emergency orders could be extended beyond 30 days by the Legislature, but they must have a definite end date. If the emergency order is terminated by lawmakers, it could not be reinstated by public health departments.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;A county legislative body also would be empowered to end a public health emergency declared by a local health department earlier than 30 days. And the bill would cap fines for individuals violating public health orders at $150, down from up to $10,000 currently.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;A health authority could ask to extend a public health emergency declaration beyond 30 days under the bill, so long as it provides written notice to the Senate President and Speaker of the House.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Asked by reporters whether the bill would limit the role of public health leaders in a pandemic, Adams said that could be a “matter of perspective” but noted that their existing powers would remain in place during the first 30 days of such an emergency. Afterward, their input would continue, but in an advisory capacity.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“We have many people in the state that give us advice,” he said, pointing to the example of “the Department of Transportation; they recommend speed limits — we set them.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Sen. Luz Escamilla, D-Salt Lake City, also dismissed those concerns, noting that she sees the proposal as moving decision-making to people who can be held accountable by the voters.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Vickers’ proposal would also restrict the governor from taking executive action in response to a long-term emergency, unless he or she informs a newly-created legislative “emergency response committee” at least 24 hours beforehand. That committee could approve or nix an extension of a public health emergency declaration.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“This bill says if an emergency is going to last more than 30 days, the Legislature needs to be consulted and decide whether or not the state of emergency should remain,” says House Speaker Brad Wilson, R-Kaysville&lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The proposed legislative committee would be made up of the current members of the Executive Appropriations Committee, plus other members appointed by the House speaker and Senate president.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Lawmakers have been frustrated with the length and scope of the coronavirus emergency, but have been unable to find a legislative solution. This proposal comes out of discussions between legislative leaders and the governor’s office, which did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. A spokesperson for Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall said she was not prepared to take a position on the just-released legislation. Salt Lake County Mayor Jenny Wilson’s spokesperson said she would not comment until she had reviewed the bill further.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“I think everyone sees the system for emergencies that we have set up just wasn’t built for a protracted emergency,” says Rep. Brady Brammer, R-Highland. “We’re just trying to find the right solution.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Vickers says the bill recognizes that there are instances where the executive branch has to be nimble in responding to emergencies in a way the legislative branch can’t, and for the first 30 days of an emergency, “there’s no intrusion upon that process.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“We don’t want to have a situation where we’re disrupting a chemical spill [cleanup] or some of those other immediate [issues],” he said.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;But after the 30 days have passed, he said there’s a need for more accountability and a more deliberative process.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;A statement released from the House and Senate leaders said the proposed changes “are not a condemnation of any agency, individual or action” and noted the collaborative process the bill went through, though it added that the bill will likely “continue to be refined as the bill goes through the legislative process.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;SB195 has yet to be introduced but already appears almost certain to pass in some form.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Most states have some sort of check on executive emergency powers, according to &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.ncsl.org/research/about-state-legislatures/legislative-oversight-of-executive-orders.aspx\&quot; target=_blank&gt;a roundup by the National Conference of State Legislatures&lt;/a&gt;. It summarizes Utah’s by saying that the governor cannot extend an emergency declaration beyond 30 days without a resolution by the Legislature, but that hasn’t precluded the executive from doing so by issuing new orders.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The bipartisan group also said that legislatures in at least 37 states are considering bills or resolutions that would limit governors’ powers or executive spending during the COVID-19 pandemic or other emergencies.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;script type=\&quot;text/javascript\&quot; src=\&quot;https://sltrib.formstack.com/forms/js.php/breaking_news\&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;a href=\&quot;https://sltrib.formstack.com/forms/breaking_news\&quot; title=\&quot;Online Form\&quot;&gt;Online Form - Breaking News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div style=\&quot;text-align:right; font-size:x-small;\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=\&quot;http://www.formstack.com?utm_source=jsembed&amp;utm_medium=product&amp;utm_campaign=product+branding&amp;fa=h,4196536\&quot; title=\&quot;Powered by Formstack\&quot;&gt;Powered by Formstack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;raw_html&quot;}],&quot;credits&quot;:{&quot;by&quot;:[{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;bschott&quot;,&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/sltrib/d116c567-15c2-4250-914c-638eb5af4458.png&quot;},&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Bryan Schott&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;tstevens&quot;,&quot;image&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/sltrib/552b549d-0874-4a30-a916-6f26498fb3e6.png&quot;},&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Taylor Stevens&quot;}]},&quot;display_date&quot;:&quot;2021-02-16T17:32:01.254Z&quot;,&quot;headlines&quot;:{&quot;basic&quot;:&quot;Lawmakers take aim at limiting emergency powers&quot;},&quot;last_updated_date&quot;:&quot;2021-02-17T00:33:17.794Z&quot;,&quot;promo_items&quot;:{&quot;basic&quot;:{&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;(Rick Egan | The Salt Lake Tribune) Nurses test for Covid-19 at the Test Utah site in Herriman, on Friday, Feb. 5, 2021.&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/sltrib/2EN3LEDSAZESFHE36Q3QT7G67A.JPG&quot;}},&quot;publish_date&quot;:&quot;2021-02-17T00:33:17.550Z&quot;,&quot;subheadlines&quot;:{&quot;basic&quot;:&quot;Bill would curtail sweeping emergency authority of governor and health officials.&quot;},&quot;taxonomy&quot;:{&quot;primary_section&quot;:{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;/news/politics&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Politics&quot;,&quot;parent_id&quot;:&quot;/news&quot;,&quot;path&quot;:&quot;/news/politics&quot;},&quot;sites&quot;:[{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Politics&quot;,&quot;path&quot;:&quot;/news/politics&quot;}],&quot;tags&quot;:[{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;legislature&quot;,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;legislature&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;legislature&quot;},{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Politics&quot;,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;politics&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Politics&quot;},{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Coronavirus&quot;,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;coronavirus&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Coronavirus&quot;}]},&quot;website_url&quot;:&quot;/news/politics/2021/02/16/lawmakers-take-aim&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;OQRKMEMPTJDNTBVH3RNXVOP5D4&quot;,&quot;canonical_url&quot;:&quot;/news/2021/02/16/hospitals-still-ration&quot;,&quot;content_elements&quot;:[{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Mike Bowen’s warehouse outside Fort Worth, Texas, was piled high with cases of medical-grade N95 face masks.

But on this day, she’ll wear that mask from one infected person to the next because N95s — they filter out 95% of infectious particles — have supposedly been &lt;a href=\&quot;https://apnews.com/article/automated-insights-earnings-virus-outbreak-pandemics-1295eae6f73d1870a23cb8e2cb66ad05\&quot;&gt;in short supply&lt;/a&gt; since last March.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Turner’s employer, North Memorial Health, said in a statement that supplies have stabilized, but the company is still limiting use because “we must remain mindful of that supply” to ensure everyone’s safety.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;One year into the COVID-19 pandemic, many millions of N95 masks are pouring out of American factories and heading into storage. Yet doctors and nurses like Turner say there still aren’t nearly enough in the “ICU rooms with high-flow oxygen and COVID germs all over.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;While supply and demand issues surrounding N95 respirators are well-documented, until now the reasons for this discrepancy have been unclear.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The logistical breakdown is rooted in federal failures over the past year to coordinate supply chains and provide hospitals with clear rules about how to manage their medical equipment.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Internal government emails obtained by The Associated Press show there were deliberate decisions to withhold vital information about new mask manufacturers and availability. Exclusive trade data and interviews with manufacturers, hospital procurement officials and frontline medical workers reveal a communication breakdown — not an actual shortage — that is depriving doctors, nurses, paramedics and other people risking exposure to COVID-19 of first-rate protection.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Before the pandemic, medical providers followed manufacturer and government guidelines that called for N95s to be discarded after each use, largely to protect doctors and nurses from catching infectious diseases themselves. As N95s ran short, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention modified those guidelines to allow for extended use and reuse only if supplies are “depleted,” a term left undefined.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Hospitals have responded in a variety of ways, the AP has found. Some are back to pre-COVID-19, one-use-per-patient N95 protocols, but most are doling out one mask a day or fewer to each employee. Many hospital procurement officers say they are relying on CDC guidelines for depleted supplies, even if their own stockpiles are robust.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Chester “Trey” Moeller, a political appointee who served as the CDC’s deputy chief of staff until President Joe Biden’s inauguration last month, said efforts to increase U.S. mask production were successful, but there has since been a federal breakdown in connecting those who need them with this new supply.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“We are forcing our health care industry to reuse sanitized N95s or even worse, wear one N95 all day long,” he said.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Before the pandemic tore through the U.S., the demand for N95 masks was 1.7 billion per year, with 80% going to industrial uses and 20% into medical, trade groups say. In 2021, demand for N95 masks for medical use is estimated by industry sources to be 5.7 billion.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;With the increased demand and prodding from the federal government, U.S. manufacturers stepped in. Bowen’s company, Prestige Ameritech, boosted production from 75,000 N95 respirators a month to almost 10 million during the COVID-19 pandemic.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Still, many hospitals are building their stockpiles over fears of a future surge, and restricting the number given directly to health care workers.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The AP spoke with a dozen procurement officers who buy supplies for more than 300 hospitals across the U.S. All said they have enough N95s now, between two and 12 months worth, sitting in storage.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Even so, all but two of those hospital systems are limiting their doctors, nurses and other workers to one mask per day, or even one per week. Some say they are waiting for the supply to grow even more, while others say they never plan to go back to pre-COVID-19 usage.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Dean Weber, vice president of corporate supply chain management for Sioux Falls, South Dakota, Sanford Health, said the one-N95-per-patient guidelines were established with the help of manufacturers.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“You know, the mask manufacturers are in the business of selling masks,” Weber said. He said he prioritizes safety over cost, but he doesn’t believe these respirators need to be tossed after each use. “We were all, in fact, you know, just infatuated with an N95.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;But John Wright, vice president of supply chains for Salt Lake City-based Intermountain Healthcare, says reusing masks or wearing them longer “would not be appropriate” once they have enough supplies. He hopes his 23 hospitals and hundreds of clinics will be back to single use within two weeks.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;As the coronavirus spread through spring and summer, demand for N95 masks surged to unprecedented levels and the respirators disappeared from stockpiles and distributors’ shelves. Hospitals and distributors looked overseas to fill the need.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;In March 2020, just six shipping containers arrived in the U.S. with N95s in them, and almost all of those masks were for industrial use, not medical. By September 2020, orders had soared — in one month, almost 3,000 shipping containers of N95s arrived at U.S. ports, almost entirely medical-grade.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Federal officials saw the reliance on imports as a security problem and worked to boost domestic supply, The federal agency that oversees N95 manufacturers, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, approved 94 new brands, including 19 new domestic manufacturers, according to the internal government emails.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Over the fall and winter, those domestic producers hired thousands of employees and invested millions in supplies to churn out masks,&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;As U.S. production rose through the fall and winter, imports plunged. Shipment data maintained by ImportGenius and Panjiva Inc., services that independently track global trade, shows arrivals dropped sharply to about 150 in January 2021.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;In Shanghai, Cameron Johnson, a trade consultant at the Tidalwave Solutions recruitment firm and an adjunct business faculty member at New York University, says “the bottom has fallen out of the mask market.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;But the U.S. government failed to help link buyers to the growing supplies. Now some of those U.S.-based makers are facing major financial losses, potential layoffs and bankruptcies.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;In December, Moeller, an appointee of President Donald Trump, grew frustrated while working in the office of CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“(NIOSH) had approved almost 20 U.S. manufacturers to make N95 masks, but had not published any guidance or notice of what is ultimately more than 100 million N95 mask-making capacity a month going unsold,” Moeller told the AP.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The Food and Drug Administration was monitoring N95 supply chains, and received $80 million in emergency pandemic funds “to prevent, prepare for and respond to coronavirus.” Of that amount, about $38 million was for efforts related to tracking medical product shortages.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;But the agency has still not solved the problem. “There have been a good number of new NIOSH (mask) approvals that have been granted,” said Suzanne Schwartz, director of the FDA’s Office of Strategic Partnerships &amp;amp; Technology Innovation. “Yet the access to those new manufacturers, there seems to be a hurdle there. FDA ... is trying to identify that blockage.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Schwartz said the agency is working with President Joe Biden’s pandemic response team and the health care industry to find answers.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The internal emails show that Moeller in December alerted NIOSH head Dr. John Howard about the unused U.S. N95 manufacturing capacity.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;In a Dec. 22 email, Howard acknowledged he was still hearing of shortages: “Apparently, there is a significant domestic production capacity going unused for the lack of orders and we have tried to address this supplier/purchaser disconnect.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;A few weeks later, as a suggested remedy, Howard said the list of domestic N95 manufacturers had now been published for potential buyers. But the list shows up on page 3 of an obscure newsletter published by a University of Cincinnati toxicologist, after a satirical column on “chin warmers,” or improperly worn surgical masks.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;NIOSH was not actively promoting the new mask producers, Howard wrote, saying that “to avoid the perception of inequitable treatment and because of the dynamic production landscape, we have not posted information on our website regarding respirator availability.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Howard, through an agency spokesperson, declined a request for an interview. In a statement, NIOSH also acknowledged “a supply and demand disconnect” exists and said it is working with FEMA and other federal agencies, as well as online sales platforms like &lt;a href=\&quot;http://amazon.com/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;Amazon.com&lt;/a&gt; Inc., to better connect purchasers with U.S.-made mask producers.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“How could this be happening? You have an obvious need, and you have a tremendous engine of supply,” said Tony Uphoff, president and CEO of Thomas, an online platform for product sourcing. Uphoff said that for decades the N95 market was stable, so when the virus upended the supply chain, procurement officers were unprepared to respond.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Meanwhile, the U.S. finds itself in a paradox. The more N95s are rationed to alleviate a perceived shortage, the fewer masks are actually reaching the front lines.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;N95s still appear on the FDA shortage list, in part because of reports from doctors and nurses who say they still don’t have enough. The American Hospital Association also says there’s a scarcity of N95s, citing global demand. But the government shortage list triggers distributors to limit how many masks they can sell to each hospital.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“The concept is similar to when trading is halted on Wall Street,” said David Hargraves, senior vice president of supply chain for Premier, a group purchasing organization that helps buy equipment and supplies for thousands of hospitals across the U.S. “You put the protective allocation in place to prevent folks from hoarding and overbuying, therefore exacerbating the shortage situation.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;But without clear guidance, hospitals are left to make their own decisions.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Some procurement officers are loath to trust masks from unfamiliar suppliers. Others balk at federally approved domestic manufacturers, some of whom charge more than international makers. And adding new products into a hospital’s inventory can be tricky: Every health care worker must be fit-tested before using a new brand.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“It’s not easy to pivot from one brand to another,” said Katie Dean, health care supply chain director at Stanford Health Care in California, where they are back to using one N95 mask per patient, as needed.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Dr. Robert Hancock, an emergency room doctor and president of the Texas College of Emergency Physicians, said hospitals are taking risks by continuing to ration N95s, even when they have enough. He said some doctors tell him they get one N95 mask every five to seven days.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“All the N95s currently out there were designed to be worn once. They were never designed to be reused,” Hancock said. “Hospitals are going to have to come up with some hard data to back up that a mask built for single use is OK to use repeatedly if there are other masks available. It was one thing when we had no choice. But you can’t just say something works because it favors you financially.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;i&gt;AP Medical Writer Linda A.

Holker was healthy, active and had been working her tail off for months, helping to care for the coronavirus patients in her hospital.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Then, in the fall, Holker contracted COVID-19. By Nov. 5, she was admitted to the hospital and days later a tube was inserted into her trachea to help her breathe.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Her condition worsened and she was put on an ECMO — extracorporeal membrane oxygenation — machine, which is used in place of a patient’s lungs during transplant surgery but has become a last-ditch effort to keep coronavirus patients alive.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;On Dec. 6, Holker was flown to Gainesville, Fla., where, if a donor could be located, she would receive a double lung transplant.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Now here’s the good news: On Jan. 20, Holker got her transplant and is on the road to recovery — although after such an intensive surgery, it could be a long one.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The University of Florida is one of just a couple places that perform lung transplants on patients with coronavirus infections, said Dr. John Stringham, surgical director of lung transplant at the University of Utah. There have only been about 15 performed nationwide.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Stringham’s team was consulted on Holker’s case, but the hospital currently doesn’t pursue transplants with patients on ECMO, since the outcomes are so much worse. “She was really, really sick,” he said.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The typical transplant, Stringham said, begins with trying to get the recipient healthy enough for the surgery and identifying a good donor candidate. Once a donor is identified a surgical team will open the donor’s chest, inspect the lungs and, if they’re suitable for a transplant, remove them and put them on ice.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Meantime, another team prepares the recipient, opening the chest cavity and removing the lungs while the ECMO machine functions in their place. COVID-19 can complicate that process, Stringham said, because the tissue surrounding the lung can be inflamed making it harder to cut.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Once the donor lungs are in place, the windpipe and a large vein and artery are attached. When the lungs are inflated, Stringham said, they start to draw in oxygen and turn a bright pink color.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“Once that happens, hopefully you’re able to come off the cardio-pulmonary support and they’re able to breath on their own,” Stringham said. “It’s a big operation. It usually takes anywhere from six to seven or eight hours.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Recovery can take time, too. Patients are put on a cocktail of medications to suppress the immune system to keep the body from rejecting the new organs. The patients are moved off of oxygen and undergo physical therapy to strengthen the new lungs.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Holker was breathing on her own by Feb. 1, according to Holly Pike, her friend and fellow nurse, and she was moved out of the intensive care unit shortly after.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“She says she’s feeling good. It’s definitely a transition,” Pike told me. “Right now I think we’re taking it one step at a time.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Holker has been able to talk to her kids — which she hadn’t been able to do for months — and will have to stay in Florida (where she has a brother) while she continues her recovery.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“She’s just working on getting stronger, physical therapy, working on those short term goals,” Pike said. Her next goal: Get out of the hospital.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;One of the advantages Holker has going for her, Stringham said, is apart from her bout with COVID-19 she is young and healthy.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;In a recent photo, Holker is waif thin and gaunt, but sitting upright and smiling. It’s a stark contrast to the image of her from December, unconscious in a hospital bed with a tube down her throat and wired to machines with her daughter at her bedside.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“As long as things go well and she’s got a good pulmonologist, she’ll probably keep doing well and have a good, long life,” Stringham said. “She has a good chance of living many more years and having a good quality of life and being able to hike and ski and do all those things we all want to do.”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Holker has traveled a remarkable road and she is luckier than some. Of the nearly 18,500 Utah health care workers who have tested positive for COVID, &lt;a href=\&quot;https://coronavirus-dashboard.utah.gov/#risk-factors\&quot;&gt;446 have been hospitalized and 16 have died&lt;/a&gt;.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;It’s a stark reminder of the sacrifices our health care workers have made during the pandemic — the grueling hours, the strain on families, the staggering emotional toll of daily death, the risk to their own well-being, and for many serious illnesses and even death. We all owe them a debt of gratitude.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Thankfully, for Holker and her friends and family, it appears there will be a happy ending.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;i&gt;Friends of Holker have set up a GoFundMe page to help pay for her children’s expenses.

Coming into the session, there was an expectation that there would be a blockbuster amount of extra cash to spend, mostly because lawmakers cut $1 billion out of this year’s budget last spring out of fears the COVID-19 pandemic could crater the state’s economy.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;That didn’t happen. Utah’s unemployment rate is currently fifth-lowest in the nation, meaning income tax revenues did not take as large of a hit as expected. Sales tax collections, too, are outdoing what fiscal analysts believed would happen due to the pandemic.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;But, there are indications the economic outlook is going to be even rosier when those revenue numbers are made public next week. Privately, legislative leaders say the economy could be growing twice as fast as those projections, and they are convinced the amount of extra revenue available to spend will be significantly higher than previously thought.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;That’s not necessarily good news for legislative budgeters as the demands for spending this year are outpacing even the most optimistic of forecasts.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“This is my ninth year in leadership doing budget negotiations, and I’ve never seen a year with this many big requests for spending,” said House Speaker Brad Wilson, R-Kaysville.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;After the revenue numbers are released, the four House and Senate chairs and co-chairs of the Executive Appropriations Committee will essentially lock themselves in a room to hammer out most of the budget. Legislative leaders will join those negotiations later to move the final pieces into place.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;One of the big pieces of the budget that is mostly decided is education funding. Usually, there’s a big push toward the end of the session for money to pay for projected student growth plus a bump in the weighted pupil unit (WPU), the basic unit of education funding in Utah. That was already allocated before the session. Leaders voted to include $400 million in new money in the base budget, which included $122 million to pay for cash bonuses to public school teachers and staffers.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;That shift is the result of Utah voters approving Amendment G in November, which opened up the constitutional earmark reserving income tax collections for public and higher education to also include programs for children and services for disabled people. In the 2020 session, Utah lawmakers agreed to automatically include increases for enrollment growth and inflation in the budget as part of a deal to win support for the constitutional amendment from the education community. The practical result is most of the big pieces of the education budget are already in place before lawmakers begin setting the overall spending plan during the session.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;There’s another big chunk of money, about $274 million, from the federal government that’s part of the COVID relief package passed last year. Legislative leaders want to make sure those dollars go toward helping students who are lagging behind because of remote learning. To that end, &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2021/01/29/lawmakers-target-m/\&quot; target=_blank&gt;legislators added language to the base budget&lt;/a&gt; making it clear that if those COVID relief dollars go toward another purpose, then their annual allocation from the State Board of Education will be reduced by an equal amount.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;That’s not to say there won’t be more spending on public education this year. The&lt;a href=\&quot;https://le.utah.gov/interim/2021/pdf/00001418.pdf\&quot;&gt; final funding priority list from the Public Education Appropriations Subcommittee&lt;/a&gt; equals more than half of all the funding currently available to the state in its entire budget. Legislative leaders believe they’ll be able to fund a big chunk of those requests, but not all of them.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;One unexpected pressure point in this year’s budget is Medicaid expansion, specifically keeping up with growing enrollment. As it stands, there’s a funding imbalance due to enrollment growth. &lt;a href=\&quot;https://le.utah.gov/interim/2021/pdf/00001427.pdf\&quot;&gt;According to projections&lt;/a&gt;, ongoing expenses will exceed revenues by $8 million in next year’s budget and $21 million in 2022. In order to fix that budget hole, the state will have to spend more than $55 million this year to fix that imbalance. But this is more than just a one-time problem.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“Spending on social services is about to outstrip education as the most expensive item on our state budget,” according to Rep. Robert Spendlove, R-Sandy, who says if it weren’t for federal funds to bolster the program, Utah’s budget would really be in trouble.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“It’s not an issue of wanting to help people or take care of people,” he says. “It’s an issue of deciding what our priorities are. Do we want to be funding education or do we want to be funding health care coverage?”&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Spendlove says it’s not as simple as a binary choice, but there are only two solutions.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“As far as Medicaid and other social programs growing as a share of the budget, there are only two choices. You can cut the other budgets to pay for this, or you can increase taxes.

Other age groups, from 16 to 69, have been vaccinated at 7% to 14% rates — the vaccines that have been allocated to health care workers, teachers and first responders are responsible for those figures.

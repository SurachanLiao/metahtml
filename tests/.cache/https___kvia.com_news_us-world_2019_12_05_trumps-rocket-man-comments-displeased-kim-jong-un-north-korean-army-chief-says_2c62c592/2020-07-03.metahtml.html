<p>A senior member of the North Korean government has again described Donald Trump as a &#8220;dotard&#8221; after the US President revived the war words with <a href="https://cnn.com/2019/11/28/asia/north-korea-launch-intl-hnk/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">North Korean leader</a> Kim Jong Un by calling him &#8220;Rocket Man.&#8221;</p>


<p>Choe Son Hui, North Korea&#8217;s First Vice-Foreign Minister, was quoted by North Korea&#8217;s state news agency as saying the foreign ministry &#8220;can not repress displeasure over the utterances made by President Trump inappropriately at the most sensitive time.&#8221;</p>


<p>Choe added: &#8220;If any language and expressions stoking the atmosphere of confrontation are used once again on purpose at a crucial moment as now, that must really be diagnosed as the relapse of the dotage of a dotard.&#8221;</p>

 
            
<p>Speaking of the North Korean leader at the NATO summit in London on Tuesday, Trump said: &#8220;He really likes sending rockets up, doesn&#8217;t he? That&#8217;s why I call him Rocket Man.&#8221; Trump added that he and Kim have &#8220;a good relationship.&#8221;</p>


<p>The statement on Thursday is the latest in a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/04/asia/north-korea-christmas-gift-kim-jong-un-intl-hnk/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">series of increasingly dire warnings</a> by North Korea, and recalls<a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2017/09/21/politics/kim-jong-un-on-trump-comments/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> the strong language</a> between the two leaders that escalated in 2017, before a <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2018/06/11/politics/trump-kim-summit-singapore/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">landmark meeting </a>the following year in Singapore.</p>


<p>Pak Jong Chon, the chief of staff of the Korean People&#8217;s Army, said Wednesday that Kim was &#8220;displeased&#8221; by what he called &#8220;undesirable remarks&#8221; about North Korea made by US President Donald Trump on Tuesday in London, where he was attending NATO meetings.</p>

 
            
<p>Pak&#8217;s comments come amid a ratcheting up in rhetoric from the North Koreans ahead of the country&#8217;s self-imposed end-of-year deadline for negotiations with the US.</p>


<p>A foreign ministry official said earlier this week that Pyongyang was preparing a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/04/asia/north-korea-christmas-gift-kim-jong-un-intl-hnk/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&#8220;Christmas gift,&#8221; </a>for Washington, but warned that the present the Trump administration will receive depends on events in the coming days.</p>


<p>When Trump was asked about North Korea&#8217;s recent uptick in missile tests and the status of nuclear talks Tuesday, he referred to Kim as &#8220;Rocket Man&#8221; &#8212; a nickname the President coined during the standoff between Pyongyang and Washington in 2017 &#8212; and hinted that his administration reserved the right to use force.</p>


<p>&#8220;We have the most powerful military we&#8217;ve ever had and we&#8217;re by far the most powerful country in the world. And, hopefully, we don&#8217;t have to use it, but if we do, we&#8217;ll use it. If we have to, we&#8217;ll do it,&#8221; Trump said.</p>


<p>Those comments appear to have rubbed Kim and the top North Korean leadership the wrong way.</p>


<p>High-ranking North Korean army officials like Pak do not often issue public statements, and when they do they&#8217;re usually focused on tensions between North and South Korea, according to Michael Madden, an expert in North Korean leadership at the Stimson Foundation.</p>


<p>Pak was recently photographed alongside Kim on horseback touring Mount Paektu, an important site in North Korean lore, often used for propaganda purposes. That means it&#8217;s likely his statement Wednesday carries added weight.</p>


<p>Pak said that while he recognized Trump attached preconditions when discussing the use of military force against North Korea, the President&#8217;s comments still &#8220;greatly disappointed&#8221; him.</p>


<p>&#8220;Such elated spirit and bluffing may greatly get on the nerve of the dialogue partner even at the slightest slip,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The use of armed forces against the DPRK will be a horrible thing for the US.&#8221;</p>


<h3>Cracks in the friendship? </h3>



<p>John Delury, a professor at Yonsei University&#8217;s Graduate School of International Relations, said the fact that Pak brought up Trump&#8217;s comments was particularly concerning, and believes that Pak&#8217;s statement was likely a response to Trump bringing back the rhetoric that was common in 2017.</p>


<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just short of Kim Jong Un himself saying it &#8230; but it&#8217;s getting very close to the point where Kim Jong Un says kind of directly to Trump that I&#8217;ve lost faith in you,&#8221; Delury said.</p>


<p>Diplomats from Pyongyang and Washington have been attempting to negotiate a trade that would see Kim give up the country&#8217;s nuclear weapons and the ballistic missiles used to deliver them in exchange for relief from punishing US and United Nations sanctions that have crippled the North Korean economy.</p>


<p>Though North Korea first detonated a nuclear device in 2006, Pyongyang successfully test-fired missiles that could potentially hit the US mainland with a nuclear warhead  for the first time in 2017 &#8212; upping the stakes significantly and increasing the urgency to reach a peaceful solution to a decades-long struggle.</p>


<p>North Korea has this year continually blamed the US for the lack of progress in nuclear negotiations, singling out Secretary of State <a href="https://cnn.com/2019/04/18/politics/north-korea-us-pompeo-intl/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mike Pompeo</a> and former National Security adviser John Bolton for censure. However, Pyongyang has made a notable effort not to criticize Trump and has emphasized the importance of the two leaders&#8217; relationship.</p>


<p>Pak again did so Wednesday in his statement, saying he thinks &#8220;the only guarantee that deters physical conflict from flaring up in relations between the DPRK (the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, North Korea&#8217;s formal name) and the US despite such a dangerous military stand-off is the close relations between the top leaders.&#8221;</p>


<p>North Koreans are particularly sensitive to any perceived insults directed at the ruling Kim family. After former Vice President Joe Biden called Kim a dictator last month during a campaign rally, North Korea&#8217;s state-run Korean Central News Agency published a commentary calling him a &#8220;rabid dog&#8221; that &#8220;must be beaten to death with a stick, before it is too late.&#8221;</p>


<p>Even if Trump was joking when he brought back a favorite nickname he used before his budding friendship with Kim, the President may have been playing with fire.</p>

                <h2>Byrne: With Soleimani dead, the world is safer</h2>
              </p><p>You may not have known his name, but the most dangerous man in the Middle East has finally received justice for a lifetime of brutality.</p><p>Before being taken out by an American airstrike, Iranian General Qasem Soleimani was a major general in Iran&#8217;s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and commander of its extra-military, clandestine Quds Force. He left his stain on this world by organizing, training and leading terrorist groups across the Middle East and beyond.</p><p>The blood on his hands included that of at least 600 Americans and thousands more.</p><p>Consider the scope of his activities. Soleimani attacked Americans in Afghanistan. His forces were active throughout Iraq. He armed Hezbollah with rockets that have indiscriminately killed women and children in Israel. He attempted attacks in Europe against our allies. He even planned at least one failed bombing in our nation&#8217;s capital.</p><p>To put it simply, he was a terror mastermind. Taking Soleimani off the battlefield leaves a gaping hole in the Iranian regime&#8217;s ability to orchestrate terrorist activities throughout the Middle East. Make no mistake, the Middle East, and the entire world, is safer without him.</p><p>We can&#8217;t be naive. The evil Iranian regime&#8217;s goal is to destroy the West and its way of life, no matter the cost. Soleimani and the government of Iran have never had any intention of adhering to any global norms or abiding by any treaties.</p><p>That&#8217;s why policies of appeasement towards Iran are misguided and dangerous. The Obama-era Iranian deal was, at best, an empty public relations victory for the Obama administration that did little to slow down Iran&#8217;s public support for global terrorism and quest towards its goal of securing nuclear capabilities. In reality, as we pumped up their economy with billions in cash and sanctions relief, Iran never wavered. With international scrutiny relaxed, Iran successfully took their operations underground. Iran continued and even escalated its proxy support of terrorist groups while the Iranian deal was in place. And Soleimani was the unquestioned leader.</p><p>Unlike the previous President who drew a &#8220;red line&#8221; regarding Assad&#8217;s evil Syrian regime&#8217;s use of chemical weapons, President Trump means what he says. He made clear that any Iranian attack on Americans would be punished. The killing of Soleimani came just days after his proxies attacked our embassy in Baghdad and a military base in Kenya that resulted in the loss of an American life.</p><p>President Obama may have capitulated in Syria, but global terrorists and the regimes who support them now know with certainty that President Trump does not make idle threats. He will act decisively to defend Americans and our interests around the world. After two face-saving attacks from Iran in the region that took no American lives, the Iranian regime appears to be wisely deescalating their aggression.</p><p>Last week, House Democrats introduced a War Powers Resolution designed to discredit President Trump for using his constitutional powers to eliminate Soleimani. It is disappointing that when Congress should be showing national resolve and unity against an evil Iranian regime, Democrats are playing politics. Last week, I received a classified briefing from national security officials that made clear the continued threat Soleimani posed to Americans. We should be thanking the president and the brave men and women who successfully carried out this attack, not engaging in political grandstanding.</p><p>The evil Iranian regime is growing weaker at home. President Trump&#8217;s sanctions are continuing to damage Iran&#8217;s economy. Iranians are protesting in the streets, shouting &#8220;death to the dictator!&#8221; After President Trump&#8217;s show of American strength, the Iranian government can&#8217;t risk further antagonizing the United States. Their leaders would be wise to continue their de-escalation.</p><p>U.S. Rep. Bradley Byrne is a Republican from Fairhope. He is a 2020 candidate for the U.S. Senate.</p><ul>

                <h2>Auburn College of Veterinary Medicine partners with Humane Genomics Inc. on COVID-19 vaccine development</h2>
              </p><p>AUBURN, Ala. &#8212; Researchers from the Auburn University College of Veterinary Medicine are partnering with Humane Genomics Inc. to develop a potential vaccine for the COVID-19 virus currently at the heart of the ongoing global pandemic.</p><p>According to Dr. Bruce Smith, director of the Auburn University Research Initiative in Cancer, professor in the Department of Pathobiology and scientist in the college&#8217;s Scott-Ritchey Research Center, the collaboration between Auburn and Humane Genomics is an outgrowth of cooperation between the two in the field of cancer research. Much of the science used in this particular vaccine development is adapted from the company&#8217;s cutting-edge research into precision virus-based cancer therapies.</p><p id="count_words">

                            </p><p>&#8220;We had previously worked with Humane Genomics in the area of cancer treatment,&#8221; said Smith, &#8220;specifically an attempt to custom synthesize viruses to target tumors. The same basic concept can also be used to develop a vaccine. All that is necessary is to have the virus&#8217; genome&#8212;a genetic map of its DNA&#8212;in order to create a vaccine to target it.&#8221;</p><p>The COVID-19 genome is available, so the custom development of a vaccine tailored to its specific vulnerabilities, a so-called &#8220;synthetic vectored vaccine,&#8221; was a relatively rapid process. In this case, that process involved genetically synthesizing via computer modeling a harmless virus called vesicular stomatitis virus, or VSV, and giving it the same &#8220;spike&#8221; protein characteristic of COVID-19. This spike protein binds with so-called ACE2 receptors on human lung cells to allow the harmful virus to infect them. But if the vaccine functions as hoped, the immune system would be triggered to produce antibodies to recognize this spike protein and block infection, but in a harmless virus. That same triggered immune reaction&#8212;in theory&#8212;would then protect against COVID-19.</p><p>&#8220;The idea of developing vectored vaccines by &#8216;cutting and pasting&#8217; virus DNA to alter its characteristics is a proven method of vaccine development and has been in use for more than a decade,&#8221; Smith said. &#8220;In the case of animals, vectored vaccines have been successfully developed for rabies and fowl pox. In human medicine, a vaccine approved in 2019 for the deadly Ebola virus was developed using the same technique.</p><p>&#8220;What makes the Humane Genomics approach unusual,&#8221; added Smith, &#8220;is that they are skipping the traditional cutting and pasting process of removing and substituting DNA and instead synthesizing their targeted viruses using computer modeling. It allows for a much quicker process. If they have the target&#8217;s genome, they can develop a vaccine in about a week.&#8221;</p><p>It is the testing phase that takes time, and currently the company&#8217;s COVID-19 vaccine is in the safety testing phase, which is where Auburn&#8217;s contribution comes in. The Auburn College of Veterinary Medicine is testing the vaccine on rats to see if they develop the proper antibodies or become ill due to unforeseen side effects. Later, another vaccine partner will perform similar tests with guinea pigs, and if all goes well, the vaccine can then move on to human testing.</p><p>Smith says that, while he is cautiously optimistic a working vaccine will eventually be developed, there is still a long road ahead despite the urgent need.</p><p>&#8220;With a tremendous amount of luck, we could have a vaccine by the end of the year,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but more likely, we won&#8217;t know for sure if a vaccine is going to be successful until some time in 2021.&#8221;</p><p>(Courtesy of Auburn University)</p><p class="button-wrapper">

                            </p><p>The Extended Benefits program is a federal project offered only when a state&#8217;s insured unemployment rate goes over 5.9%. The last time it was offered in Alabama was during the Great Recession of 2008.</p><p>The 13-week extension of normal unemployment paid for by the federal government is called the Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation program.</p><p>EB will start being available to eligible unemployed Alabamians on July 5.</p><p>Once the extra $600 from the federal government stops being added the EB program will pay the standard unemployment benefit amount for Alabama, which is $275 per week.</p><p>Per the Department of Labor, &#8220;Claimants must not be eligible for unemployment compensation benefits in another state or Canada, must have no disqualifications, have qualifying wages, and must have at least one week in the benefit year that begins in an EB eligibility period.&#8221;</p><p>ADOL will notify those eligible for EB benefits via the online UI Claims Tracker and by mail. Claimants will not have to apply for these benefits but should continue to file weekly certifications, per the department.</p><p>The department added, &#8220;Individuals are only entitled to benefits if they are no longer working through no fault of their own and they MUST be able and available for work. The EB program has more stringent work search requirements and requires claimants to engage in a &#8216;systematic and sustained&#8217; effort to obtain work during each week and to provide evidence of efforts. Due to the pandemic, the submission of required work search contacts has been TEMPORARILY waived due to Covid-19 restrictions. However, claimants should continue to look for work where possible, and maintain a record of their efforts on a weekly basis. This waiver may end at any time. Once this waiver ends, claimants will be required to provide a minimum of three (3) work search contacts each week during the weekly certification process.&#8221;</p><p>A detailed information sheet on who can received Extended Benefits can be <a href="https://wdr.doleta.gov/directives/attach/UIPL/UIPL_24-20.pdf">accessed here</a>.</p><p>Henry Thornton is a staff writer for Yellowhammer News.

              </p><p>As a movement of racial justice sweeps across the nation, the media finds itself distracted by patently absurd issues like cartoon voices, 80s TV shows and other trivial issues.</p><p>Most people, however, seem interested in hearing out the legitimate gripes people may have about depictions of history and how power operates in this country.</p><p>Riots and protests at unrelated monuments to American history (Columbus, Washington, Lincoln and Grant) have the potential to derail the movement, as do the equally absurd cries to &#8220;Defund The Police&#8221; &#8212; and white liberals&#8217; attempts to explain what that &#8220;actually&#8221; means while those saying it in the Black Lives Matter movement are pretty clear.</p><p>In Alabama, with its troubling racial past, there are leaders like House Minority Leader Anthony Daniels (D-Huntsville) who have laid out a few real changes they would like to see while showing an openness to compromise on issues down the road.</p><p id="count_words">

                            </p><p>First, and reasonably so, Daniels wants the Confederate flag removed from Alabama State Trooper uniforms. This is such a non-issue, that should be resolved quickly, that State Senator Artur Orr (R-Decatur) said during a radio appearance on Friday that he didn&#8217;t even know they had the Confederate flag on them.</p><p>Daniels also wants a monument to the &#8220;Confederate Cause&#8221; that is placed near the steps of the Madison County Courthouse removed. This is happening, slowly, but the statue put up in 1905 will be moved from the courthouse to the Confederate section of Maple Hill Cemetery in Huntsville.</p><p>Those issues are almost no-brainers. They may take time, but they will probably happen as soon as the slow gears of government turn and make it so.</p><p>Of the more contentious discussions we will see in Alabama over this topic will be the attempted defunding of Confederate Memorial Park and the potential end of the Alabama Memorial Preservation Act.</p><p>Daniels has taken issue with the $600,000 budget allotment to this park, and Alabama Democratic Party spokesman Wade Perry accused State Rep. Will Dismukes (R-Prattville), who opposes this defunding idea, of disloyalty to the United States and called for him to resign.</p><p>My take: Perry is a clown. He is just using this to get attention, meanwhile the elected leaders are using his outlandish behavior to show that they are being more reasonable by contrast. They are right.</p><p>Daniels believes some local municipalities will want to keep their statues local, saying it is &#8220;so that they can have discussions about history locally.&#8221;</p><p>But last week, both Daniels and Dismukes appeared on WVNN&#8217;s &#8220;The Dale Jackson Show,&#8221; and a compromise may have emerged. Both agreed that Confederate Memorial Park could continue to exist, potentially as a stopping point for removed monuments, with Daniels noting, &#8220;I&#8217;m not against moving them to the Confederate park, but I think that if we&#8217;re going to have a park it should talk about all of Alabama history park, not just Confederate history.

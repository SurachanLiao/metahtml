2 Deaths in Africa

There, while working near the Church of the Brethren's mission station, the first nurse, Laura Wine, became ill. Flown by private plane to the Sudan Interior Mission's hospital in Jos, she died 24 hours later.

A week later, Charlotte Shaw, one of Miss Wine's nurses, got what she thought was migraine headache. However, she devel oped a fever unresponsive to antibiotics, became sicker, and died 10 days later.

Assisting at Miss Shaw's autopsy was Lily Pinneo, a missionary nurse, who had cared for both earlier victims.

“A week later, I got a 103‐ degree fever and severe ulcers in my mouth,” Miss Pinned re called at her home in Rochester. Considering that she might have the same illness, Miss Pin ?? doctors flew her to Lagos. She spent four days in a hos pital, cared for by Dr. Stanley O, Foster, a United States Pub lic Health Service physician.

Lying on a stretcher in a curtained‐off area of cabin and accompanied by a nurse and an other Health Service physician, Dr. J. Lyle Conrad, she spent 12 hours on a direct flight here.

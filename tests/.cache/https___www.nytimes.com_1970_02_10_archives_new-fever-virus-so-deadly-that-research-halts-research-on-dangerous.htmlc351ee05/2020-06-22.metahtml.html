Those infected were three American mis sionary nurses, who con tracted the disease in Ni geria, and two laboratory workers at Yale University. Two of the nurses and one of the laboratory workers died.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Scientists at Yale, collabo rating with doctors at Co lumbia University and in West Africa, identified the virus last year from blood samples of the three nurses.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Blood tests show that none of the other laboratory or hospital personnel or family members got sick from Lassa Fever, although the virus possibly infected an other American missionary in Guinea a few years ago, doctors at Yale and Columbia said in recent interviews.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">The episode vividly illus trates the hazards of virology research, which has led to at least 2,700 cases and 107 deaths from laboratory ac quired infections over the years. Most of these cases have occurred since 1950 as more researchers have tried to better understand viruses and have discovered new ones, almost as virulent as Lassa Fever, among the hun dreds of viruses previously known.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Just as important, Lassa Fever demonstrates that dis ease is not restricted by geo graphic or political boun daries.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Lassa Fever infection can involve almost all the body's organs; symptoms may vary in the individual patient. The virus produces a fever as high as 107 degrees; mouth ulcers; a skin rash with tiny hemorrhages; pneumonia; in fection of the heart leading to cardiac failure; kidney damage, and severe muscle aches.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">The Yale researchers knew of the hazards when they re ceived blood samples from the three missionaries.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">&#8220;We were aware of the dan gers of our research, but we had commitments to the doe tors and patients,&#8221; said Dr. Jordi Casals, the virologist who later got Lassa Fever.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Accordingly, Dr. Casals and his co&#8208;worker, Dr. Sonja Buck ley, proceeded cautiously. Only by inoculating the victims&#8217; blood into Vero cells (from a green monkey) were research ers able to show quickly evi dence of a virus, and only after months of tests were they able to say it was new.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">By custom, they named it for the place from which it came, which was Lassa, a vil lage of about 1,000 Nigerians, situated about 150 miles below the Sahara.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">2 Deaths in Africa</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">There, while working near the Church of the Brethren's mission station, the first nurse, Laura Wine, became ill. Flown by private plane to the Sudan Interior Mission's hospital in Jos, she died 24 hours later.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">A week later, Charlotte Shaw, one of Miss Wine's nurses, got what she thought was migraine headache. However, she devel oped a fever unresponsive to antibiotics, became sicker, and died 10 days later.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Assisting at Miss Shaw's autopsy was Lily Pinneo, a missionary nurse, who had cared for both earlier victims.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">&#8220;A week later, I got a 103&#8208; degree fever and severe ulcers in my mouth,&#8221; Miss Pinned re called at her home in Rochester. Considering that she might have the same illness, Miss Pin ?? doctors flew her to Lagos. She spent four days in a hos pital, cared for by Dr. Stanley O, Foster, a United States Pub lic Health Service physician.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Lying on a stretcher in a curtained&#8208;off area of cabin and accompanied by a nurse and an other Health Service physician, Dr. J. Lyle Conrad, she spent 12 hours on a direct flight here.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">From John F. Kennedy In ternational Airport, where of ficials had no reason to suspect a new viral disease, an ambu lance took Miss Pinneo to Columbia&#8208;Presbyterian Hospital. Also at the airport was Dr. John D. Frame, who drew a blood sample from Miss Pinneo and sent it along with those previously obtained from the two dead missionaries to the Yale Arborvirus Research Unit.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">At Columbia&#8208;Presbyterian, Miss Pinneo was isolated. Her, doctors ruled out the known tropical diseases.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">&#8220;After a few days, we real ized that hers was not a usual disease,&#8221; recalled one of her physicians, Dr. David J. Gocke, who said that they looked to the Yale laboratory for Miss Pinneo's diagnosis. Except for excellent nursing care, her doc tors had no specific therapy to offer.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Miss Pinneo remained hos pitalized for nine weeks, losing 28 pounds and most of her hair. Since she could &#8220;swallow just a sip at a time,&#8221; her doctors fed, her by vein for five weeks.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">&#8220;My eyes kept jerking from side to side and I couldn't watch television, so I listened to my favorite hymns on the radio,&#8221; Miss Pinneo said.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">At Yale, researchers studied the effects of the virus on animals such as mice but they said only Dr. Casals, Dr. Buck ley and Dr. Wilbur G. Downs, the group's director, worked with the virus.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">In June, Dr. Casals felt ill but did not suspect he had Lassa Fever because his severe thigh&#8208;muscle aching was sympton that the others had escaped. A friend urged Dr. Casals, who lives here, to enter Columbia&#8208;Presbyterian Hospital. There, physicians suspected Lassa Fever as a laboratory acquired infection.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Against the Infection</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Since antibiotics are ineffec tive against viruses, his doc tors used a therapy, common in prevaccine and preantibiotic days, but seldom used now, to save Dr. Casals's life. They asked Miss Pinneo to fly to New York from Rochester. They withdrew two units of blood and separated her plas ma, which contained the anti bodies she had made to fight her infection, and injected it into Dr. Casals's veins.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Miss Pinneo's plasma also worked against Dr. Casals's in fection. The virus stopped cir culating in Dr. Casals's blood immediately after this specific therapy was given, laboratory tests later showed, whereas it was found in Miss Pinneo's un treated blood for six weeks.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Dr. Casals returned to Yale to learn how many other Afri cans or missionaries, if any, have the disease and how it is transmitted. But this research was stopped when a laboratory worker, Juan Roman, who had no known contact with the vi rus, died in December. He left for a Thanksgiving vacation in York, Pa., where he became ill and was hospitalized.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Yale researchers say they learned of his illness just be fore he died there. And from blood samples Dr. Casals ob tained in York, Dr. Buckley identified the Lassa Fever virus.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">&#8220;We simply do not know how the virus was transmitted to the technician,&#8221; Dr. Downs, the group's director, said. Any future research, he said, would have to be conducted in a maximum security laboratory.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Dr. Downs, meanwhile, has written laboratories in Africa warning them of the dangers of the virus and communicat ing what is known about the fat covered, spherical particle, which contains RNA (ribonu cleic acid) and can be seen only under an electron micro scope.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">The researchers say they be lieve there Is no threat now to anyone associated with these cases. In such an event, Dr. Downs said, his laboratory would do all necessary tests for diagnostic, purposes.</p></section></article>

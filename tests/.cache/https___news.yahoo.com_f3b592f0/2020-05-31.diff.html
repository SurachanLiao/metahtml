The National Guard “should have been used 2 days ago &amp; there would not have been damage &amp; Police Headquarters [sic] would not have been taken over &amp; ruined,” Trump tweeted. As police clashed with demonstrators in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and other cities, Trump, after returning to the White House from Florida where he witnessed the launch of two astronauts aboard the SpaceX rocket, was uncharacteristically reticent on Twitter.</del></p></div>

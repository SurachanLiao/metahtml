As violent protests continued for a fifth straight night over the death of an African-American man during an arrest by Minneapolis police, President Trump took advantage of the crisis to take a swipe at “the Democrat Mayor” of Minneapolis for failing to control the protests, praising a “great job” by the Minnesota National Guard. The National Guard “should have been used 2 days ago & there would not have been damage & Police Headquarters [sic] would not have been taken over & ruined,” Trump tweeted. As police clashed with demonstrators in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and other cities, Trump, after returning to the White House from Florida where he witnessed the launch of two astronauts aboard the SpaceX rocket, was uncharacteristically reticent on Twitter.

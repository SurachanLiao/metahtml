	</p><p>https://quadrant.org.au/opinion/bennelong-papers/2020/06/when-the-facts-fade-to-black/</p><p>Anthony Dillon identifies as a part-Aboriginal Australian who is proud of both his Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal ancestries. Originally from Queensland, he now lives in Sydney and is a researcher at the Australian Catholic University.</p><p>&#8220;Many times I have heard blactivists dismiss high rates of community violence and child abuse with the throwaway&#160; line, &#8216;Walk a mile in our shoes before you criticize.&#8217; Maybe they should try walking a few yards in the shoes of the police just to see what it&#8217;s like. They would likely discover that the last thing police need in pressure situations is some loud-mouth sticking a phone in a police officer&#8217;s face while shouting &#8220;I&#8217;m filming this!&#8221;</p><p>Black Lives Matter (BLM) activists and their sympathisers claim to care about all black lives, which prompts me to pose a question: Why are BLMers not protesting when blacks die at the hands of blacks? Instead, during the current eruption of outrage, they focused at first on Aboriginal deaths in custody, which demonstrated what a charade they were staging, given that Aboriginal people are less likely to die in custody than non-Aborigines. Such an inconvenient fact required a change of emphasis, hence the narrative&#8217;s switch to claims of systemic police brutality. The method? Cherry-pick examples and ignore context.</p><p>Consider a recent article by Australian activist Amy McQuire in the Washington Post. In regard to the alleged racist brutality of police and the justice system, she informs her US audience that &#8220;the violence is evident in the wounds on black bodies and in the life stories of Aboriginal people.&#8221; Actually, Amy, if it&#8217;s the wounds on black bodies you are interested in, I can take you to some remote communities where you will see all the wounded black bodies you want. The perpetrators are mostly Aboriginal, so you wouldn&#8217;t be interested in telling Americans about that, not when it is more fun, and wins you more attention, to slander an entire nation in the eyes of a wider world.</p><p>In a YouTube clip (below), Amy explains that while non-Aboriginal people regard police as protectors, &#8220;for Aboriginal people we see them as the aggravators, as the unjust people, as the people that you need protection from.&#8221; Really, Amy? When you speak of &#8216;Aboriginal people&#8217;, are you speaking on behalf of all Aboriginal people?</p><p class="post-meta post-top-meta">

Elise Stefanik (R-NY) has heard her share of similarly tragic stories from several of her constituents. And there was one common denominator: Gov. Andrew Cuomo&#8217;s mandate that forced nursing home facilities to accept COVID-positive patients once they were discharged from the hospital.&#160;</p><p>In the aftermath of the policy, several thousand nursing home residents have died, having been unnecessarily exposed to the virus. Dean has no doubt in her mind that Cuomo&#8217;s policy is what doomed her husband&#8217;s parents. That&#8217;s why, when Gov. Cuomo demanded an investigation into a young man who unknowingly spread the virus to a few classmates at his high school graduation, Rep. Stefanik called the governor &#8220;hypocritical.&#8221;&#160;</p><p>&#8220;The governor refuses to be held accountable for the thousands and thousands of seniors who lost their lives because of the failed and fatal nursing home policy&#8230;It really is hypocritical that the governor is pointing fingers at this high school student,&#8221; Stefanik said.&#160;</p><p class="post-meta post-top-meta">

	</p><p>https://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2020/06/29/its-obvious-joe-biden-lied-about-targeting-michael-flynn-n2571343</p><p>On May 12, former Vice President Joe Biden said he was &#8220;unaware&#8221; of the Obama era case and spying, known as &#8220;Crossfire Razor,&#8221; against General Michael Flynn during an interview with ABC News Anchor George Stephanopoulos. When pressed, Biden changed his story, saying he was aware of an investigation but nothing more.</p><p>&#8220;I know nothing about those moves to investigate Michael Flynn,&#8221; Biden first said.</p><p>&#8220;I was aware that there was&#8230;that they asked for an investigation, but that&#8217;s all I know about it, and I don&#8217;t think anything else,&#8221; he attempted to clarify.</p><p>We first knew this statement was untrue when declassified documents, released in May, showed Biden as one of the Obama administration officials who unmasked Flynn during the 2016/2017 presidential transition period.&#160;</p><p>Now, we have additional verification Biden&#8217;s statement to ABC News was completely false. Not only did Biden know about the details of the Flynn investigation, he was suggesting ideas about how to go after him through the Logan Act. In other words, guiding the FBI and DOJ about how to nail Flynn with criminal charges. As Matt detailed last week:</p><p class="post-meta post-top-meta">

He suggested that the university honor Wilson&#8217;s good deeds. He explained that in 2016, Princeton trustees voted to keep Wilson&#8217;s name on the school, but in 2020, Princeton has &#8220;buckled under the pressure.&#8221;&#160; &#160;</p><p>The Open Campus Coalition letter to Princeton President Christopher Eisgruber states: &#8220;[T]he vast majority of claims and demands made by these students amounts to a concerted siege of free thought at Princeton, which they seek to effect by hijacking the University bureaucracy to create a monopoly for their beliefs on deeply controversial and contentious issues.&#8221;&#160;</p><p class="post-meta post-top-meta">

Without Romney&#8217;s defeat, no Trump takeover. And no Republican other than Utah&#8217;s freshman senator himself had more to do with the fateful outcome on that Election Day than Mitt Romney&#8217;s sole campaign strategist in 2012, principal advertising consultant, and convention speechwriter, Stuart Stevens. Strange, then, to pick up Stevens&#8217;s new book, It Was All a Lie, to find him accusing Republican voters of all manner of sins, failures of judgment, and squandered opportunities, as if they were due the harsh accounting and he was the one left disappointed.</p><p>The book is billed as a &#8220;lacerating mea culpa,&#8221; a painful outpouring of regret by &#8220;the most successful political operative of his generation,&#8221; though in practice what the penitent mostly confesses is having for too long overlooked the faults of others, and having kept the wrong company when he should have known better. Presenting himself as the battle-weary veteran of many a campaign, with &#8220;the best win-loss record of anyone in my business,&#8221; Stevens shares his sadness and remorse at having labored so long as a Republican consultant, in service to people he now realizes are mostly frauds and to ideas he now regards as &#8220;lies&#8221; unworthy of his talents.</p><p>&#8220;If I look back on my years in politics,&#8221; he reflects, &#8220;the long-standing hypocrisy of the Republican Party should have been obvious.&#8221; But it wasn&#8217;t, and now in atonement he is prepared to testify that Donald Trump&#8217;s arrival merely revealed &#8220;the essence&#8221; of a selfish, backward, hateful, hopelessly racist &#8220;white grievance party&#8221; &#8212; defined by &#8220;the kooks and weirdos and social misfits of a conservative ideology&#8221; &#8212; our lofty Republican ideals all along just for show. As he tells us in his Prologue, &#8220;This is a book I never thought I&#8217;d write, that I didn&#8217;t want to write. But it&#8217;s the book I now must write. It&#8217;s a truth to which I can bear witness.&#8221;</p><p class="post-meta post-top-meta">

Midway through, Bayoumi casually invoked the historical tensions between blacks and Jews.</p><p>&#8220;In Harlem in the 1960s, most such stores were Jewish-owned,&#8221; Bayoumi writes, offering as evidence James Baldwin&#8217;s 1967 essay, also published in the&#160;Times, titled &#8220;Negroes Are Anti-Semitic Because They&#8217;re Anti-White.&#8221; In that essay, Baldwin writes, &#8220;It is bitter to watch the Jewish storekeeper locking up his store for the night, and going home.&#8221;</p><p class="post-meta post-top-meta">

	</p><p>https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2020/06/29/three_ideas_to_end_the_rot_on_college_campuses_143564.htm</p><p>In the early 1950s, at the nadir of McCarthyism, the Cincinnati Reds baseball team was so fearful of anti-communist crusaders that it actually changed the team&#8217;s name. Overnight, they reverted to their original name, the Cincinnati Red Stockings, and then for several years&#160;became&#160;the Redlegs. The anti-communism was justified; the mob mentality was not. Today, we are all Redlegs. This time, the repression is coming from the left.</p><p>It&#8217;s not just that a careless word can cost your job, it&#8217;s that people tremble in fear that they might say the wrong word. Today, as in the past, the loudest, most extreme voices claim the right to control speech and judge whether it is worthy of being heard at all. The giants of technology and media have either bowed to these demands or embraced them enthusiastically. The result, as in the early 1950s, is a shriveled, impoverished public square. Genuine debate is suppressed, even in classrooms, which should nurture informed discussion with multiple viewpoints. All too often they have become pipelines for indoctrination.</p><p>What&#8217;s wrong with this rigid groupthink? First, it takes real problems, such as police misconduct or Confederate statues, and inflates them for political purposes. It vastly exaggerates their extent and gravity, mistakenly generalizes them (Ulysses Grant is not Stonewall Jackson), ignores significant progress in correcting old errors, calls any disagreement &#8220;racist,&#8221; and relies on intimidation and sometimes violence, not democratic procedures, to get their way. The loudest voices say America and its history are fundamentally evil, that its institutions need to be smashed so they can be reestablished on &#8220;socially just&#8221; foundations. The mob and their fellow travelers will determine what is just. Who gives them that right? This arrogation of power and attack on public order will not end well.</p><p class="post-meta post-top-meta">

It is fair to say that I expressed a high degree of skepticism that the pandemic was of sufficient severity to justify the extreme economic suppression that was being undertaken at that time (much of which still remains in place today). Here is my post from April 16 titled &#8220;What Is The Proof That This Covid-19 Thing Really Is A &#8216;Crisis,&#8217; Or That Economic Suppression Is The Solution?&#8221;; and here is one from April 27, titled &#8220;What Is The True Level Of Mortality Caused By The Covid-19 Virus?&#8221;</p><p>I have been holding off revisiting the subject because I have not been able to find data that answer the principal questions that I asked in those posts. In particular, I made this statement in the April 27 post:</p><p>The best indication we will get [of the true death rate from this virus] will come when the CDC issues final data for deaths from all causes in the U.S. for the month of April. When we get that number, we can subtract from it the approximate &#8220;normal&#8221; number of deaths that would have occurred anyway during April. The difference will be a good estimate of the number of excess deaths attributable to the virus.</p><p>At this writing I still cannot find those data. If anyone can point me to a source, I will appreciate it.</p><p class="wp-pagenavi">

<h1><p>Kim Jong Un Builds A Gym, But He Doesn&#8217;t Even Lift! He Just Eats!</p></h1>
<p>Kim Jong Un is a sick bastard Dictator that decided to mask his serial killer tendencies by building a gym for &#8220;his people.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a nice gesture, but you are going to learn a little bit about his own lifestyle that might shock you. You will understand why he loves to <a href="https://muscleroast.com/kim-jung-un-dennis-rodman-donald-trump-meeting/">party with Dennis Rodman</a>!</p>

<p><strong>He is the opposite of healthy, especially because he eats like a pig! Not to mention that he has diabetes, STD&#8217;s, and crazy high blood pressure!</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Many experts are saying that he is dying because of his horrible diet. Very different from the typical North Korean diet.</li>
</ul>

</p>
<p><strong>Is it me, or does it not make sense that this fat bastard who doesn&#8217;t even work out has build a gym?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>He has to be one of the, if not THE most unhealthy world leader out there. Here is a quick video on his stupid gym&#8230;</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h2><p>Kim Jong Un Is Only In His 30&#8217;s, But His Diet Is Killing Him!</p></h2>
<p>Kim is very well known for spending millions of dollars on junk food, alcohol and cigarettes.</p>
<ul>
<li>He basically smokes his ass off, and eats like a pig.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>That is no surprise looking at that fat bastard.</strong></p>
<p>The stress of running that insane country, the lack of sleep, alcoholism and puffing the cigs, has his doctors saying he will die at a young age.</p>
 
<p>

 

 

</p>
<ul>
<li>Especially because he has diabetes and high blood pressure.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://muscleroast.com/kim-jong-un-health/"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7083 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/muscleroast.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/7D44.gif?resize=500%2C392&amp;ssl=1" alt="kim jung un diet" width="500" height="392"></a></p>
<h2><p>Kim Jong Un Is Addicted To Cheese!</p></h2>
<p>This is probably something you did not know, but this fat bastard is addicted to cheese!</p>
<ul>
<li>To many around him, it is not a secret that he has a horrible diet and that he is obsessed with cheese.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Some say that years ago when he removed himself from the public eye, was because of his horrible diet which includes Emmental Cheese.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://muscleroast.com/kim-jong-un-health/"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7089 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/muscleroast.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/00-1.jpg?resize=737%2C491&amp;ssl=1" alt="kim jong un cheese" width="737" height="491"></a></p>
<p>On top of eating massive amounts of cheese, he eats a super high sodium diet.</p>
<ul>
<li>His former chef said that Kim would pig out on sushi, but always the most fattening rolls.</li>
</ul>
<h2><p>Kim&#8217;s Alcohol And Cigarettes!</p></h2>
<p>Since Kim steals money from his people, he has plenty to spend on alcohol and cigarettes.</p>
 
<p>

 

 

</p>
<p><strong>If you think you spend a lot on booze, this fat bastard spends about $30 Million on importing alcohol every year!</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://muscleroast.com/kim-jong-un-health/"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7085 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/muscleroast.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/kim-jong-landscape-3x2.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;ssl=1" alt="kim-jong-alcohol" width="1200" height="800"></a></p>
 
<p>

 
 

 

</p>
<ul>
<li>Some of his favorites are Hennessy, which he easily buys for $3,500 per bottle. Who cares right?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>On top of that, this noodle eating fat ass smokes&#160;Yves Saint Laurent cigarettes! Can you believe that shit? They go for $45 per pack as well.&#160;</strong></p>
<p>I never even heard of anything like that, but ok, I guess they exist!</p>
<p><a href="https://muscleroast.com/kim-jong-un-health/"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7086 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/muscleroast.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/ad_210352454-e1466416048332.jpg?resize=644%2C460&amp;ssl=1" alt="kim jon un smoking" width="644" height="460"></a></p>
<p id="874880_node_22" class="ng-binding ng-scope"></p>
<h2><p>Kim Has Diabetes And Really High Blood Pressure!</p></h2>
<p>Everybody knows by now that diabetes can kill you.</p>
<p><strong>The fact that Kim chooses not to eat a diabetes friendly diet (meaning very low carb), is exactly why he is headed for the casket.&#160;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I guess when you feel invincible you don&#8217;t really care about your diet.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://muscleroast.com/kim-jong-un-health/"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7088 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/muscleroast.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/North-Korea-Kim-Jong-un-health-881751.jpg?resize=590%2C350&amp;ssl=1" alt="kim jong un blood pressure" width="590" height="350"></a></p>
<h2><p>Kim Might Have Gout</p></h2>
<p>If you remember a while back, this guy was limping around every single time he was shown on TV.</p>
<p><strong>Since he is a heavy drinker and smoker, that only makes matters worse. When someone has <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/gout-joint-pain-and-more">Gout</a>, they are not supposed to drink!</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Some of the top experts in the world believe he has gout, which is inflammation from too much uric acid.</li>
</ul>
<p>The pain comes and goes, which is why his limp comes and goes. This is no surprise because his father had Gout as well.</p>
<h2><p>Kim Jong Un Has STDs!</p></h2>
<p>Secret sources have stated that this fat horny bastard has contracted various STDs.</p>
<ul>
<li>One of the sources closest to him has said that Kim Jong Un has <a href="https://medlineplus.gov/syphilis.html">Syphilis.</a></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://muscleroast.com/kim-jong-un-health/"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7090 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/muscleroast.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/giphy-14.gif?resize=382%2C229&amp;ssl=1" alt="kim jong un stds" width="382" height="229"></a></p>
<p><strong>This should not be that hard to believe, since his father has had a lot of different STDs as well!</strong></p>
<p>North Korea is also very well known for sex trade, and young girls get forced into sex with high ranking officials.</p>
<ul>
<li>Basically him and his dad probably had sex with tons of girls who were basically raped.</li>
</ul>
<h2><p>Kim Jong Un Will Never Go To The Doctor!</p></h2>
<p>His entire family is very well known for being paranoid!</p>
<p>A long time ago, his grandfather had a tumor, and he simply refused to get it removed!</p>
<p><a href="https://muscleroast.com/kim-jong-un-health/"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7091 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/muscleroast.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/1o1y10.jpg?resize=370%2C277&amp;ssl=1" alt="kim jong un fat" width="370" height="277"></a></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;His reasoning was that he was afraid of being killed. Why risk the life of doing whatever you want as a dictator when you don&#8217;t have to!&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Many dictators have been known to be afraid of surgery for the simple reason of getting assassinated.&#160;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Surgery requires getting sedated, and that is not something these guys want to do!</li>
</ul>
<p>If Kim continues to live his crazy life style, he will definitely need surgery.</p>
<p>That is exactly why this guy will never do anything about his health and stay away from the doctor.</p>

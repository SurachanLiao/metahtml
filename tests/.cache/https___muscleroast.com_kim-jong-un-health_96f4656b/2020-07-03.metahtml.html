<h1><span>Kim Jong Un Builds A Gym, But He Doesn&#8217;t Even Lift! He Just Eats!</span></h1>
<p>Kim Jong Un is a sick bastard Dictator that decided to mask his serial killer tendencies by building a gym for &#8220;his people.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a nice gesture, but you are going to learn a little bit about his own lifestyle that might shock you. You will understand why he loves to <a href="https://muscleroast.com/kim-jung-un-dennis-rodman-donald-trump-meeting/">party with Dennis Rodman</a>!</p>
 
<p>He is the opposite of healthy, especially because he eats like a pig! Not to mention that he has diabetes, STD&#8217;s, and crazy high blood pressure!</p>
<ul>
<li>Many experts are saying that he is dying because of his horrible diet. Very different from the typical North Korean diet.</li>
</ul>
 
 

 


<p>Is it me, or does it not make sense that this fat bastard who doesn&#8217;t even work out has build a gym?</p>
<ul>
<li>He has to be one of the, if not THE most unhealthy world leader out there. Here is a quick video on his stupid gym&#8230;</li>
</ul>
 
<h2><span>Kim Jong Un Is Only In His 30&#8217;s, But His Diet Is Killing Him!</span></h2>
<p>Kim is very well known for spending millions of dollars on junk food, alcohol and cigarettes.</p>
<ul>
<li>He basically smokes his ass off, and eats like a pig.</li>
</ul>
<p>That is no surprise looking at that fat bastard.</p>
<p>The stress of running that insane country, the lack of sleep, alcoholism and puffing the cigs, has his doctors saying he will die at a young age.</p>
 

 


<ul>
<li>Especially because he has diabetes and high blood pressure.</li>
</ul>
 
<h2><span>Kim Jong Un Is Addicted To Cheese!</span></h2>
<p>This is probably something you did not know, but this fat bastard is addicted to cheese!</p>
<ul>
<li>To many around him, it is not a secret that he has a horrible diet and that he is obsessed with cheese.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Some say that years ago when he removed himself from the public eye, was because of his horrible diet which includes Emmental Cheese.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
 
<p>On top of eating massive amounts of cheese, he eats a super high sodium diet.</p>
<ul>
<li>His former chef said that Kim would pig out on sushi, but always the most fattening rolls.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span>Kim&#8217;s Alcohol And Cigarettes!</span></h2>
<p>Since Kim steals money from his people, he has plenty to spend on alcohol and cigarettes.</p>
 

 


<p>If you think you spend a lot on booze, this fat bastard spends about $30 Million on importing alcohol every year!</p>
 
 

 


<ul>
<li>Some of his favorites are Hennessy, which he easily buys for $3,500 per bottle. Who cares right?</li>
</ul>
<p>On top of that, this noodle eating fat ass smokes&#160;Yves Saint Laurent cigarettes! Can you believe that shit? They go for $45 per pack as well.&#160;</p>
<p>I never even heard of anything like that, but ok, I guess they exist!</p>
 
 
<p id="874880_node_23" class="ng-binding ng-scope">
<h2><span>Kim Has Diabetes And Really High Blood Pressure!</span></h2>
<p>Everybody knows by now that diabetes can kill you.</p>
<p>The fact that Kim chooses not to eat a diabetes friendly diet (meaning very low carb), is exactly why he is headed for the casket.&#160;</p>
<ul>
<li>I guess when you feel invincible you don&#8217;t really care about your diet.</li>
</ul>
 
</p>
<h2><span>Kim Might Have Gout</span></h2>
<p>If you remember a while back, this guy was limping around every single time he was shown on TV.</p>
<p>Since he is a heavy drinker and smoker, that only makes matters worse. When someone has <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/gout-joint-pain-and-more">Gout</a>, they are not supposed to drink!</p>
<ul>
<li>Some of the top experts in the world believe he has gout, which is inflammation from too much uric acid.</li>
</ul>
<p>The pain comes and goes, which is why his limp comes and goes. This is no surprise because his father had Gout as well.</p>
<h2><span>Kim Jong Un Has STDs!</span></h2>
<p>Secret sources have stated that this fat horny bastard has contracted various STDs.</p>
<ul>
<li>One of the sources closest to him has said that Kim Jong Un has <a href="https://medlineplus.gov/syphilis.html">Syphilis.</a></li>
</ul>
 
<p>This should not be that hard to believe, since his father has had a lot of different STDs as well!</p>
<p>North Korea is also very well known for sex trade, and young girls get forced into sex with high ranking officials.</p>
<ul>
<li>Basically him and his dad probably had sex with tons of girls who were basically raped.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span>Kim Jong Un Will Never Go To The Doctor!</span></h2>
<p>His entire family is very well known for being paranoid!</p>
<p>A long time ago, his grandfather had a tumor, and he simply refused to get it removed!</p>
 
<blockquote><p>&#8220;His reasoning was that he was afraid of being killed. Why risk the life of doing whatever you want as a dictator when you don&#8217;t have to!&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Many dictators have been known to be afraid of surgery for the simple reason of getting assassinated.&#160;</p>
<ul>
<li>Surgery requires getting sedated, and that is not something these guys want to do!</li>
</ul>
<p>If Kim continues to live his crazy life style, he will definitely need surgery.</p>
<p>That is exactly why this guy will never do anything about his health and stay away from the doctor.</p>

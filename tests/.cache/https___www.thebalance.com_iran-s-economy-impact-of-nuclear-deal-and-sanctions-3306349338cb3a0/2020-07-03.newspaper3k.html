<p>Iran's economy had received a boost when the United States lifted sanctions in 2015. In February 2016, Iran began shipping oil to Europe for the first time in three years.&#160;It <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/more-shipments-of-iranian-oil-are-readied-for-europe-1455559119">exported 4 million barrels</a>&#160;to France, Spain, and Russia.&#160;Oil makes up 80%&#160;of Iran's exports. Its primary export markets are&#160;<a href="https://www.thebalance.com/china-economy-facts-effect-on-us-economy-3306345">China</a>, India, South Korea, Turkey, and&#160;<a href="https://www.thebalance.com/japan-s-economy-recession-effect-on-u-s-and-world-3306007">Japan</a>.&#160;</p>

<p>But on May 8, 2018,&#160;<a href="https://www.thebalance.com/donald-trump-economic-plan-3994106">President Donald Trump</a>&#160;announced the United States would&#160;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/world/middleeast/trump-iran-nuclear-deal.html">withdraw from the 2015 nuclear deal</a> and reimpose sanctions. That severely hurt Iran's economy.</p>

<p>Iran has the world's fourth-largest <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/oil-reserves-definition-categories-world-s-largest-3305873">oil reserves</a>. But sanctions prevented it from capitalizing on that resource. As a result, Iran is only the world's seventh-largest oil producer, pumping 4.5 million barrels per day. In 2018, it exported <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IRNNXGOCMBD">1.9 million barrels per day</a>. Without sanctions, Iran&#160;<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/iran-projects-oil-exports-to-almost-double-after-sanctions-lifted-official-1436098424">had hoped to double that amount</a>&#160;once it built up the necessary infrastructure. With the reinstatement of sanctions, exports are projected to plummet to 945,000 barrels per day.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/us/politics/trump-iran-nuclear-deal-news-analysis-.html">Some experts</a> say there is an underlying motive behind the sanctions. The Trump administration, Saudi Arabia, and Israel want to end the Iranian clerical regime.&#160;Saudi Arabia and Iran have long been on opposite sides of the&#160;<a href="https://www.thebalance.com/sunni-shiite-split-3305550">Sunni-Shiite split</a>.&#160;&#160;</p>

<p>On July 14, 2015, the United States, the&#160;EU, Russia, China, and&#160;Iran signed the Joint Commission Plan of Action. Iran agreed to limit its nuclear development program in return for the end of economic sanctions. The arms embargo would remain in place until 2020.</p>
<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-39" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"></p>
<p>Specifically, Iran agreed to reduce its 12,000-kilogram stockpile of enriched uranium to 300 kilograms. It agreed to remove about two-thirds or 10,000 centrifuges that produce uranium. It would eliminate the core of the Arak plutonium reactor.&#160;Iran agreed to neither produce nor acquire highly enriched uranium or weapons-grade plutonium.&#160;&#160;The U.N.'s&#160;International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors must have daily access to Iran's entire nuclear production supply chain.&#160;</p>
<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-41" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"></p>
<p>The agreement guaranteed&#160;that, for 10 years, Iran would be at least a year away from producing a nuclear weapon. That is much longer than its "breakout time" of two to three months before the agreement. According to the&#160;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/us/politics/trump-iran-nuclear-deal-news-analysis-.html?action=click&amp;module=Intentional&amp;pgtype=Article">New York Times</a>, the deal&#160;succeeded in getting 97% of Iran's nuclear material out of the country.</p>
<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-43" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.state.gov/remarks-secretary-pompeo/">agreement reduced</a>&#160;Iran's ability to create a nuclear bomb. Despite the sanctions, Iran had increased its number of centrifuges from 164 to thousands. It had also accumulated enough fissile material for 10 to 12 nuclear bombs. Iran promised to reduce its centrifuges and the amount of bomb-grade nuclear material, making it less likely that it will create a weapon.</p>
<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-45" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"></p>
<p>The agreement did&#160;not remove many other problems with Iran's behavior. These&#160;include its support of terrorism, its refusal to turn over four American hostages, its ballistic missiles, and its human rights violations.&#160;</p>
<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-47" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/iran-world-powers-reach-nuclear-deal-1436861667">Critics in the U.S. Congress, Israel, and Saudi Arabia</a>&#160;warned that the agreement allowed&#160;Iran to build nuclear weapons after the 10-year moratorium. Removing sanctions gave Iran more economic power to fund terrorist organizations in Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen.&#160;</p>

<p>In 2006, the United States asked the United Nations Security Council to impose sanctions on Iran if it didn&#8217;t agree to suspend uranium enrichment.&#65279;&#65279; It said Iran violated its compliance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.

<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-56" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"></p>
<p>Iran ignored repeated Security Council Resolutions.

The sanctions restricted financial&#160;transactions,&#160;imposed asset freezes and travel bans on&#160;Iranians,&#160;and banned arms sales.&#160;</p>
<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-60" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"></p>

<p>The United States first imposed&#160;<a href="https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/international-sanctions-iran">sanctions on Iran</a>&#160;on November 14, 1979. President Jimmy Carter responded to the November 4, 1979 hostage crisis. Iranian students took 66 Americans hostage at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran.

<p>In January 1984, the United States imposed additional sanctions in response to the bombing of the U.S. Marine base in Beirut. It had been carried out by Iran's client, Hezbollah. The United States&#160;<a href="https://www.state.gov/state-sponsors-of-terrorism/">designated</a>&#160;Iran as a state sponsor of terrorism. The designation remains in place.

<p>Through much of the 1980s, the United States financed the Nicaraguan &#8220;contras&#8221; rebellion against the Sandinista government by secretly selling arms to Iran. This led to the Iran-Contra Scandal in 1986, which implicated members of the&#160;<a href="https://www.thebalance.com/president-ronald-reagan-s-economic-policies-3305568">Reagan administration</a>&#160;in illegal activities.</p>
<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-75" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"></p>
<p>From October 1984 to October 1986, the United States assisted the military activities of the Nicaraguan contra rebels during the prohibition on such aid. It financed this by selling U.S. arms to Iran in contravention of stated U.S. policy. That was also possibly in violation of arms-export controls.</p>
<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-77" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"></p>
<p>In late November 1986, Reagan administration officials announced that some of the proceeds from the sale of U.S. arms to Iran were used to fund the Contras. The Iran/Contra Report of Independent Counsel found that some of Reagan&#8217;s advisers and Cabinet members sitting on the National Security Council&#160;were&#160;involved. They set up Oliver North and other National Security Agency employees as scapegoats to protect the Reagan administration.&#160;The report added that much of the best evidence of the cover-up was made in the last year of the Counsel&#8217;s investigation, too late for most prosecutions.&#160;</p>

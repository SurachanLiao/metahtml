Its economy shrank by 3.5%.</p> <p>Iran's economy had received a boost when the United States lifted sanctions in 2015. In February 2016, Iran began shipping oil to Europe for the first time in three years. It <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/more-shipments-of-iranian-oil-are-readied-for-europe-1455559119">exported 4 million barrels</a>to France, Spain, and Russia. Oil makes up 80% of Iran's exports.

Investors believed Iran's oil supply will dwindle once sanctions are reimposed. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation said Trump's decision to reimpose trade sanctions on Iran <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/hsbc-trump-trade-war-part-of-triple-shock-of-threats-to-the-global-economy-2018-7?r=US&amp;IR=T">raised the price of oil by $10 per barrel</a>.</p> <p>On August 6, 2018, the administration says it expected Iran’s oil buyers to begin winding down their oil purchases. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-signals-zero-tolerance-on-future-iran-oil-exports-1530028859?mod=article_inline">Oil companies had until November 4</a>to cut 1 million barrels per day.

Iran agreed to limit its nuclear development program in return for the end of economic sanctions. The arms embargo would remain in place until 2020.</p> <p>Specifically, Iran agreed to reduce its 12,000-kilogram stockpile of enriched uranium to 300 kilograms. It agreed to remove about two-thirds or 10,000 centrifuges that produce uranium. It would eliminate the core of the Arak plutonium reactor. Iran agreed to neither produce nor acquire highly enriched uranium or weapons-grade plutonium.  The U.N.'s International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors must have daily access to Iran's entire nuclear production supply chain. </p> <p>The agreement guaranteed that, for 10 years, Iran would be at least a year away from producing a nuclear weapon. That is much longer than its "breakout time" of two to three months before the agreement. According to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/us/politics/trump-iran-nuclear-deal-news-analysis-.html?action=click&amp;module=Intentional&amp;pgtype=Article">New York Times</a>, the deal succeeded in getting 97% of Iran's nuclear material out of the country.</p> <p>The <a href="https://www.state.gov/remarks-secretary-pompeo/">agreement reduced</a>Iran's ability to create a nuclear bomb. Despite the sanctions, Iran had increased its number of centrifuges from 164 to thousands. It had also accumulated enough fissile material for 10 to 12 nuclear bombs. Iran promised to reduce its centrifuges and the amount of bomb-grade nuclear material, making it less likely that it will create a weapon.</p> <p>The agreement did not remove many other problems with Iran's behavior. These include its support of terrorism, its refusal to turn over four American hostages, its ballistic missiles, and its human rights violations. </p> <p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/iran-world-powers-reach-nuclear-deal-1436861667">Critics in the U.S. Congress, Israel, and Saudi Arabia</a>warned that the agreement allowed Iran to build nuclear weapons after the 10-year moratorium. Removing sanctions gave Iran more economic power to fund terrorist organizations in Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen. </p> <p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/tosv2.html?vid=&amp;uuid=a082d090-977b-11e9-af8d-3f16bd395216&amp;url=L3ZpZXcvYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjAxOC0wNS0wOC9pcmFuLW51Y2xlYXItZGVhbC1zLWVuZC1mcmVlcy10cnVtcC10by1maWdodC1mb3ItaXJhbmlhbi1mcmVlZG9tP3V0bV9zb3VyY2U9dHdpdHRlciZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249c29jaWFsZmxvdy1vcmdhbmljJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09c29jaWFsJnV0bV9jb250ZW50PXZpZXcmY21waWQlM0Q9c29jaWFsZmxvdy10d2l0dGVyLXZpZXc=">Some Iranians believe</a>the deal conferred legitimacy on a regime that was losing popular support anyway.

The sanctions restricted financial transactions, imposed asset freezes and travel bans on Iranians, and banned arms sales. </p> <p>The United States also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/07/world/middleeast/united-states-announces-new-iran-sanctions.html?_r=2&amp;">imposed sanctions</a>on companies doing business with Iran.

Carter froze all Iranian assets that were under the jurisdiction of the United States.</p> <p>In January 1984, the United States imposed additional sanctions in response to the bombing of the U.S. Marine base in Beirut. It had been carried out by Iran's client, Hezbollah. The United States <a href="https://www.state.gov/state-sponsors-of-terrorism/">designated</a>Iran as a state sponsor of terrorism.

This led to the Iran-Contra Scandal in 1986, which implicated members of the <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/president-ronald-reagan-s-economic-policies-3305568">Reagan administration</a>in illegal activities.</p> <p>From October 1984 to October 1986, the United States assisted the military activities of the Nicaraguan contra rebels during the prohibition on such aid. It financed this by selling U.S. arms to Iran in contravention of stated U.S. policy. That was also possibly in violation of arms-export controls.</p> <p>In late November 1986, Reagan administration officials announced that some of the proceeds from the sale of U.S. arms to Iran were used to fund the Contras. The Iran/Contra Report of Independent Counsel found that some of Reagan’s advisers and Cabinet members sitting on the National Security Council were involved. They set up Oliver North and other National Security Agency employees as scapegoats to protect the Reagan administration. The report added that much of the best evidence of the cover-up was made in the last year of the Counsel’s investigation, too late for most prosecutions. </p> </article>

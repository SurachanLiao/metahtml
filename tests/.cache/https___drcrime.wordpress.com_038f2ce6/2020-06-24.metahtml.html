The waiter told them that they had, in fact, been given a discount as they were relieved of the &#8364;2.50 per person cover charge.</p><p>&#8220;We&#8217;d just paid &#8364;59 for our entire dinner, including a litre of wine, and then were charged &#8364;42 for gelato!&#8221; James told The Local.&#160;&#8220;We&#8217;ve been careful in watching out for pickpockets in Rome, but I never thought I would get scammed here,&#8221; he said.&#160;The couple paid the bill but, unsure whether such a high charge was legal, they returned to the bar on Thursday morning with the police.</p><p>Mediating between the waiter and the Lucianis, a police officer checked the menu and found that the price was written down. As the menu was available, the bar was not breaking Italian law.&#160;&#8220;I should have checked the menu,&#8221; James told The Local, adding that he and his wife had previously been guests of Italian relatives and so had not encountered such problems.</p><p>When approached by The Local, the waiter said that he only worked at the bar and did not decide the menu prices.&#160;When the manager arrived at Bar il Caff&#232; later on Thursday, he told The Local that he was an &#8220;honest&#8221; person and the problem was the customers&#8217; fault.&#160;&#8220;It&#8217;s their fault&#8230;I advise foreigners to read the menu,&#8221; he said, declining to give his name and pointing to menus on a number of outdoor tables.</p><p>&#8220;Italy isn&#8217;t like other countries. Here there&#8217;s always a different price at the bar and sat at a table,&#8221; the manager added, pointing to a sign above the ice cream stand which in English states the cheaper &#8220;take-away&#8221; prices.&#160;&#8220;An ice cream in this cup is big,&#8221; the manager said, holding up a glass bowl which carries the &#8364;13 price tag. &#8220;You could have it for lunch!&#8221;</p><p>But the Lucianis are not the first visitors to complain that the place is a tourist trap. The bar&#8217;s TripAdvisor page gets a resounding &#8220;terrible&#8221; rating from 25 of its 28 reviews.&#160;A British tourist who visited earlier this month described the bar as a &#8220;complete rip off&#8221; to &#8220;avoid at all costs&#8221; after she was charged &#8364;29 for two drinks.</p><ul>

At some point between 12:30 and 6:30 a.m., police say, thieves took off with the whole caravan of vehicles &#8211; which not only includes a pickup truck and a trailer, but three classic Volkswagen Mini Buses.</p><p>The VW Mini Buses were in the trailer, which was attached to a Ford F-350, when the theft happened, police say. Police say that the VW Mini Buses alone are worth about $100,000 each. The buses are used as a part of Tillamook&#8217;s promotional tour, each one highlighting the company&#8217;s different cheese, yogurt and ice cream products.</p><p>It shouldn&#8217;t be too hard to spot the vehicles, as all of them are custom-painted orange with the &#8220;Tillamook&#8221; logo emblazoned on the sides. Anyone who knows where the vehicles might be is asked to call the Manteca Police Department at (209) 456-8101.&#160;The following is the vehicle&#8217;s description, along with their license plate numbers:</p><p>&#9830; 2008 Ford F350, Oregon License plate number Y116821

(AP) &#8212; A former University of Vermont employee who pleaded guilty to embezzling at least $185,000 from the college&#8217;s cheese making program is going to prison for 13 months.</p><p>Jody Farnham of Burlington was sentenced Monday in federal court in Rutland.&#160;She had pleaded guilty to charges she cashed tuition checks for her own use that were earmarked for the college&#8217;s Vermont Institute for Artisan Cheese, where she was an administrator.</p><p>Federal prosecutors say she also used UVM credit cards for personal purchases.&#160;The cheese institute closed in May 2013 after years of operating losses.</p><p>Farnham&#8217;s lawyer declined to comment.&#160;She was ordered to report to prison next month.</p><ul>

The summertime treat powerhouse had sued its former franchisee, Dimitrios Tsirkos, who runs his buggies in Queens, Manhattan and the Bronx out of a depot in Long Island City.</p><p>The 53-year-old Woodside businessman painted his vehicles in a familiar-looking red, white and blue color scheme and included a grinning, cone-headed mascot &#8212; making the truck difficult to differentiate from a Mister Softee four-wheeler.</p><p>&#8220;It is obvious that (Tsirkos) adopted his truck designs with the object of achieving an appearance similar to plaintiff&#8217;s Mister Softee trucks,&#8221; Judge Laura Taylor Swain wrote in court papers. &#8220;The trucks are designed to appeal to children, who are relatively unsophisticated consumers.&#8221;</p><p>Swain barred Tsirkos from using the name Master Softee or any other confusing names or marks, and prohibited Tsirkos from involvement in any facet of theretail ice cream industry within 5 miles of his former Mister Softee franchise territories until February 2016.</p><p>Still, the Daily News spotted Master Softee trucks over the weekend on Sixth Ave., in Greenwich Village, and along Broadway in Astoria. Mister Softee co-owner Jim Conway said that a private eye retained by his company counted 10 of the trucks on Saturday and Sunday in Manhattan.</p><p>&#8220;These guys are bad guys on all levels,&#8221; said Conway, whose family founded the New Jersey-based chain in 1956. &#8220;We don&#8217;t have an alternative but to work through the court system.&#160;Conway and his lawyer, Jeff Zucker, have spent more than a decade suing knockoff Mister Softee ice cream trucks. They say they have never lost a case.</p><p>Tsirkos&#8217; attorney, Nicholas Damadeo, wouldn&#8217;t explain why the illegal sugar-loving crew appeared to be ignoring the court&#8217;s order. &#8220;The case is still proceeding,&#8221; Damadeo said, adding the ban is not permanent and Tsirkos can file an appeal. &#8220;That&#8217;s one of the avenues that is available.&#8221;</p><p>Meanwhile, Mister Softee investigators plan to submit photographs of Master Softee trucks in action, hoping that Swain will come down on Tsirkos.&#160;&#8220;They are violating the judge&#8217;s orders,&#8221; Conway said.</p><ul>

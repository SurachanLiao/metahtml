<p><strong>An American couple were outraged after being charged &#8364;42 for three ice creams and a bottle of water at a bar in central Rome, asking the police to intervene, but the manager told The Local it was &#8220;their fault&#8221; for not reading the menu.</strong></p>
<p>James and Mariann Luciani had just finished dinner when they and a relative stopped for an ice cream at Bar il Caff&#232;, just a stone&#8217;s throw from the Trevi Fountain.&#160;Having paid around &#8364;3 or &#8364;4 for an ice cream so far on their Italian holiday, they were shocked when the bill came to &#8364;42 ($50).</p>
<p>The Lucianis contested the charge, only to be shown a menu &#8212;&#160;having not checked before ordering&#8212;in which the price for an ice cream was set at &#8364;13 apiece. The waiter told them that they had, in fact, been given a discount as they were relieved of the &#8364;2.50 per person cover charge.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d just paid &#8364;59 for our entire dinner, including a litre of wine, and then were charged &#8364;42 for gelato!&#8221; James told The Local.&#160;&#8220;We&#8217;ve been careful in watching out for pickpockets in Rome, but I never thought I would get scammed here,&#8221; he said.&#160;The couple paid the bill but, unsure whether such a high charge was legal, they returned to the bar on Thursday morning with the police.</p>
<p>Mediating between the waiter and the Lucianis, a police officer checked the menu and found that the price was written down. As the menu was available, the bar was not breaking Italian law.&#160;&#8220;I should have checked the menu,&#8221; James told The Local, adding that he and his wife had previously been guests of Italian relatives and so had not encountered such problems.</p>
<p>When approached by The Local, the waiter said that he only worked at the bar and did not decide the menu prices.&#160;When the manager arrived at Bar il Caff&#232; later on Thursday, he told The Local that he was an &#8220;honest&#8221; person and the problem was the customers&#8217; fault.&#160;&#8220;It&#8217;s their fault&#8230;I advise foreigners to read the menu,&#8221; he said, declining to give his name and pointing to menus on a number of outdoor tables.</p>
<p>&#8220;Italy isn&#8217;t like other countries. Here there&#8217;s always a different price at the bar and sat at a table,&#8221; the manager added, pointing to a sign above the ice cream stand which in English states the cheaper &#8220;take-away&#8221; prices.&#160;&#8220;An ice cream in this cup is big,&#8221; the manager said, holding up a glass bowl which carries the &#8364;13 price tag. &#8220;You could have it for lunch!&#8221;</p>
<p>But the Lucianis are not the first visitors to complain that the place is a tourist trap. The bar&#8217;s TripAdvisor page gets a resounding &#8220;terrible&#8221; rating from 25 of its 28 reviews.&#160;A British tourist who visited earlier this month described the bar as a &#8220;complete rip off&#8221; to &#8220;avoid at all costs&#8221; after she was charged &#8364;29 for two drinks.</p>

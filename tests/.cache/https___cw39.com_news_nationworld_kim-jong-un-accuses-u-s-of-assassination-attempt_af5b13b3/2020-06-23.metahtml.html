		</p><p>PYONGYANG, North Korea - North Korea is accusing the U.S. of trying to assassinate the supreme leader! The North Koreans say a "hideous terrorist group" conspired with the CIA and and the South Korean government to attack Kim Jong Un with a "bio-chemical substance."</p><p>You might remember Kim Jong Un's brother was killed earlier this year in an airport when police say two women rubbed a toxic substance on his face. Many speculate Un was behind the alleged murder of his estranged brother, which would mean he's accusing the U.S. of the same thing.</p><p class="modal modal--suggest-a-correction article-content-cta-group__cta">

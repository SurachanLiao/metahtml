			<p>Driving cars at seven, binge drinking vodka at 14 and being around his father&#8217;s pleasure girls throughout his teens, it is little wonder Kim Jong-un&#8217;s excessive and twisted upbringing would yield the leader North Korea has today.</p> <p class="hide-in-mobile">Former companion Kenji Fujimoto, who spent more than a decade as the ruling family&#8217;s personal chef and Kim's playmate, is now coming forward to give the most detailed account of the leader&#8217;s troubling childhood to ever be released.</p>

			 <p class="hide-in-mobile">&#8220;In the palace, I had two jobs really. For Kim Jong-Il (the current leader's father), I was his main sushi chef. For Kim Jong-un, I was there to play with him, almost like a nanny,&#8221; says Fujimoto to<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2565558/My-playmate-monster-A-tyrant-nursery-Vodka-binges-14-Big-Macs-brigade-pleasure-girls-The-man-saw-Kim-Jong-Un-rock-star-boyhood-blood-soaked-dictatorship-tell-story.html"> The Daily Mail</a> on Saturday.</p> <p class="hide-in-mobile">"I would say I was the closest person to him when he was young. I felt like he was my own son.&#8221;</p> <p class="hide-in-mobile">From the age of six, Jong-un spent hours of every day with the chef.</p> <p class="hide-in-mobile">Allowed egregious privileges at a young age, Fujimoto recalls Jong-un demanding to drive a car, a Mercedes no less, at the age of seven.</p> <p class="hide-in-mobile">&#8220;They put a little box beneath his feet to help him reach the pedals and someone gave him instruction. The first car he got was a Mercedes-Benz, and he has owned Mercedes ever since. I&#8217;d say he has more than ten now &#8211; all bulletproof.&#8221;</p> <p class="hide-in-mobile">Around the age of 14, he began to take up smoking.</p>

			 <p class="hide-in-mobile">He would often show up at Fujimoto&#8217;s door at 3 a.m., begging for cigarettes.</p> <p class="hide-in-mobile">Even more troubling, Fujimoto recalls Jong-un drinking at 14.</p> <p class="hide-in-mobile">&#8220;[He] drank a lot, too, even as a young teenager &#8211; Russia&#8217;s finest vodka. Sometimes he&#8217;d drink the whole bottle all by himself.&#8221;</p> <p class="hide-in-mobile">As time went on, the would-be despot adopted a playboy lifestyle, spending time on one of the two yachts his father bought for him. Early habits that explain recent reports that claimed the North Korean leader spent $716 million dollars in 2012 alone.</p> <p class="hide-in-mobile">In his late teens, Jong-un found himself exposed to his sex-crazed father&#8217;s &#8216;pleasure brigade&#8217; &#8211; bands of beautiful teenage girls forced to sing, strip naked and perform massages and sexual favors.</p> <p class="hide-in-mobile">Fujimoto claims that the 18-year-old was shy with girls and hated &#8220;having relationships with multiple women.&#8221; Jong-un&#8217;s reluctance led his father to question if his son was interested in girls.</p> <p class="hide-in-mobile">Fujimoto speculates that this hatred of his father&#8217;s womanizing is what led Jong Un to execute his uncle. Jang Song Thaek, who was responsible for picking the girls, used to make girls strip and lift their legs to &#8220;inspect their virginity.&#8221;</p> <p class="hide-in-mobile">The live-in-chef also described an exorbitant lifestyle the family enjoyed while millions of North Koreans were dying during the country&#8217;s two decade famine.</p>

		 <p class="hide-in-mobile">&#8220;It was incredible, with an enormous chandelier and all-cream furnishings,&#8221; Fujimoto says.</p> <p class="hide-in-mobile">&#8220;It had an Olympic-size pool, movie theatre and huge gym. The kids&#8217; playroom was big, with remote-controlled cars everywhere and a billiard table.&#8221;</p> <p class="hide-in-mobile">In 2001, Fujimoto fled North Korea to Japan. His escape was viewed as betrayal by the leader, who sent assassins to kill the former nanny and chef. However, a year later a North Korean official showed up at Fujimoto&#8217;s doorstep, saying that he had been forgiven and Kim requested him to return.</p> <p class="hide-in-mobile">Reluctantly agreeing, he arrived at the leader&#8217;s palace.</p> <p class="hide-in-mobile">&#8220;I was terrified. I had betrayed Kim Jong-Un by leaving North Korea, so he could have had me killed.&#8221;    Uncharacteristic of his notorious temperamental personality, Kim smiled at his childhood companion, hugged him, and said, &#8220;Long time no see, Fujimoto-san. Your betrayal of North Korea has been all forgiven.&#8221;</p>

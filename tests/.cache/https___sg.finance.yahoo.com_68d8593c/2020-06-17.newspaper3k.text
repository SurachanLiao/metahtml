The Canadian government will unveil a "fiscal and economic snapshot" on July 8 to show much money it has spent combating the coronavirus outbreak, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Wednesday. Trudeau, though, said it was still too soon to present a full fiscal update with formal mid- to long-term projections. The snapshot "will give Canadians an idea of where our economy is right now, how our response compares to that of other countries and what we can expect in the months to come," Trudeau told a daily briefing.

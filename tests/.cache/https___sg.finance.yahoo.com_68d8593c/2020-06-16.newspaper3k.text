U.S. retail sales increased by the most on record in May after two straight months of sharp declines as businesses reopened, offering more evidence that the recession triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic was over or drawing to an end. "The economy and retail sales have hit the bottom in May and we have a V-shaped first stage of recovery," said Sung Won Sohn, a business economics professor at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. "However, it will take quite some time to get back to anywhere near the levels of retail sales and economic activity we enjoyed around the turn of the year."

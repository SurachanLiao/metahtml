Unlike his predecessors, he believed in the importance of application of religion in the practical, social and political issues of the day. He was also an arch-anti-secularist.</p></li><li class="newpara"><p class="newpara_desc">In 1962, he protested against the westernization pursued by the Shah, who launched the White Revolution in Iran. He organized the ulama of religious scholars and together with them, strongly opposed Shah and his plans, thus boycotting the White Revolution.</p></li><li class="newpara"><p class="newpara_desc">For his defamatory speech against the Shah in which he accused the latter for moral corruption and submission of Iran to America and revolutionary actions, he was imprisoned in June 1963.</p></li><li class="newpara"><p class="newpara_desc">Following his imprisonment, riots broke out in Iran as people rallied for his release. The event is recalled as Movement of 15 Khordad. Upon his release in 1964, he returned to Qom.</p></li><li class="newpara"><p class="newpara_desc">He continued to attack Shah&#8217;s close ties with America and Israel. Though the government did try to convince him to drop down the movement, he refuted and instead continued attacking, which resulted in his arrest and deportment.</p></li><li class="newpara"><p class="newpara_desc">He was deported to Turkey where he lived for a year before moving his base to Najaf, Iraq. In his fourteen years of exile, he drew upon a theory, called wilayat-al-faqih, which stated how an ideal state based on true Islamic principles and led by the clergy should be like.</p></li><li class="newpara"><p class="newpara_desc">He began teaching Iranian students at the local schools of Iraq. The videotapes of these sermons were smuggled and made available in Iran as well. It was his provocative speeches that made him the most influential leader in opposition to the government of Shah.</p></li><li class="newpara"><p class="newpara_desc">His growing popularity and mass display of protest led to his deportment further to Paris, where he spent the last few months of his exile. Meanwhile, the mass protest and remonstration against the government eventually caused the sabbatical of the Shah.</p></li><li class="newpara"><p class="newpara_desc">Upon his return on February 1, 1979 to the Iranian soil, he was unanimously appointed as the new leader for Iran. Just after his return, he adopted a modified form of wilayat-al-faqih and started to lay the foundation to build an ideal Islamic state.</p></li><p class="crb hide_on_bs">Continue Reading Below</p>

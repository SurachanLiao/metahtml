Welcome to the new Voxeurop! After more than ten years, the website needed an update. We used the launch of our subscription offers as an opportunity to completely revamp the visual identity and layout of Voxeurop. The new site is not only more modern but also easier to access and to read. Navigation of the more than 8,000 articles in our archive is now more intuitive, and new features will soon be available. A few bugs and other growing pains cannot be ruled out; we will be working them out in the coming weeks, and we are counting on you to let us know your comments, critiques, and suggestions.

The relaunch of our website was the right time to launch our subscription offers. In order to guarantee the viability of Voxeurop and to better connect it to its community, we are offering our readers the chance to be more involved in our – in your – outlet’s life by choosing among three monthly subscription rates. These subscriptions give access to different benefits such as advanced previews of articles, exclusive exchanges with the editorial team (choice of topics, participation in interviews, etc.), the possibility to publish blog posts, and no ads.

Animating a European public space

From an editorial standpoint, we are continuing the initiative undertaken several months ago with the launch of our manifesto: to organise a public European space by reporting on Europe to its citizens’ scale. We accomplish this through exclusive articles (many of which are entrusted to some of the sharpest observers of European affairs), through articles that we select daily among hundreds of sources, by continually giving a prominent place to editorial cartoons (a journalistic format in its own right and one of our trademarks) and to illustrations. All this and translating the entirety into as many languages as possible. We are also introducing a new format: photo coverage from all corners of Europe. Photography will generally be more present on our new website.

We are counting on you to join us in this unique editorial adventure, and we are thrilled to have you by our side!

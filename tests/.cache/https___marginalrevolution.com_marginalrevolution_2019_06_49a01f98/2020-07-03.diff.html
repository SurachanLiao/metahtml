Ford aircraft carrier or fund federal health-care programs for fifty hours.”</p></blockquote><p>Recommended, you can buy the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nonsense-Factory-Making-Breaking-American/dp/0316475262/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=nonsense+factory&amp;qid=1561843661&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-1/marginalrevol-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p></article> <article class="post-76202 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-books category-uncategorized" id="post-76202"><p><ins>Vaclav Smil, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Growth-Microorganisms-Megacities-MIT-Press/dp/0262042835/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=vaclav+smil+growth&amp;qid=1561731573&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-2/marginalrevol-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Growth: From Microorganisms to Megacities Link: https://www.amazon.com/Growth-Microorganisms-Megacities-MIT-Press/dp/0262042835/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=vaclav+smil+growth&amp;qid=1561731573&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-2/marginalrevol-20 </a>.  This book was too much a pile of facts for my taste — and facts I already know — but it is about the most important topic, namely growth and economic growth, so some of you should read it.  When you get right down to it, there are worse things than a pile of facts!</ins></p><p><ins>Swapan Dasgupta, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Awakening-Bharat-Mata-Political-Beliefs/dp/0670091693/ref=sr_1_1?crid=CCBL1KLQNWO&amp;keywords=awakening+bharat+mata&amp;qid=1561731483&amp;s=gateway&amp;sprefix=awakening+bha%2Caps%2C126&amp;sr=8-1/marginalrevol-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Awakening Bharat Mata: The Political Beliefs of the Indian Right Link: https://www.amazon.com/Awakening-Bharat-Mata-Political-Beliefs/dp/0670091693/ref=sr_1_1?crid=CCBL1KLQNWO&amp;keywords=awakening+bharat+mata&amp;qid=1561731483&amp;s=gateway&amp;sprefix=awakening+bha%2Caps%2C126&amp;sr=8-1/marginalrevol-20 </a>.  What do those people actually believe and why?  A summary and also a collection of original texts, strongly recommended for insight into one of the world’s most important nations and thus one of the world’s most important intellectual movements.</ins></p><p><ins>Gabriel García Marquez, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Scandal-Century-Other-Writings/dp/0525656421/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=scandal+of+the+century&amp;qid=1561731639&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-1/marginalrevol-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Scandal of the Century, and Other Writings Link: https://www.amazon.com/Scandal-Century-Other-Writings/dp/0525656421/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=scandal+of+the+century&amp;qid=1561731639&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-1/marginalrevol-20 </a>.  His early journalistic pieces are a revelation, both for their connections to a Borges-Cortázar style, and for how they show the roots of his later more literary productions.  His best-known work is perhaps overrated, but his body of work as a whole is still considerably underrated, and this volume will add to your appreciation of him.</ins></p><p><ins>I’ve only browsed Owen Matthews, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Impeccable-Spy-Richard-Stalins-Master/dp/1408857782/ref=sr_1_1?crid=11I9OHRIMBOCU&amp;keywords=an+impeccable+spy&amp;qid=1561731682&amp;s=gateway&amp;sprefix=impeccable+%2Caps%2C133&amp;sr=8-1/marginalrevol-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An Impeccable Spy: Richard Sorge, Stalin’s Master Agent Link: https://www.amazon.com/Impeccable-Spy-Richard-Stalins-Master/dp/1408857782/ref=sr_1_1?crid=11I9OHRIMBOCU&amp;keywords=an+impeccable+spy&amp;qid=1561731682&amp;s=gateway&amp;sprefix=impeccable+%2Caps%2C133&amp;sr=8-1/marginalrevol-20 </a>, but it seems to be based on a remarkable amount of original research.  I do not care so much about the history of spying, but for some of you this should be a very good book.</ins></p><p><ins>Sarah L.

It no longer seems that China will join the international economic order as that term might have been understood 15 years ago. Instead, there will be an ongoing cold war; China will not liberalize, and capital controls may persist. In that world, Bitcoin will continue to prove a useful way of getting funds out of China. The Chinese Communist government may or may not crack down on that practice, but outright liberalization would have ended this use of Bitcoin altogether.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>For related reasons, a China that does not liberalize may influence the broader tenor of the global economy away from freedom, again giving Bitcoin additional uses around the world for evading central authorities.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>A second development is that the Democratic Party in the U.S. continues to shift to the left, including on the possibility of a wealth tax. As America’s fiscal deficits grow (due often to the Republicans, I might add), there will be a long-term need to restore fiscal sanity. Presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, for one, <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/1/24/18196275/elizabeth-warren-wealth-tax" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">advocates Link: https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/1/24/18196275/elizabeth-warren-wealth-tax </a> a 2% wealth tax (over $50 million) toward this end.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>No matter what you think of this idea, it likely would boost the demand for Bitcoin and other crypto assets, as cryptocurrencies are potentially a way to store assets out of reach of many tax authorities. And the U.S. is hardly the only nation that may be looking to a wealth tax in the future to balance the books. In essence, the new and higher price of Bitcoin is telling us that fiscal solvency will be hard to come by, and the wealthy will not give up their assets without a fight.</ins></p></blockquote><p><ins>Do read the whole thing.</ins></p></article><article class="post-76229 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-uncategorized" id="post-76229"><p><ins>1. “<a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/06/18/1814688116" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Our results suggest that Americans overestimate the intergenerational persistence in income ranks.

The Allies suddenly found themselves saddled with nearly three hundred thousand prisoners of war, including the bulk of General Erwin Rommel’s famed Afrika Korps. Unable to feed or house their share, the British asked their American comrades to relieve them of the burden. And so, by the tens of thousands, German soldiers were loaded aboard Liberty Ships, which had carried American troops across the Atlantic. Eventually, some five hundred P.O.W. camps, scattered across forty-five of the forty-eight United States, housed some four hundred thousand men. In every one of those camps, the Geneva conventions were adhered to so scrupulously that, after the war, not a few of the inmates decided to stick around and become Americans themselves. That was extraordinary rendition, Greatest Generation style.</ins></p></blockquote><p><ins>That’s the opening to a piece by Hendrik Hertzberg from 2011 and thus the piece is motivated neither by President Trump nor about separating children from their parents on the border.

Imagine that virtual reality is the “next big thing” and the gamification of just about everything, including education, proceeds apace. For the next generation of startups, that might throw the balance of power in the direction of expertise in entertainment and design — a sense of the theatrical, in other words, intermediated through tech. That could favor the culture of Los Angeles and Hollywood. Southern California also has a strong background in aerospace and military contracting, two areas that could produce a spillover effect for the next tech booms, especially if they involve transportation. The region also remains the leading U.S. <a href="https://www.inc.com/dakota-shane/3-reasons-why-los-angeles-could-become-nations-next-tech-hub.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">manufacturing center Link: https://www.inc.com/dakota-shane/3-reasons-why-los-angeles-could-become-nations-next-tech-hub.html </a>, and that too could be a source of future synergies.</ins></p></blockquote><p><ins>And:</ins></p><blockquote><p><ins>Northern California had an original advantage over Southern California as a center of free thinking and thus as a tech hub. Think back to Haight-Ashbury, the 1960s, Beatniks, LSD and the Whole Earth Catalog, the psychedelic movement, the bohemian and gay cultures of San Francisco. All of that bred an atmosphere of rebellion, and it helped birth the personal computer and a large movement of non-conformist hippie programmers, often working out of their proverbial garages.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>But those cultural roots have largely faded, and if anything today San Francisco and the Bay Area are better known for political correctness and a conformist culture of scolding and groupthink.

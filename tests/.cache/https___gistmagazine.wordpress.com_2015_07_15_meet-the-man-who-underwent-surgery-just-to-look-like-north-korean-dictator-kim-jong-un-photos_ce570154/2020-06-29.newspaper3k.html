A Chinese man has undergone plastic surgery to look like North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un. Wang Lei is the spitting image of the 32-year-old &#8216;Dear Leader&#8217; of North Korea, and has reportedly gone under the knife to enhance his likeness.&#160;</p>
<p>He was caught by photographers in Nanjing, capital of east China&#8217;s Jiangsu Province, after bumping into a fellow plastic surgery lover &#8211; and going on a date.</p>

<b>The real man; North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un</b>



<p>Wang Lei met Liu Zixuan, an actress based in Nanjing, at a plastic surgery clinic when she went for a check-up following a breast enlargement. The couple discovered their mutual interest in artificial body alterations and arranged to go on a gold date &#8211; inviting photographers to come along.<br>

<p>The pair attracted crowd attention as they walked through town and Wang Lei took it in his stride, waving back to &#8216;fans&#8217; and posed for pictures.</p>

The virus may also affect the gut. A coronavirus was first isolated in 1937 &#8211; it was an avian infectious bronchitis virus which had (and still has) the ability to seriously devastate poultry stocks. According to the Health Protection Agency (HPA), UK, it can also infect the uro-genital tract of chickens, and eventually spread to various organs in its body. Over the last 70 years, scientists have found that related coronaviruses can infect mice, rats, dogs, cats, turkeys, horses, pigs and cattle. What are human coronaviruses?

SARS Human coronaviruses (HCoV) were first identified in the 1960s from the naval cavities of patients with the common cold. Approximatley 30% of common colds are caused by two human coronaviruses &#8211; OC43 and 229E. Coronaviruses are thus called because of their crown-like projections on their surfaces. &#8220;Corona&#8221; in Latin means &#8220;halo&#8221; or &#8220;crown.&#8221; Coronaviruses&#8230; <a href="/go?url=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWVkaWNhbG5ld3N0b2RheS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjU2NTIxLnBocA==" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Read full this story</a></p><blockquote class="wps-mine-source-information"> Coronaviruses: Symptoms, Treatments and Variants have 286 words,  post on <a href="/go?url=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWVkaWNhbG5ld3N0b2RheS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjU2NTIxLnBocA==" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">www.medicalnewstoday.com</a> at November 29, 1999.

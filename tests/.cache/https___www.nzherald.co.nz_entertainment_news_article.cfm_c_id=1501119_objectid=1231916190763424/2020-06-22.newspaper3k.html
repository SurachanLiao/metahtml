<div> <p class=""> Hollywood actor Tom Hanks, who has been quarantined in Australia with his wife Rita Wilson after they both tested positive for Covid-19, has posted another update on his health for fans.</p> <p class=""> In a text post on Twitter, the actor says both he and his wife are doing better - and he has called for people to keep fighting to flatten the curve.</p> <p class=""> "Hey folks. Two weeks after our first symptoms we feel better," Hanks posted this afternoon.</p> <p class=""> "Sheltering in place works like this: You don't give it to anyone - You don't get it from anyone. Common sense, no? Going to take a while, but if we take care of each other, help where we can, and give up some comforts... this, too, shall pass. We can figure this out."</p> <p class="ad-text-before">Advertisement</p> <p id="ContentRect" class="pb-ad-container max-width-300 min-height-250"> </p>   <p class="border-bottom-airy"></p> <p class=""> Hank and wife Wilson have been keeping fans updated on their health and how they are passing the time in quarantine in Australia.</p> <p class=""> Yesterday, Wilson posted a video of herself rapping on Instagram, with the caption "quarantine stir crazy".</p> <p class="element element-rawhtml element-rawhtml-script"> </p> <p class=""> Hanks and Wilson announced their positive Covid-19 diagnosis on March 12.</p> <p class=""> <strong>READ MORE:<br>&#8226;<a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&amp;objectid=12319131&amp;ref=art_readmore" target="_blank"> Coronavirus and Tom Hanks: Kevin Bacon communicating with star via email</a><br>&#8226;<a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&amp;objectid=12318203&amp;ref=art_readmore" target="_blank"> Coronavirus: Tom Hanks 'OK, but not great' after treatment, sister reveals</a><br>&#8226;<a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&amp;objectid=12317821&amp;ref=art_readmore" target="_blank"> Coronavirus: Tom Hanks responds to uproar over excessive Vegemite during his Covid-19 lockdown</a><br>&#8226;<a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&amp;objectid=12316889&amp;ref=art_readmore" target="_blank"> Tom Hanks mocked for excessive Vegemite in coronavirus photo update</a></strong><br></p> <p class="nzh-datavis" id="nzh-datavis-root">&#8204;</p></div>

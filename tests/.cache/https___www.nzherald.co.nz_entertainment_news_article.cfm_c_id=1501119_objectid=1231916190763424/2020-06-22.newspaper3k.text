Hollywood actor Tom Hanks, who has been quarantined in Australia with his wife Rita Wilson after they both tested positive for Covid-19, has posted another update on his health for fans.

In a text post on Twitter, the actor says both he and his wife are doing better - and he has called for people to keep fighting to flatten the curve.

"Hey folks. Two weeks after our first symptoms we feel better," Hanks posted this afternoon.

"Sheltering in place works like this: You don't give it to anyone - You don't get it from anyone. Common sense, no? Going to take a while, but if we take care of each other, help where we can, and give up some comforts... this, too, shall pass. We can figure this out."

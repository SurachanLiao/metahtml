<span><span>The Trump administration claimed Iranian general Qasem Soleimani was
 planning &#8220;imminent attacks&#8221; on US interests when it assassinated him. 
That lie was just destroyed, but not before countless corporate media 
outlets transmitted it to the public.</span></span></h3>

Desperate to justify the US drone assassination of Iranian Major General Qasem Soleimani, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/01/03/qasem-soleimani-killing-pompeo-says-airstrike-response-threat/2802844001/">insisted</a>
 that Washington had made an &#8220;intelligence-based assessment&#8221; that 
Soleimani was &#8220;actively planning in the region&#8221; to attack American 
interests before he was killed.</p><p>
President Donald Trump justified his fateful decision to kill the 
Iranian general in even more explicit language, declaring that Soleimani
 was planning &#8220;imminent attacks&#8221; on US diplomatic facilities and 
personnel across the Middle East.</p><p>
&#160;&#8220;We took action last night to stop a war,&#8221; Trump claimed. &#8220;We did not take action to start a war.&#8221;</p><p>
Trump&#8217;s dubious rationale for an <a href="https://www.cia.gov/about-cia/eo12333.html">indisputably criminal</a> assassination has been <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/planned-attacks-against-u-s-targets-syria-lebanon-were-reason-n1110221">repeated</a> <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/video/president-trump-says-iranian-general-210013369.html">widely</a> across corporate media <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-says-soleimani-was-planning-imminent-and-sinister-attacks-defends-airstrike">networks</a>, and often without any skepticism or debate.</p><p>
At a <a href="https://www.state.gov/senior-state-department-officials-on-the-situation-in-iraq/">January 3 State Department briefing</a>,
 where reporters finally got the chance to demand evidence for the claim
 of an &#8220;imminent&#8221; threat, one US official erupted in anger.</p><p>
&#8220;Jesus, do we have to explain why we do these things?&#8221; he barked at the press.</p><p>
Two days later, when Iraqi Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi addressed 
his country&#8217;s parliament, Trump&#8217;s justification for killing Soleimani 
was exposed as a cynical lie.</p><p>
According to Abdul-Mahdi, he had planned to meet Soleimani on the morning the general was killed to <a href="https://twitter.com/Mustafa_salimb/status/1213822979882143744">discuss a diplomatic rapproachment</a> that Iraq was brokering between Iran and Saudi Arabia.</p><p>
Abdul-Mahdi said that Trump personally <a href="https://twitter.com/janearraf/status/1213823941321592834">thanked him</a>
 for the efforts, even as he was planning the hit on Soleimani &#8211; thus 
creating the impression that the Iranian general was safe to travel to 
Baghdad.</p><p>

The above article made it clear to all the American treachery and deceit in the assassination of Soleimani. The Iraqi PM was duded by Trump to invite Soleimani to broker a peace mission in Iran Saudi relations. Soleimani flown to Baghdad thinking that he was there to negotiate for peace with the Saudi govt.&#160; He flew there in a commercial aircraft on a peace mission, not as what the Americans had been lying to the world. And on his arrival, the American drones were there waiting for him at the airport and took him and his entourage out in cold blood murder.</p><p>
The Iraqi PM is furious for being made a fool of, and made use of, just like Justin Trudeau, by Trump, and became an accomplice to the assassination of Soleimani. How stupid can the Arabs be to continue to believe and trust the evil Americans? Soleimani would not have been so stupid to visit Baghdad if not of the invitation and the assurance that the evil Americans are supporting his visit and peace mission.&#160; Now the Iraqis are demanding that American troops leave Iraq but the Americans would not leave. They were invited to be in Iraq?</p><p>
Kim Jong Un must be wary of the Americans and stop meeting Trump again if he treasures his life and not be assassinated in the next meeting.

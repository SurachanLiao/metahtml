(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)</p><p class="post_title"><h1><p>Graham: Iranian Gen. Soleimani Is Dead Because He &#8216;Miscalculated&#8217; Trump</p></h1></p><p>The reason why Iranian Gen. Qassem <a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/t-soleimani">Soleimani</a> was killed by U.S. forces on Thursday was because of attacks he was planning against Americans&#8212;not because of attacks he carried out in the past, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said on Friday.</p>
<p>Soleimani, who headed the powerful Quds Force in the Revolutionary Guards, was killed in an airstrike in Baghdad, according to the U.S. <a href="https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Releases/Release/Article/2049534/statement-by-the-department-of-defense/">Department of Defense</a>. The Pentagon said it was taken as a &#8220;decisive defensive action to protect U.S. personnel&#8221; after it learned Soleimani &#8220;was actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The intelligence was that Soleimani was orchestrating chaos in Iraq at our expense and throughout the region,&#8221; Graham, a top ally of President Donald <a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/t-trump">Trump</a>, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/lindsey-graham-qassem-soleimani-iran-trump">told Fox News</a>. &#8220;The president was informed of these potential attacks and he acted. This was a defensive strike to neutralize future attacks that were planned and executed by Soleimani and the popular mobilization front: the Shiite militias in Iraq.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trump&#8217;s administration acted to prevent &#8220;holy hell&#8221; in the Middle East that would have been uncorked if Soleimani were allowed to act.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s not dead today because of what he did in the past, he&#8217;s dead today because he miscalculated what President Trump would do regarding future attacks,&#8221; said Graham.</p>
<p>Trump, he said, should make it now clear to Iran and its supreme leader that any future attack will put its oil refineries at risk. Iran is one of the world&#8217;s top exporters of oil.</p>
<p>&#8220;Their oil refineries are the last thing they have in terms of an economy,&#8221; Graham said. &#8220;To the Iranian government: If you want to stay in the oil business leave America and our allies alone and stop being the largest state sponsor of terrorism in the world,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Graham, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, suggested that he would go a step further.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are going to come after us with a vengeance if we do not reset the table quickly,&#8221; Graham said. &#8220;And, if I were the president, I would put on the table targets in Iran&#8212;not Iraq and Syria. Economic targets that crush the economy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Secretary of State Mike Pompeo <a href="https://twitter.com/SecPompeo/status/1213062846021558273">wrote it was</a> Trump&#8217;s &#8220;decision to eliminate Soleimani in response to imminent threats to American lives.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Responses</h2>
<p>Following the general&#8217;s death, countries heavily involved in the Middle East urged for de-escalation.</p>
<p>Britain Foreign Minister Dominic Raab on Friday&#160;<a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/dominic-raab-qassem-soleimani-iran-us-a4325481.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">called on</a>&#160;&#8220;all parties to de-escalate,&#8221; adding that &#8220;further conflict is in none of our interests.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ulrike Demmer,&#160;a German government spokeswoman, said the United States was just reacting to Iranian provocations.</p>
<p>&#8220;The American action was a reaction to a series of military provocations for which Iran is responsible,&#8221; she <a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/china-germany-britain-urge-de-escalation-after-us-strike-russia-offers-condolences_3192794.html">told reporters at a press conference</a>.&#160;&#8220;We also see with great concern Iran&#8217;s activities in the region. We stand before a dangerous escalation,&#8221; she added. Germany will try to de-escalate the situation, she said.</p>
<p>Russia, which has strengthened ties with Iran amid fighting in Syria, <a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/moscow-condemns-killing-of-iranian-general-as-russia-us-tensions-escalate_3192974.html">condemned the killing</a> of&#160;Soleimani and offered condolences to the Iranian people after his death.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, several top Democrats in Congress said they were not informed of the strike ahead of time.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Administration has conducted tonight&#8217;s strikes in Iraq targeting high-level Iranian military officials and killing Iranian Quds Force Commander Qasem Soleimani without an Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) against Iran,&#8221; Pelosi&#160;<a href="https://www.speaker.gov/newsroom/1220" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said in a statement.</a>&#160;Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said he also wasn&#8217;t informed.</p>
<p>&#8220;If [the president] plans a large increase in troops and potential hostility over a longer time, the administration will require congressional approval&#8212;and the approval of the American people,&#8221; Schumer said on the <a href="https://twitter.com/ABC/status/1213153769015447552">Senate floor on Friday</a>.</p>

<div><p><strong>Why Are The Brits Even More Loopy Than Americans When it Comes to Fruitcake Conspiracy Theories?</strong></p>
<p><strong>By Nate Thayer</strong></p>
<p><strong>February 24, 2013</strong></p>
<p>Some may recall that in December 2012 a couple of radio disc jockey pranksters in Australia called the London hospital where the pregnant Princess whatever-her-name-is was staying having taken ill with tummy troubles. The Aussie jokesters told the nurse on duty who answered the phone that they were the Queen of England and inquired about the well-being and status of their &#8220;grand-daughter.&#8221;</p>
<p>The nurse believed them and they engaged in a non-substantive, but recorded,&#160;conversation as to&#160;how the Princesses was feeling that resulted in a minor global hullabaloo after the joke was broadcast in Oz.</p>
<p>The blaring British tabloids didn&#8217;t damper the incident and &#160;a few days later the unfortunate and gullible nurse committed suicide.</p>
<p>That is when things got rather decidedly wonky.</p>
<p>What struck me&#8212;and motivated me to write the December 2012 story&#8211; was the extraordinary number of complete nutcases and the most inane conspiracy theorists who dominated the chattering classes on social media.</p>
<p>These people were seriously forwarding theories convinced that the poor nurse was the victim of a royal murder plot.</p>
<p>So I wrote an obvious tongue in cheek spoof story on my blog titled: <b>BREAKING NEWS:<i> Dark Hand of British Royal Family Behind Secret Murder of Kate&#8217;s Morning Sickness Nurse&#160;</i></b><b><i>&#8220;She pissed off the Queen, now she&#8217;s dead.&#8221;</i>&#8211;Twitter Ace Journalist</b></p>
<p><b>After my byline,&#160;</b><b>Nate Thayer, I accorded myself the job title <i>&#8220;Senior News Ombudsman for World Social Media Operations&#8221;</i></b></p>
<p>That should, I would have thought, been a clue that my tongue was firmly in my cheek.</p>
<p><b><i>The story began as follows:</i></b></p>
<p>The UK nurse at hospital where pregnant Kate Middleton was resting with morning sickness and&#160; answered the prank phone call from two&#160; male Aussie radio DJ&#8217;s saying they were Queen Elizabeth asking <i>&#8221;Hello, I&#8217;m just looking after my granddaughter, Kate. I wanted to see how her little tummy bug is going?&#8221;</i> has been found dead.</p>
<p>Fortunately the crack professionals of social media, which has effectively replaced what use to be the job of the now widely agreed to be the untrustworthy, sensationalist, incompetent institution known as the &#8220;Mainstream Media&#8221; of journalism is on the case and a well-informed citizenry is in safe hands.<b><i></i></b></p>
<p><b><i>&#8216;I believe the royal family and the British secret agents killed the nurse. It is not the first time. Remember what happened to Diana&#8221;&#8211;</i>Twitter Crack Reporter'&#8221;</b></p>
<p>The story followed with a series of other outlandish quotes I culled from Twitter and other social media that any&#8212;I thought&#8212;any half-sensible reader would interpret for what they were&#8212;complete and utter poppycock.</p>
<p>I am still scratching my head and continue to be entirely flummoxed and more than a little concerned to have found that almost all the readers of the story&#8212;the entirety of it published below&#8212;took the story seriously as if I was writing a straight news article.</p>
<p>Every single comment I have received has been from those who agreed the Royal family was behind the death of the poor nurse, because&#8230;.well they did not say because why, actually.</p>
<p>The story, for no discernible reason, still more than a year later ranks as one of the most read stories on my blog. I received another comment today on it:</p>
<p><b><i>&#8220;Or perhaps it&#8217;s a &#8216;warning signal&#8217; that if anyone else tried to go near the Royal Family or doesn&#8217;t do their job properly, they will be grave consciences. The nurse let her guard down and so the &#8216;secret Royal guardian forces&#8217; put her down. That&#8217;s why everyone else under the watch of the Royals has to do their job properly and those wanting to cause grave harm to them have been warned. Bottom line is The Royal Family has to be viewed as powerful and influential people. Its up to these &#8216;secret guardian forces&#8217; of theirs to make sure that these &#8216;views&#8217; are always in place. I will never believe this B.S. even Diana&#8217;s car crash death.&#8221;</i></b></p>
<p>Other comments responding to the story include:</p>
<p><b><i>&#8220;How many years your country&#8217;s king and queen will kill people to save their dirty secrets. &#8221; who is william &#8216;s baby real mom ?&#8221; was it that secert royal family wants to save from england people then they kill the nurse ? You don&#8217;t think it is time to kick ass to kings &#8230;. England people have a deep sleep . I am yelling &#8220;wake up England. WAKE UP ENGLAND, IT IS SO Late.&#8221;</i></b></p>
<p>Then there was Holly:</p>
<p><b><i>&#8220;First of all, it wasn&#8217;t two MALE disc jockeys, one was a female. Secondly, it&#8217;s not the QUEEN MUM, she&#8217;s been dead since 2002. This writer should get the facts straight. Bloody British Royal Family or not, this is a super-convenient distraction for them from the Jimmy Savile affair, focusing on this &#8220;royal&#8221; pregnancy will go on and on and on for another 7 months, then there will be watching the little devil, I mean darling, grow up. I&#8217;m sick of all this already.&#8221;</i></b></p>
<p>I responded to Holly with the following:</p>
<p><b><i>Holly: </i></b></p>
<p><b><i>My apologies on not realizing your Queen Mum was dead. Really, I had lost track of keeping current on the family health issues since my people expelled your people a couple centuries back. </i></b></p>
<p><b><i>However, occasionally I do admit to spurts of entertainment with Fergie and Di and Camilla (sp?) and Chuck and Randy Andy and Philip et al. But I do agree, it does get tiresome rather quickly. </i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Why is it they are useful for you people to keep them on the payroll again? </i></b></p>
<p><b><i>And who is the &#8220;them&#8221; you refer to? </i></b></p>
<p><b><i>And if I could politely offer one small correction: Isn&#8217;t it &#8220;Sir&#8221; Jimmy Savile? </i></b></p>
<p><b><i>The public sexual shenanigans of your people really are a bit hard to keep up with nearly as much as the state of health of your Mum&#8217;s and Princesses and Duchesses et al etc and so on&#8230;. </i></b></p>
<p><b><i>And since you mention being &#8220;sick of it all&#8221;, I might suggest you alert your health care providers about your preferences for incoming well wishers, as there appears to be some confusion on that front as well. </i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Good luck with it all. </i></b></p>
<p><b><i>I don&#8217;t envy you.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Nate</i></b></p>
<p>Here is the rest of the story, unredacted, including actual Twitter comments followed by other people who wrote to my blog responding to the article. Not a single one acknowledged the story to be a spoof:</p>
<p>&#8220;The Royal Plot behind the Secret Conspiracy to Murder the Morning Sickness Nurse appears to be unlikely to mislead the news hound sleuths from the most respected global Twitter news operations:<b><i></i></b></p>
<p><b><i>&#8220;If u think the prank callers are at fault, then YOU are what&#8217;s wrong with this world. It&#8217;s obviously the Mafia Royal Family. They have done this before many times to avoid shame.&#8221;</i></b></p>
<p>But while the dominant theme trending by the new vanguard responsible for ensuring a vibrant and free press that serves the people and the principles of freedom of press&#8212;Twitter&#8212;is to blame the media for the death of the Florence Nightingale of our era, there is another strain of analysis trending on Twitter: That the demise of the deceased nurse was murdered at the hands of the Royals, a dark plot cooked up by the Royal family who murdered her to protect dark secrets which would expose the monarchy to unthinkable revelations of&#8230;well they don&#8217;t get very specific on the minor details.</p>
<p><b><i>&#8220;So royal family murders this nurse, calls it suicide and you crazy people are mad at the radio station? It was an innocent prank. At best it was semi-unprofessional and a bit lame. They do not deserve a shred of an ounce of blame for the supposed &#8220;suicide&#8221;. Nobody with common sense would utter something so ridiculous.&#8221;&#8211;</i></b>Senior World Affairs Correspondent for Twitter</p>
<p>The Twitter righteous-indignation social media SWAT teams have been deployed in full force, calling for the poor Aussie radio prankster blokes to get fired, go to jail, or what seems to be the overwhelming favorite, be executed by guillotine.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were very surprised that our call was put through,&#8221; DJ Mel said after the prank. &#8220;We thought we&#8217;d be hung up on as soon as they heard our terrible accents.&#8221;</p>
<p>The now widely agreed to be murdered nurse took seriously the Australian men imitating the voice of the&#160; British Royal Great-grandmother to be and apparently revealed secrets which surely threatened to bring down the British Empire, and took necessary measures to save its subjects from the calamity.</p>
<p>And the entertaining kerfuffle promises only to get more fun.</p>
<p>The two DJs have deleted their Twitter accounts and gone into hiding after a deluge of death threats, the radio station says it is very, very sorry and apologized for the poor attempt at humour, the Royals have all sent their condolences&#160; and the Queen Mum and Princes Charles conveyed their &#8220;sadness and concern for the nurses family&#8221;</p>
<p><b><i>&#8220;I just saw a lord, stupid Brit elites, she was suicided by the inbreeds for knowing too much, either reptile hybrid, or In vitro fertilization from a human donor, the good thing is, no harm was done the royals.&#8221;</i></b></p>
<p>But the Trojan horse attempt to redirect blame from the real perpetrators by cleverly blaming two 20 something Australian radio talk show jocks did not detract the professional media sleuths of the powerful world network of Social Media.</p>
<p><b><i>&#8220;The British Royal Family has murdered millions for shiny rocks in the past. You think they have any qualms about killing?&#8221;&#8211;Twitter Senior&#160; Investigative Correspondent</i></b></p>
<p>But to look on the bright side of these developments, I must say it is comforting to know that the nutcase conspiracy theorists running loose are not confined to those among my brethren Americans, but they appear to have taken root across the pond quite nicely.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other comments left on my blog include:</p>
<p><b><i>&#8220;Middleton is a strange woman. Now that the baby is her, she seems very awkward and unloving towards it. Like it&#8217;s not hers&#8221;</i></b> and <b><i>&#8220;If everything were really just honest with that family I doubt there would be so many bizarre rumors ?&#8221; </i></b></p>

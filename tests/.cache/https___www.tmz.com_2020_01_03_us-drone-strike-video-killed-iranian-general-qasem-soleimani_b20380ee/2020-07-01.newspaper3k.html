            <p>The U.S. drone strike ordered by <a href="https://www.tmz.com/people/donald-trump/"><strong>President Trump</strong></a> in Baghdad -- which killed top Iranian military commander, <strong>Qasem Soleimani</strong> -- is captured in new footage from an independent Iraqi television network.</p>
  <p>According to Al-Ahed channel ... the blast captured on video is the one that killed General Soleimani along with Iraqi militia commander <strong>Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis</strong>, though it's yet to be verified by other major news outlets.</p>

                        <p>A photo of the aftermath shows a burning vehicle near Baghdad International Airport shortly after the strike, which reportedly included 3 rockets hitting the site. The White House announced the strike had killed Soleimani Thursday night ... 6 people were reportedly killed in total.</p>

                                            <p>The Trump administration viewed the Iranian commander as a ruthless killer, and the President tweeted that Soleimani was responsible for the deaths of millions of people and was plotting to kill more ... but he got caught.</p>
  <p>Trump added the general should have been "taken out many years ago."</p>
  <p>Of course, many lawmakers and ordinary U.S. citizens are concerned the strike will escalate tensions in the Middle East and result in retaliatory attacks ... which Iran has already promised.</p>

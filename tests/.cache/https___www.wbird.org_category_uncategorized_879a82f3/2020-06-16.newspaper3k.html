<div><p>Under a March agreement with Major League Baseball, minor leaguers have been receiving financial assistance that is set to expire at the end of May. Baseball America reported earlier this week that the Dodgers will continue to pay their minor leaguers $400 per week past May 31, but it is unclear how long such payments would go. Even if one were to assume that the payments will continue throughout the month of June, however, it&#8217;s worth noting that $400 a week is not a substantial amount of money for players to live on, on which to support families, and on which to train and remain ready to play baseball if and when they are asked to return. &#8230; <a href="https://www.wbird.org/2020/05/report-david-price-to-pay-each-dodgers-minor-leaguer-1000-out-of-his-own-pocket/" class="more-link">[Read more...] about Report: David Price to pay each Dodgers minor leaguer $1,000 out of his own pocket</a></p></div>

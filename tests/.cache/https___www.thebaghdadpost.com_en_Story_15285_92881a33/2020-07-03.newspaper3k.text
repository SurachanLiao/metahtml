The deputy commander of Iran’s notorious Quds Force bragged at a recent ceremony that his operatives have killed more Americans than US troops have killed Iranian fighters, the Washington Times reported.

Brig. Gen. Ismail Ghaani was referring to Iran’s major intervention in the Iraq war to supply Shiite militias with supercharged explosives that could penetrate US armored vehicles. The Pentagon has estimated the Quds Force, an arm of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, killed 500 Americans that way.

“Americans have suffered more losses from us then we have suffered losses from them,” Gen. Ghaani said, according to an article by Admad Majidyar, director of the Iran Observed Project at the Middle East Institute.

Majidyar wrote that the boasting came at a ceremony honoring the “martyred of the defenders of shrines” — Iran’s term for the militias it financed and trained in Iraq to fight the ISIS and in Syria to support President Bashar Assad.

An Iranian opposition group has accused Iran of committing atrocities in Syria, particularly in the city of Aleppo, where thousands died under constant attacks by Syrian, Russian and Iranian forces.

“This, of course, is not only a confession but also outright bragging about how the Quds Force murdered Americans in Iraq,” said Michael Rubin, a Middle East analyst at the American Enterprise Institute. “It was the Quds Force, after all, that smuggled in explosively formed, armor-penetrating projectiles into Iraq for insurgents to incorporate in improved explosive devices.

Gen. Ghaani repeated Tehran propaganda that America carried out the 9/11 attacks in New York and the Pentagon, not al Qaeda.

“America, under the pretext of Sept. 11 attacks, which it carried out itself, invaded Afghanistan and mobilized young Muslims and deployed them to Afghanistan so that they can later attack Iran,” he said.

The Quds Force leader contended that the US has spent $6 trillion to curtail Iran, but failed.

The ceremony occurred amid Iranian expansion in the region, military moves financed in part by the 2015 nuclear deal with the US. The Obama administration lifted economic sanctions that freed billions of dollars in frozen assets and directly delivered $1.4 billion in cash.

Rubin writes in Commentary Magazine that the largesse prompted Tehran to increase the Quds Force budget by $300 million.

“Unilateral surrender in the name of diplomacy does tend to embolden enemies,” Rubin said.

Quds Force stands as the ruling mullahs’ expeditionary special operations force that, working with Lebanese Hezbollah, another Iran-created group, fought anti-Assad rebels in Syria.

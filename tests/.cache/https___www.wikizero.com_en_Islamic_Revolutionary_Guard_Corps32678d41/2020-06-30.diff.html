From the beginning of the new Islamic government, the Pasdaran (Pasdaran-e Enghelab-e Islami) functioned as a corps of the faithful. The Constitution of the Islamic Republic entrusted the defense of Iran's territorial integrity and political independence to <a href="Iranian_Army" class="mw-redirect" title="Iranian Army">the regular military <ins>(artesh)</ins> <del>(<i>artesh</i>)</del> </a>, while it gave the Pasdaran the responsibility of preserving the Revolution itself. </p><p>Days after Ayatollah <a href="Ruhollah_Khomeini%27s_return" class="mw-redirect" title="Ruhollah Khomeini's return">Ruhollah Khomeini's return</a> to <a href="Tehran" title="Tehran">Tehran</a> on 1 February 1979, <a href="Mehdi_Bazargan" title="Mehdi Bazargan">Mehdi Bazargan</a>'s interim administration established the Pasdaran under a decree issued by <a href="Khomeini" class="mw-redirect" title="Khomeini">Khomeini</a> on 5 May. The Pasdaran was intended to protect the Revolution and to assist the ruling clerics in the day-to-day enforcement of the new government's Islamic codes and morality. There were other, perhaps more important, reasons for establishing the Pasdaran. The Revolution needed to rely on a force of its own rather than borrowing the previous regime's tainted units. As one of the first revolutionary institutions, the Pasdaran helped legitimize the Revolution and gave the new government an armed basis of support. Moreover, the establishment of the Pasdaran served notice to both the population and the regular armed forces that the Khomeini government was quickly developing its own enforcement body. Thus, the Pasdaran, along with its political counterpart, Crusade for Reconstruction, brought a new order to Iran. In time, the Pasdaran would rival the police and the judiciary in terms of its functions. It would even challenge the performance of the regular armed forces on the battlefield. </p> <p class="thumbcaption"><ins>IRGC's Naval special forces, <a href="S.N.S.F." class="mw-redirect" title="S.N.S.F.">S.N.S.F. Link: S.N.S.F. </a></ins></p> <p>Although the IRGC operated independently of the regular armed forces, it was often considered to be a military force in its own right due to its important role in Iranian defense. The IRGC consists of ground, naval, and aviation troops, which parallel the structure of the regular military. Unique to the Pasdaran, however, has been control of Iran's strategic missile and rocket forces. </p><p>Also contained under the umbrella of the more conventional Pasdaran, were the Basij Forces (Mobilization Resistance Force), a network of potentially up to a million active individuals who could be called upon in times of need. The Basij could be committed to assist in the defense of the country against internal or external threats, but by 2008 had also been deployed in mobilizing voters in elections and alleged tampering during such activities.

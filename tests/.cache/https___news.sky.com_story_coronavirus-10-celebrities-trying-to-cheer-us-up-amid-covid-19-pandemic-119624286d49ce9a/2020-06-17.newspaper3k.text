New York is the US state that has so far been worst hit by the coronavirus pandemic.

DeVito, who is 75, said: "I'm asking you from the bottom of my heart, all over the state of New York, stay home.

"I mean everybody. I mean, we got this virus, this pandemic and, you know, young people can get it and they can transmit it to old people and the next thing you know-I'm out of there.

"So, Governor Cuomo asked me to ask you. Please, do us a favour, all of us, and stay home, not spread this virus around. Thank you! Watch a little TV, why don't ya!"

Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller also gave Governor Cuomo their full support from the comfort of their front rooms.

De Niro, who is 76, finishes his appeal with the menacing warning he gives his son-in-law in the irreverent comedy Meet The Fockers: "I'm watching you", while gesturing his two fingers at his eyes and the camera.

While Stiller, 54, pulls out a chainsaw and sets about spending some of his alone time making a wood sculpture in his living room.

Madonna

The queen of pop decided to share her thoughts on COVID-19 while naked in a bath full of petals.

Speaking from her candle-lit tub, with piano music playing in the background, Madge explains: "That's the thing about COVID-19, it doesn't care about how rich you are, how famous you are, how funny you are, how smart you are, where you live, how old you are, what amazing stories you can tell.

"It's the great equaliser and what's terrible about it is what's great about it.

"What's terrible about it is that it's made us all equal in many ways, and what's wonderful about is, is that it's made us all equal in many ways."

The 61-year-old concludes by referencing one of her tracks from 1995, which she has recently been performing on her now-cancelled Madame X tour: "Like I used to say at the end of Human Nature every night, if the ship goes down, we're all going down together."

She also posted a picture with some strategically placed petals, and the message: "No-Discrimination- Covid-19!!"

Kevin Bacon

The Hollywood star used his infamous "Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon" fame - which is based on the six degrees of separation concept - to encourage fans to stay home and avoid groups and gatherings.

He starts his video: "Hi folks, you know me right? I'm technically only six degrees away from you."

The Footloose star goes on: "Right now, like people around the world, I'm staying home, because it saves lives and is the only way we're going to slow down the spread of this coronavirus."

The 61-year-old actor then holds up a pig-shaped blackboard with the hashtag #IStayHomeFor, explaining he was staying in for his wife Kyra Sedgwick, and asking fans to share the name of the special person they want to protect.

Kicking off the media campaign, he asked people to tag six friends in their post, writing: "The more folks involved, the merrier - We're all connected by various degrees (Trust me, I know!) I'm kicking it off with @jimmyfallon @eltonjohn @Brandicarlile @kevinhart4real @ddlovato @davidbeckham - but I encourage YOU ALL to join in too!

"Let's use this 6 Degree thing to do some good!"

Liam Gallagher

The ex-Oasis star has been quick to turn some of the band's biggest hits into public service announcements.

The 47-year-old posted the black and white videos, which were filmed in his kitchen, on his Twitter page.

In typically sweary style, he gave fans Champagne Soap, Soap-ersonic and Wonder-wash.

Somewhat bafflingly, he also posted a short video wearing a colander on his head while singing his version of the 80s advertising slogan: "For mash get Smash".

As you were Liam…

Neil Diamond

The American singer-songwriter has re-written his 1969 hit Sweet Caroline to reflect the coronavirus pandemic.

Sitting in his living room with his golden retriever and guitar, the 79-year-old told his 55,000 followers: "I know we're going through a rough time right now, but I love ya, and I think maybe if we sing together, we'll feel just a little bit better."

In his updated lyrics, Diamond sings: "Hands, washing hands, reaching out, don't touch me, I won't touch you."

The 79-year-old, who was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 2018, originally wrote the song about his wife Marsha.

In a message with his video he wrote: "Stay safe out there!"

Jane Godley

The Glaswegian comedian used a clip of Nicola Sturgeon giving advice to the public on how to deal with COVID-19 to add a little levity to the subject.

Using footage from the Scottish first minister's daily coronavirus briefing, Godley added her own cheeky voiceover to the official government messages.

In the new soundtrack to the speech given at Edinburgh's St Andrew's House, a stalwart Sturgeon warns: "I don't want to see any of you out there, I run my toe up the crack of yer a**".

Godley is known for taking footage of important government broadcasts and putting her own humorous twist on them.

The clip caught the attention of Sturgeon, who shared the clip, writing: "I would *never* use language like this, obvs - but we could all do with a smile just now.

"And if humour helps get the message across."

Stuart Pyke

Sky darts and occasional rugby commentator Stuart Pyke has decided to entertain fans with daily updates on his home estate.

Pyke, who calls himself "a grumpy old man", is giving commentaries on things he spots in his street to keep his skills sharp.

Peeping out of an upper floor window, Pyke chats about dog walkers, white and silver vans "speeding past", builders and the video highlight - a man and a pram.

Pyke wrote: "Trying to keep in tune and + smiling! Daily updates from The Pastures from a man with a mic!"

Katy Brand

Comedian Katy Brand stepped away from her trademark laughs to offer some serious advice for those struggling with social distancing.

Some tips if you are feeling some darkness creeping into you: 1) everyone up, showered and dressed by 9am on weekdays, 2) tidy up and do the dishes before bed - force yourself, 3) change bedding once a week, 4) open all the windows for 10 minutes every morning and evening.

Brand had been performing in the West End before the musical she was working on - Everybody's Talking About Jamie - was cancelled due to coronavirus.

She wrote: "Some tips if you are feeling some darkness creeping into you: 1) everyone up, showered and dressed by 9am on weekdays, 2) tidy up and do the dishes before bed - force yourself.

"3) change bedding once a week, 4) open all the windows for 10 minutes every morning and evening. X"

Brand also said the approach of spring was cheering her up, adding "Watching nature come back to life through the window is a comfort."

community during the global crisis</p> <p>All across the country, people are stayinginside as much as possible — and as a result,small businesses are seriously suffering.To counteract the negative effects that thehealth crisis has had on the economy, PresidentTrump recently signed the CARES Act into law.which allocated $376 billion to Americanworkers and small business owners.However, for many entrepreneurs — notably,minority business owners who don’t speakfluent English — the process of actuallygetting that money has proven difficult.“I can read things online, but think about forall the business owners — think about all theones you know — who do not have strongEnglish as a second language,” nail salonowner Tuan Ngo explained to ABC News.On top of economic issues, minority groups arealso disproportionately affected by the crisis.As reported by KRON4, a report from MijenteSupport Committee found that Latinx individualsare dying at higher rates from coronavirusdue to lack of healthcare access.The good news?</p> <p>In addition to practicingsocial distancing so things can returnto normal as soon as possible.you can also shop locally and supportorganizations that are working to keepthe economy — and specifically, minority-owned small businesses — afloat.HERE ARE SOME ORGANIZATIONS AND FUNDS THATARE DEVOTING THEIR TIME AND MONEY SPECIFICALLYTOWARDS LATINX-OWNED BUSINESSES AND EFFORTS.The Street Vendor Emergency Fund aims“to provide direct cash assistance to LA streetvendors,” many of whom are Latinx immigrants.Through the emergency fund, theorganization will be able to providestreet vendors with $400 each topay their rent, buy groceriesand provide for their families.The Migrant Kitchen is a social impactcatering company with the sole mission ofhighlighting international cuisines and employingthe immigrants whose backgrounds inspire it.During the health crisis, the organizationis providing free meals to impacted familiesand healthcare workers on the front line.The COVID-19 Humanitarian Migrant Fundwas set up to help migrant families impactedby Migrant Protection Protocols.All of the money raised will be donatedto Al Otro Lado and other organizationsworking to help immigrant refugeesuntil the borders reopen.If you can’t donate directly,buying from Latinx restaurantsand shopping at Latinx-ownedsmall businesses goes a long way.Every dollar spent will benefit thecompany, and you’ll get something in return:either a delicious meal or essential goods</p> </td></tr> </table> <table name="SocialSharing" id="ID13000294"><tr><td>0

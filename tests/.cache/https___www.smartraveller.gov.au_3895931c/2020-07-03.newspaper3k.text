When you arrive in Australia from overseas, you must complete 14 days of mandatory quarantine in designated facilities in the city you arrive in. You won’t be allowed to travel domestically (including to your home) until you’ve completed the 14-day mandatory quarantine. If you’re not an Australia citizen or resident, you cannot enter Australia at this time. Find out more about these entry restrictions from the Department of Home Affairs.

However, he should not penetrate; sodomising the child is OK. If the man penetrates and damages the child then he should be responsible for her subsistence all her life. This girl, however, does not count as one of his four permanent wives. The man will not be eligible to marry the girl's sister.</ins></p><p><ins>Ayatollah Khomeini</ins></p><p><ins>It is better for a girl to marry in such a time when she would begin menstruation at her husband's house rather than her father's home. Any father marrying his daughter so young will have a permanent place in heaven.</ins></p><p><ins>Ayatollah Khomeini</ins></p><p><ins>A man can have sex with animals such as sheeps, cows, camels and so on. However, he should kill the animal after he has his orgasm.

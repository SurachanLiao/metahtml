AHPRA should provide waivers in the event of hardship to provide some relief to that important workforce," Associate Professor Dabars said.</p> <blockquote class="OsWT8"><p class="_1SzQc"><del>"In the event that the COVID crisis increases in Australia we are going to need to call on their resources and expertise in a very rapid way, so we need to look after them now."</del></p></blockquote> <p class="_1SzQc">However, she said there was work that casual nurses could and should already be doing in hospitals to prepare for the peak of the pandemic.</p><p class="_1SzQc">"Bringing casual workers onboard now would enable some of that pre-planning, that preparation to occur and, in the event the situation worsens, to enable the important relief so people are not as fatigued as in other countries," Associate Professor Dabars said.</p><p class="_1SzQc">"They can be relieving permanent staff to allow permanent staff to upskill, they can and should be engaged in orientation and they should be engaged in scenarios and pre-planning to deal with the crisis."</p><p class="_1SzQc">More than 40,000 doctors, nurses, midwives and pharmacists who have recently retired or left the industry have been placed on the pandemic register so they can quickly return to work if required.</p><p class="_1SzQc">Anyone placed on that register is not required to pay AHPRA registration fees for the year.</p><p class="_1SzQc">Ms Wardle said she wanted similar support offered to casual nurses out of work.</p><p class="_1SzQc">"They've got 1,500 nurses who are there at the ready to help," she said.</p><p class="_1SzQc">"Why can't they use those nurses and put them into the system before taking those people out of retirement?"</p><p class="_1SzQc">An AHPRA spokesperson said registration fees from nurses were crucial for ongoing work, but said the agency was modifying its "regulatory approach to support health practitioners in these exceptional circumstances".</p><p class="_1SzQc">"Registration fees go directly to regulating for safety in each health profession and keeping the public and practitioners safe," the spokesperson said.</p><p class="_1SzQc">"Our regulatory work is entirely funded by registrant fees and we receive no government funding for this work."</p><p class="_1SzQc">However, AHPRA said the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia (NMBA) has announced that "a payment plan will be available for nurses and midwives experiencing genuine financial hardship due to COVID-19".</p> <p class=""><ins><span>Posted   </span><span>15

India was recently battered by a super typhoon, is currently suffering torrential rain and flooding and heatwaves as well as battling a surge in Covid-19 cases and at least five states are being overrun by massive locust swarms since the beginning of May and showing no signs of slowing down.</p><p>
New footage shows a massive swarm of locusts invading the Indian city of Gurugram, located just southwest of New Delhi. The cloud of insects is a rare sight in the city &#8211; a posh financial and technology hub.
The locusts descended upon the streets of Gurugram on Saturday, flying in a large, cloud-like mass and resting upon anything they pleased. The invasion was anticipated, and the local authorities urged residents to close their doors and windows beforehand.</p><p>

Desert Locust situation update</p><p>
More swarms form and appear in Ethiopia

During the past week, an increased number of immature swarms were reported in eastern Ethiopia between El Kere and Jijiga, most likely arising from local breeding as hopper bands persist in many areas. This may have also been supplemented by some swarms arriving from northern Kenya. Swarms are also present in the northern Rift Valley and an increasing number of hopper bands have been found in the highlands of Amhara and Tigray.</p><p>
Africa</p><p>
SOMALIA. Hopper bands and an increasing number of swarms are present in the northwest between Boroma and Hargeisa and in central areas near Galkayo.</p><p>
KENYA. More swarms continued to form and were seen flying in the northwest.

Although control operations continue, a general northerly movement of swarms will occur in the three countries. Some of the swarms in northwest Kenya are expected to transit through South Sudan to reach the summer breeding areas of Sudan where some rains have already fallen. If these rains are not enough, there is a risk that swarms could continue to eastern Chad and spread westwards across the northern Sahel of West Africa. Swarms that accumulate in northern Somalia are likely to migrate across the Indian Ocean to the summer breeding areas along the Indo-Pakistan border.</p><p>
Arabia</p><p>
YEMEN. More immature and mature swarms were reported during this past week in the interior between Marib and Hadhramaut. As control operations are not possible, farmers were resorting to digging trenches to bury locusts. Some swarms are likely to reinvade northern Somalia and northeast Ethiopia.</p><p>
SAUDI ARABIA. A few immature swarms have been seen in the southwest and hopper bands are present near Najran. Control operations are underway.

In Southwest Asia, spring-bred swarms are present along both sides of the Indo-Pakistan border where they are awaiting the onset of the monsoon rains that will start in the coming days and allow the swarms to mature and lay eggs. Control operations continue.</p><p>
Asia</p><p>
PAKISTAN. Some swarms have already started laying eggs in Nagaparkar of southeast Sindh near the Indian border while swarms are present in the Indus Valley and are starting to form from hopper bands in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.</p><p>
INDIA. Swarms and adult groups are mainly present in Rajasthan west of Jaipur but some infestations continue to be reported in parts of Madhya Pradesh and Utter Pradesh. At least one small group of immature adults moved north in Utter Pradesh on the 27th during strong winds, reaching northern districts of Kushinagar and Sidharth Nagar where they split up and a few crossed the border to the central lowlands of Nepal near Butwal. These are likely to disperse without causing much harm.</p><p>
Middle East</p><p>
IRAN. Locust infestations declined further in the south. Only adult groups remain along the Pakistan border in the interior of Sistan-Baluchistan and hopper groups are present in South Khorasan. Control operations continue.

Sudan, Ethiopia, South Sudan, Somalia, Pakistan, and India should remain on high alert during the next four weeks. West Africa should continue to take anticipatory measures and preparatory steps.&#160;<a href="http://www.fao.org/ag/locusts/en/info/info/index.html">FAO</a></p><p>
South America</p><p>
<span>'Astonishing' huge swarm of locusts are sweeping through farmland and ruining crops in South America making it the third continent this year to&#160;succumb to locust plagues.&#160;Short-horned locusts, &#160;capable of devouring the same amount of crops as 2,500 people would each day are thought to have arrived from neighbouring Paraguay recently.</span></p><p>
<span>Argentine food safety body SENASA said swarms, which initially entered Argentina from Paraguay in late May, contained about 40 million insects. It is in the province of Corrientes, near borders with Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay. Argentina and Brazil are among the world&#8217;s largest soy and corn exporters. &#8220;We are following the movement of the plague,&#8221; H&#233;ctor Medina, a coordinator at SENASA, told Reuters on Thursday. Due to the arrival of a cold-weather front from the south, the movement of the locusts would be limited in the coming days, he added. The low temperatures &#8220;will prevent them from moving and reproducing. The lethargy makes them stay still,&#8221; Medina said. Winds could eventually push the cloud of locusts into a neighbouring country, he added.&#160;</span></p><p>

<a href="http://www.thebigwobble.org/2020/06/a-letter-from-leeds-tale-of-two-viruses.html">A letter from Leeds: The tale of two viruses "The Beautiful Game," which is itself a virus and started in the steel city of Sheffield back in 1855 and went on to infect the whole world is now in danger of being killed by another virus</a>
</h3>

The beautiful game, the real atmosphere often called the twelfth man at Leeds United on a normal Saturday afternoon</p><p>
Gary Walton</p><p>
On Saturday I watched my favourite football team Leeds United beat promotion rivals Fulham three-nil and boosting their efforts to reach the Premier League next season. I have supported Leeds United since I was a young kid and stayed loyal to my team through the few ups and the many downs but I have never witnessed a game like the one I watched this weekend. Let me explain, due to lockdown rules the 40,000 capacity stadium was empty but--It wasn't, human supporters had been replaced by life-size supporters made from cardboard giving the stands a surreal impressionistic, Vincent Van Gough feel, about the whole thing, see below.</p><p>
 
Roared on by a silent, motionless cardboard cut-out crowd, the sterile flatness of a stadium in lockdown. Credit Leeds United.</p><p>
Now, as you well know, cardboard cannot move, talk, shout, scream or chant, so to create an atmosphere, Leeds United taped crowd audio through the stadium's speaker system creating a plastic-type atmosphere. The chanting and the OOH'S and AAH'S of near misses&#160;and the&#160;YESSS! when a goal was scored often came a little later than the action. The whole game had a bizarre feel about it and even though my team won and will probably be in the Premier League next season the whole experience left me a little sad.</p><p>

Football, as we know it today, is a virus which began infecting people in a city called Sheffield in 1855. Sheffield is about 30 miles, (50km) South of Leeds in South Yorkshire. This virus called football then went on to infect Nottingham, Preston, Blackburn, Accrington, the rest of England, Scotland and Wales, Europe and then the whole world and is now known as "the beautiful game," so romantic. Watched by billions of people worldwide football, is itself now in danger of being killed by another virus, Covid-19, so you can understand my sadness if Leeds do win promotion to the Premier League, will there even be the next season, I ask myself? Or will the beautiful game be watched by thousands of cardboard supporters united in silence and taped crowd noise blasted through speakers? Hmmm, not such a beautiful prospect for the world's beautiful game.</p><p>
Below a short glimpse of the unique and incredible atmosphere at a Leeds United game, an atmosphere which will make the hair on your neck stand up but sadly is in danger of being lost forever.</p><p>

<a href="http://www.thebigwobble.org/2020/06/nasa-grab-decabe-of-sun-watching-into.html">NASA grab a decabe of sun watching into an hour on video: NASA&#8217;s Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)  has gathered 425 million high-resolution images of the Sun, amassing 20 million gigabytes of data over the past 10 years.</a>

<span><span class="style-scope yt-formatted-string" dir="auto">As of June 2020, NASA&#8217;s Solar Dynamics Observatory &#8212; SDO &#8212; has now been watching the Sun non-stop for over a full decade. From its orbit in space around the Earth, SDO has gathered 425 million high-resolution images of the Sun, amassing 20 million gigabytes of data over the past 10 years. This information has enabled countless new discoveries about the workings of our closest star and how it influences the solar system. 

With a triad of instruments, SDO captures an image of the Sun every 0.75 seconds. The Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) instrument alone captures images every 12 seconds at 10 different wavelengths of light. This 10-year time-lapse showcases photos taken at a wavelength of 17.1 nanometers, which is an extreme ultraviolet wavelength that shows the Sun&#8217;s outermost atmospheric layer &#8212; the corona. Compiling one photo every hour, the movie condenses a decade of the Sun into 61 minutes. The video shows the rise and fall in an activity that occurs as part of the Sun&#8217;s 11-year solar cycle and notable events, like transiting planets and eruptions. The custom music, titled &#8220;Solar Observer,&#8221; was composed by musician Lars Leonhard (</span><a class="yt-simple-endpoint style-scope yt-formatted-string" dir="auto" href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lars-leonhard.de%2F&amp;event=video_description&amp;v=l3QQQu7QLoM&amp;redir_token=GiSCth4ZmKNLZip1jSbVzrUgF258MTU5MzQzNzM0M0AxNTkzMzUwOTQz" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.lars-leonhard.de/</a><span class="style-scope yt-formatted-string" dir="auto">).

While SDO has kept an unblinking eye pointed towards the Sun, there have been a few moments it missed. The dark frames in the video are caused by Earth or the Moon eclipsing SDO as they pass between the spacecraft and the Sun. A longer blackout in 2016 was caused by a temporary issue with the AIA instrument that was successfully resolved after a week. The images where the Sun is off-centre were observed when SDO was calibrating its instruments. 

SDO and other NASA missions will continue to watch our Sun in the years to come, providing further insights about our place in space and information to keep our astronauts and assets safe.

&#8220;Now learn this illustration from the fig tree: Just as soon as its young branch grows tender and sprouts its leaves, you know that summer is near. Photo Credit NAC.Today.</p><p>
The first six months of the most important decade in the history of mankind is coming to a close and it has been six months which have literally shocked the world. A global pandemic which has cost the lives of 500,000 people, (conservative guess), with another 10 million infected. Worse still, some 1.6 billion people employed in the informal economy &#8211; or nearly half the global workforce - could see their livelihoods destroyed due to the continued decline in working hours brought on by lockdowns to curb the spread of COVID-19, according to the International Labour Organization (ILO).</p><p>
The first six months of the most important decade in the history of mankind also opened a pressure cooker of global social-justice movements, which have surged onto the streets of major cities worldwide, spreading hate, violence and destruction against governments, leaders, authority and even our perceived history, anger has become the new normal.</p><p>
The first six months of the most important decade in the history of mankind has abruptly ended a bullish market before stocks rallied in dramatic fashion but in reality, they are held up by a nervous uncertainty which will eventually bring the whole thing crashing down and will see the world enter another great depression.</p><p>
The first six months of the most important decade in the history of mankind has seen a rise in nuclear-armed countries, sabre-rattling, masking their fear with macho posturing, gung-ho rhetoric, in a flag-waving nationalistic way, aggressively insulting one another which can only lead to one outcome, WWIII. If only they realised they were being played by dark satanic forces, pulled and pushed like puppets in a theatre of hate.</p><p>
The first six months of the most important decade in the history of mankind has seen Western society regress toward pre-technological tribalism. Our preconceived Hollywood perception of ourselves has seen a return of wild west values, London, often considered one of the safest capitals of the world has become a hotbed of hate and violence with a surge in murders and has a new title, "the wild west". In Chicago, murders increased by about 60% and shooting victims rose by 71% last month, according to police statistics. The crime rate in Paris has seen a 70% rise, rival Muslim gangs recently took to the streets of Dijon using automatic weapons against each other while frightened residents cowered behind closed doors. New York is the same story. There have been 38 murders over the last 28 days, twice as much as the same period last year, according to NYPD. So far this year, there have been 159 murders, which is 25% higher than last year.</p><p>
The first six months of the most important decade in the history of mankind has seen massive locusts swarms of Biblical proportion on 3 continents. South America, Africa and Asia are all struggling to contain the locusts egregious demand for food in some of the worlds poorest countries. So far this year&#160;<span>450 billion locusts have been killed, but devastating swarms still ravage Africa, India and the Middle East and the pests march on growing in unprecedented numbers.&#160;</span></p><p>
The first six months of the most important decade in the history of mankind has seen a massive surge in the deaths of pigs due to African Swine Fever.<span>&#160;Long before the Covid-19 Pandemic had infected almost 10, million people and killed almost 500,000 another devastating disease broke out of China which has probably killed an estimated hundreds of millions of pigs around the world since 1918. The latest country to suffer is Nigeria after their worse outbreak ever, culminating in the loss of more than a million pigs, culled due to the virus. It is believed more than 40% of all farm-reared pigs have died globally from the killer virus with a 100% death rate.&#160;</span><span>Humans and Pigs have remarkably similar immune systems, can</span><span>&#160;you imagine the carnage if this virus mutates?</span></p><p>
The first six months of the most important decade in the history of mankind has seen unprecedented rainfall in many areas across the world. An absurd amount of water poured down all over the world in May. An incredible amount of rain fell on all areas suffering locust swarms from Africa to India killing hundreds and displacing more than a million people.  According to China&#8217;s Ministry of Emergency Management, as of 24 June, flood disasters that began in late May have affected 11.22 million people in 26 provincial regions, including Guangxi, Guizhou, Guangdong, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Chongqing.

A total of 571,000 people have been displaced after flooding damaged 171,000 homes and destroyed 9,300 with nearly 300 people killed.</p><p>
The first six months of the most important decade in the history of mankind saw more record-breaking extreme weather. The period from January through May was also the 2nd hottest on record after 2016. South America, Europe, Asia and the Gulf of Mexico region had their warmest Year To Date on record. The May average Arctic sea ice coverage was the fourth smallest in the 42-year record, 7.0% below the 1981&#8211;2010 average, according to an analysis by the National Snow and Ice Data Center. A rare May snowstorm triggered by a polar vortex whipped through the northeast of the US, with parts of Maine and New Hampshire receiving as much as 10 inches of snow and near white-out conditions in upstate New York.

Greece, Germany, Turkey and Russia also got their share of unseasonable snow, but Ayubia National Park in Pakistan was covered in snow for the first time in a century and Australia ended up with 40 inches of snow during the coldest start of May ever recorded. &#160;This week Reuters reported pine trees are bursting into flames. Boggy peatlands are tinderbox dry. And towns in northern Russia are sweltering under conditions more typical of the tropics. Record-breaking Arctic heat &#8211; registered at more than 100 Fahrenheit (38 Celsius) in the Siberian town of Verkhoyansk on June 20 &#8211; are still being verified by the World Meteorological Organization. But even without that confirmation, experts at the global weather agency are worried by satellite images showing that much of the Russian Arctic is in the red.  

That extreme heat is fanning the unusual extent of wildfires across the remote, boreal forest and tundra that blankets northern Russia. Those blazes have in turn ignited normally waterlogged peatlands.</p><p>
The first six months of the most important decade in the history of mankind so most catastrophic wildfires ever. The Australian bushfire in the summer of 2019/20 saw nearly 25% of the country's&#160;<span>forests consumed by fire, the normal average for a bushfire season being around 2%. More than a billion animals died in the fires with a further 60% loss of their annual crop production. As I type this post, wildfires are out control in the Arctic, Arizona, and Syberia which is a worry considering the wildfire season hasn't even started in these places yet.</span></p><p>
 
The first six months of the most important decade in the history of mankind has seen a slight decrease in major quakes, (mag 6 or higher). Or did we.&#160;<span>As we approach the halfway point of 2020, a total of 53 major quakes (mag 6 or higher) have been recorded around the world with 9 recorded in June so far, however,&#160;</span><span>our government-run agencies have a way of cooking the books. Here on TBW, I record every major quake and I can honestly say, almost every major quake is reduced in size by USGS, for instance, a mag 6.0 will be reduced to a mag 5.8, or a mag 6.1 will become a mag 5.9, so if I report a mag 6.3 or a mag 6.4 they are probably much stronger than that.</span></p><p>
 
<span>This year I have read many times of people acting like animals, this is not true and is an insult to our furry friends. Animals do not hate, they do not disrespect others and they are not destroying our planet. They are not corrupt and do not drop bombs on their neighbours. &#160;</span></p><p>
In Matthew 24, Jesus warned us of time like these:  &#8220;Look out that nobody misleads you, for many will come on the basis of my name, saying, &#8216;I am the Christ,&#8217; and will mislead many. You are going to hear of wars and reports of wars. See that you are not alarmed, for these things must take place, but the end is not yet. &#8220;For nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be food shortages and earthquakes in one place after another. All these things are a beginning of pangs of distress. &#8220;Then people will hand you over to tribulation and will kill you, and you will be hated by all the nations on account of my name. Then, too, many will be stumbled and will betray one another and will hate one another. Many false prophets will arise and mislead many; and because of the increasing of lawlessness, the love of the greater number will grow cold. But the one who has endured to the end will be saved. And this good news of the Kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations, and then the end will come.
</p><p>
He also went on to say: &#8220;Now learn this illustration from the fig tree: Just as soon as its young branch grows tender and sprouts its leaves, you know that summer is near.
</p><p>
Stay safe out there wonderful people.</p><p>

<a href="http://www.thebigwobble.org/2020/06/yesterday-almost-200000-new-cases-of.html">Yesterday, almost 200,000 new cases of Covid-19 globally: 10 million cases and a half a million people dead. CV found in Europe in March 2019? The US yesterday recorded its third-day running of new cases with more than 45,000 new cases</a>

</p><p>
US infectious disease chief Dr Anthony Fauci says the nation has a "serious problem" as 16 states reel from a spike in Covid-19 cases.
At the first White House task force briefing in two months, Dr Fauci said: "The only way we're going to end it is by ending it together."</p><p>
World</p><p>
 
The serious problem is enormous. Yesterday, almost another 200,000 new cases of Covid-19 were recorded bringing the grand total to just short of 10 million cases and a half a million people dead globally.</p><p>
US</p><p>
 
The US yesterday recorded its third-day running of new cases with more than 45,000 new cases, beating the old record recorded the day before when 40,000 new cases were revealed. Total deaths in the US from the virus is at 125,000 thousand from nearly 2,467,837 cases, more than any other country. In Texas, Florida and Arizona, reopening plans have been paused due to a surge in cases. &#160;Health officials in the US estimate the true number of cases is likely to be 10 times higher than the reported figure.</p><p>
Around the world</p><p>
Brazil's unrelenting surge continues with 47,000 new cases reported there yesterday bringing the total number of cases to 1,274,974 with 56,000 of them dying. India had its record number of cases yesterday topping almost 20,000. In Europe, France had a spike yesterday just days after an easing of lockdowns. Turkey appears to be heading for a second wave too after the virus appeared to be dwindling there in early June.</p><p>
Good News just around the corner?</p><p>
 
With the official global death rate now at 500,000, many experts believe that the real number of deaths could be anything from 150,000 to 200,000 higher than the official number. However yesterday, the BBC claimed although there is a worldwide surge in new cases, the number of people dying from the disease is actually dropping, for instance, deaths in the UK from the virus is down to 1.5% suggesting Covid-19 is losing it virality.</p><p>
Was COVID-19 in Europe a year ago already?</p><p>

Researchers at the University of Barcelona have detected the presence of the Covid-19 virus in samples of Barcelona's sewage, collected as far back as March 12, 2019, almost a year before the virus broke out in Europe. These results, which were sent to a high-impact journal and published in the medRxiv repository, would indicate that the infection was present long before any case of COVID-19 was recorded in the world.&#160;<a href="https://www.ub.edu/web/ub/es/menu_eines/noticies/2020/06/042.html">Full story</a></p><p>

<a href="http://www.thebigwobble.org/2020/06/the-godzilla-dust-cloud-3500-mile-long.html">The 3,500-mile-long, (5,600 km) cloud, dubbed the &#8220;Godzilla dust cloud,&#8221; travelled 5,000 miles (8,047 km) and has now arrived in the southern US where COVID-19 cases has recently spiked causing concern among doctors. </a>
</h3>

 


<p>
On June 23, 2020, the GOES-East satellite viewed the Saharan Air Layer (or SAL) over Cuba, while a storm erupted through its dusty haze. During this time of year, the SAL often blows westward from Africa&#8217;s Saharan Desert and can travel thousands of miles away. The SAL&#8217;s activity usually results in reduced severity--- or in some cases entirely inhibits the formation of---Atlantic tropical storms and hurricanes.</p><p>
'The Godzilla dust cloud' which left the Shara earlier in the month has arrived over the U.S. Southeast, raising health concerns. Forecasters are expecting a thick brown haze raising more health concerns in states where the coronavirus crisis is worsening. </p><p>
The 3,500-mile-long, (5,600 km) cloud, dubbed the &#8220;Godzilla dust cloud,&#8221; travelled 5,000 miles (8,047 km) from North Africa before reaching the region stretching from Florida west into Texas and north into North Carolina through Arkansas, the National Weather Service (NWS) said.

&#8220;It&#8217;s a really dry layer of air that contains very fine dust particulates. It occurs every summer,&#8221; said NWS meteorologist Patrick Blood. &#8220;Some of these plumes contain more particles, and right now we expecting a very large plume of dust in the Gulf Coast.&#8221;
This year, the dust is the densest it has been in a half a century, several meteorologists told Reuters earlier this week as it crossed over the Caribbean.</p><p>
The Saharan dust plume will hang over the region until the middle of next week, deteriorating the air quality in Texas, Florida and other states where the number of COVID-19 cases has recently spiked.

&#8220;There&#8217;s emerging evidence of potential interactions between air pollution and the risk of COVID, so at this stage, we are concerned,&#8221; said Gregory Wellenius, a professor of environmental health at Boston University&#8217;s School of Public Health.


Air pollution can be especially detrimental for people who are at risk for or suffer from cardiovascular and respiratory illnesses, Wellenius added. Heart and lung problems heighten the risk of severe COVID-19.</p><p>

Seismic signs and wonders</p><p>
A magnitude 6.4 earthquake has struck China just 30km from its Indian border just 10 days after&#160;70 Chinese and Indian soldiers were killed in a fistfight which&#160;could have sparked a nuclear war engulfing the world</p><p>
<span>The fistfight erupted ten days ago on a narrow Himalayan ridge border area between Indian and Chinese soldiers which ended in the deaths of 50 Chinese and 20 Indian soldiers. The two countries have blamed each other for the conflict of course.&#160;<a href="https://www.thebigwobble.org/search?q=China+India+border">TBW</a></span></p><p>
 
<p>
<span><span>Yesterday's major quake (mag 6 or higher) is the second major quake to hit the world since June the 23rd, however, &#160;our government-run agencies have a way of cooking the books, the last week has been a week with very much seismic action.&#160;</span></span><span>An earthquake of magnitude 6.1 struck 23 km (14.29 miles) west-northwest of Cartago in California on yesterday, however, the U.S. Geological Survey has since reduced the quake to a magnitude 5.8. &#160;The quake was at a depth of 9 km, it added. the area received 170, small to medium aftershocks according to USGS.</span></p>
</p><p>
<span>A magnitude 6.0 earthquake, reduced to a 5.9 by USGS, rattled Milford Sound, in the tourist hotspot of Fiordland in New Zealand&#8217;s South Island on Thursday, government seismic monitor Geonet said. Thousands of people in the area registered as having felt the earthquake, which was very shallow at a depth of 5km (3 miles), but there were no immediate reports of damage or injuries. On Monday a magnitude 6 earthquake rattled Iceland.</span></p><p>
 
<p>
<span>A mag 6.1, yes you guessed, reduced to a 5.9 by USGS hit the east coast of Japan, a mag 5.9 rocked Guam in the South Pacific and a mag 5.9 hit the Indonesian area, &#160;</span></p><p>
<p>
<span>As we approach the halfway point of 2020, a total of 53 major quakes (mag 6 or higher) have been recorded around the world with 9 recorded in June so far, USGS is keeping things tight.</span></p>
 
<p>
<span><span>All the above quakes happened on or around the 23rd of June which could be very significant because, on that day, a global magnetic anomaly was recorded here on earth. A&#160;</span></span>phenomenon known as a "pulsation continuous" or "Pc" for short was recorded by astronomers around the world. Pc waves are essential flutters propagating down the flanks of Earth's magnetosphere excited by the breath of the sun. During more active phases of the solar cycle, these flutters are easily lost in the noise of rambunctious geomagnetic activity. But during the extreme quiet of Solar Minimum, such waves can make themselves "heard" like a pin dropping in a silent room. In the Lofoten islands of Norway, Rob Stammes detected the anomaly on his magnetometer. "It was remarkable,&#8221; says Stammes. "Our magnetic field swung back and forth by about 1/3rd of a degree. I also detected ground currents with the same 10 minute period." It has long been known that solar energy affecting our magnetosphere causes seismic activity here on earth, maybe the "pulsation continuous" is the cause for all the above seismic activity during the same period.&#160;<a href="https://spaceweather.com/">Full Story</a></p><p>

Marching on together! South America becomes the third continent after Africa and Asia to succumb to locust plagues.&#160;</p><p>
'Astonishing' huge swarm of locusts are sweeping through farmland and ruining crops in South America making it the third continent this year to&#160;succumb to locust plagues.&#160;Short-horned locusts, &#160;capable of devouring the same amount of crops as 2,500 people would each day are thought to have arrived from neighbouring Paraguay recently. The swarms are heading toward the large metropolitan area of Sante Fe. Lanteri community president Pipo Garcia described the swarm as "astonishing" and said he has never seen anything like it. The swarms are expected to move into Brazil. A video of a swarm can be seen&#160;<a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/astonishing-huge-swarm-locusts-sweeps-22220756">here</a></p><p>
Argentine food safety body SENASA said the swarm, which initially entered Argentina from Paraguay in late May, contained about 40 million insects. It is in the province of Corrientes, near borders with Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay.

Argentina and Brazil are among the world&#8217;s largest soy and corn exporters.

&#8220;We are following the movement of the plague,&#8221; H&#233;ctor Medina, a coordinator at SENASA, told Reuters on Thursday. Due to the arrival of a cold-weather front from the south, the movement of the locusts would be limited in the coming days, he added.

The low temperatures &#8220;will prevent them from moving and reproducing. The lethargy makes them stay still,&#8221; Medina said. Winds could eventually push the cloud of locusts into a neighbouring country, he added.
</p><p>
450 billion locusts have been killed this year, but devastating swarms still ravage Africa, India and the Middle East.&#160;<a href="https://www.thebigwobble.org/">TBW</a></p><p>

Everybody was Kung Flu Fighting.</p><p>
Yesterday, the U.S. recorded its highest single-day total of new coronavirus cases with more than 45,500, breaking the previous April record by an astonishing 9,000 cases. Last Sunday, The World Health Organization reported the largest single-day increase in coronavirus cases by its count, at more than 183,000 new cases, which, is a little bit scary when our governments are telling us all to go back to work and return to restaurants and bars and even book flights to other countries. NEW coronavirus cases in California rose to almost 70 per cent in a period of just two days. Meanwhile, Florida&#8217;s new confirmed coronavirus cases skyrocketed by 5,500 Wednesday, a 25% jump from the previous one-day record set last week and triple the level of just two weeks ago. Coronavirus bodies are being stashed in BIN BAGS next to patients in hospitals as the Brazil death toll tops 50,000. A shortage of medical oxygen worldwide leaving many gasping for life is the latest worry in the CV fight.</p><p>
A week of seismic action</p><p>
An earthquake of magnitude 6.1 struck 23 km (14.29 miles) west-northwest of Cartago in California on yesterday, however, the U.S. Geological Survey has since reduced the quake to a magnitude 5.8. &#160;The quake was at a depth of 9 km, it added. the area received 170, small to medium aftershocks according to USGS.</p><p>
The death toll from a powerful earthquake that struck southern Mexico on Tuesday has risen to 10 people, authorities said on Wednesday, as locals began clearing the rubble and assessing the damage from the temblor. The area surrounding the popular Huatulco beach resort in the southern state of Oaxaca was hardest hit by the 7.5, magnitude quake, reduced to a 7.4 by USGS but the shaking could be felt as far away as Mexico City, where tall buildings swayed and thousands of people raced into the streets according to Reuters.</p><p>
A magnitude 6.0 earthquake, reduced to a 5.9 by USGS, rattled Milford Sound, in the tourist hotspot of Fiordland in New Zealand&#8217;s South Island on Thursday, government seismic monitor Geonet said.

Thousands of people in the area registered as having felt the earthquake, which was very shallow at a depth of 5km (3 miles), but there were no immediate reports of damage or injuries. On Monday a magnitude 6 earthquake rattled Iceland.</p><p>
As we approach the halfway point of 2020, a total of 52 major quakes (mag 6 or higher) have been recorded around the world with 8 recorded in June so far.</p><p>
Arctic burning</p><p>

</p><p>
The Federal Forest Agency of Russia added that during the month of June 2020, emergency managers and related personnel eliminated more than 330 forest fires in 49 different regions of Russia, spanning over more than 27 square miles. As of June 22, six more fires spanning over 81 square miles have appeared in the region of Chukotka, and 66 more in other parts of the country, bringing the total to 72 currently active fires burning across Russia.</p><p>
Moreover, the town of Verkhojansk, at a latitude of 67.55&#176; N, in the Arctic circle, reportedly hit a record high temperature of 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit on June 20.  If it is verified, it would be the hottest temperature ever recorded north of the Arctic Circle., breaking the previous record of 99.1 degrees Fahrenheit in 1988.

450 billion locusts have been killed this year, but devastating swarms still ravage Africa, India and the Middle East
</p><p>
 
Desert Locust situation update</p><p>
More swarms form in East Africa An increasing number of second-generation immature swarms continue to form in northwest Kenya. The bulk of swarm formation is likely to occur during the next two weeks followed by a decline in July. Before migration, swarms will remain for a short time during which there is a considerable threat to crops and pastures in Turkana and Marsabit counties. Thereafter, the swarms are expected to migrate northwards to the summer breeding areas in Sudan and Ethiopia where they will mature quickly and lay eggs.</p><p>
Some of the swarms will take about a week to cross South Sudan to reach South Kordofan and South Darfur while other swarms will move north to east and northern Ethiopia. Any swarms in northern Somalia can migrate across the Indian Ocean to the summer breeding areas along both sides of the Indo-Pakistan border. In Sudan, some rains have fallen so far in South Darfur and South Kordofan, and no locusts are present except for isolated adults in the Nile Valley. If the rains are not sufficient, then the invading swarms are likely to continue to eastern Chad and migrate westwards across the Sahel of West Africa. This threat should decline progressively during the next four weeks.</p><p>
In Ethiopia, control operations continue against hopper bands and new swarms that are forming in the east and northeast. Smaller operations are underway in central and northern Somalia. In Saudi Arabia, control operations are in progress against hopper bands in the southwest near Najran and adult groups in the Asir Mountains.</p><p>
In Yemen, hopper bands are present in the interior and highly mobile swarms are moving in highland and southern coastal areas. Some of these swarms are likely to migrate to northern Somalia and northeast Ethiopia.</p><p>
In Oman, adult groups and a few swarms laid eggs in the Dhofar Hills of the south. In Southwest Asia, breeding has ended in southern Iran and southwest Pakistan where locust infestations are rapidly declining as a result of control operations and migration to the summer breeding areas along the Indo-Pakistan border. Spring-bred adult groups and swarms continue to appear along the Indo-Pakistan border, many of which have continued further east into several states of northern India because the monsoon rains have not yet arrived in Rajasthan, India. These infestations are expected to return to Rajasthan with the onset of the rains to rapidly mature and lay eggs. Control operations continue in both countries. Sudan, Ethiopia, South Sudan, Pakistan, and India should remain on high alert during the next four weeks. West Africa should continue to take anticipatory measures and preparatory steps.&#160;<a href="http://www.fao.org/ag/locusts/en/info/info/index.html">FAO</a></p><p>

There are increasing fears for food security in East Africa, with mounting evidence of a new wave of desert locusts.
Earlier in the year, billions of the insects destroyed crops across the region &#8211; with the UN warning a second generation would be even more destructive.
Now, despite international efforts, those fears appear to be coming to pass.
When the first wave hit, Albert Lemasulani gave up his life to fight the swarms - leaving his family, his goats and his newborn son behind to try and prevent a plague.</p><p>
 
China Crisis</p><p>
 
China's Three Gorges dam is in danger of collapse from torrential rainfall which has killed more than 200 people and tens of millions more across 26 provinces in China have been affected by flooding along the Yangtze River.</p>

We are said to be living in "woke," times apparently. According to the Urban Dictionary:&#160;woke,&#160;is the act of being very pretentious about how much you care about a social issue. Meaning a person has passed the process of waking up. They're done with it. They've moved on.</p><p>
So we have moved on we are "woke." Like John Lennon said. "Strange days indeed."</p><p>
Nobody Told Me</p><p>
John Lennon</p><p>
Everybody's talking and no one says a word</p><p>
Everybody's making love and no one really cares</p><p>
There are Nazis in the bathroom just below the stairs</p><p>
Always something happening and nothing going on</p><p>
Nobody told me there'd be days like these</p><p>
Nobody told me there'd be days like these</p><p>
Strange days indeed</p><p>
As the great human pause continues we are indeed living in strange days, the world since Covid-19 appeared, has been turned upside down and back-to-front. As we sipped champagne on New Year's Eve, 2019 did any of us see this coming, I certainly didn't. Who would have guessed as we sang</p><p>
Auld Lang Syne that in just 6 months time almost 10 million people would be infected and nearly half a million people would be dead from a strange virus which the US claims, comes from China and China claims it comes from the US?</p><p>
Who would have guessed statues of the worlds greatest leaders would be under attack and global icons such as Sir Winston Churchill who saved the UK from Nazis Germany would be described as a racist and have his monument damaged in London by a movement called Black Lives Matter? And who would have guessed protesters would tear down a George Washington statue and set fire to its head? Strange days indeed.</p><p>
Who would have guessed riots would erupt in major cities by anarchists, hell-bent on destruction after the senseless murder of another dark-skinned American by a racist cop? And who would have guessed we would hear of calls to punish the cops but not the anarchists? Who would have guessed businesses would be closed but open to looters? Who would have guessed wealthy A-listers would raise money, not for the needy but for rioters? And who would have thought rioters would raize their own poverty-ridden areas to the ground, burning food banks and grocery stores, the very businesses who help the homeless, the needy and the poor?</p><p>
Who would have guessed we would be living among murderers, rapists and violent criminals after our governments release thousands of prisoners because jails are deemed unsafe for them due to the Covid-19? &#160; Who would have thought untold millions of jobs would be lost but not one government official job lost? And finally, who would have guessed, our beloved elderly family members would be left to die alone in nursing homes? Families not allowed to visit but allowed to fly on a crowded jet?</p><p>

<a href="http://www.thebigwobble.org/2020/06/the-great-and-enduring-plagues-and.html">The great and enduring plagues, and grievous and enduring sicknesses of 2020: Covid-19 approaches 10 million cases: The African Swine Flu outbreak, the end of pork? Avian flu killing millions of birds: The worst locust outbreak in nearly a hundred years, surely all lives matter </a>
</h3>

 


<p dir="ltr">
 
Credit, John Martin the 7th plague</p><p>
Humans and Pigs have remarkably similar immune systems. Long before the Covid-19 Pandemic had infected almost 10, million people and killed almost 500,000 another devastating disease broke out of China which has probably killed an estimated 300 million pigs around the world since 1918. The latest country to suffer is Nigeria after their worse outbreak ever culminated in the loss of almost a million pigs culled due to African Swine Fever, (ASF). It is believed more than 40% of all farm-reared pigs have died globally since 2018 from the killer virus with an almost 100% death rate. Can you imagine the carnage if this virus</p><p>
<span><span>The African Swine Flu outbreak (</span></span><span>&#8220;There just isn&#8217;t enough pork in the world to fill the gap.&#8221;)</span></p><p>
However, the African swine fever (ASF) pandemic will be even worse this year than in 2019, say, experts, warning that the spread of the highly contagious virus, which is fatal to pigs, is unrelenting.

With world attention on the human viral pandemic of Covid-19, the concern is growing that countries are not focusing enough on halting the spread of ASF through better biosecurity practices, cooperation on intensive vaccine development, or transparency regarding outbreaks.

&#8220;The ASF virus is a much &#8216;stronger&#8217; virus [than Covid-19], in that it can survive in the environment or processed meat for weeks and months,&#8221; Dirk Pfeiffer, a professor of veterinary sciences at City University in Hong Kong and a leading expert on ASF, told the Guardian.

ASF kills almost 100% of the animals it infects, and despite being in circulation for nearly 100 years, there is still no vaccine.
</p><p>
As well as China and Africa, Vietnam has also culled 1.2 million pigs since an outbreak occurred there last year.&#160;<span>Pork accounts for three-quarters of total meat consumption in Vietnam, a country of 95 million people where most of its 30 million farm-raised pigs are consumed domestically.</span></p><p>
 
<span>Avian flu which is thought to be linked to Spanish flu&#160;</span>which is thought to have killed between 100 to 500 million people around the world in 1918/20.</p><p>
<span><span><span>Avian flu is another pest</span></span></span>, known informally as avian flu or bird flu, is a variety of influenza caused by viruses adapted to birds. The type with the greatest risk is highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). Bird flu is similar to swine flu, dog flu, horse flu and human flu as an illness ... Recent influenza research into the genes of the Spanish flu confirmed that virus came from avian flu which is thought to have killed between 100 to 500 million people around the world in 1918/20. Hundreds of thousands of birds have been culled around the world already this year because of Avian flu.</p><p>
The locust plagues are destroying crops and economies of the worlds poorest nations</p><p>
<span>The worst locust outbreak in nearly a hundred years is spreading fast. The FAO announced&#160;South Sudan&#160;and&#160;</span>Botswana, the first southern African nation&#160;<span>to have been invaded by migratory locusts and in a separate, report the locust plague has reached the&#160;</span>Western borders of coronavirus-hit China<span>, the area of the plagues are vast and the list of countries now affected is enormous. A small plague was first reported on&#160;</span><a href="https://www.thebigwobble.org/2019/01/the-great-mosque-in-mecca-which-hosts.html" target="_blank">TBW</a>&#160;<span>back in Jan 2019, ironically at t</span><span>he holiest site in Islam. The locusts were filmed&#160;</span><span>swarming around the Great Mosque in Mecca. Since then the plague has stretched Eastwards from Saudi Arabia, through Iran, Afghanistan, India and Pakistan, Bangladesh and on to the Western border of China. Westwards from Saudi Arabia into Egypt and then South into the Horn Of Africa and all the way down to Botswana in the South, passing through Sudan, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia, Mozambique and Uganda. Hundreds of thousands of miles of crops have been destroyed in just 13 months. The swarms are now migrating toward Western Africa and taking away the livelihood of millions of the poorest people in the world.</span></p><p>
 
<span>It is not difficult to imagine, the next plague to hit mankind will be famine, yet another Bible passage springs to mind as I write this piece.</span> Deuteronomy 28:59. Jehovah will inflict very severe plagues on you and your offspring, great and enduring plagues, and grievous and enduring sicknesses.</p><p>

<a href="http://www.thebigwobble.org/2020/06/a-wicked-generation-having-no-natural.html"> A wicked generation: Having no natural affection, not open to any agreement, slanderers, without self-control, fierce:  How this generation will handle the terrifying consequences of 2020, which are surely coming, is truly frightening.</a>

<p dir="ltr">
 
The ugly reality of 2020, credit AFP</p><p>
2020 has been an incredibly difficult year. Western society, usually, when our backs have been up against the wall roll up their sleeves and get stuck in and solve overwhelming hardships. The WWI and WWII generations come to mind. Or the people who lived through the great depression. We are, probably, heading to another great depression and sadly, maybe WWIII. How this generation will handle the terrifying consequences of 2020, which are surely coming, is frightening.</p><p>
The greatest power in the world, the United States of America has become a bickering nest of vipers, far from becoming great again it is crippled with hatred, ugliness, viciousness and nastiness, fuelled by a political quagmire of backbiting, lying, corruption, disloyalty and cheating, the left is as bad, if not worse than the right. The country is riddled with racism, crime, inequality and poverty. A recent poll shows 7 in 10 Americans agree 2020 is the lowest point in the country&#8217;s history that they&#8217;ve witnessed. Two-thirds say that the government&#8217;s response to the coronavirus is a source of daily stress for them.&#160;<a href="https://www.studyfinds.org/land-of-the-worried-83-of-americans-very-stressed-over-nations-future/">Full Story</a>&#160;&#160;In another pole nearly 3 out of 4 DC police officers are ready to leave the force after the Black Lives Matter protests.&#160;<a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/nearly-3-out-of-4-dc-police-officers-ready-to-leave-the-force-washington-police-union-poll">Full Story</a>. More crucially, Americans are the unhappiest they have been in 50 years, according to&#160;<a href="https://time.com/5854394/americans-unhappy-poll-coronavirus/">Time</a></p><p>
Thursday's 150,000 new cases of Covid-19 were the highest so far in a single day and nearly half of them are in the Americas, yet the economy appears to be more important the human lives, as citizens, not only in America but all of the Western world, are being ushered by governments back to work and back to play yet the virus is increasing. Not only are peoples lives in danger but can you imagine what the second wave of Covid-19 do to morality, confidence and the economy?</p><p>
Our enemies can sense weakness, a soft underbelly, they are beginning to see a shift in world power, China, Russia, Iran and North Korea, the usual suspects, some would say the axes of evil are itching for a fight, they believe the time is right as tensions rise around the globe.</p><p>
The weekend is upon us once again and the major cities in America and Europe are preparing for the next round of Black Lives Matter, protests, demonstrations and full-blown riots. I ask you to please read a poignant passage from the Bible which so accurately describes our generation today and will maybe, give you an insight how this generation would have handled WWI and WWII or the people who lived through the great depression. </p><p>
The second of Timothy 3:1-4. But know this, that in the last days critical times hard to deal with will be here. 2  For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, haughty, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, disloyal, 3  having no natural affection, not open to any agreement, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, without the love of goodness, 4  betrayers, headstrong, puffed up with pride, lovers of pleasures rather than lovers of God.</p><p>

Firemen battle the great Porter Ranch fire last year.</p><p>
Another horror show has arrived which could well take our minds off Covid-19, Civil war or WWIII and it's earlier than usual.</p><p>
Here we go again and this year they are early with a long hot summer ahead. On November the 8th 2019,&#160;<span>California's biggest and most ruinous wildfire of the year, a wind-driven blaze that scorched 120 square miles (310 square kilometres) was declared fully contained and extinguished, however, a new horror show was just beginning in New South Wales, Australia.</span></p><p>
<span>According to authorities at the time, an "unprecedented" (90) number of emergency-level wildfires were streaking across New South Wales, Australia in drought-affected areas&#160;aided by gusty winds and 35 deg C (95 deg F) heat. There were reports of people trapped in their homes in several places, with fire crews unable to reach them due to the strength of the fires.&#160;</span><span>We all know the outcome of those unprecedented fires in Australia which went on to destroy an incredible 21% of its temperate forests and killed more than a billion animals.&#160;</span></p><p>
Back to the future, namely June 19, 2020. Early wildfires are raging across Arizona and California as the trinity of wildfires, drought, heat and gusty winds are converging once again creating ideal conditions for rapid spread.</p><p>
According to Reuters, so far more than 2,000 were evacuated from three large wildfires in Arizona on Thursday as dry conditions and gusty winds whipped blazes across the U.S. Southwest. Over 1,500 residents fled small communities in mountains about 50 miles (80 km) northeast of Phoenix, Arizona, as a wildfire grew to an area larger than the city of Detroit overnight, fire officials reported. Firefighters battling the Bush Fire faced gusting winds, low relative humidity and triple-digit temperatures as flames leapt through pi&#241;on pine and juniper in the Tonto National Forest. The fire, which began with a vehicle blaze, was the largest of 37 fires burning in the United States at 114,941 acres (46,515 hectares) and already the seventh-largest in Arizona history, according to National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) and National Weather Service (NWS) data. &#8220;We have hotter temperatures approaching,&#8221; said Marvin Percha, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Phoenix, forecasting above-average temperatures of 110 degrees Fahrenheit (43 Celsius) by Monday. Around a dozen other fires burned in Arizona as it faced another record daily rise in coronavirus cases on Thursday. The Mangum Fire had blackened 56,780 acres (22,980 hectares) around 40 miles (65 km) north of the Grand Canyon, forcing 230 people to leave their homes. Four hundred homes were evacuated for the Bighorn Fire north of Tucson, which had burned 23,892 acres (9,669 hectares) </p><p>
To the west, much of California remained under a &#8220;red flag warning&#8221; for erratic gusty winds, around half a dozen small fires burning up and down the state.

Alaska reported dozens of small blazes and the use of dogs to protect wildland firefighters from bears. Karelian Bear Dogs, a Finnish breed known for their fearless nature, were flown to a firefighting camp to protect personnel and supplies from the intruding animals, according to fire authorities.

<div><p class="subheading">North Korea claimed to conduct a test of &#8220;super-large multiple rocket launchers&#8221; on Thursday afternoon, state news propaganda outlet KCNA <a href="https://kcnawatch.org/newstream/1572556437-614413144/another-test-fire-of-super-large-multiple-rocket-launchers-conducted-in-dprk/">announced</a> on Friday.</p><p id="gmx-rev-top" class="H"></p>
<p>KNCA reported that North Korea&#8217;s Academy of Defence Science &#8220;succeeded in another test-fire of super-large multiple rocket launchers&#8221; as part of an effort to &#8220;verify the security of launchers&#8217; continuous fire system.&#8221;</p>


<p>&#8220;The successful test-fire result was directly reported to the Central Committee of the Workers&#8217; Party of Korea on the spot,&#8221; the agency reported.</p>
<p>State newspaper Rodong Sinmun published of the multiple rocket launcher, surrounded by yellow flames and smoke. The test reportedly left communist dictator Kim Jong-un feeling satisfied.</p>
 

<p>The report reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>After receiving a report of the Academy of Defence Science on the military and technical appreciation of the test-fire, Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un expressed satisfaction over it and sent congratulations to the national defense scientists who are devotedly struggling for developing the self-defensive military muscle of the country and bolstering up its armed forces.</p>
<p>The perfection of the continuous fire system was verified through the test-fire to totally destroy with super-power the group target of the enemy and designated target area by surprise strike of the weapon system of super-large multiple rocket launchers.</p></blockquote>
<p>Pyongyang&#8217;s continued testing of its nuclear weapons arsenal angered officials in Washington, with the chairman of the Senate foreign relations subcommittee on East Asia, the Pacific, and international cybersecurity policy,&#160;Sen.&#160;Cory Gardner (R-CO), accusing the regime of engaging in &#8220;escalatory behavior&#8221; at a time when they are meant to be <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/asia/2019/02/18/north-korea-predicts-major-breakthrough-second-trump-kim-summit/">negotiating</a> a peace agreement with the United States and South Korea.</p>
<p>He said in a <a href="https://www.gardner.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/gardner-statement-on-reports-of-north-korean-launch">statement:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>This launch and continued North Korean aggression underscore the need for the Trump Administration to re-commit to the maximum pressure policy and for Congress to quickly pass my bipartisan legislation to impose additional sanctions against the Kim regime.</p></blockquote>
<p>South Korean national security adviser Chung Eui-yong&#160;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-missiles-launch/north-korea-conducted-successful-multiple-rocket-launchers-test-kcna-idUSKBN1XA2OC">played down</a> the protests, arguing the missile launches do not pose &#8220;very grave threats.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re also test-firing missiles, no less than North Korea does,&#8221; he told a parliamentary session. &#8220;Our missile defense and intercept capabilities are absolutely superior to theirs.&#8221;</p>
<p>The test was the first activity since one day of talks between U.S. and North Korean diplomats ended without agreement, with the latter&#8217;s chief negotiator complaining that the talks had &#8220;not fulfilled our expectations and broken down.&#8221;</p>
<p>A&#160;<a href="https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2019/10/31/north-korea-done-nothing-decrease-nuclear-arsenal/">report</a> from The Heritage Foundation this week found that Pyongyang still &#8220;poses definite threats to the U.S. homeland,&#8221; as well as American military bases in South Korea, Japan, and Guam, having made no concrete attempts to reduce the size of their nuclear arsenal.</p>

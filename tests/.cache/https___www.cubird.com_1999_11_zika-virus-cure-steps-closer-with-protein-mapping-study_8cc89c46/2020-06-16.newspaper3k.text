There is currently no vaccine or medicine against Zika – a mosquito-borne virus that causes birth defects and, in its recent outbreak, has infected more than 1 million people in the Americas and Caribbean. Now, by mapping a protein that helps the Zika virus to replicate and spread, researchers take a significant step toward a cure. A study focusing on mapping the protein structure – led by Indiana University (IU) in Bloomington in collaboration with Texas A&M University in College Station – is published in the journal Nature Communications. Although most commonly spread through bites from Aedes mosquitoes, Zika virus can also spread through sexual activity. Symptoms of infection last for 2 to 7 days and include mild fever, a skin rash, eye inflammation (conjunctivitis), headache, and muscle and joint pain. The symptoms of Zika virus infection are often so mild that people barely notice them. Zika virus belongs to the genus Flavivirus, which includes viruses that cause yellow fever, West Nile virus, dengue fever, Japanese encephalitis, hepatitis C, and other significant diseases in humans. It was first identified in monkeys in Uganda in 1947. Scientists now agree that Zika virus can cause microcephaly in babies born to women infected… Read full this story

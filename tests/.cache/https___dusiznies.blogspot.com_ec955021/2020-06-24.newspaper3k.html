<p>&#8220;We write to reaffirm the unshakeable alliance between the United States and Israel, to emphasize that Israel has the right to make sovereign decisions independent of outside pressure, and to express our support for you as you make such decisions in your capacity as Israel&#8217;s democratically-elected prime minister,&#8221; said the letter sent Monday to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. &#8220;As dedicated friends of the Jewish state, we reaffirm our steadfast commitment to the relationship between our two nations and Israel&#8217;s right to sovereignty and defensible borders.&#8221;</p></p>

<p>The letter, shared with the&#160;Jewish Telegraphic Agency, was spearheaded by the first, second, and third-ranked Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives: Kevin McCarthy, Calif., Steve Scalise, La., and Liz Cheney, Wyo., respectively. Also taking a lead in gathering signatures for the letter were the two Jewish members of the caucus: Lee Zeldin of New York and David Kustoff of Tennessee.</p></p>
<p>
<p>It has garnered 116 signatures out of 198 Republicans in the House. The Republican Jewish Coalition recently announced that it would lobby for Israel&#8217;s right to extend sovereignty to some areas as envisioned in the Trump administration peace plan unveiled earlier this year.</p></p>
<p>
<p>The letter comes as another letter is circulating among Democrats in the House that warn Israel of the perils of applying sovereignty over parts of Judea and Samaria. That letter so far has garnered 170 signatures, including top pro-Israel leaders like Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the majority leader.</p></p>

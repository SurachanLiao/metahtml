</h3>

 


<p dir="ltr">
 
<span>Radical left Jewish American activist Ariel Gold, who has previously had her picture taken at the Western Wall holding a sign in support of 'Palestine' and assaulted IDF soldiers, voiced her support for having monuments to Israel's leaders - among them leftist prime ministers - taken down.</span></p><p>
 
<span>"FYI I am great with tearing down any statues of Ben Gurion, Theodore Herzl, Menachem Begin, Rabin etc anywhere around the world.&#160;</span></p><p>
<span>Also any statues of Moses anywhere," she tweeted.</span></p><p>
 
<span><span><span>Ariel Gold</span>&#160;is classic useful idiot, who use their Jewish blood as a justification for promoting vile racism and hatred toward Jews.&#160;</span></span></p><p>
<span><span>She is an anti-Israel provocateur, a strong advocate of the antisemitic BDS movement and co-director of Codepink, a radical social justice NGO that is proud of its relationship with terror groups.</span></span></p><p>

<a href="https://dusiznies.blogspot.com/2020/06/appeals-court-orders-malicious-black.html">Appeals court orders the Malicious Black Judge to dismiss Flynn Case </a>
</h3>

 


<p dir="ltr">
 
<span>A federal appeals court on Wednesday ordered a lower court to allow the case against former National Security Adviser Michael&#160;</span><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/drops-doj-case-against-michael-flynn-in-wake-of-internal-memo-release" target="_blank">Flynn&#160;</a><span>to be dismissed, as requested by the Justice Department -- likely ending the years-long legal saga stemming from the Russia investigation.</span></p><p>
 
<span>The abrupt&#160;</span><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/drops-doj-case-against-michael-flynn-in-wake-of-internal-memo-release" target="_blank">ending</a><span>&#160;came in a 2-1 ruling and&#160;</span><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/read-courts-opinion-ordering-flynn-case-dismissal" target="_blank">order</a><span>&#160;from judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.</span></p><p>
 
<p>
This was the result of an appeal from Flynn's lawyers asking for a so-called writ of mandamus --&#160;essentially an order telling a government official to carry out a certain duty --&#160;directing District Judge Emmet Sullivan to approve the DOJ's motion to dismiss.</p>
<p>
Sullivan did not immediately grant that motion and instead sought to hold hearings on the matter, angering Flynn allies.</p>
<p>
The unusual move from&#160;Sullivan to keep the case alive despite prosecutors' wishes was preceded by an unusual move from the DOJ itself to drop the charges against Flynn even after he&#160;had pleaded guilty -- saying the FBI interview that led to his charge of lying to investigators about his contacts with Russia's ambassador had no "legitimate investigative basis."</p>
<p>
It's unclear whether Sullivan could try to appeal to the full appeals court or even to the Supreme Court in order to keep the case alive. The next step otherwise would likely be for Sullivan to comply.</p>
<p>
Wednesday's court order was direct, ordering&#160;"that Flynn&#8217;s petition for a writ of mandamus be granted in part; the District Court is directed to grant the government&#8217;s ... motion to dismiss; and the District Court&#8217;s order appointing an amicus is hereby vacated as moot, in accordance with the opinion of the court filed herein this date."</p>
<p>
President Trump cheered the decision Wednesday morning, tweeting:&#160;"Great! Appeals Court Upholds Justice Departments Request To Drop Criminal Case Against General Michael Flynn!"</p>
<p>
A senior DOJ official told Fox News the department is &#8220;pleased&#8221; by the appeals court decision in the Flynn case.</p>

</h3>

 



 
 
<p>
<span>I haven't really written too much about the breakup in Ger...</span></p><p>
<span>but just because I'm not writing about it, doesn't mean that its not happening ....</span></p>
<p>
<span>suffice it to say at this time ...&#160;</span></p>
<p>
<span>&#160;The Rosh Yeshiva of Ger, Rav Shaul Alter, first cousin of the Gerer Rebbe, who was the Rosh Yeshivah,&#160; took approximately 3 thousand Gerer families and left the chassidus to form his own off shoot..</span></p>
 
<p>
<span>The Gerer Rebbe, no slouch himself tried putting down the rebellion with tremendous force and sometimes with violence and he also threw out the children of the rebels of the moisdois...</span></p>
<p>
<span>and now they erased and crossed out the name of the Rosh Yeshivah in their holy sefarim!</span></p>
 
 
 
<p>
<span>and so now we have another show during this covid-19 lockdown!&#160;</span></p>

<p>
<span> There is a group of crazed fanatics who call themselves the "Aarilich" ... they are Toldos Ahron Chassidim...!</span></p>
<p>
<span>They live in Yerushalyim in Meah Shearim and in&#160; Bet Shemesh "bet".</span></p>
<p>
<span>They do nothing all day ...</span><span>the majority don't work, supported by handouts..and are bored&#160;to tears...</span></p>
 
<p>
<span>Well one of the Toldos Aaron Rebbes died... the one living in Monsey ...</span></p>
<p>
<span>So of course the other brothers sat shivah ... and the Belzer Rebbe decided&#160;to make an innocent Shivah Call...</span></p>
<p>
<span>Big mistake!</span></p>
<p>
<span>When the mobs got wind of the fact that the Belzer came, they surrounded his car on the way out and taking a cue from the rioting shvartzes in the US, they started to riot ...and called him "Nazi"</span></p>
 
<p>
<span>Why they hate the Belzer... G-d only knows...</span></p>
<p>
<span>But the Belzer are majority in Israel and if they wanted they could beat the living crap out of them ....and knowing a little about Belz, I am sure that we didn't hear the end of this and will not allow this "debt" to linger for ever and will soon "collect" to&#160; make sure there is closure!</span></p>
 
<p>
<span>&#160;The "Aarelich" are just like Amon &amp; Moav ....and learned how to treat "guests"from them ...&#160;</span></p>
<p>
<span>&#160;in next week's parsha ....we see how Amon &amp; Moav treated their "guests" the Jewish people!</span></p>

</h3>

 



 
<p>
<span>The Board of Elections of Rockland County has introduced "tablets" that are now used for voting in local elections..</span></p>
 
<p>
<span>Well, not so fast!</span></p>
<p>
<span>The holy Bais Din of Skver sat down to discuss this new innovation and decided that voting by signing a "tablet" will contaminate&#160;the soul... the neshama!</span></p>
 
<p>
<span>But it apparently won't contaminate the soul once you are married ....&#160;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Once you are "toam taam chete" (tasted the taste of sin) the satan stays away ...</span></p>
<p>
<span>and so if you are a lady or a man thats married you can go ahead and vote..</span></p>
 
<p>
<span>I don't know if the "fatwah" includes anyone divorced!</span></p>

</h3>

 



 
<p>
Interesting... I don't see any Neturei Karta running to live there... I wonder why</p><p>
Rav Yehudah Grami, the Chief Rabbi of Teheran, said there was &#8220;complete freedom of religion&#8221; in Iran in an interview on Sunday.</p>
<p>
In the interview, which was carried out in Hebrew with&#160;Al-Monitor&#160;and broadcast on Channel 12 News in Israel,&#160;<span>Rav Grami</span>&#160;spoke about many aspects of Jewish life in Iran.</p>

 

<p>
&#8220;I estimate that there are between 20,000 and 25,000 Jews in the country. Most of them live in Tehran, Shiraz, Esfahan and Kermanshah, though there are other, small communities too,&#8221; Rav Grami said.</p>
<p>
&#8220;We have total freedom of religion,&#8221; claimed Rav Grami. &#8221; All the shuls are open, and Torah classes take place there. We have all sorts of educational institutions too, including elementary and middle schools.&#8221;</p>
<p>
Rav Grami also spoke about the coronavirus crisis, which seems to have barely affected the Jewish community in hard-hit Iran, in part, thanks to his swift action by closing all shuls in March.</p>

<a href="https://dusiznies.blogspot.com/2020/06/new-study-says-summer-sun-can-kill.html">New study says summer sun can kill coronavirus in 34 minutes</a>
</h3>

 



 
<p>
<span>The strong summer sun is capable of wiping out 90 percent or more of coronavirus in just 34 minutes, a new study has found.</span></p>
<p>
Scientists suggest that &#8220;midday sunlight in most US and world cities during summer&#8221; is extremely effective in inactivating the virus that causes COVID-19, according to&#160;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32502327/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the study published earlier this month.</a></p>
<p>
The virus, however, is most infectious from December until March &#8212; when it can live for up to a day or more &#8220;with risk of re-aerosolization and transmission in most of these cities.&#8221;</p>
<p>
The study, which appeared in the&#160;journal Photochemistry and Photobiology,&#160;was authored by Jose-Luis Sagripanti and David Lytle &#8212; scientists who are retired from the US Army and Food and Drug Administration, respectively.</p>
<p>
The pair also suggests that the mandatory stay-at-home orders issued in hopes of stopping the spread of coronavirus may have been more harmful than good.</p>
<p>
&#8220;In contrast, healthy people outdoors receiving sunlight could have been exposed to lower viral dose with more chances for mounting an efficient immune response,&#8221; the study said.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4504358/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Past research</a>&#160;has shown that during the Spanish Flu outbreak of 1918-&#8217;19, patients who were exposed to fresh air and sunshine in &#8220;open-air hospitals&#8221; may have had a better chance at survival.</p>
<p>
The new evidence comes months after health experts shot down the idea that&#160;<a href="https://nypost.com/2020/04/27/sunlight-doesnt-kill-coronavirus-experts-say/">the virus doesn&#8217;t spread as much</a>&#160;in hotter climates.</p>

</h3>

 



 
<p>
Just when you thought Mel Gibson was&#160;<a href="https://nypost.com/2017/01/24/hollywood-has-officially-forgiven-mel-gibson/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">back in Hollywood&#8217;s good graces</a>, actress Winona Ryder (aka&#160;<span>Laura Horowitz)</span> has alleged that the 64-year-old actor slandered her with an anti-semitic slur while they were at a party in 1995. The &#8220;Stranger Things&#8221; star dropped the bombshell, which was&#160;<a href="https://www.jta.org/2010/12/16/united-states/gibsons-anti-semitic-remarks-predate-dui-tape-ryder-says" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">first reported by GQ in 2010</a>, while discussing her experiences with anti-semitism in Hollywood in an interview with the&#160;<a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/winona-ryder-on-turning-50-missing-keanu-reeves-and-being-saved-by-normal-people-07rppmj3t?wgu=270525_54264_15929201799651_35da228bc9&amp;wgexpiry=1600696179&amp;utm_source=planit&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_content=22278" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">UK-based Sunday Times</a>.</p>
<p>
&#8220;We were at a crowded party with one of my good friends, and Mel Gibson was smoking a cigar,&#8221; Ryder, 48, told the news outlet. She added that something came up about the Jewish faith, upon which the &#8220;Mad Max&#8221; actor said, &#8216;You&#8217;re not an oven dodger, are you?&#8221; &#8212; an apparent reference to the way bodies of Jewish prisoners were incinerated in Nazi death camps.</p>
<p>
Gibson has not responded to The Post&#8217;s request for comment, but Ryder has said he later tried to apologize for his offensive comments.</p>

<a href="https://dusiznies.blogspot.com/2020/06/republican-lawmakers-endorse-israels.html">Republican lawmakers endorse Israel's right to apply sovereignty ... But Jews Still Vote For DemocRATS</a>
</h3>

 



<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container"><tbody>
 
<tr><td class="tr-caption">Kapos</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>
<span>Jews don't really care, they will keep voting for the DemocRATS!&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p>
<span>The "askanim" the "gedoilim" and the "Kapos" like Ezra Friedlander will be writing "opinion" pieces for the dumb Jews to vote for the Jew haters ... nothing will change! absolutely nothing.....</span></p>
 
<p>
<span>Top Republicans spearheaded a letter backing Israel&#8217;s right to determine its borders at a time that Democrats are pressing Israel not to apply sovereignty over parts of Judea and Samaria.</span></p>

<p>
<span>THANKS SO MUCH, IT MEANS A LOT ESPECIALLY IN THESE DIFFICULT TIMES!</span></p>
 
<p>
<span>&#8220;We write to reaffirm the unshakeable alliance between the United States and Israel, to emphasize that Israel has the right to make sovereign decisions independent of outside pressure, and to express our support for you as you make such decisions in your capacity as Israel&#8217;s democratically-elected prime minister,&#8221; said the letter sent Monday to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. &#8220;As dedicated friends of the Jewish state, we reaffirm our steadfast commitment to the relationship between our two nations and Israel&#8217;s right to sovereignty and defensible borders.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>
<span>The letter, shared with the&#160;Jewish Telegraphic Agency, was spearheaded by the first, second, and third-ranked Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives: Kevin McCarthy, Calif., Steve Scalise, La., and Liz Cheney, Wyo., respectively. Also taking a lead in gathering signatures for the letter were the two Jewish members of the caucus: Lee Zeldin of New York and David Kustoff of Tennessee.</span></p>
<p>
<span>It has garnered 116 signatures out of 198 Republicans in the House. The Republican Jewish Coalition recently announced that it would lobby for Israel&#8217;s right to extend sovereignty to some areas as envisioned in the Trump administration peace plan unveiled earlier this year.</span></p>
<p>
<span>The letter comes as another letter is circulating among Democrats in the House that warn Israel of the perils of applying sovereignty over parts of Judea and Samaria. That letter so far has garnered 170 signatures, including top pro-Israel leaders like Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the majority leader.</span></p>

</h3>

 



 
<p>
<span>"The chickens are coming home to roost!"</span></p>
<p>
Bullets are whizzing around New York this month at a&#160;<a href="https://nypost.com/2020/06/21/nyc-shootings-skyrocket-as-court-closures-let-gun-possession-perps-walk-free/">rate not seen in nearly a quarter century,</a>&#160;according to the NYPD &#8212; and police sources said that the recent run of gunplay will be the new normal.</p>
<p>
Through the first three weeks of June, which came to a close Sunday, city streets echoed with 125 shooting incidents, Chief of Crime Control Strategies Michael LiPetri told The Post on Monday.</p>
<p>
&#8220;We have to go back to June of 1996 to get a worse start for June,&#8221; said LiPetri. &#8220;That is a telling stat.&#8221;</p>
<p>
Twenty-four years ago, Rudy Giuliani was mayor and, while the city had made strides in tamping down crime, Gotham still saw 2,938 people shot and 984 murdered.</p>
<p>
From Monday, June 15, through Sunday, there were 53 shooting incidents across the city, the highest mark for a single week since Mayor de&#8201;Blasio took office.</p>
<p>
The last time the city recorded that many shootings in a week was around July 4, 2012, according to police sources.</p>
<p>
But to find a non-holiday week &#8212; which tends to be quieter &#8212; with that many shootings, the department had to look all the way back to 2005, according to LiPetri.</p>

</h3>

 



 
 
 
<p>
<span>Crazy Frummies...&#160; they think that Moshiach is here ... and no longer in Galus.....</span></p>
<p>
<span>De'Blassio hates them and I think he doesn't even sleep in city hall .</span></p>
<p>
<span>The city is going down the drain, becoming a Mexico&#160; with more shooting in one 24 hour period than in the last 10 years in Israel..</span></p>
<p>
<span>This is what happens when "Gedioilm" say that Israel isn't safe ..</span></p>
<p>
<span>Those words that "Israel isn't safe" are straight out of the words of the meraglim who were "gedoilei" Yisrael...</span></p>
<p>
<span>Don't think that these shooting will stay in NYC only ... it will spread all over ...&#160;</span></p>
<p>
A few hundred angry New Yorkers showed up to a &#8220;noisy&#8221; protest in Manhattan late Monday night, sending a &#8220;noise message&#8221; to Mayor DeBlasio.</p>
<p>
The residents are furious that DeBlasio has done nothing to stop the fireworks plaguing the city every night until 3-4 in the morning, preventing millions of New Yorkers from being able to sleep.</p>
<p>
In return, the protesters arrived in their vehicles and honked their horns outside Gracie Mansion, to give the Mayor a taste of what it feels like to not be able to sleep.</p>
<p>
A viral social media message reads:</p>

 

<p>
&#8220;We will be taking over all the side streets leading up to Gracie mansion if east end is indeed closed. We want to leave at this time to avoid issues of last minute positioning and setup and have ample time to coordinate and proceed on time.</p>
<p>
We will be blocking the FDR on the SOUTH BOUND SIDE heading towards Brooklyn since Gracie mansion is right on the edge by 90th street at the beginning/end of the tunnel.</p>
<p>
All other locations out of Brooklyn, please coordinate with those joining from those areas and commence a starting point to leave together.</p>
<p>
Feel free to coordinate rides with each other if you don&#8217;t have a car as well.</p>

<a href="https://dusiznies.blogspot.com/2020/06/zionist-scientists-invent-self-cleaning.html">Zionist Scientists Invent Self-Cleaning Masks That Kill Virus With Heat From Phone Charger</a>
</h3>

 



 
 
<p>
Israeli scientists have developed a reusable face mask that can kill the coronavirus via heat obtained via an electric current from a phone charger.</p>
<p>
The mask looks like a standard N97 face mask except for the USB port that can connect it to a standard power source that heats an inner layer of carbon fibers to 158&#176;F (70&#176;C), high enough to kill viruses.</p>
<p>
It takes about a half-hour for the mask to be sterilized and the mask can then be re-used, an environmentally friendly alternative to disposable face masks.</p>
<p>
The masks were developed by a research team at the Technion University in Haifa, headed by Prof. Yair Ein-Eli.</p>

 

<p>
The team filed for a US patent for the mask in the United States in March and hopes to make them commercially available for about $1 each in the near future.</p>

This is mind boggling .... Nancy Goroff one the Jewish candidates that hopes to run against Lee Zeldin the only Jewish Republican Congressman, is&#160; a leftist scientist who is closely aligned with the anti-Israel "JStreet" ... and is a member of a group that advocates the murder of babies in the womb....</p>

<p>The other jerk, Perry Gershon, is also closely aligned with JStreet and both backed the murderous Iran Deal and express "worry" on Israel's plan to annex parts of the West Bank.</p>

<span>New York&#8217;s First Congressional District is not very Jewish.&#160;It encompasses most of Central and Eastern Suffolk County, where&#160;</span><a href="https://www.jewishdatabank.org/content/upload/bjdb/358/C-NY-New_York-2002_Slide_Set_Profile_of_Long_Island_Jewish_Community.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">roughly</a><span>&#160;five to seven percent of the population are Jews. But it is currently the site of a very Jewish US House race.</span></p>
<p>
On Tuesday, Democrats Nancy Goroff and Perry Gershon will face off in a primary to challenge Representative Lee Zeldin, one of only two Jewish Republicans in Congress after the November election. There are also two other candidates running for the seat, Suffolk County legislator Bridget Fleming and a perennial local candidate Greg Fischer &#8212; although both have&#160;<a href="https://shelterislandreporter.timesreview.com/2020/02/16/in-congressional-race-goroff-leads-democratic-hopefuls-in-fundraising/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">raised</a>&#160;far less money than the two main rivals.</p>

<p>
<span>What is it with our Democrat, Jewish, elected politicians that, when the chips are down, they side with the enemies of Israel?&#160;</span></p>
 
<p>
<span>A&#160;<a href="https://forward.com/news/national/449169/house-democrats-israel-annexation/" target="_blank">recent letter to Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu</a>&#160;and his political rival, Defense Minister, Benny Gantz was signed by&#160;<a href="https://jewishinsider.com/2020/06/steny-hoyer-and-115-house-dems-have-signed-onto-letter-opposing-annexation/" target="_blank">115 Democrats</a>, warning these two leaders, even reprimanding them for their rare and short-lived moment of solidarity in moving to apply sovereignty to the areas of Judea and Samaria, which the note unfortunately terms,&#160;&#8220;The West Bank.&#8221;</span></p>
 
 
<p>
<span>Sadly, this missive of censure for this move had the likes of Jewish Congresspeople Ted Deutch (D-FL), Nita Lowey (D-NY), Brad Schneider (D-ILL), and Jan Schakowsky (D-ILL) putting their John Hancocks to the document.</span></p>
 
 
<p>
<span>They joined hands with Congresswomen Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, both firmly anti-Israel and Jew haters of the first accord.&#160;</span></p>
 
<p>
<span>This attempt to weaken Israel is also supported and financed by the likes of J Street, CAIR and the Israel Policy Forum. That tells the tale of the goals of this move.</span></p>
 
 
<p>
<span>These Jewish, Democrat, elected House members, along with the likes of Senators Schumer and Feinstein (not halakhically Jewish) who also threw their support against Israel&#8217;s application of sovereignty, shamelessly garner Jewish votes back home by kvelling&#160;(<a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/kvelling" target="_blank">boasting</a>)&#160;about their outright, support, backing and championing of Israel.</span></p>
 
 
<p>
<span>They lie. But they get re-elected. Go figure.</span></p>

<span>At Least 21 People Shot In 24-Hour Span In NYC</span></h1>
 

<p>
The NYPD is investigating a spree of shootings on the first official weekend of summer. They say 21 people have been shot in the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>
The police department says it&#8217;s investigating 13 separate shootings that occurred in the 12 hours since midnight.</p>
<p>
Since Monday, there have been 33 reported shootings across the city &#8212; more than double the number of shootings reported during this week in 2019, when only 12 shootings occurred.</p>
<p>
As of June 14, the city was reeling from a 24% jump in shootings across the city, from 317 this time last year to 394, officials said. Murders were also up by 25% from 127 to 159.</p>

<p>
<span>This "kishhing the hand business" of the rebbe, is a Hungarian "minhag shtus" and was never practised by the the "galiyetzaner" chassidim .... in fact when I was growing up, the galiyatzaner would mock the Hungarians because they kissed the hands of their rebbes...</span></p>
 
<p>
<span>The Bobover Rebbe 48 was one of the first to get the Covid-19 virus and it was only then that he issued a fatwa for chassidim to take precautions..</span></p>
 
<p>
<span>But now that his youngest son got engaged, "beshaa tova umitzlachas" he no longer practices "social distancing" and stuck his hand out so he could get kissed!. ....</span></p>

<a href="https://dusiznies.blogspot.com/2020/06/how-brad-lander-far-left-progressive.html">How Brad Lander a far-Left Progressive Got to Write An Opinion Piece in VIN</a>
</h3>

 


<p dir="ltr">
 
<span>As my readers know,&#160; I am not a fan of Eliot Engel, a Jewish US representative, that hates Trump and wants him overthrown.</span></p><p>
 
<span>Having said that, his opponent, Jamaal Bowman&#160; is a black "educator" that is endorsed by AOC and Bernie Sanders, and has been quoted as saying that "American aid to Israel should be conditional on exploring Israel's human rights record......"</span></p><p>
<span>He also supports "</span><span><span>The Jewish Vote," a far-left group that is the electoral arm of Jews for Racial and Economic Justice (JFREJ), which has a history of backing pro-BDS candidates and anti-Semitic individuals who make anti-Israel statements.</span></span></p><p>
 
<span>Last week, June 18, Brad Lander a NYC Council member, and founder of the Council's Progressive Caucus, wrote an opinion piece in <a href="https://vosizneias.com/2020/06/18/brad-lander-eliot-engels-challenger-jamaal-bowman-is-the-best-candidate-for-jews/" target="_blank"><span>VosIzNeis </span></a>endorsing Jamaal Bowman.... and headlining his endorsement "Eliot Engel's Challenger&#160;Jamaal Bowman's Is the Best Candidate for The Jews"</span></p><p>
 
<span>Brad Lander's ideas are to the left of Fidel Castro...&#160;</span></p><p>
<span>on a vote in the City Council against BDS in which he thankfully sided with Israel, he couldn't contain his real feelings when he at the same time condemned "Israel's Occupation of the west Bank and Gaza," not mentioning that Israel withdrew from Gaza in September of 2005.</span></p><p>
 
<span>So how did Brad get to write this leftist propaganda&#160;in VIN, which basically asked Jews to vote for a Black anti-Semite over the Jewish Engel?</span></p><p>
 
<span>Answer:</span></p><p>
<span>Ezra Friedlander!&#160;</span></p><p>
<span>It has been told to me that Ezra's wife works for Brad Lander....</span></p><p>
<span>And it's no secret that Friedlander pushed the candidacy of Lander who is openly against "mezizeh be'peh" a policy that the frum community wants .... but Ezra doesn't care what his constituents want or need it's all about as Omar famously said " the Benjamins"</span></p><p>
<span>He got his "opinion" peace into VIN even if it meant stabbing his Jewish brothers and sisters in the back!</span></p><p>

</h3>

 



 
 
<p>
<span>So this should settle this once and for all.....I remember growing up when Chassidishe "Baldies" would alway yell ... "Tchup... Tchup....&#160; (hair in the front...called "frezuhr") to the Litvishe boys ..</span></p>
<p>
<span>I especially remembers when the "oberlanders" with their Hitler moustaches ...&#160; hated the "Tchups"..</span></p>
<p>
<span>They would constantly yell ... it's "blurious" which the gemarrah prohibits ... "blurious" is actually the haircut that Romans used to do which was shaving the sides of the head ......</span></p> 
<p>
<span>The <a href="https://genazym.bidspirit.com/?lang=en&amp;utm_source=vin&amp;utm_medium=188&amp;utm_campaign=7#catalog~606~589~129546" target="_blank"><span>Genizim</span></a> auction has the Chazon Ish's comments written in his own handwriting, permitting it ... he does however, not recommend it...</span></p>
<p>
<span>my doctor recommends I stay away from tomatoes, since it gives me heartburn..</span></p>

 
<p>
Fascinating Comment from the Chazon Ish Detailing His Halachic Perspective on Growing a &#8216;Tchup&#8217; (Forelock)</p>
 
<p>
The Chazon Ish states that it is permitted to grow a "tshup" for beauty&#160;reasons&#160;</p>
<p>
(&#160;although not recommended)&#160;</p>
 
 
<p>
In the sefer Da Gezairos Oraisa, the author- Rabbi Yehoshua Alter Wildman rules that it is a de&#8217;oraisa prohibition to grow a forelock (tchup) due to the prohibition of imitating the gentiles.</p>
 
<p>
In the present copy of this sefer there is a&#160;handwritten note by the Chazon Ish refuting&#160;the author&#8217;s opinion and arguing that the matter involved is not a de&#8217;oraisa transgression. He explains that unless one was specifically trying to imitate the gentiles, the matter did not constitute a transgression since it was being done for reasons of beauty and not as an imitation. However, the Chazon Ish adds that despite this, it is still &#8220;worthy of those who fear G-d to veer to a more modest path in clothing and other matters (of modesty).&#8221;</p>
 
<p>
Rabbi Yehoshua Alter published his sefer following the immigration of the Slabodka Yeshiva to Eretz Yisrael. Students of the yeshiva were accustomed to growing a forelock, something that was frowned upon by Jerusalem&#8217;s Charedi community.</p>

Nor will they have a chance to thank him. He died in China on February 7th of the plague he warned was coming. The Wuhan ophthalmologist was just 34 when his heart stopped, a husband and father — with another baby on the way. “He wasn’t an idealistic whistleblower. He was not a dissident. He wasn’t even political,” one reporter <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/sierens-china-li-wenliang-a-tragic-hero/a-52373250">mourned</a>. “He was simply a doctor doing his job.” And for that, China silenced him. Permanently.</p><p>Dr. Wenliang was treating patients when Chinese officials <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/06/world/asia/chinese-doctor-Li-Wenliang-coronavirus.html">arrested him</a>. Furious that he’d sounded the alarm over the mysterious virus exploding through the region, they made him sign a statement to keep quiet. “We solemnly warn you: If you keep being stubborn, with such impertinence, and continue this illegal activity, you will be brought to justice — is that understood?” It was the beginning of a massive, regime-wide <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/02/08/chinas-culture-of-lies-has-helped-spread-the-coronavirus/">cover-up</a>that’s claimed 19,000 lives and sent the global economy spiraling out of control.</p><p>Now, with the world in utter chaos and people dying faster than countries can bury them, the fury over China’s deadly conspiracy is white hot. Leaders like Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), who are watching with horror as the infections ravage America, are determined to hold the Chinese Communist Party responsible. “Since day one, [they] intentionally lied to the world about the origin of this pandemic.” He talked about the orders for laboratories to destroy samples and the persecution of doctors like Li. “It is time for an international investigation,” <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/congressional-resolution-seeks-international-probe-of-chinas-coronavirus-handling">Hawley insisted</a>. “…The Chinese Communist Party must be held to account for what the world is now suffering.”</p><p>Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, whose agency is getting frantic calls from Americans trying to get home, understands better than anyone the human toll of China’s actions. “Every day, every week matters in terms of how this information is transmitted around the world. That is, when you share this information, the best scientists around the world can begin to work on it. You can start all the processes, not only vaccines and things that mitigate, but you can begin to put in place the things that will cause the spread to be decreased. And it’s multiplicative — so every day that the Chinese Communist Party sat on this information and didn’t do the right thing… [they] increased the number of people who would be exposed, and thereby put all of us all around the world — the Chinese people as well — at unnecessary risk.”</p><p>Even now, he said on “Washington Watch” Tuesday, the disinformation campaign continues — not just in China but in Russia and Iran as well. “They’re talking about it coming from the U.S. Army, and they’re saying maybe it began in Italy — all things to deflect responsibility.” And yes, countries have more urgent problems on their hands right now, but “the world needs to understand what’s really going on,” the secretary insisted, “because it’s still important.”</p><p>If nothing is done, this culture of lies will continue to cost the world innocent human lives. “It’s still important to have transparency even today. This is an ongoing global crisis, and we need to make sure that every country today is being transparent sharing what’s really going on, so that the global community, the global health care, infectious disease community can begin to work on this in a holistic way. My concern,” Mike said frankly, “is that this cover-up, this disinformation that the Chinese Communist Party is engaged in, is still denying the world the information it needs so that we can prevent further cases or something like this from recurring again.”</p><p>In Iran, where the government ignored the virus to <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/03/24/how-iran-botched-coronavirus-pandemic-response/">keep turnout high for the February elections</a>, the casualties have been astronomical. Now, of course, they’re lying to their people and trying to turn them against America because they know their grip on their regime is very tentative. If they can shift their focus away from themselves, the Iranians can hide what they knew and when they knew it. But, as Secretary Pompeo points out, “the people most harmed by the absence of transparency and good governance are the people of their own country.” And as much as Iran and China try to deceive them, the people know it.</p><p>So maybe, the secretary said, one of the best outcomes we can hope for in this catastrophe is that they see a country like America treating people with dignity and respect. “Those are the things that fundamentally separate us from regimes like… Iran and the Chinese Communist Party. And it’s why, when we move our way through this… as I know we will, the people all around the world will see that is our system — a republic where we have freedom and liberty and we know that our rights come from our Creator — these are the systems that will ultimately prove to be most effective at delivering good outcomes for every human being.”</p><p>Tony Perkins’s Washington Update is written with the aid of FRC senior writers.</p><p>RELATED ARTICLES</p><p><a href="http://www.frc.org/updatearticle/20200325/do-die" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Economy: Do or Die</a></p><p><a href="http://www.frc.org/updatearticle/20200325/abortion-curve" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flattening Abortion’s Curve</a></p><p>EDITORS NOTE: This <a href="https://www.frc.org/get.cfm?i=WA20C50&amp;f=WU20C16" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FRC-Action</a> podcast and column are republished with permission. © All rights reserved.</p></article> <article class="post-entry post-entry-type-standard post-entry-94459 post-loop-3 post-parity-odd single-big  post-94459 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-elections category-featured category-healthcare category-news category-policy category-politics category-science category-social-issues"><p><ins>Watching the evening press conferences that President Trump and his team are holding nightly during this crisis, I am seeing something I was not expecting — and now understand why some Democrats and many media members are pushing networks to cut the live coverage and make sure they get to” filter” everything.</ins></p><p><ins>The media calls to cut the mic made no sense after they had fits when Trump had stopped the daily press availabilities (because some media members had turned it into opportunities to grandstand.) Now I get it. It’s not hypocrisy. It’s because it works. And it works in a way that the intransigent never Trumpers could not have imagined possible.</ins></p><p><ins>These nightly press conferences are not only very effective, they are revealing how Trump has changed to deal with this crisis — something that many did not think possible. Trump looks downright presidential in the way all his critics claim he should be, but don’t really want him to be because they fear that would be good for his presidency.</ins></p><p><ins>He has an almost charming relationship with Dr. Deborah Birx and has her or Dr. Anthony Fauci handle most of the medical questions. He has a Navy Admiral explaining the efforts in the supply chain; Attorney General William Barr explaining the law for new rules; Vice President Mike Pence heading the federal task force to explain overall steps; and different specialists each night to answer questions.</ins></p><p><ins>Trump speaks, rarely invoking politics, then steps aside and has experts in each area explain from their respective areas of expertise.</ins></p><p><ins>Despite the socially distanced media clearly pushing him to make political statements in search of tomorrow’s headline, my goodness that is glaringly obvious, he stays very non-political for about two hours. That is a new Trump.</ins></p><p><ins>And the best Trump for this moment. Most great presidents, great leaders, are made during a crisis and their handling of it. Washington, Lincoln, Churchill, FDR (a very strong leader, just too often in the wrong direction) Reagan, even George W. Bush in his initial response to 9/11. Yes, there is some rarified company in that list. But we may be seeing that happening right now. After a slow start (minus blocking the flights from China in late January, which obviously bought us some time) and some missteps over seriousness, Trump has allowed his strengths to overcome his weaknesses.</ins></p><p><ins>This crisis has revealed his organizational abilities, intelligence, imagination, personal charisma and, very importantly, his boundless optimism for America. It also showed he does not have to be the center of attention. He spends a lot of time standing off to the side. But he directs the entire press conference like a maestro, from beginning to end.</ins></p><p><ins>He’s become what Dr. Sheldon Roth calls a “leader-follower” — which is just what the country needs at this critical moment.</ins></p><p><ins>The media is too far gone to allow that to come through directly to American people. They want to be the censors of Presidential speech, so they can cherry-pick and twist for their own, partisan agenda. That has not changed in this crisis. Neither apparently have many Democrats with their willingness to lard up the coronavirus bill with add-ons for pay equity, voting, private board representation, green initiatives, permanent paid leave, student loan bailouts and so much more. The crisis is an opportunity for them to get some goodies. (Notably, Democrats outside D.C., such as California Gov. Newsome and New York Gov. Coumo, have praised Trump’s responses.)</ins></p><p><ins>The media and the Democratic leadership seem not to have changed during this. Trump has, at least for the moment. And the American people are liking what they are seeing. The approval polls are showing it, with Trump soaring up to 54 percent on his handling of this, which is pretty phenomenal. And for the media and Democrats, that’s why the mic must be cut.</ins></p><p><ins>We may be seeing the emergence of a great U.S. President during a time of crisis. I honestly never thought Trump would be “great.” But what I see at these evening press conferences is something altogether unexpected — a Trump version of Roosevelt’s popular fireside chats.</ins></p><p><ins>EDITORS NOTE: This <a href="https://therevolutionaryact.com/are-we-seeing-the-emergence-of-greatness-in-a-crisis/?utm_source=The+Revolutionary+Act%3A+General+Subscribers&amp;utm_campaign=f1166d7d2e-RSS_Email_Every_Post_&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_829cfbf761-f1166d7d2e-24413925" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revolutionary Act Link: https://therevolutionaryact.com/are-we-seeing-the-emergence-of-greatness-in-a-crisis/?utm_source=The+Revolutionary+Act%3A+General+Subscribers&amp;utm_campaign=f1166d7d2e-RSS_Email_Every_Post_&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_829cfbf761-f1166d7d2e-24413925 </a> column is republished with permission. © All rights reserved.</ins></p></article><article class="post-entry post-entry-type-standard post-entry-94455 post-loop-4 post-parity-even single-big  post-94455 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-healthcare category-news category-religion-2 category-social-issues category-video"><p><ins>My latest in <a href="https://pjmedia.com/trending/new-york-imam-finds-the-key-coronavirus-comes-from-women-showing-too-much-ankle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PJ Media Link: https://pjmedia.com/trending/new-york-imam-finds-the-key-coronavirus-comes-from-women-showing-too-much-ankle/ </a>:</ins></p><p><ins>Amid all the controversy over where the coronavirus comes from (don’t you dare call it the “Chinese Virus,” a la “Spanish Flu,” that would be racist, and to be racist is worse than the virus itself) and what should be done about it, a Muslim cleric in Syracuse, NY., has found the key; thousands of people are being infected, many are dying, and America is teetering on the edge of economic collapse because American women are showing too much ankle.</ins></p><p><ins>Don’t laugh. Laughing would be “Islamophobic,” and Khadar Bin Muhammad, the imam of the Masjid Bilal Ibn Rabah in Syracuse, is not making a joke. <a href="https://www.memri.org/tv/ny-imam-khadar-muhammad-coronavirus-land-infidels-women-ankles-jews" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In a video Link: https://www.memri.org/tv/ny-imam-khadar-muhammad-coronavirus-land-infidels-women-ankles-jews </a> [below] posted on YouTube last week and reposted by the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI), the learned imam explains it all for us. Offering us a revelation that the Center for Disease Control and everyone else who is working on the coronavirus crisis have overlooked, the imam explained that “safety comes through tauhid,” that is, Islam’s concept of monotheism. So if you don’t want to contract the coronavirus, turn to Allah. Khadar Bin Muhammad says: “Every destruction and every harm comes through shirk” – that is, having other gods besides Allah – “and through worshipping other than Allah, believing in other than Allah, and thinking that [anything] other than Allah can harm you or have an effect on you. All harm comes through that. That is why you see the kuffar [infidels] are the scaredest people.”</ins></p><p><ins>The infidels aren’t just scared when they should be trusting in Allah. They are also the cause of all the trouble in the first place – specifically infidel women. According to Khadar Bin Muhammad, the coronavirus is a manifestation of Allah’s wrath against their outrageous immodesty. “How many women do we see,” he asked, “may Allah guide them and protect them, who walk around and show their ankles? Is this not part of her awra [private parts]?”</ins></p><p><ins>Yes, that’s right. Khadar Bin Muhammad said that women’s ankles were part of her private parts. As strange as it may seem, this is not an eccentric view in Islam. A hadith depicts Muhammad saying to a woman, “‘O Asma’, when a woman reaches the age of menstruation, it does not suit her that she displays her parts of body except this and this,’ and he pointed to her face and hands” (Sunan Abu Dawud 4092).</ins></p><p><ins>Many Muslims believe that by saying this, Muhammad proclaimed every part of a woman except her face and hands to be her private parts, never to be seen in public.</ins></p><p><ins>There is much more.

Trump was merely pointing out—quite correctly—that since the federal government has now taken the unprecedented and justifiable action of completely shutting down the American economy, to the tune of millions of lost jobs and the greatest quarterly economic decline in recorded history, we must also have a plan to end this situation.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The economy cannot remain shuttered indefinitely; the federal government cannot engage in endless cash expenditures on the basis of treasuries nobody is buying. Nor is the economy merely Wall Street. The vast majority of those who will lose their jobs are not day traders but workers. Small companies are more likely to go under than large ones.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The economy isn’t an abstraction. It’s the real lives of hundreds of millions of American citizens, and costs to those Americans must be weighed in the balance.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>That’s not controversial. That’s a simple fact. Public policy is the craft of weighing risks and rewards, and policymakers do it every day. It’s just that this time, the stakes are the highest they have ever been.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>So, when do we reopen, and how?</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The biggest problem is that we lack the data to answer the question.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>How many lives will be lost if we take heavy social measures after how many weeks? Moderate social measures? What will be the concomitant economic gain or loss? How many additional ICU beds and ventilators will we need to make available in order to clear the flattened curve such that we do not experience excess deaths due to lack of equipment, a la Italy?</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Our goal should be to move from the Chinese model—total lockdown—to the South Korean model—heavy testing, contact investigations, and social distancing. In order to accomplish that, we need to flatten the curve and stop the spread, allowing us to reset. How long will that take?</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>We’re not going to have answers until some time passes—until we test more, until the outcomes of cases are made certain. But we can certainly construct the formulas that should allow us to calculate possible outcomes as new data comes in, and that should allow us to collectively commit to actions directed at certain outcomes.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>We require a formula from the government. That’s the transparency the markets need, that the American people need. And that, at least, should be attainable over the next two weeks.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>COPYRIGHT 2020 CREATORS.COM</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>COMMENTARY BY</ins></p><ins> </ins><h4 class="byline"><ins><a class="author-name" href="https://www.dailysignal.com/author/ben-shapiro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ben Shapiro Link: https://www.dailysignal.com/author/ben-shapiro/ </a></ins></h4><ins> </ins><p class="bio-text"><ins>Ben Shapiro is host of “The Ben Shapiro Show” and editor-in-chief of DailyWire.com.

Hopefully, we will learn from this episode and make changes to address future epidemics, and believe me, this will not be the end of it as the media has discovered such disasters are bigger business than mere politics. What can we expect though from this episode and what awaits us in the months ahead?</ins></p><p><ins>First, this will be on everyone’s mind as we head to the voting booths in November. As of now, President Trump has been getting favorable poll ratings for his handling of the problem, so this shouldn’t effect him in a negative way. However, the key will be to see how the economy bounces back. It will undoubtedly take a dip in the Spring, but when the panic is over and life begins to return to normal, will another bull market emerge? If not, this could present a serious problem for the Republicans. As of now, the American public doesn’t blame President Trump for the declining stock markets, but when this is over, they will want to see it come roaring back.</ins></p><p><ins>Now that stocks are down, shrewd investors will be picking up some bargain stocks and making a killing. Transportations may be slow to rebound, but others should come back faster, such as electronics and food related companies. One of the biggest surprises during the panic was our attachment to paper products. Who would have thought toilet paper, paper towels, and tissues would be so much in demand? Companies such as Scott Paper, Kimberly-Clark, and Procter &amp; Gamble should be sitting pretty following the panic.</ins></p><p><ins>Likewise, pharmacies have taken a noticeable upturn and will continue to grow.</ins></p><p><ins>Supply chains will need to be re-evaluated and improved in order to prevent another product shortage in the future. Freight truck sales are booming and will continue to do so to help in this regard. Freight trains should also do well.</ins></p><p><ins>People have learned the need for maintaining emergency supplies on hand. Look for increased sales in refrigerators and freezers to accommodate this. Shelving, storage and security items should also do well.</ins></p><p><ins>The service industry should prosper substantially; “Sit down” restaurants will eventually recover but there will be an explosion in “To Go” ordering, something people have become used to during the panic and has altered our eating habits. Look for a revolution in home delivery. Walmart, Amazon, and the major Supermarkets have been moving in this direction for a long time, but the panic clearly demonstrated its viability.</ins></p><p><ins>The tobacco industry will take a hit as we were once again reminded of the ill-effects of tobacco. Not surprising, liquor sales held strong as people got together in impromptu groups and enjoyed libations to pass the time of day.</ins></p><p><ins>As much as we hate the politically correct expression, “Social Distancing,” it will become a part of life from now on as it has become a habit. There will be fewer handshakes and hugs, people will keep their distance, and there will still be fewer group activities, including nonprofits and church meetings. Also watch for surgical masks to become more commonplace, as well as the re-introduction of gloves at group events.</ins></p><p><ins>Perhaps the most noticeable coming attraction will be a baby boom in December. As people went into hibernation during the panic, as requested by government, they had to find ways to entertain themselves. Hence, we are on the verge of a major baby boom, the likes of which will make the old New York blackouts seem pale by comparison. Inevitably, even more paper products will be needed to accommodate the influx of infants.</ins></p><p><ins>Should there be another virus like this, it is hoped we will be better prepared. Personally, I would like to see someone take the news media to task, but this will likely never happen. And I certainly hope a panic such as this never happens again during an election year. This was too much of a coincidence for my liking.</ins></p><p><ins>By the way, Rod Serling couldn’t have written a better script than what the coronavirus politicians and media did.</ins></p><p><ins>Keep the Faith!</ins></p><p><ins>P.S. – Also, I have a NEW book, <a href="http://www.phmainstreet.com/mba/government.htm" target="index" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Before You Vote: Know How Your Government Works” Link: http://www.phmainstreet.com/mba/government.htm </a>, What American youth should know about government, available in Printed, PDF and eBook form.

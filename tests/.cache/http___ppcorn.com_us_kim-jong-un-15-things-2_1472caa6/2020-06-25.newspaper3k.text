Check out eight more fascinating facts about the supreme leader and public figure that you definitely (probably) did not know below. You might be surprised by what you find out!

Number Eight: He Killed His Uncle. You might be familiar with Jong-un’s insane antics, but did you know he killed his uncle? Jong-un’s uncle confessed to several crimes against the state, such as accepting medical care in a foreign country and spending foreign money in a foreign country, so Jong-un ordered him to be executed by firing squad.

Number Seven: He Is the Sexiest Man Alive. Well, not really. After the satirical publication The Onion printed a piece calling him the sexiest man alive, news outlets all over China ran the story without realizing that it was meant to be satire.

Number Six: He Is Afraid of Barbers. We’re not sure if it’s because he’s afraid of sharp objects near his head or he’s just too picky about his coif, but Jong-un is so afraid of barbers that he cuts his own hair. That explains a lot.

Number Three: He Had Plastic Surgery to Resemble His Grandfather. According to leaks from Chinese diplomats, Jong-un underwent surgery so he would more resemble his grandfather Kim Il-sung.

Number Two: He Is Very Passionate About Cheese. Jong-un reportedly imports Emmental cheese to satisfy his enormous cravings. He reportedly spends thousands of pounds every year to import the cheese to North Korea.

Number One: He Founded North Korea’s First All-Female Band. It’s true! Jong-un handpicked female singers to make North Korea’s very first all-girl group. The group is called the Moranbong Band, and they sing about how great North Korea is, because of course.

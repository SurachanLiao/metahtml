Twenty Indian soldiers died, some pushed over a cliff into a freezing river in the highest-casualty battle between the Asian giants in decades.</ins></p><p><ins>Among the issues surely raised with Pompeo by the Chinese is the growing bipartisan vilification of China and its ruling Communist Party by U.S. politicians the closer we come to November.</ins></p><p><ins>The U.S. has been putting China in the dock for concealing information on the coronavirus virus until it had spread, lying about it, and then letting Wuhan residents travel to the outside world while quarantining them inside China.</ins></p><p><ins>In America, it has become good politics to be tough on China.</ins></p><p><ins>The reasons are many.</ins></p><p><ins>High among them are the huge trade deficits with China that led to an historic deindustrialization of America, China’s emergence as the world’s first industrial power, and a U.S. dependency on Chinese imports for the vital necessities of our national life.</ins></p><p><ins>Then there is the systematic theft of intellectual property from U.S. companies in China and Beijing’s deployment of thousands of student-spies into U.S. colleges and universities to steal security secrets.</ins></p><p><ins>Then there is the suppression of Christianity, the denial of rights to the people of Tibet and the discovery of an archipelago of concentration camps in western China to “reeducate” Muslim Uighurs and Kazakhs to turn them into more loyal and obedient subjects.</ins></p><p><ins>Among the strategic concerns of Pompeo: China’s fortification of islets, rocks and reefs in the South China Sea and use of its warships to drive Vietnamese, Malaysian, Indonesian and Philippine fishing vessels out of their own territorial waters that China now claims.</ins></p><p><ins>Another worry for Pompeo: China’s buildup of medium- and intermediate-range ballistic missiles, a nuclear arsenal not contained or covered by the Cold War arms agreements between Russia and the United States.</ins></p><p><ins>Then there were those provocative voyages by a Chinese aircraft carrier through the Taiwan Strait to intimidate Taipei and show Beijing’s hostility toward the recently reelected pro-U.S. government on the island.</ins></p><p><ins>Finally, there are China’s growing restrictions on the freedoms the people of Hong Kong have enjoyed under the Basic Law negotiated with the United Kingdom when the territory was ceded back to Beijing in 1997.</ins></p><p><ins>Also on the menu at Hickam was almost surely the new bellicosity out of Pyongyang. This week, the building in Kaesong, just inside North Korea, where bilateral peace talks have been held between the two Koreas, was blown up by the North. With the explosion came threats from the North to send combat troops back into positions they had vacated along the DMZ.</ins></p><p><ins>The rhetoric out of the North against South Korean President Moon Jae-in, coming from the 32-year-old sister of North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, the rising star of the regime, Kim Yo Jong, has been scalding.</ins></p><p><ins>In a statement this week, Kim Yo Jong derided Moon as a flunky of the Americans: “It is our fixed judgment that it is no longer possible to discuss the North-South ties with such a servile partner engaging only in disgrace and self-ruin, being soaked by deep-rooted flunkyism.”</ins></p><p><ins>North Korea’s state media published photos of the destruction of the joint liaison office. Pyongyang is shutting off communications with Seoul, and a frustrated South looks to be ginning up and reciprocating.</ins></p><p><ins>The North-South detente appears dead, and President Trump’s special relationship with Kim Jong Un may not be far behind.</ins></p><p><ins>There are rumors of a renewal of nuclear weapons and long-range missile tests by the North, suspension of which was one of the diplomatic achievements of Trump.</ins></p><p><ins>Whether Trump’s cherished trade deal with China can survive the growing iciness between the two nations remains to be seen.</ins></p><p><ins>What the Chinese seem to be saying with their actions — against India, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Taiwan, Australia, Hong Kong and Japan — is this: Your American friends and allies are yesterday. We are tomorrow. The future of Asia belongs to us. Deal with it!</ins></p><p><ins>No one should want a hot war, or a new cold war, with China or North Korea.</ins></p><p><ins>But if Trump was relying on his special relationships with Kim Jong Un and Xi Jinping, his trade deal with China and his commitment by Kim to give up nuclear weapons for recognition, trade and aid, he will have to think again.</ins></p><p><ins>For the foreseeable future, Communist bellicosity out of Beijing and Pyongyang seem in the cards, if not worse.[2]</ins></p></blockquote><p><ins>As I have written:</ins></p><blockquote><p><ins>China launched the Coronavirus, intentionally (as a bioweapon) or inadvertently; and many would argue that it must pay reparations or restitution to the world for having done so, which would likely run into trillions of dollars.</ins></p><p><ins>Also, a global boycott of anything and everything from China may ensue, as Americans and their counterparts abroad “vote” with their pocketbooks against the suffering that China unleashed.[3]</ins></p></blockquote><p><ins>Second, the only thing that China and North Korea respect is power.  Donald Trump has provided the leadership vis-à-vis both countries that they have not witnessed in decades.  Now is the time to turn the screws even tighter, not to lessen them.  And American and global consumers must be galvanized to boycott China’s exports.</ins></p><p><ins>© 2020, Timothy D.

Most foreign policy analysts predict it will be a missile test more impressive than any Pyongyang has yet carried off.</ins></p><p><ins>What is Kim’s game? What does Kim want?</ins></p><p><ins>He cannot want war with the United States, as this could result in the annihilation of the Kim family dynasty that has ruled North Korea since World War II. Kim is all about self-preservation.</ins></p><p><ins>What he appears to want in his confrontation with Trump is a victory without war. In the near-term, Kim seeks three things: recognition of his regime as the legitimate government of North Korea and its acceptance in all the forums of the world, trade and an end to all U.S. and U.N. sanctions, and a nuclear arsenal sufficient to deter a U.S. attack, including missiles that can strike U.S. bases in South Korea, Japan, Guam, and the Western Pacific. And he seeks the capability to deliver a nuclear warhead on the U.S. mainland.</ins></p><p><ins>Nor is this last goal unreasonable from Kim’s vantage point.</ins></p><p><ins>For he knows what became of the two other nations of George W. Bush’s “axis of evil” that failed to develop nuclear weapons.</ins></p><p><ins>Saddam Hussein’s Iraq was invaded, and he was hanged and his sons hunted down and killed.</ins></p><p><ins>The Ayatollah’s Iran negotiated a 2015 nuclear deal with America and opened up its nuclear facilities to intrusive inspections to show that Tehran did not have a nuclear weapons program.</ins></p><p><ins>Trump came to power, trashed the deal, reimposed sanctions and is choking Iran to death.</ins></p><p><ins>Moammar Gadhafi surrendered his WMD in 2004 and opened up his production facilities. And in 2011, the U.S. attacked Libya and Gadhafi was lynched by a mob.</ins></p><p><ins>Contrast the fate of these regimes and rulers with the Kim family’s success. His father, Kim Jong Il, tested nuclear weapons and missiles in defiance of U.S. warnings, and now the son is invited to summits with the U.S. president in Singapore and Hanoi.</ins></p><p><ins>If Kim did not have nuclear weapons, would American presidents be courting him? Would U.S. secretaries of state be visiting Pyongyang? If Kim did not have nuclear weapons who would pay the least attention to the Hermit Kingdom?</ins></p><p><ins>Undeniably, with his promised “Christmas gift,” possibly a missile capable of hitting the U.S., Kim is pushing the envelope. He is taunting the Americans. We have told him what he must do. And he is telling us where we can go.</ins></p><p><ins>But by so doing, Kim has put the ball squarely in Trump’s court.</ins></p><p><ins>The question Trump faces: Is he prepared to accept North Korea joining Russia and China as a third adversarial power with the ability to launch a nuclear strike on the continental United States?</ins></p><p><ins>And if U.S. sanctions are insufficient to force Kim to “denuclearize,” as seems apparent, is Trump prepared to force him to do so? Is Trump prepared to use “fire and fury” to remove Kim’s nukes?</ins></p><p><ins>With 28,500 U.S. troops and thousands of U.S. citizens in South Korea, many within artillery range of the DMZ, is Trump prepared to risk a clash that could ignite a second Korean War in the election year 2020?</ins></p><p><ins>Is the president prepared for whatever that might bring?</ins></p><p><ins>How does this confrontation play out?</ins></p><p><ins>A guess: The U.S. has lived with North Korea’s nuclear weapons for a decade, and Trump is not going to risk a second Korean conflict with a military attack on Kim’s nuclear and missile arsenals. Kim Jong Un and his father have created a new reality in Korea, and we are going to have to live with it.</ins></p><p><ins>Where does East Asia go from here?</ins></p><p><ins>South Korea has twice the population of the North and an economy 40 times as large. Japan has a population five times that of North Korea and an economy 100 times as large.</ins></p><p><ins>If the U.S. treaty guarantees, dating to the 1950s, to fight for these two nations come into question as a result of America’s reluctance to face down Pyongyang more forcibly on its nuclear arsenal, these nations are almost certain to start considering all options for their future security.</ins></p><p><ins>Among these are building their own nuclear arsenals and closer ties to the one nation that has shown it can discipline North Korea — China.</ins></p><p><ins>Much is on the line here.</ins></p><p><ins>Kim’s challenge is ultimately about the credibility of the United States, which has treaty commitments and issued war guarantees to scores of nations in NATO Europe, the Mideast and East Asia, but whose people have zero interest in any new war, especially a second Korean War.</ins></p><p><ins>If the world sees that America is reluctant to face down, or fight a North Korea that is threatening us, will they retain the old confidence that the United States will risk war for them?</ins></p><p><ins>What Kim is undermining is not just U.S. security but U.S. credibility.<span>[2] </span></ins></p></blockquote><p><ins><span>Buchanan has neglected to mention several vital issues.</span></ins></p><p><ins>First, President Trump essentially guaranteed Kim Jong-un and North Korea a bright future if it joined the “family of nations” and did not expand its nuclear arsenal.  In other words, Kim might “have his cake and eat it too.”  </ins></p><p><ins>Second, there is no question that the totally-despicable congressional Democrats have harmed America’s standing around the globe by pursuing their goal of impeaching the President.  This was initiated and set in motion by the un-American racist and anti-Semite Barack Obama, who must be prosecuted for treason and his other crimes, and imprisoned at the very least.  Otherwise, no American should ever believe in our system of justice again.[3]</ins></p><p><ins>Third, China and Russia are pursuing policies that are at odds with those of the United States, and playing their Kim Jong-un/North Korean cards in the process, with the aim of producing a united front at a time of perceived weakness on the part of our President because of the impeachment efforts.  With the President’s reelection next year and/or the end of the impeachment “sham,” all three nations may be much more willing to cut deals with the United States, which are in our best interests. </ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>© 2019, Timothy D.

Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren, and Mayor Pete Buttigieg — are running even with Trump, a measurable drop. A Washington Post-ABC poll just found Trump at 47% approval, a new high for his presidency.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Apparently, the more the nation sees of the alternatives to Trump the Democrats have on offer, the better The Donald looks. For Democrats, this is not good, not good at all.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>For while Trump has run a daily gauntlet of dreadful media for two years, these Democrats have had only one debate and a few weeks of close coverage.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Between now and the New Hampshire primary, they will be going after one another and receiving a far more thorough vetting by a media in constant search of failings and flaws, especially of front-runners.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Traditionally, all candidates suffer attrition as the primaries come closer. For it is then that their lagging rivals become more desperate in their attacks and the media coverage becomes more intense.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Other problems have now arisen for the Democrats because of the issues that have come to the fore: race, radicalism and the border.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>None looks like a winning Democratic issue in November 2020.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The race issue surfaced in the debate when Biden was called out by Harris for his professed friendships with segregationist senators like Herman Talmadge and James O. Eastland, and for Joe’s impassioned public resistance to the court-ordered bussing of black and white children for racial balance in the public schools of the 1970s.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Harris defended bussing as a necessary remedy to segregation and added that, as a “little girl,” she had been a beneficiary.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>If your friends like Eastland had their way, said Harris, I would not be here in the Senate. For days, the issue dogged Biden, who, last weekend, apologized for any “hurt” he caused.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Biden seems to have recovered most of the ground lost from Harris’ attack. But that this racially charged issue threw him on the defensive for weeks assures it will be raised again by opponents to trip up the front-runner.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Another issue certain to come up in future debates, and in the South Carolina primary where 61% of the Democratic vote is African American, is reparations for slavery.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Several candidates have already endorsed a commission to study reparations, and Biden and every other candidate will have to take a stand.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Yet, recent polls show that Americans, by 2-1, are opposed to paying reparations for a system of slavery that was abolished 150 years ago.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Bottom line: If the 2020 campaign becomes a conversation about reparations for slavery and the bussing of white kids from the suburbs into inner-city schools to achieve greater integration, the Democrats will be in a world of hurt.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>On border security, indispensable to Trump in 2016, Democrats in the debates came out for ending criminal detention of people invading our country and for providing free health care for migrants who successfully break into the USA.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Detesting ICE as they do, and supporting sanctuary cities, left-wing Democrats routinely describe the Border Patrol as neo-fascists who run “concentration camps” where migrant children are forced to drink toilet water. The Democrats are becoming an open borders party.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>What is their solution to the hundreds of thousands of migrants who annually arrive at our borders? Foreign aid. They want to create a Marshall Plan for Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador so refugees will stay home rather than come to the USA for the health care Democrats will provide at taxpayer expense.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Among other ideas advocated by leading Democratic candidates:</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Free college for all, cancellation of all student loan debt, Medicare for All, an end to private health insurance and the companies that provide it, the abolition of the Electoral College, expansion of the Supreme Court to 15 justices, the abolition of ICE, a phase-out all fossil fuels for a carbon neutral country, and repeal of all Trump tax cuts.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>What is causing the moderate Democrats to adopt what they used to regard as radical positions? The party base, which votes in primaries and is further left than it has ever been.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Also pulling the party leftward is Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and her sisters in Congress who receive extensive and indulgent media coverage and have a powerful following among millennials.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>What the Democratic Party is risking today — and what many of its leaders recognize — is that it will be pulled so far outside the mainstream of American politics in the nomination battle, that its nominee will not be able to make it back close enough to the center to win.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>If the Democratic Party, as its alternative to Trump, decides to run on this radical new agenda, America will punish that hubris with a second term for Trump.<span>[2]</span></ins></p></blockquote><ins> </ins><p><ins>It is likely that the Biden candidacy will collapse for a myriad of reasons, not the least of which he is prone to gaffes and mistakes that are seemingly unforgivable.  He may be shown to be an utter buffoon, sooner rather than later; and the fact that his son Hunter has been embroiled in scandals, linked to his father, may only compound his problems.[3]</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Bernie Sanders is authentic, albeit a true socialist not unlike Karl Marx; and his only viable chance of getting the Democratic Party’s nomination may have died in 2016, at the hands of Hillary Clinton and her thugs.  Did Sanders deserve to be the party’s nominee?  Probably so, but he was robbed of it then, as history will attest.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Kamala Harris’ political career began as former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown’s ho.  And having been nurtured while “working” on her back, this may forever define her credentials as a candidate for higher offices.  The fact that California’s Leftist voters let her “skate” speaks volumes about what has happened in this once-great and proud State.[4]</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Elizabeth “Pocahontas” Warren, who lied repeatedly about her native-American heritage, is going nowhere fast.[5]  Like the remainder of the pygmies and societal misfits who are running for their party’s nomination, they are likely to join the growing ranks of ignominity.[6]  And yes, lots of us began as Democrats, but will never vote for one again.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Pat Buchanan is correct that race, radicalism and “the border” are likely to be in the minds of Americans as they approach and vote in next year’s elections.  Crime, abortions and a plethora of other issues will affect their decisions too, but Buchanan may be correct when he concluded:</ins></p><ins> </ins><blockquote><p><ins>What the Democratic Party is risking today — and what many of its leaders recognize — is that it will be pulled so far outside the mainstream of American politics in the nomination battle, that its nominee will not be able to make it back close enough to the center to win.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>If the Democratic Party, as its alternative to Trump, decides to run on this radical new agenda, America will punish that hubris with a second term for Trump.[7]</ins></p></blockquote><ins> </ins><p><ins>The Left’s efforts to radicalize America must be stopped in their tracks.  Our borders must be closed tight, except to those who come here legally[8]. Sanctuary cities and other lawlessness must be eradicated.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Those who are in our great country illegally must be rooted out and deported summarily.  Violent groups like Antifa must be designated as terrorist groups, and dealt with harshly.  Eco-Nazis must be repudiated; and the hoax of man-made “global warming” must be exposed for what it is.[9]</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Abortions must be treated as Infanticide, with criminal consequences ensuing for all involved.  Our Electoral College must be respected and adhered to, not cheapened or discarded.  All student loan debt must be paid back, not forgiven.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Radical judges who seek to legislate from the bench must be removed, and replaced with those who will follow the law, not discard it. Those who sought to destroy the candidacy or the presidency of Donald Trump must be prosecuted and imprisoned for treason, at the very least.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>And the list goes on and on.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>. . .</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Lastly, will Bill Clinton’s flights on Jeffrey Epstein’s “Lolita Express” jet—allegedly 26 times, involving the sexual trafficking of young girls—affect the Democratic Party’s election chances?[10]</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>© 2019, Timothy D.

Naegele Link: http://www.naegele.com/attorneys.html#tdn </a><a href="#_edn1">[1] Link: #_edn1 </a></ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>I have been outspoken in my condemnation of Russia’s venomous Vladimir Putin.  Perhaps my article about him on November 29, 2015—entitled “The Death Of Putin And Russia: The Final Chapter Of The Cold War”—summed up my beliefs and yes, hopes, the best:</ins></p><ins> </ins><blockquote><p><ins>The death of Russia’s brutal dictator-for-life Vladimir Putin, and the end of Russia, will comprise the final chapter of the Cold War—which began at the end of World War II, and lasted more than 70 years.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>. . .</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>It is estimated that the Soviet Union’s Joseph Stalin was responsible for the deaths of more than 30 million men, women and children—his own countrymen—including millions during the collectivization of the Soviet farms in the 1930s. As the Soviets moved through Germany and captured Berlin at the end of World War II, they raped at least two million German women in what is now acknowledged as the largest case of mass rape in history.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>. . .</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Putin is a killer, and Stalin’s heir.  After World War II, he came to prominence as a KGB operative in East Germany—or the DDR, as it was known before the collapse of Erich Honecker’s government—which was one of the most repressive regimes in the Soviet Union’s orbit, or the Evil Empire. Following the USSR’s implosion, Putin and his thugs and cronies hijacked Russia’s incipient democracy, and have been exploiting it ever since.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>. . .</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Russia is crippled as a result of our economic sanctions and the fall of oil prices. By ratcheting up the sanctions even more—such as unilaterally denying Russia access to the SWIFT banking system—Putin and Russia will be in free fall, and in a death spiral from which they will not recover. . . .</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Russia is weaker today than the former USSR before it collapsed. It spans nine time zones and includes 160 ethnic groups that speak an estimated 100 languages. It is by no means monolithic, and may crumble “overnight.” Once Putin is gone, Russia may be dismembered—never to rise again—with China taking part (e.g., Siberia, which it covets) and the rest becoming independent states like the former Yugoslavia.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Each of the new states will act in its own best interests, just as has been true in the former Yugoslavia, and among the countries that were spun off from the USSR—which have thrived as part of the West. Putinism will not survive Putin. It will suffer an ignominious death, like its namesake; and constitute a tragic watershed in history, like Adolf Hitler’s “Thousand Year Reich” and Nazism.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Let the celebrations begin. The end is near . . .</ins></p></blockquote><ins> </ins><p><ins>As if to add emphasis to my feelings about Putin, the photo at the end of the article was of a corpse.[2]</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Yet, Pat Buchanan—an adviser to Presidents Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford, and a former GOP presidential aspirant himself—has written in an article entitled “Is Putin Right? Has Liberalism Lost the World?”:</ins></p><ins> </ins><blockquote><p><ins>“The liberal idea has become obsolete. … (Liberals) cannot simply dictate anything to anyone as they have been attempting to do over the recent decades.”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Such was the confident claim of Vladimir Putin to the Financial Times on the eve of a G-20 gathering that appeared to validate his thesis.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Consider who commanded all the attention at the Osaka summit.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The main event was Trump’s meeting with China’s Xi Jinping and their agreement to renew trade talks. Xi runs an archipelago of detention camps where China’s Uighur Muslims and its Kazakh minority have their minds coercively “corrected.”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>A major media focus at the summit was Trump’s meeting with Putin where he playfully admonished the Russian president not to meddle again in our 2020 election. The two joked about how both are afflicted with a media that generates constant fake news.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>At the G-20 class picture, Trump was seen smiling and shaking hands with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, whom U.S. intelligence says ordered the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Trump called the prince “a friend” who has done a “spectacular job.”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Trump then left for Seoul, traveled to the DMZ, and crossed into North Korea to shake hands with Kim Jong Un, who runs a police state unrivaled for its repression.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Negotiations on Kim’s nuclear weapons may be back on track.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Among other G-20 leaders present were Hindu nationalist Narendra Modi of India and President Recep Erdogan of Turkey, who has imprisoned tens of thousands following a coup attempt in July 2016.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>In his interview with the FT’s Lionel Barber, Putin appeared as much an analyst of, as an advocate for, the nationalism and populism that seems to be succeeding the 20th-century liberalism of the West.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Why is liberalism failing? Several causes, said Putin. Among them, its failure to deal with the crisis of the age: mass and unchecked illegal migration. Putin praised Trump’s efforts to secure the U.S. border:</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>“This liberal idea has become obsolete. It has come into conflict with the interests of the overwhelming majority of the population. … This liberal idea presupposes that … migrants can kill, plunder and rape with impunity because their rights as migrants have to be protected.”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Putin deplored Chancellor Angela Merkel’s 2015 decision to bring into Germany a million refugees from Syria’s civil war.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>His comments came as 10 Democratic candidates in the second presidential primary debate were raising their hands in support of the proposition that breaking into the USA should cease to be a crime and those who succeed in breaking in should be given free health care.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Putin also sees the social excesses of multiculturalism and secularism in the West as representing a failure of liberalism.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>In a week where huge crowds celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall “uprising” in Greenwich Village, as it is now called, with parties and parades, Putin declared:</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>“Have we forgotten that all of us live in a world based on biblical values? … I am not trying to insult anyone because we have been condemned for our alleged homophobia. But we have no problem with LGBT persons. God forbid, let them live as they wish.”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>He added, “But some things do appear excessive to us. They claim now that children can play five or six gender roles.”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Elton John pronounced himself “deeply upset.”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Putin did not back off: “Let everyone be happy … But this must not be allowed to overshadow the culture, traditions and traditional family values of millions of people making up the core population.”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Putin took power, two decades ago, as this 21st century began. In recent years, he has advanced himself not only as a foe of liberalism but a champion of populism, traditionalism and nationalism.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Nor is he hesitant to declare his views regarding U.S. politics.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Of Trump, Putin says, “He is a talented person (who) knows very well what his voters expect of him. … Trump looked into his opponent’s attitude toward him and saw changes in American society.”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Recalling his own controversial comment that the collapse of the Soviet Union was the greatest tragedy of the 20th century, Putin said the tragedy was not the death of Communism but the shattering of the Russian Federation into 15 separate nations.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The tragedy was the “dispersal of ethnic Russians” across the newly independent successor states of the Soviet Union: “25 million ethnic Russians found themselves living outside the Russian Federation. … Is this not a tragedy? A huge one! And family relations? Jobs? Travel? It was nothing but a disaster.”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>What may be said of Putin?</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>He is no Stalin, no Communist ideologue, but rather a Russian nationalist who seeks the return of her lost peoples to the Motherland, and, seeing his country as a great power, wants NATO out of his front yard.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>While we have issues with him on arms control, Iran and Venezuela, we have a common interest in avoiding a war with this nuclear-armed nation as we did with the far more menacing Soviet Empire of the Cold War.[3]</ins></p></blockquote><ins> </ins><p><ins>I have not changed my opinion of Putin, but believe that Liberalism and its counterparts in the far-Left beliefs and actions of the United States are an equal threat to America’s future.  Whether it be the violent Antifa groups, who seek to silence dissent[4], or their counterparts in the Democratic Party, today’s radical Leftists are threats to America’s democracy, to its history and heritage, and to all that most Americans hold dear and cherish.  And yes, lots of us began as Democrats, but will never vote for one again.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Perhaps the traitorous, racist, anti-Semite Barack Obama fractured the American fabric more than any single person in our history.  He grew up in Hawaii and Indonesia, and never lived on the U.S. mainland until he attended Occidental College in Los Angeles.  A window into his “soul” is best understood by reading his book, “Dreams from My Father,” which is shocking.  Indeed, the book was summarized—with direct quotes and page cites—in the first article that was published in this blog.[5]</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Many Americans believe that he should be in prison today—at the very least—for trying to destroy the Trump candidacy and then the Trump presidency.[6]  Perhaps the most vivid example of Liberalism in America today can be summed up in the following facts:</ins></p><ins> </ins><blockquote><p><ins>Roe v. Wade unleashed a holocaust of epic proportions, which ranks with the greatest holocausts in human history—including the Nazi Holocaust, Stalin’s Soviet Holocaust and Mao’s Chinese Holocaust.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Indeed, more human beings have been killed as a result of abortions—since the U.S. Supreme Court handed down its decision in 1973—than in each of the other three holocausts.[7]</ins></p></blockquote><ins> </ins><p><ins>This is the gift of death that Liberals and the far-Left keep giving to Americans each and every day.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>© 2019, Timothy D.

Lincoln didn’t respond, appeal, or order the release of Merryman. But during a July 4 speech, Lincoln was defiant, insisting that he needed to suspend the rules in order to put down the rebellion in the South.[2]</ins></p><ins> </ins></blockquote><ins> </ins><p><ins>We may be approaching a series of crises in which President Donald Trump will have to act boldly and defiantly, and adopt harsh measures similar to those of Lincoln.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>President Trump was elected by the American people.  There are a myriad of persuasive arguments why his opponent, Hillary Clinton, should be indicted, convicted and imprisoned for the rest of her life.[3]  Yet, the drumbeat among Democrats, so-called “progressives” and the far-Left is to destroy the Trump presidency before it has begun.[4]</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Many Americans felt just as strongly about the black racist Barack Obama[5], but they did not try to destroy his presidency or advocate his assassination as many in the anti-Trump camp have.  Their seditious, subversive and treasonous conduct strongly suggests that they pose a danger to our system of government. They should be arrested, tried, convicted and imprisoned.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Pat Buchanan—an adviser to Presidents Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford, and a former GOP presidential aspirant himself—has written:</ins></p><ins> </ins><blockquote><p><ins>Trump is hated by [Washington, D.C.], which gave him 4 percent of its votes, as much as Nixon was. And the deep-state determination to bring him down is as great as it was with Nixon. By 1968, the liberal establishment had lost the mandate it had held since 1933, but not lost its ability to wound and kill [Republican] presidents. Though Nixon won 49 states, that establishment took him down. Though Ronald Reagan won 49 states, that establishment almost took him down in the Iran-Contra affair. And that is the end they have in mind for President Trump.[6]</ins></p><ins> </ins></blockquote><ins> </ins><p><ins>The United States and the American people are facing threats to our existence, which are unprecedented in our history, far surpassing 9/11 and Pearl Harbor.[7]  We cannot permit the seditious, subversive and treasonous conduct of some to pose a danger to our system of government and way of life.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>© 2017, Timothy D.

Naegele</a><a href="#_edn1">[1]</a></p> <p>A series of events has been unfolding for some months now, which may culminate in another shooting war on the Korean peninsula that might prove devastating.  North Korea has warned that a war with South Korea would go nuclear<a href="#_edn1">[2]</a>; and the ramifications are enormous.  In discussing this potential tragedy of epic proportions, it is useful to review recent events that have brought us to the present state of affairs:</p> <ul><li>The Sinking Of A South Korean Navy Vessel In March Of 2010—The facts were unknown when it happened, except that an explosion took place aboard the ship, and efforts were underway to save as many of the crew members as possible.  Whether this would turn into an international incident, testing the South Koreans and President Barack Obama, remained to be seen.<a href="#_edn1">[3]</a> However, the Wall Street Journal noted:</li> </ul> <blockquote><p>The possibility of a violent, potentially apocalyptic regime collapse in North Korea within the decade is one that all countries with an interest in the region should keep in mind.<a href="#_edn1">[4]</a></p> </blockquote> <p>The Journal added:</p> <blockquote><p>The latest incident comes days after a conference in which some experts described the Kim dictatorship as being in the first stage of collapse.  Americans should be paying attention: If North Korea decides to go out in a blaze of nuclear glory—and its current penchant for kamikaze rhetoric suggests it might—the enormous number of casualties would likely include many of the U.S. troops stationed on the peninsula.<a href="#_edn1">[5]</a></p> </blockquote> <ul><li>South Korean Ship Was Hit By North Korean Torpedo—Among other publications, the London Times reported that North Korea had launched one of the worst military acts of provocation since the Korean War, killing 46 South Korean sailors, which had amounted to a deliberate and unprovoked attack by North Korea.<a href="#_edn1">[6]</a></li> </ul> <ul><li>Finally, In May Of 2010, South Korea Blamed North Korea For Launching The Torpedo At Its Warship, Causing The Explosion That Killed 46 Sailors<a href="#_edn1">[7]</a>—The Wall Street Journal reported that South Korea had convincing evidence.<a href="#_edn1">[8]</a></li> </ul> <ul><li>There Is Reason To Believe That North Korea’s Dictator Kim Ordered The Sinking Of The Cheonan, To Help Secure The Succession Of His Son—The New York Times reported that an American intelligence analysis of the deadly torpedo attack on the South Korean warship concluded that Kim Jong Il, the ailing leader of North Korea, must have authorized the torpedo assault.<a href="#_edn1">[9]</a></li> </ul> <ul><li>China Shields North Korea—Bloomberg News reported that Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao was likely to resist pressure to acknowledge that North Korea had torpedoed the South Korean warship.<a href="#_edn1">[10]</a></li> </ul> <ul><li>North And South Korea On The Brink Of War, Russian Diplomat Warned.<a href="#_edn1">[11]</a></li> </ul> <ul><li>North Korea Fired At South Korea As It Prepared To Host G-20 Summit Of Wealthiest Nations.<a href="#_edn1">[12]</a></li> </ul> <ul><li>North Korea Fired On South Korean Island.<a href="#_edn1">[13]</a></li> </ul> <ul><li>China Warned U.S. About Joint U.S.-South Korean Military Exercise As Korea Tensions Rise<a href="#_edn1">[14]</a>—In turn, North Korea responded angrily to the maneuvers: “The situation on the Korean peninsula is inching closer to the brink of war.”</li> </ul> <ul><li>America’s Chairman Of The Joint Chiefs Of Staff, Admiral Mullen, Rebuked China For Failing To Curb North Korea.<a href="#_edn1">[15]</a></li> </ul> <ul><li>Firing Drill Increased Korea Tensions—South Korea test-fired artillery from the island that North Korea attacked, defying North Korean threats of another attack and asserting its rights in a maritime area it has controlled since the Korean War of the 1950s.<a href="#_edn1">[16]</a></li> </ul> <ul><li>North Korea Said It Would Not Strike Back—As the Wall Street Journal noted, North Korea stood pat after a South Korean artillery drill, easing fears of armed conflict and suggesting that the North Koreans might be using provocations to seek economic inducements.</li> </ul> <p>The Journal added:</p> <blockquote><p>Fighter jets patrolled the air and destroyers sailed in nearby waters ready to counter another North Korean attack.</p> <p>. . .</p> <p>[F]or decades Pyongyang’s power has been tied to its ability and willingness to surprise Seoul. Analysts say it is more likely to stage another provocation when the South’s guard goes down in the months ahead, depending on its need to further its broad goals of securing economic assistance and security guarantees for its authoritarian regime.</p> <p>For now, the episode appeared to take its place in a long series of provocations South Koreans have gotten used to.</p> <p>. . .</p> <p>Earlier in the day the North made another conciliatory gesture—announced by a visiting U.S. dignitary, New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, making an unofficial visit—to let the international nuclear inspectors it kicked out last year come back to the country.</p> <p>. . .</p> <p>For longtime North Korea watchers, Pyongyang’s official statement and offer to Mr. Richardson showed that it continued to operate in a familiar pattern: heating things up with provocative actions that draw attention, and then cooling them down with peace-making gestures in hopes of winning economic and security favors.<a href="#_edn1">[17]</a></p> </blockquote> <ul><li>WikiLeaks Cables Reveal China Ready To Abandon North Korea—The UK’s Guardian reported:</li> </ul> <blockquote><p>China has signalled its readiness to accept Korean reunification and is privately distancing itself from the North Korean regime, according to leaked US embassy cables that reveal senior Beijing figures regard their official ally as a “spoiled child”.<a href="#_edn1">[18]</a></p> </blockquote> <p>North Korea’s latest series of provocations might prove little more than that, even as deadly as they were.  However, miscalculations may take place, which could be catastrophic.  While America is tied down militarily in Iraq, and its forces are mired in the Afghan War, North Korea may feel emboldened to strike against South Korea and set the Korean peninsula ablaze.  Similarly, other trouble spots around the world may flare up, such as a war in the Middle East involving Israel and Iran or its surrogates.</p> <p>Given Barack Obama’s perceived weakness and naïveté, as well as global economic problems confronting the United States and other countries, its enemies may choose now or in the not-too-distant future as an opportune time to strike.  The use of nuclear weapons, or the ultimate EMP Attack<a href="#_edn1">[19]</a>, would send America and its allies reeling.  Let’s hope and pray it never happens.</p> <p>© 2010, Timothy D.

He hopes precipitating a crisis will lead the generals to rally behind his son and compel South Korea and the West to engage in dialogue on his terms.</p> <p>Kim Jong-un was made a four-star general and named vice-chairman of the country’s National Defence Commission in September—even though the Swiss-educated 27-year-old had no military experience. “The generals saw Kim Jong-un as a puppy who wasn’t even lavatory trained,” said Kongdan Oh Hassig, a North Korea expert, “not a credible leader. There was lots of fuming.”</p> <p>Bruce Bennett, another North Korea specialist, said the succession left generals “asking themselves how much longer they would have a role in government”. He noted that replacements of officials in North Korea “usually occur as the result of a purge or a ‘traffic accident,’ so that could be cause for some instability.”</p> <p>“Every time there’s been a succession in North Korea,” Dr. Hassig noted, “you’ve had trouble, because the leadership has needed to reassure the military.”</p> <p>Kim Jong-il ordered the bombing of a Korean Air plane in 1987, killing all 115, and an attack on officials which left 17 dead.</p> <p>Little noticed in the West, tensions with the military have often threatened North Korea’s ruling family. In 1991-1992, there were reports that a group of generals had been planning to assassinate Kim Il-sung, in order to implement a programme of radical modernisation. Later, in 1995, elements of North Korea’s VI corps in famine-hit North Hamgyong province almost revolted.</p> <p>“The Kims are playing the Crazed Fearsome Cripple Gambit,” a US military official told The Daily Telegraph, referring to a term coined by the strategic analyst George Friedman.</p> <p>North Korea’s regime, Mr Friedman argued, wilfully chose to be an economically-crippled state to make itself unattractive as a target for intervention. Then it sought to inspire fear by developing nuclear weapons.</p> <p>Finally, Mr Friedman argued, “having established that they were crippled and fearsome, the critical element was to establish their insanity”. Since no one would wish for a nuclear-armed North Korea to engage in a crazed military adventure, it would give the regime what it wanted.</p> <p>Both Koreas are now holding out threats of further fighting. North Korea’s official news agency warned on Saturday that the “situation on the Korean peninsula is inching closer to the brink of war”.</p> <p>Lieutenant General Yoo Nak Joon, commander of the South Korean Marine Corps, meanwhile, called on his troops to “put our feelings of rage and animosity in our bones and take our revenge on North Korea”.</p> </blockquote> <p>See <a title="Kim Jong-il 'laying the ground for succession' with military attacks" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/northkorea/8166343/Kim-Jong-il-laying-the-ground-for-succession-with-military-attacks.html" target="_blank">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/northkorea/8166343/Kim-Jong-il-laying-the-ground-for-succession-with-military-attacks.html</a></p> <p><a href="#_edn1">[10]</a> Specifically, Bloomberg reported:</p> <blockquote><p>Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao is likely to resist pressure to acknowledge that North Korea torpedoed a South Korean warship when he flies to Seoul tomorrow to meet South Korean President Lee Myung Bak and Japan’s Yukio Hatoyama.</p> <p>. . .</p> <p>China wants to avoid a conflict on the Korean peninsula, and is concerned that taking South Korea’s side may provoke North Korea into further escalations and even lead to war, said Shen Dingli, vice dean of the Institute of International Affairs at Shanghai’s Fudan University.</p> <p>“North Korea is dying, and we can make things worse,” Shen said. “We have assumed North Korea is not a rational actor.”</p> </blockquote> <p>See <a title="China May Shield North Korea as Lee, U.S. Seek Action" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-05-26/china-may-shield-north-korea-as-lee-clinton-seek-action-over-ship-sinking.html" target="_blank">http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-05-26/china-may-shield-north-korea-as-lee-clinton-seek-action-over-ship-sinking.html</a></p> <p><a href="#_edn1">[11]</a> See <a title="North and South Korea on the brink of war, Russian diplomat warns" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/northkorea/8020972/North-and-South-Korea-on-the-brink-of-war-Russian-diplomat-warns.html" target="_blank">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/northkorea/8020972/North-and-South-Korea-on-the-brink-of-war-Russian-diplomat-warns.html</a></p> <p><a href="#_edn1">[12]</a> The AP reported:</p> <blockquote><p>North Korea fired two rounds toward South Korea at their tense border and South Korean troops immediately fired back, an official said Friday.</p> <p>The exchange of fire at the heavily armed border highlights the security problems faced by Seoul as it prepares to host the Group of 20 economic summit next month.</p> <p>North Korean troops fired at a South Korean guard post in the Demilitarized Zone, said an official at the Joint Chiefs of Staff in Seoul.</p> <p>. . .</p> <p>The guard post is 73 miles (118 kilometers) northeast of Seoul.</p> <p>. . .</p> <p>The spike in tensions Friday came two weeks ahead of a global economic summit in Seoul to be attended by President Barack Obama and other leaders.</p> <p>. . .</p> <p>In May, a multinational investigation led by Seoul concluded that a torpedo fired by a North Korean submarine sank the 1,200-ton Cheonan warship.

The next day, the U.S. and South Korea said planned joint exercises would go ahead over the weekend, heightening fears in some quarters that already-tense relations between North and South Korea—and their respective international protectors, China and the U.S.—could be heading for a showdown.</p> <p>Yet China’s outwardly defiant response belies a more delicate political reality: Beijing’s continued support of North Korea’s erratic, martial regime is beginning to extract real costs.

Beijing refused this week to blame North Korea for Tuesday’s attack. Privately, its officials maintain, the weekend’s exercises could be a grave mistake that risk further provoking the North.</p> <p>But current and former U.S. officials who have worked on North Korea said Friday that they saw China in a growing quandary in how to square its support for Pyongyang with the regime’s continued provocations.</p> <p>Beijing has sought in recent months to deepen its economic and strategic relationship with North Korea, despite U.S. objections, arguing it would help contain leader Kim Jong Il’s nuclear work and military provocations. As Pyongyang has continued to challenge the international community, however, China has been placed in an increasingly weakened position to protest U.S. military action.</p> <p>“China is having a much harder time in defending its policy, but they only have themselves to blame,” said Michael Green, who oversaw Asia policy for the White House during George W. Bush’s first term. “You talk to any Chinese official, and they’re furious with the North Koreans.”</p> <p>Beijing is also facing renewed criticism from Chinese foreign-policy experts, journalists and Internet activists who question whether unqualified support for North Korea is still in China’s interests.</p> <p>China’s apparently softened stance on Yellow Sea exercises appears to demonstrate a concern that the North Korean crisis will overshadow a planned trip to Washington in January by President Hu Jintao. It may also reflect an acknowledgment that China would be unlikely to prevent the U.S. and South Korea from staging their drills following the week’s attack, requiring a compromise to avoid appearing weak before an increasingly nationalist and demanding Chinese public.</p> <p>“The very recent developments put China in an awkward position,” said Jin Canrong, an international relations professor at Renmin University in Beijing. “China’s not pleased to see that, but it has to face it. So its immediate concern is to contain the crisis.”</p> <p>U.S. military officials insisted Friday that the exercise scheduled for this weekend shouldn’t be interpreted as anything but an attempt to deter North Korea from further attacks on the South.</p> <p>“This exercise is not directed at China,” said Capt. Darryn James, a Pentagon spokesman. “The purpose is to strengthen the deterrence against North Korea.”</p> <p>U.S. officials on Friday said the Obama administration continues to focus its diplomacy in Northeast Asia on gaining China’s cooperation to exert more pressure on North Korea.</p> <p>. . .</p> <p>[In] a speech by [Secretary of State Hillary] Clinton[,] she said that the U.S. had a national interest in protecting freedom of navigation in the South China Sea.

As well, military officials said they saw no unusual preparations by the North’s military over the weekend.</p> <p>As a result, no special precautions were ordered on South Korea’s mainland and in the capital city of Seoul, just 30 miles from the border, and business proceeded as usual Monday.</p> <p>. . .</p> <p>North Korea’s offer to restart international nuclear inspections may have less impact now after its announcement last month of a uranium enrichment program. When the North’s nuclear-weapons development work was confined to plutonium reprocessing, it was easy for inspectors to monitor.</p> <p>But, analysts note the uranium program Pyongyang revealed last month is likely housed in multiple locations and easily hidden, making the inspections process less reliable as a means of holding North Korea to disarmament agreements.</p> </blockquote> <p>See <a title="North Korea Says It Won't Strike Back" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703886904576031232770698532.html?mod=WSJ_hp_MIDDLENexttoWhatsNewsForth" target="_blank">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703886904576031232770698532.html?mod=WSJ_hp_MIDDLENexttoWhatsNewsForth</a> </p> <p><a href="#_edn1">[18]</a> See <a title="Wikileaks cables reveal China 'ready to abandon North Korea'" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/nov/29/wikileaks-cables-china-reunified-korea" target="_blank">http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/nov/29/wikileaks-cables-china-reunified-korea</a> </p> <p><a href="#_edn1">[19]</a> See <a title='Naegele: "EMP Attack: Only 30 Million Americans Survive"' href="https://naegeleblog.wordpress.com/2010/01/19/emp-attack-only-30-million-americans-survive/" target="_blank">https://naegeleblog.wordpress.com/2010/01/19/emp-attack-only-30-million-americans-survive/</a>; see also <a title="Timothy D.

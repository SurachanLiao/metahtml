<div><p>Pre-lobby battlerite system We know it was annoying for the most of ppl that you get bad team combo, no healer combo, you get blindly countered etc. Since battlerite season 1, we got pre-game lobby where we have order of picks and chat so we can assemble the team better. Most of the people are one trick heroes so it won&#8217;t matter much for them, but yet at least someone can change. This is a really good feature, as if you are 2nd to pick, you can counter pick their first pick or you can swap with your first pick in case you are one trick.&#160; This feature should make our game easier. &#8230; <a href="https://www.make-money-online-resources.com/2018/03/battlerite-official-first-season-review-by-mmo-boosting-service/" class="more-link">[Read more...] about Battlerite official first season review by MMO Boosting Service</a></p></div>

“No new case has been reported in Delhi in the last 24 hours. Five people have been discharged from hospitals after getting treatment. But we should not be happy. The biggest challenge now is to not let situation go out of control, we need your support,” Kejriwal tweeted.

पिछले 24 घंटों में दिल्ली में कोई नया केस नहीं आया। 5 लोग इलाज करवाकर जा चुके हैं। अभी खुश नहीं होना। अभी सबसे बड़ी चुनौती है किसी भी अवस्था में स्थिति को बेक़ाबू नहीं होने देना। इसमें आप सबका सहयोग चाहिए। pic.twitter.com/e4GynrLopC — Arvind Kejriwal (@ArvindKejriwal) March 24, 2020

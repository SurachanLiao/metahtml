CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story erroneously presented 2010's Daily Beast rankings, in which San Francisco was America's 3rd drunkest city, as the 2011 rankings. As is apparent in the comments section of this blog post, the links on the Daily Beast site are a little confusing, and our misinterpretation of them resulted in this mix-up. We regret the error.



San Francisco reliably comes out on top in national polls of which metropolitan area ranks highest in ribald practices. In June, we brought you the important news that our city had been deemed the country's sluttiest.



Our drinking, it seems, is not quite up to that level. According to a survey of health statistics by The Daily Beast, San Francisco has dropped from the the country's third-drunkest city in 2010 to 22nd drunkest in 2011.

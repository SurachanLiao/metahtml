            <p><i><b>CORRECTION:</b> An earlier version of this story erroneously presented 2010's </i>Daily Beast<i> rankings, in which San Francisco was America's 3rd drunkest city, as the 2011 rankings. As is apparent in the comments section of this blog post, the links on the </i>Daily Beast<i> site are a little confusing, and our misinterpretation of them resulted in this mix-up. We regret the error.</i><br><br>San Francisco reliably comes out on top in national polls of which metropolitan area ranks highest in ribald practices. In June, we brought you the important news that <a href="http://blogs.sfweekly.com/thesnitch/2011/06/san_francisco_sex_partners.php">our city had been deemed the country's sluttiest</a>.<br><br>Our drinking, it seems, is not quite up to that level. According to a survey of health statistics by <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/galleries/2011/12/28/america-s-drunkest-cities-photos.html?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=cheatsheet_morning&amp;cid=newsletter%3Bemail%3Bcheatsheet_morning&amp;utm_term=Cheat%20Sheet">The Daily Beast</a>, San Francisco has dropped from the the country's <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/galleries/2010/12/23/drunkest-cities.html">third-drunkest city in 2010</a> to <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/galleries/2011/12/28/america-s-drunkest-cities-photos.html?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=cheatsheet_morning&amp;cid=newsletter%3Bemail%3Bcheatsheet_morning&amp;utm_term=Cheat%20Sheet">22nd drunkest</a> in 2011.<br><br> </p>

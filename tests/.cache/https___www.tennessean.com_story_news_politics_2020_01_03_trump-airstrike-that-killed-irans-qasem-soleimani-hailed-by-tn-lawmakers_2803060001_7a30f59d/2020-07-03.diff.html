Security Council, took a dim view of the U.S. airstrike.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">“We are waking up in a more dangerous world. Military escalation is always dangerous,” France's deputy minister for foreign affairs, Amelie de Montchalin, told RTL radio. "When such actions, such operations, take place, we see that escalation is underway.”</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Russia likewise characterized the deadly U.S. strike as “fraught with serious consequences.” A Foreign Ministry statement warned that “such actions don’t help resolve complicated problems in the Middle East, but instead lead to a new round of escalating tensions.”</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">China described itself as “highly concerned.”</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">“Peace in the Middle East and the Gulf region should be preserved,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said. "We urge all parties concerned, especially the United States, to maintain calm and restraint and avoid further escalation of tensions.”</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">But while echoing the concerns of other Security Council members about spiraling tensions, Britain and Germany broke ranks, voicing qualified understanding for the U.S. position.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Deirdre Shesgreen, Tom Vanden Brook and The Associated Press contributed to this report.

In 2019, Iran's unemployment rate was estimated to amount to 11.99 percent of the total labor force.

Also, many of those who are considered employed in Iran are also considered underemployed. Unemployment in Iran is especially high among young people and women;  over 70 percent of the population’s close to 80 million <a href="/statistics/294102/total-population-of-iran/">inhabitants Link: /statistics/294102/total-population-of-iran/ </a> are of <a href="/statistics/294213/iran-age-structure/">working age Link: /statistics/294213/iran-age-structure/ </a>, increasing the overall demand of these inhabitants for work.

Although the economy is expected to recover slightly in 2014, Iran's <a href="/statistics/294233/iran-gross-domestic-product-gdp/">GDP Link: /statistics/294233/iran-gross-domestic-product-gdp/ </a> is expected to decrease and the <a href="/statistics/294301/iran-gross-domestic-product-gdp-growth/">real GDP growth rate Link: /statistics/294301/iran-gross-domestic-product-gdp-growth/ </a> is either negative or quite low.

Because Iran's economic activity still depends to a large extent on oil revenues, this also reduces the stability of the economy and employment. With a decreasing <a href="/statistics/294245/iran-gross-domestic-product-gdp-per-capita/">per capita GDP Link: /statistics/294245/iran-gross-domestic-product-gdp-per-capita/ </a> and a high <a href="/statistics/294320/iran-inflation-rate/">inflation rate Link: /statistics/294320/iran-inflation-rate/ </a> people are also more vulnerable to changes in income and employment, making the unemployment a pressing issue that the country will have to manage.

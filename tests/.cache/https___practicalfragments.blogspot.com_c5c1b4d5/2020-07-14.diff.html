Fragments – and indeed much of what appears in the literature – describe successes.
This is obvious in the <a href="https://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2020/03/fragments-in-clinic-2020-edition.html">list Link: https://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2020/03/fragments-in-clinic-2020-edition.html </a> of fragment-derived clinical compounds, and discoveries
of high-affinity tool molecules or even advanceable fragment hits make up a
large share of the 750+ posts on this blog. But of course, most of what we do
in science fails, and such failures can also be informative. Eric Minikel and 25
collaborators from the Broad Institute and multiple other organizations have just published
an illustrative <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.18.159418v1">case study Link: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.18.159418v1 </a> on bioRxiv. (Eric also has a detailed and eloquent <a href="http://www.cureffi.org/2020/06/23/five-years-of-screening/#">blog post Link: http://www.cureffi.org/2020/06/23/five-years-of-screening/# </a> of his own about the work.)</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="MsoNormal"><ins>The researchers describe a
five-year effort to find small-molecule binders of the prion protein, PrP, which
misfolds and forms aggregates that lead to neurodegeneration. The hope was that
binders could be turned into PrP stabilizers or perhaps even degraders. PrP has
been studied for decades and there are plenty of literature reports of small molecules
that seem to interact with the target, but none of these have been convincingly validated.
Moreover, the crystallographic structure of the protein does not reveal attractive
binding pockets.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="MsoNormal"><ins>Fragment-based methods have
succeeded for other difficult targets, so the researchers performed <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2019/05/sar-by-std-not.html">STD Link: http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2019/05/sar-by-std-not.html </a> and <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2020/05/broadening-scope-of-19-f-nmr.html">19F Link: http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2020/05/broadening-scope-of-19-f-nmr.html </a> NMR screens. Of 6630 pooled fragments, 238 initial hits were retested by STD
NMR, leading to 80 hits that were then assessed by <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2020/05/machine-learning-for-two-dimensional-nmr.html">two-dimensional Link: http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2020/05/machine-learning-for-two-dimensional-nmr.html </a> (TROSY)
NMR. This led to a single hit, a substituted <a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/5_6-Dichloro-2-methylbenzimidazole">benzimidazole Link: https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/5_6-Dichloro-2-methylbenzimidazole </a>. Unfortunately the binding site
could not be determined: chemical shift perturbations were spread across the
protein. Differential scanning fluorimetry (<a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2017/08/assessing-ligandability-by-thermal.html">DSF Link: http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2017/08/assessing-ligandability-by-thermal.html </a>) showed the molecule caused a slight
decrease in thermal stability. Both of these results suggest some sort of
pathological mechanism, but the researchers did multiple experiments to rule
out <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2019/11/a-new-tool-for-detecting-aggregation_10.html">aggregation Link: http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2019/11/a-new-tool-for-detecting-aggregation_10.html </a>. A dose-response suggested a dissociation constant well above 1
mM, and none of 54 analogs tested proved any better. Soaking crystals of PrP
with 20 of these was also unsuccessful.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="MsoNormal"><ins>Next, the researchers performed a
thermal shift assay of just over 30,000 compounds (not necessarily fragments),
which yielded both stabilizers and destabilizers. Unfortunately, none of 93
tested by two-dimensional NMR (HSQC) revealed any sign of binding. A DNA-encoded
library (<a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2020/03/fbld-meets-del.html">DEL Link: http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2020/03/fbld-meets-del.html </a>) screen of 256,000 macrocycles also didn’t yield any confirmed
hits (though more on that below), nor did a computational screen of just under
7 million molecules.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="MsoNormal"><ins>Given this experience, the
researchers cautiously conclude that their “results may hint toward relative rarity
of PrP binders in chemical space.” They do suggest several alternative
approaches, such as screening the more biologically-relevant membrane-bound form
of the protein. It may also be worth doing a high-concentration <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2020/06/crystallographic-fragment-screening.html">crystallographic screen Link: http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2020/06/crystallographic-fragment-screening.html </a>. Finally, the researchers note that one of the DEL scaffolds “was judged
to be a likely covalent binder and was not pursued further.” This decision may be
worth revisiting. Indeed, covalent approaches have led to clinical compounds against another formerly undruggable target, <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2020/01/fragments-in-clinic-amg-510.html">KRAS Link: http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2020/01/fragments-in-clinic-amg-510.html </a>. </ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="MsoNormal"><ins>According to the <a href="http://www.cureffi.org/2020/06/23/five-years-of-screening/#">blog post Link: http://www.cureffi.org/2020/06/23/five-years-of-screening/# </a>, the
researchers have pivoted to oligonucleotide therapeutics, where they seem to be
making good progress. This makes sense, and I wish them luck. But I hope
someone returns to PrP itself with new tools. If they do, the assays established
and described here will prove invaluable.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="post-footer-line post-footer-line-1"><ins><span class="post-author vcard">Posted by

libraries built for crystallographic screening, and this week we continue the library theme. A primary challenge after validating
a fragment hit is what to do next. You can look for similar compounds, either
in-house or from vendors, but ultimately you’ll need to do chemistry. And this
might not be <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2016/02/dihydroisoquinolones-as-fragments.html">trivial Link: http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2016/02/dihydroisoquinolones-as-fragments.html </a>: you don’t want to embark on a multistep synthesis if you

of 220 Da.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="MsoNormal"><ins>Fragments were characterized by
NMR and LC-MS. NMR experiments were done in both d6-DMSO (at 50
mM) and phosphate buffer (at 1 mM). The DMSO solutions were spiked with 10% D2O;
this mixture remains liquid at 4 °C, thus avoiding <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2014/02/poll-results-how-do-you-store-your.html">freeze-thaw Link: http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2014/02/poll-results-how-do-you-store-your.html </a> problems. Fragment
concentrations were established by NMR using either external or internal
standards.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="MsoNormal"><ins>Some 30% of fragments did not
pass quality control. This probably will not come as a shock to long-time
readers, though it is a bit worse than some <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2014/10/caveat-emptor.html">previous studies Link: http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2014/10/caveat-emptor.html </a>. Just like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Karenina_principle">unhappy families Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Karenina_principle </a>, fragments failed QC for a variety of reasons, including impurities,
degradation, solubility, and even inconsistency with the expected structures. There
were also a couple cases where two fragments were mixed together, suggesting operator
error while assembling the library. NMR spectra for various types of QC
failures are provided in the paper.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="MsoNormal"><ins>The researchers are honest about deficiencies
in the library, noting that it contains <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2015/02/new-pains-and-their-painful-mechanisms.html">PAINful Link: http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2015/02/new-pains-and-their-painful-mechanisms.html </a> molecules such as <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2014/09/pains-in-nature.html">catechols Link: http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2014/09/pains-in-nature.html </a> and
hydroquinones, though one wonders why these were not removed in the first place. Laudably, they provide <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_molecular-input_line-entry_system">SMILES Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_molecular-input_line-entry_system </a> for all 782 compounds along with an
extensive set of physicochemical calculations (see <a href="https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10858-020-00327-9/MediaObjects/10858_2020_327_MOESM1_ESM.xlsx">here Link: https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10858-020-00327-9/MediaObjects/10858_2020_327_MOESM1_ESM.xlsx </a> – opens as an Excel spreadsheet).
Weirdly though, the researchers do not specify which molecules failed QC or which vendors they came from. At
first I thought these had been weeded out of the final set, but five examples
shown as failures appear in the spreadsheet. The library is sold commercially
by Enamine as the <a href="https://enamine.net/fragments/plated-libraries/dsi-poised-library">DSI-poised Library Link: https://enamine.net/fragments/plated-libraries/dsi-poised-library </a>, and since this library contains only 768
compounds perhaps the most egregious bad actors have been removed. Enamine was
rated highly in a reader <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2018/12/poll-results-library-vendors.html">poll Link: http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2018/12/poll-results-library-vendors.html </a>, so presumably the compounds have all passed QC.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="MsoNormal"><ins>So how does the fragment library perform?
That – unfortunately – is not addressed in this paper, though the DSI-poised
library was among those <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2020/03/a-crowdsourcing-call-to-action-fbld-vs.html">screened Link: http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2020/03/a-crowdsourcing-call-to-action-fbld-vs.html </a> against the SARS-CoV-2 main
protease (MPro). Have you used it? And if so, has the “poised”
nature of the library allowed you to efficiently grow fragment hits? Hopefully
these questions will be answered in the literature, if not in the comments.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="post-footer-line post-footer-line-1"><ins><span class="post-author vcard">Posted by

way, tuberculosis is currently the deadliest infectious disease worldwide,
causing nearly 1.7 million deaths per year. Multidrug-resistant and extensively
drug-resistant strains are widespread. Some approved drugs work by blocking the
mycolic acid pathway essential for mycobacterial envelope formation. One member
of the pathway, the enzyme InhA, is the target of isoniazid and ethionamide.
Both of these molecules are prodrugs, and a major mechanism of resistance shuts
down their bioactivation. To sidestep this problem, Mohamad Sabbah, Chris
Abell, and collaborators at University of Cambridge and Comenius University in
Bratislava have targeted InhA directly, as they describe in a recent
open-access J. Med. Chem. <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.0c00007">paper Link: https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.0c00007 </a>. (See <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2018/02/more-hits-from-complex-library.html">here Link: http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2018/02/more-hits-from-complex-library.html </a> for a previous FBLD effort
against this target.)</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="MsoNormal"><ins>The researchers began with a
differential scanning fluorimetry (<a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2017/08/assessing-ligandability-by-thermal.html">DSF Link: http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2017/08/assessing-ligandability-by-thermal.html </a>) screen of 800 fragments, each at 5 mM. Forty-two
fragments stabilized InhA by at least 3 °C and were tested at 1 mM in three
ligand-based NMR assays: <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2019/11/a-new-tool-for-detecting-aggregation_10.html">CPMG Link: http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2019/11/a-new-tool-for-detecting-aggregation_10.html </a>, <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2019/07/sar-by-waterlogsy.html">WaterLOGSY Link: http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2019/07/sar-by-waterlogsy.html </a>, and <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2019/05/sar-by-std-not.html">STD Link: http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2019/05/sar-by-std-not.html </a>. All 18 fragments that hit
in at least two of these confirmatory assays were soaked into InhA crystals at 20
mM, yielding 5 hits.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>None of the fragments inhibited enzymatic
activity at 2 mM, but compound 1 was chosen for optimization based on an
attractive growth vector into a hydrophobic region of the binding pocket. The
carboxylic acid was replaced with an isosteric sulfonamide to yield compound 6,
which has measurable activity. Various substituents were tested around the new
phenyl ring, with a significant boost in activity caused by an aminomethyl moiety.
Cyclizing the molecule and further medicinal chemistry ultimately led to
compound 23, with high nanomolar activity. A crystal structure revealed that compound
23 bound as expected and that the primary amine was making interactions with
the enzyme cofactor as well as an ordered water molecule.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="MsoNormal"><ins>Unfortunately, although compound
23 slightly inhibited the growth of M. tuberculosis, it did not inhibit
synthesis of mycolic acids, suggesting that activity was through a different
mechanism. The researchers suggest that the molecules may not be sufficiently
cell permeable or that they are effluxed or metabolized. However, it may be that
they just aren’t potent enough. Perhaps further medical chemistry will improve
affinity by another couple orders of magnitude and achieve pathway inhibition. Regardless, this is a nice example of a robust biophysical assay
cascade followed by fragment growing and structure-based design.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="post-footer-line post-footer-line-1"><ins><span class="post-author vcard">Posted by

crystallography has become the most popular technique for FBLD. Three recent
papers discuss some of the whys and hows.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="MsoNormal"><ins>The first <a href="https://www.cell.com/structure/fulltext/S0969-2126(20)30140-4">publication Link: https://www.cell.com/structure/fulltext/S0969-2126(20)30140-4 </a>, published
in Structure by Manfred Weiss and collaborators at Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin,
Philipps-Universität Marburg, Freie Universität Berlin, and Lund University,
describes the construction of the F2X-Universal Library for crystallographic
screening. Starting from 1.4 million commercially available fragments, the
researchers filtered out undesirable molecules such as <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2015/02/new-pains-and-their-painful-mechanisms.html">PAINS Link: http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2015/02/new-pains-and-their-painful-mechanisms.html </a> and then clustered
the remaining compounds by similarity. Among clusters with at least 1000
members they chose one fragment from each. The resulting library, sourced from roughly
a dozen vendors, contains 1103 fragments individually dissolved in DMSO at 0.5
M concentration. Outside of the <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2020/03/a-crowdsourcing-call-to-action-fbld-vs.html">Diamond Light Source Link: http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2020/03/a-crowdsourcing-call-to-action-fbld-vs.html </a>, screening 1000 crystals is still a sizable
effort, so the researchers have also made a 96-membered subset library called
F2X-Entry.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="MsoNormal"><ins>F2X-Entry was screened against
two targets, the model protein endothiapepsin (EP) and the spliceosomal
protein-protein complex Aar2/RNaseH-like domain of Prp8 (AR). Crystals of each
were screened with 100 mM fragments and processed with the assistance of PanDDA
(described <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2017/05/extracting-more-information-from.html">here Link: http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2017/05/extracting-more-information-from.html </a>).</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="MsoNormal"><ins>The results were quite
impressive: 29 hits for EP, several of which bound in more than one site, and
20 hits for AR. The overall hit rates of 30% and 21% compare favorably with a
previous crystallographic <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2016/05/a-strong-case-for-crystallography-first.html">screen Link: http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2016/05/a-strong-case-for-crystallography-first.html </a> against EP that yielded a 20% hit rate. The
solvent DMSO sometimes doesn’t play well with crystals, but the researchers
were able to obtain 72-75% of the original hits when soaked in the absence of
solubilizing DMSO.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="MsoNormal"><ins>One bit of data I would have
liked to have seen is how the physicochemical properties of the fragment hits
compare to the overall library, similar to what was reported <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2014/11/plenty-of-room-at-bottom-of-chemical.html">here Link: http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2014/11/plenty-of-room-at-bottom-of-chemical.html </a>. Both
libraries can be accessed by collaborators at the BESSY II synchrotron, and the
smaller library can also be accessed through an MTA, so hopefully as these are
screened against more targets this information will be published.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="MsoNormal"><ins>A second <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31808981">paper Link: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31808981 </a>, in ChemMedChem
by Gerhard Klebe and collaborators at Philipps-Universität Marburg and
AstraZeneca, also discusses crystallographic screening of a 96-compound
library, one sold commercially by <a href="https://www.jenabioscience.com/">Jena Biosciences Link: https://www.jenabioscience.com/ </a>. The target chosen was tRNA
guanine transglycosylase (TGT), an enzyme important for the pathogenicity of
the sometimes lethal bacteria Shigella. Soaking each of the compounds
at 100 mM yielded 8 structures, 5 of which bound in the active site.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="MsoNormal"><ins>The researchers also screened the
library using orthogonal methods, <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2010/02/surface-plasmon-resonance-spr.html">SPR Link: http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2010/02/surface-plasmon-resonance-spr.html </a> and ligand-detected NMR. As in a previous
<a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2016/05/a-strong-case-for-crystallography-first.html">study Link: http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2016/05/a-strong-case-for-crystallography-first.html </a> from the same group, the results were “puzzling”: none of the hits were
detected in all three assays. (The first author, Engi Hassaan, presented some
of this work at a CHI <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2019/04/fourteenth-annual-fragment-based-drug.html">meeting Link: http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2019/04/fourteenth-annual-fragment-based-drug.html </a> last year.) Indeed, only one of the
crystallographic hits was found among the 10 hits from SPR, and a different
crystallographic hit was found among the 22 NMR hits.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="MsoNormal"><ins>Several plausible reasons for the
low overlap are provided, including different buffer compositions and concentrations of
fragments. Solubility likely played a role: a dozen fragments could not be
screened by NMR at 0.2 mM, and 15 fragments interfered with the SPR assay and thus
could not be screened. Indeed, some of the fragments are <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2015/02/new-pains-and-their-painful-mechanisms.html">PAINS Link: http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2015/02/new-pains-and-their-painful-mechanisms.html </a>, including
an eyebrow-raising dinitrocatechol, so the fact that they were not observed by
crystallography is perhaps unsurprising.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="MsoNormal"><ins>Finally, in a Biomolecules
<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32235320">paper Link: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32235320 </a>, Gerhard Klebe and collaborators screen the same library against human
carbonic anhydrase II (hCAII). This resulted in 9 hits – 8 from the library and
1 from a cryoprotectant used at 2.6 M in some experiments. Among the library
hits, four bound at the active site, including a couple hydrazides which make
interactions with the catalytic zinc ion. Surprisingly, two fragments bind
covalently to the N-terminus of  hCAII.
One seems to form a formaldehyde-mediated linkage, while the other – an
aminomethylheterocycle – has likely oxidized to an aromatic aldehyde that can
form an imine linkage.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="MsoNormal"><ins>All of the fragment hits in this
case were identified through visual inspection of the electron density maps,
and in this system PanDDA was actually not helpful, revealing only three of the
fragment hits. The researchers note that they used different soaking times for
the different crystals, and suggest that shorter soaking times in particular
may not allow time for crystals to equilibrate, as assumed in PanDDA.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="MsoNormal"><ins>So in summary, fragment screening
by crystallography is becoming easier and is likely to give high hit rates, particularly
when conducted at high concentrations. Also, libraries matter: it is interesting that the F2X-Entry library gave considerably higher hit rates than the second 96-compound library, albeit on different targets. Of course, a fragment hit is only the beginning
of a long journey, but at least a structure provides guidance to begin
optimization.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="post-footer-line post-footer-line-1"><ins><span class="post-author vcard">Posted by

interested in the protein DNA Gyrase B (GyrB), which is essential for bacterial
replication (see <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2016/03/fragments-vs-bacterial-gyrb.html">here Link: http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2016/03/fragments-vs-bacterial-gyrb.html </a> for previous work on the same target). A high-throughput screen

“relatively complicated,” and most of them were inactive. However, compound 2d
showed binding by ITC as well as excellent <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2017/04/ligand-efficiency-invalidated.html">ligand efficiency Link: http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2017/04/ligand-efficiency-invalidated.html </a>. Growing from this
fragment ultimately led to compound 13e, with low nanomolar affinity. In
addition to binding, compound 13e is a potent inhibitor of GyrB and is selective
against a panel of 96 human kinases. Unfortunately though, it displays only
modest antibacterial activity, likely due to efflux.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="MsoNormal"><ins>Nonetheless, this is a nice example
of thoughtful structure-based design. In particular, the dramatic boost in
potency gained by filling a small pocket (nearly 400-fold from compound 8e to
13e) validates the willingness to explore difficult chemistry rather than sticking
with available analogs. The paper ends by noting that optimization is
continuing, and I wish them well. By my count only a single fragment-derived
antibacterial agent has entered <a href="https://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2020/03/fragments-in-clinic-2020-edition.html">clinical development Link: https://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2020/03/fragments-in-clinic-2020-edition.html </a>, and that program is no longer active.

discovery is to improve a previously reported molecule. An
example of such a “fast follower” approach has just been <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.9b01784">published Link: https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.9b01784 </a> in J.
Med. Chem. by Cheng Luo, Bing Zhou, and colleagues at Shanghai Institute of
Materia Medica.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="MsoNormal"><ins>The researchers were specifically
interested in bromodomains, which recognize acetylated lysine residues in
proteins and play major roles in gene expression. In 2018 we <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2018/02/fragments-in-clinic-abbv-075-mivebresib.html">described Link: http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2018/02/fragments-in-clinic-abbv-075-mivebresib.html </a> AbbVie’s
fragment-based discovery of ABBV-075, which had entered phase 1 clinical trials.
Although reasonably selective for BET-family bromodomains, it also strongly inhibits
<a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2018/03/fragments-deliver-another-inhibitor-for.html">EP300 Link: http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2018/03/fragments-deliver-another-inhibitor-for.html </a>, which could lead to toxicity. Thus, more selective molecules have been
sought.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="MsoNormal"><ins>The new paper starts with a <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2017/08/assessing-ligandability-by-thermal.html">thermal shift Link: http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2017/08/assessing-ligandability-by-thermal.html </a> assay of 1000 fragments against the two separate bromodomains of BRD4,
BD1 and BD2. Hits were validated using an AlphaScreen assay. Compound 47 was found
to be active against both BD1 and BD2, with high ligand efficiency (all IC50
values shown are for BD1; values for BD2 are similar). Modeling suggested this
fragment could be merged with ABBV-075, and indeed the resulting compound 26
was quite potent. (Note: structures of compounds 26 and 38 were originally drawn incorrectly - now fixed.)</ins></p><ins> Compound 26 was metabolically
unstable, but further optimization, aided by crystallography and modeling, ultimately
led to compound 38. This molecule has good oral bioavailability in mice and
promising pharmacokinetics in both mice and rats. It inhibits the expression of
cancer-driving genes such as c-Myc and BCL-2, inhibits the growth of several
cancer cell lines, and demonstrated good tumor growth inhibition in a mouse
xenograft study. Compound 26 does not inhibit five cytochrome P450 enzymes or
hERG. Finally, it is much more selective than ABBV-075 against EP300 and indeed
most other bromodomains aside from BET family members. The researchers conclude
that “compound 38 is a highly promising preclinical candidate.”
 
</ins><p class="MsoNormal"><ins>Unfortunately, selectivity for
BET-family bromodomains may not be sufficient to avoid toxicity. Indeed, as we
described earlier this year, AbbVie has dropped <a href="https://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2020/03/fragments-in-clinic-2020-edition.html">clinical development Link: https://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2020/03/fragments-in-clinic-2020-edition.html </a> of

same could be done for this series, the paper is still <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2020/03/fbld-meets-del.html">another Link: http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2020/03/fbld-meets-del.html </a> nice example of appending a fragment onto a previously discovered molecule.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="post-footer-line post-footer-line-1"><ins><span class="post-author vcard">Posted by

fragments, only two – X-ray crystallography and protein-observed NMR – can routinely
provide detailed structural information. Indeed, the first SAR by NMR <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8929414">paper Link: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8929414 </a> arguably
launched the field of fragment-based lead discovery nearly a quarter century
ago. However, whereas crystallography has steadily increased in popularity,
protein-observed NMR has lagged. A new <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32257044">paper Link: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32257044 </a> in Comp. Struct. Biotech. J.
by Grzegorz Popowicz and collaborators at Helmholtz Zentrum München, Technical
University of Munich, and the ETH seeks to change this.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="MsoNormal"><ins>Two-dimensional NMR techniques,
such as 1H-15N <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heteronuclear_single_quantum_coherence_spectroscopy">HSQC Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heteronuclear_single_quantum_coherence_spectroscopy </a>, produce two-dimensional plots with
the chemical shift of the proton on one axis and the chemical shift of the
nitrogen on the other. Different amide groups in a protein have different chemical
shifts, and these can change in position or intensity when a ligand binds. Ideally
these chemical shift perturbations (<a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2014/12/how-much-information-can-nmr-provide.html">CSPs Link: http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2014/12/how-much-information-can-nmr-provide.html </a>) can be used to tell exactly where on the
protein a ligand binds, but even unassigned perturbations can give qualitative information
on whether or not the protein is interacting with a fragment.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="MsoNormal"><ins>Unfortunately, analyzing hundreds
of two-dimensional spectra is a tedious manual process; think of spending
several hours playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where%27s_Wally%3F">Where’s Wally Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where%27s_Wally%3F </a> with blobs instead of people. And with only
two colors. Thus, the process is subject to error and human bias. To make life
easier for NMR spectroscopists, and to make analysis more objective, the
researchers developed an automated software package called the CSP Analyzer.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="MsoNormal"><ins>The process started with 1611
spectra taken from fragment screens against four different proteins, of which 176
had a bound ligand. From the total, a training set was assembled of 32 actives
along with 68 inactive or noisy spectra. These training spectra were fed into a
machine learning algorithm similar to those used for computer image processing.
Building the model required quite a bit of tweaking; because inactives
outnumbered actives, a simple algorithm would do better by returning more false
negatives than false positives. However, when looking for a fragment needle in
a haystack of spectra, you really don’t want to miss anything useful, and the
researchers used strategies to minimize this problem. In the end CSP
Analyzer performed quite well, with an accuracy of 87% across the entire data
set. Importantly, while it returned 10.3% spectra as false positives, it only
missed 3.1% of spectra as false negatives.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="MsoNormal"><ins>Teddy would often end his posts
by asking whether a new technique was practical. I’m no NMR spectroscopist, so
I’ll leave it to readers to weigh in with their opinions. Happily, the software is
freely available <a href="https://github.com/rubbs14/CSP-Analyzer/releases/tag/v1.0">here Link: https://github.com/rubbs14/CSP-Analyzer/releases/tag/v1.0 </a>, so you can download and try it yourself. Moreover, the researchers
have ambitious future plans, such as extending CSP Analyzer to other types of
NMR experiments and inputs. The <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2018/07/rise-of-machines-for-fragment.html">rise of the machines Link: http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2018/07/rise-of-machines-for-fragment.html </a> continues, in a benevolent

are a family of 10 proteins that – as their name suggests – shuttle fatty acids
around cells. FABP4 has been implicated in a host of diseases, from atherosclerosis
to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. A recent <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.9b02107">paper Link: https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.9b02107 </a> in J. Med. Chem. by
Yechun Xu and collaborators mostly at Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica
describes how a fragment led to a compound with in vivo efficacy. It is a
lesson in both recognizing and capitalizing on the fact that fragments often
have multiple binding modes.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="MsoNormal"><ins>The researchers screened just 500
fragments, each at 1 mM, looking for displacement of a fluorescent ligand. Two
hits were identified, of which compound 1 was by far the most potent. The
researchers characterized the binding mode using crystallography, which itself
was challenging because the protein co-purified with bound fatty acids. They
had to denature the protein, strip fatty acids, and then refold it to obtain
the apo form. When they were finally able to determine the crystal structure,
they were surprised to find that compound 1 adopted three different binding
modes under two different conditions (pH 6.5 and 7.5). These experimental results
were supported by molecular dynamics calculations.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="MsoNormal"><ins>It is not uncommon for fragments to assume different
binding modes. Indeed, the 7-azaindole fragment that led to
<a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2011/08/first-fragment-based-drug-approved.html">vemurafenib Link: http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2011/08/first-fragment-based-drug-approved.html </a>, <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2015/10/fragments-in-clinic-plx3397.html">pexidartinib Link: http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2015/10/fragments-in-clinic-plx3397.html </a>, and other <a href="https://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2020/03/fragments-in-clinic-2020-edition.html">clinical compounds Link: https://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2020/03/fragments-in-clinic-2020-edition.html </a> has been found to bind
in multiple orientations. In this case, the researchers recognized that the three
binding modes put the two phenyl rings in three positions, suggesting that grafting
a third phenyl ring onto compound 1 could improve affinity. This proved successful,
and the resulting compound 3 had an affinity more than two orders of magnitude
better as assessed both in the displacement assay and by <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2010/02/isothermal-titration-calorimetry-itc.html">isothermal titration calorimetry Link: http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2010/02/isothermal-titration-calorimetry-itc.html </a>. Crystallography revealed that the molecule bound as expected.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Further structure-based design ultimately
led to compound 17, with low nanomolar affinity. This molecule is also active
in a cellular assay and has surprisingly good pharmacokinetic properties in
mice. Given these encouraging results, the researchers tested whether the
molecule could protect mice from multiorgan damage promoted by inflammatory lipopolysaccharides. The results were positive. </ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="MsoNormal"><ins>Unfortunately, compound 17 does
show low micromolar activity against FABP3, whose inhibition would likely cause
cardiac toxicity. Still, this is a nice example of fragment “self-merging”. Although
merging two different fragments is common, merging a fragment onto itself is relatively
rare, and – as shown <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2013/10/fragment-merging-revisited-cyp121.html">here Link: http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2013/10/fragment-merging-revisited-cyp121.html </a> – not necessarily easy. It is an approach worth
keeping in mind the next time you encounter a fragment with multiple binding
orientations.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="post-footer-line post-footer-line-1"><ins><span class="post-author vcard">Posted by

One feature of 19F
NMR is that the chemical shifts of organofluorine molecules span a very wide
range, in theory allowing large mixtures to be screened. However, existing NMR methods
do not work across such large spectral windows, thereby requiring multiple experiments
to screen an entire library. This limitation has now been overcome as described
in a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32363632">paper Link: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32363632 </a> just published in Angew. Chem. by Andreas Lingel, Andreas

based on “broadband universal rotation by optimized pulses” (BURBOP). I confess
that the details evade me (though they are all there in the supporting
information if you wish to try it at home), but the upshot is a type of <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2019/11/a-new-tool-for-detecting-aggregation_10.html">CPMG Link: http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2019/11/a-new-tool-for-detecting-aggregation_10.html </a> experiment
in which fluorine-containing fragments bound to a protein show decreased peak
intensities. Crucially, a single experiment can cover the full frequency range
of pharmacologically relevant fluorine-containing molecules, spanning about 210 ppm.
Previously, this required four two separate experiments.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="MsoNormal"><ins>Such increased throughput led the
researchers to revamp their library, increasing the size from 1600 to 4000
fragments in an augmented library dubbed LEF4000. The paper has a nice, broadly
applicable description of their curation process. Candidate members were brought
in from both commercial and in-house sources and chosen to complement existing
library members in terms of diversity. A modified <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2013/07/the-rule-of-three-at-ten.html">rule of three Link: http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2013/07/the-rule-of-three-at-ten.html </a> was applied,

solubilities were experimentally measured, and only compounds with solubilities
above 0.2 mM were kept. (Although fluorine NMR is often done at low concentrations,
complementary biophysical experiments are not.) Additional quality control

candidate molecules passed the gauntlet, and were combined in 131 mixtures of
about 30 compounds each.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="MsoNormal"><ins>Having built their library, the
researchers screened it against the antibacterial target <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2018/05/fragments-vs-gram-negative-bacterial.html">CoaD Link: http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2018/05/fragments-vs-gram-negative-bacterial.html </a>, which is involved
in coenzyme A synthesis. The screen took just two days, and automated hit identification
took only a few hours on a standard laptop. The overall hit rate was ~6%, and
some of the hits were confirmed using two-dimensional protein-observed NMR
methods, revealing that they bind in the enzyme active site with affinities in
the mid micromolar to low millimolar range. </ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="MsoNormal"><ins>Pushing the technique further,
the researchers built a “Supermixture” of 152 compounds, including five of the
hits spanning a wide range of chemical shifts, from -50 to -220 ppm. Even under
these conditions the binders were readily identifiable, and the paper states
that libraries exceeding 20,000 fragments could in principle be screened in a
few days.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="MsoNormal"><ins>In 2009 I <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2009/11/nmr-vs-other-methods.html">wondered Link: http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2009/11/nmr-vs-other-methods.html </a> why 19F
NMR was not used more widely. How things change! At Novartis the LEF4000
library has been screened against “a wide variety of disease-related targets”
and identified “tractable hits for each of the screened targets, among them
many considered undruggable by small molecules such as transcription factors, a
cytokine, a nuclear receptor, and a repeat RNA.” Practical Fragments
looks forward to seeing some of these appear in the growing <a href="https://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2020/03/fragments-in-clinic-2020-edition.html">list Link: https://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2020/03/fragments-in-clinic-2020-edition.html </a> of FBDD-derived

out of Stephen Fesik’s lab at Vanderbilt University describing potent binders of WDR5,
a molecular scaffold that interacts with dozens of other proteins. Those
molecules bind at the so-called WIN site, disrupting interactions with proteins
such as MLL1. Other proteins, such as the famous anticancer target MYC, bind at
a completely different location – the WBM site. This is the focus of a new
<a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.0c00224">paper Link: https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.0c00224 </a> from the same group in J. Med. Chem.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="MsoNormal"><ins>The researchers had previously completed
a traditional high-throughput screen and identified molecules such as compound
1. These were further optimized, but, as one might expect looking at the
chemical structure, the best molecules had “challenging physicochemical profiles.”
The researchers turned to fragments for help.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="MsoNormal"><ins>A two-dimensional (1H-15N
<a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2015/11/nmr-poll-results.html">HMQC Link: http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2015/11/nmr-poll-results.html </a>) NMR screen of ~14,000 fragments yielded 43 hits, all of them quite weak,
with dissociation constants in the millimolar range. The tetrapeptide portion of
MYC that binds to the WBM site, Ile-Asp-Val-Val, contains a carboxylic acid
flanked by lipophilic residues, and as one would expect many hits were hydrophobic
acids. Crystal structures were determined for five, and these suggested a fragment
merging opportunity.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="MsoNormal"><ins>The carboxylic acid moiety of fragment
F2 makes similar interactions with an asparagine residue in WBM as the
sulfonamide moiety of compound 1. The resulting merged compound 2a showed
improved potency. More than a dozen replacements for the cyclohexyl ring were
attempted but none improved potency significantly. Similarly, moving the cycloalkyl
group around the 5-membered heterocycle was not productive. However, introducing
a methyl sulfone moiety to engage a lysine residue led to a ten-fold boost in potency
for compound 12. The molecule disrupted WDR5-MYC complex formation in cell
lysates and also reduced MYC binding to target genes in cells. </ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="MsoNormal"><ins>This is <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2020/03/fbld-meets-del.html">another Link: http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2020/03/fbld-meets-del.html </a> nice example of using
fragment merging to fix problems across early lead series. Of course, compound
12 still has a long way to go; as the researchers note, the phenol is a likely site
of glucuronidation. Still, this and the 2018 paper demonstrate the power of
fragments to target two separate protein-protein interfaces on the same
protein.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="post-footer-line post-footer-line-1"><ins><span class="post-author vcard">Posted by

in addition to a variable portion – contain a photoreactive diazirine moiety and
an alkyne moiety. These were incubated with cells and irradiated with UV light
to crosslink the fragments to bound proteins. The alkyne was then used in click
chemistry to isolate and identify the bound proteins. Cell-based screening is
not for the faint of heart, but as demonstrated in a <a href="https://chemrxiv.org/articles/PhotoAffinity_Bits_A_Photoaffinity-Based_Fragment_Screening_Platform_for_Efficient_Identification_of_Protein_Ligands/12053445">paper Link: https://chemrxiv.org/articles/PhotoAffinity_Bits_A_Photoaffinity-Based_Fragment_Screening_Platform_for_Efficient_Identification_of_Protein_Ligands/12053445 </a> recently posted on ChemRxiv
by Jacob Bush and collaborators at GlaxoSmithKline and University of Strathclyde,
the functionalized fragments can also be used in biophysical screening. (Emma
Grant presented a nice poster on some of this work at <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2018/10/fbld-2018.html">FBLD 2018 Link: http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2018/10/fbld-2018.html </a>.)</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="MsoNormal"><ins>A small library of 556 fragments,
rebranded as PhotoAffinity Bits (or PhABits), was synthesized by coupling the
alkyne- and diazirine-containing carboxylic acid with a diverse set of amines
(each with &lt; 16 heavy atoms). These were then screened at 200 µM against six
pure recombinant proteins, irradiated with UV light, and analyzed using intact
protein mass spectrometry as in <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2011/03/fragments-vs-pdk1-again-into-adaptive.html">Tethering Link: http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2011/03/fragments-vs-pdk1-again-into-adaptive.html </a> and other forms of <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2019/06/characterizing-and-screening.html">covalent FBLD Link: http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2019/06/characterizing-and-screening.html </a>. Hit
rates varied tremendously, from less than 3% for myoglobin to 47% for lysozyme.
It would be interesting to see whether this approach, like <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2017/08/assessing-ligandability-by-thermal.html">other Link: http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2017/08/assessing-ligandability-by-thermal.html </a> fragment

with the proteins tested, though 58 crosslinked to at least four, and 10 crosslinked to
all six. For one of the proteins screened, the <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2020/02/fragments-in-clinic-abbv-744.html">bromodomain Link: http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2020/02/fragments-in-clinic-abbv-744.html </a> BRD4-BD1, a known high-affinity
ligand could compete 68 of the 89 fragment hits, suggesting a specific interaction
at the acetyl lysine pocket. Of the 21 fragments that were not competed, 19
bound to at least three other proteins. Interestingly, the physicochemical
properties and solubilities of these fragments were not notably different from
the rest, and the researchers speculate that their non-specificity may be due
to a longer-lived reactive intermediate generated after UV irradiation.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="MsoNormal"><ins>Several of the BRD4-BD1 fragments
were confirmed as binders using a TR-FRET assay, some with low micromolar
affinities, though the tighter ones tended to contain known bromodomain binding
motifs such as <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2013/11/fragment-to-lead.html">isoxazoles Link: http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2013/11/fragment-to-lead.html </a>. A couple of these were successfully used to generate
PROTACs, as suggested <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2018/10/sixteenth-annual-discovery-on-target.html">here Link: http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2018/10/sixteenth-annual-discovery-on-target.html </a>. Protein digestion and LC-MS/MS sequencing revealed
that the fragments crosslinked residues near the acetyl lysine binding site,
and this binding mode was confirmed using X-ray crystallography for one of the
fragments.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="MsoNormal"><ins>In addition to BRD4-BD1, another
target the researchers highlight is KRAS4BG12D. Of the 11 unique
hits, some resembled previously <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2012/06/fragments-versus-ras-part-2.html">reported Link: http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2012/06/fragments-versus-ras-part-2.html </a> molecules, and LC-MS/MS studies
suggested that they do in fact bind in the same pocket. Competition studies confirmed
this, and the resulting IC50 values were similar to those previously
determined using HSQC NMR.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="MsoNormal"><ins>As the researchers point out, this
photoaffinity-based screening approach is limited to homogenous proteins that
are suitable for mass spectrometry. Also, the crosslinking efficiency is not
necessarily related to the affinity of the fragment. Still, this is an
interesting approach to both find fragments and identify their binding sites. It
will be fun to see how it develops.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="post-footer-line post-footer-line-1"><ins><span class="post-author vcard">Posted by

is by Glyn Williams (University of Cambridge). Fragment aficionados will
recognize Glyn as the former VP of Biophysics at Astex, but before that he
worked at Roche. His experiences there in the 1990s have lessons for today. -Dan Erlanson</span></ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins><span lang="EN-GB">In two recent Practical
Fragments posts (<a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2020/03/fragments-vs-sars-cov-2-protease-open.html">here Link: http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2020/03/fragments-vs-sars-cov-2-protease-open.html </a> and <a href="http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2020/03/">here Link: http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2020/03/ </a>), Dan
Erlanson noted efforts which will allow the scientific community to contribute
to drug design efforts against the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro). Leading
the charge at the moment is the <a href="https://covid.postera.ai/covid">COVID
Moonshot Link: https://covid.postera.ai/covid </a> consortium who have already received design proposals for covalent
inhibitors, based on the structures of fragments bound to Mpro that
have been generated by researchers at the Diamond Light Source. At the same
time, more information about Mpro, including its <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.07.981928v1.full">substrate
preferences Link: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.07.981928v1.full </a>, is being published. Soon there will be an urgent need to define
a selection procedure which will allow valuable drug candidates to be
progressed.</span></ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins><span lang="EN-GB">A similar
situation was faced in 1985 when HIV protease was being considered as a drug
target for AIDS. An excellent description of a pragmatic, and ultimately
successful, procedure was published in 1993 by Noel
Roberts and Sally Redshaw of Roche in <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4899-6718-3_6">The Search for Antiviral Drugs:Case Histories from Concept to Clinic Link: https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4899-6718-3_6 </a>.</span></ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins><span lang="EN-GB">When the project
began there was no definitive proof that this aspartyl protease was essential
for viral replication in human cells and that it could not be substituted by a
cellular protease. However, its in vitro
ability to cleave a Phe-Pro or Tyr-Pro peptide bond (amongst others) marked it
out as unusual, and that was sufficient encouragement for Roche to initiate a discovery
programme. Inhibitor design then took advantage of this feature to build in
selectivity over human aspartyl proteases, ultimately giving a high therapeutic
index while also improving inhibitor absorption after oral administration.</span></ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="MsoNormal"><ins><span lang="EN-GB">Critical issues,
such as the decision to target the HIV-1 viral strain, access to suitable protease
constructs and clear criteria for project progression, were defined early on. Novel
protease and anti-viral assays were then developed in parallel with
transition-state mimetic leads. From the start, it was recognised that the low
aqueous solubility of the optimal peptide substrates could imply that
peptidomimetic inhibitors were also likely to have poor physico-chemical
properties. At the time there was no structural information on the enzyme or
its complexes, so there was little opportunity to avoid these shortcomings.</span></ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins><span lang="EN-GB">As with
COVID-19, the worldwide health implications of HIV were obvious and scientific interactions
between different research groups were driven by a spirit of cooperation. Public
laboratories contributed clinical data and provided access to assays for viral
activity. In 2020 the ability to share data has improved beyond recognition but
the ability to interpret and act on it is still subject to political and
commercial pressures. At Roche, a series of hydroxyethylene inhibitors was not
pursued due to its prior inclusion in multiple patents for renin inhibitors. In
addition, <a href="https://www.treatmentactiongroup.org/resources/tagline/tagline-1997/scammed/">sensitivity
to criticism Link: https://www.treatmentactiongroup.org/resources/tagline/tagline-1997/scammed/ </a> from AIDS activist groups during the project discouraged Roche
from developing follow-up candidates later.</span></ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins><span lang="EN-GB">Many current
predictions and public expectations about COVID-19 now depend on the
availability of vaccines in 2021. After more than three decades of research, no
preventative vaccine is yet available for HIV. However, the ability to treat a
viral infection, even with a drug that contains and controls the infection
rather than eliminates it, should not be undervalued. In 1993 the Roche HIV
protease clinical candidate, Ro 31-8959, was in Phase 2 evaluation. Roberts and
Redshaw pointed out then that lowering a patient’s viral load would reduce the
risk of further infections amongst health-care workers and social contacts,
while the persistence of immature and non-infectious viral material in cells
could stimulate the patient’s own immune system to eliminate the virus.</span></ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins><span lang="EN-GB">Roberts and
Redshaw concluded their 1993 analysis with the statement that "although there is
still much work to be done, we remain very hopeful that Ro 31-8959 will make a
positive contribution to the therapy of AIDS". Two years later Ro-31-8959, as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saquinavir">Saquinavir Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saquinavir </a>, was approved by the FDA and, with Ritonavir, a second protease
inhibitor from Abbott Labs, led to a 64% reduction in deaths from AIDS in the
US over the next 2 years. Let us now hope for the same degree of success from new
COVID-19 treatments.</span></ins></p><ins> </ins></div> <div><p class="titlewrapper"><del></del></p><h1 class="title"><del>Practical Fragments

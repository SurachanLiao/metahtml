        A Republican group has distanced itself from an altered movie poster that appeared on its Facebook page, depicting four progressive congresswomen as &#8216;The Jihad Squad&#8217;. The post sparked outrage among local Democrats.

    </p><p>The now deleted post appeared on the Illinois Republican County Chairman&#8217;s Association Facebook page on Friday evening. The image is a doctored poster&#160;from the 2013&#160;film 'Gangster Squad', with the faces of Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) and Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) photoshopped onto the protagonists.</p><p>&#8220;Jihad Squad,&#8221; the poster reads, with the tagline: &#8220;Political Jihad is their game. If you don&#8217;t agree with their socialist ideology, you&#8217;re racist.&#8221;</p><img alt="'Jihad Squad' meme with Omar &amp; co. on Illinois GOP page angers Democrats" src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABAAAAAJCAQAAACRI2S5AAAAEElEQVR42mNkIAAYRxWAAQAG9gAKqv6+AwAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==" class="read-more__cover lazyload"><img src="https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.07/xxs/5d3508e6dda4c8635d8b4616.png" alt="RT"><p>It is unclear who created the poster, which circulated on social media for quite some time before an unknown GOP operative thought it would be a good idea to post it on the association&#8217;s official page.</p><a class="read-more-big" href="/op-ed/464566-racist-liberals-progressives-civil-war/" target="_blank">

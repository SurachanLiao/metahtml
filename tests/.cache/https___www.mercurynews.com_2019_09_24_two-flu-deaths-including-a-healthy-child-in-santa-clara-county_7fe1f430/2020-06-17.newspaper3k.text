SAN JOSE — Two Santa Clara County residents — an adult with chronic illness and a healthy child who returned from an overseas trip — died of influenza this month, according to county public health officials.

The adult who died was younger than 65 and had a chronic illness, which increased the person’s risk of severe flu complications, according to Director of Public Health Dr. Sara Cody.

The child who died was only described as younger than 18 and previously healthy, who likely contracted the flu while traveling outside the United States, said Cody, who would not say where the child traveled to.

Officials couldn’t confirm whether they had been vaccinated against the flu.

They’re the first Santa Clara County residents to die from influenza since the last flu season ended in May. Health officials in Contra Costa and San Mateo counties said said no flu-related deaths have been reported there since May and those in Alameda County said no one has died from the flu this month.

“While we generally see influenza activity here in the fall and winter, in other parts of the world, the flu circulates all year round, or in the opposite pattern,” Cody said, adding that people traveling overseas should get a flu vaccine.

The county typically does not see flu deaths in September, but each flu season is different, sometimes peaking in late November or as late as March, Cody said.

In addition to tracking people younger than 65 who die from influenza, the state monitors a number of other indicators, including people coming to emergency rooms with flu symptoms, in an effort to gauge the onset and severity of a new season. So far, officials have not seen an uptick that might suggest an early or severe flu season, Cody said.

“Flu season doesn’t obey a calendar, it’s always unpredictable,” she added. “This is earlier than we usually have deaths reported, but we have not seen any other indicators.”

Eight people under the age of 65 died in Santa Clara County during the last flu season, according to the county public health department, with 27 other individuals reporting cases of severe flu.

Health officials reported 10 deaths in Contra Costa County, 14 in Alameda County and four in San Mateo County in 2017-18.

So far this year across California, at least 20 flu deaths occurred between May and September, flu’s off season, according to the California Department of Public Health , although those numbers are preliminary based on the department’s analysis of death certificates. That’s compared to 13 deaths over the same period in 2018.

“It is still too early to predict how severe the upcoming influenza season might be or which strains of influenza virus will predominate earlier or later in the season,” the department said in a written statement Tuesday.

Nationwide, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated 80,000 people died of the flu in 2017-18; of those, 80 percent didn’t get vaccinated.

“Influenza is one of those viruses that can cause very serious illness, even in healthy people and adults,” Cody said.

The flu is a contagious respiratory illness caused by the influenza virus, which can mutate and change each year. Flu vaccines are developed seasonally based on research about what strains of the virus will be most common in the upcoming season, although effectiveness can vary, Cody said.

Flu symptoms can resemble those of the common cold but are more severe, and include fever, aching muscles, fatigue, nasal congestion, coughing and a sore throat.

The flu shot is recommended for all individuals six months and older, and especially for pregnant women, young children, adults over the age of 65, and people with chronic medical conditions such as heart disease, asthma and diabetes, according to health officials.

The flu shot is widely available at commercial pharmacies. County clinics and pharmacies also offer flu shots. Hours for walk-in flu shots are available online, at https://www.scvmc.org/patients-and-visitors/for-patients/Pages/Flu-Clinic-Schedule.aspx.

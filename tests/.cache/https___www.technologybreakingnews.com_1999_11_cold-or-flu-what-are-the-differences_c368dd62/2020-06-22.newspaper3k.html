So how do we know if a person has the flu or a bad cold? In this article, we explain the differences. Cold and influenza are the most common illnesses in humans, according to an article published in The Lancet. Every year, 5-20 percent of the population of America develop flu symptoms. The main difference between cold and flu is that, generally, symptoms of the flu are usually a lot more severe. Each year, more than 200,000 people are hospitalized because of flu complications; flu is responsible for around 23,600 deaths every year. Cold and flu are caused by different viruses, and, in general, the symptoms of flu are worse. Also, there are less likely to be serious complications from cold, such as pneumonia and bacterial infections. The main difference between cold and flu symptoms is that flu more commonly includes fever; the fever can be 100 degrees Fahrenheit or higher and last for 3-5 days. The extreme fatigue associated with flu can persist for weeks. Cold symptoms are generally milder and last about 1 week. Also, runny nose or nasal congestion is more common&#8230; <a href="/go?url=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWVkaWNhbG5ld3N0b2RheS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvNTE2MS5waHA=" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Read full this story</a></p>

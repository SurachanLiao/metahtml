  of the Islamist coup dEtat that followed the Iranian Revolution of 1978-79,
  attacked the US embassy in Tehran and took about 90 hostages. Khomeini would
  not receive US officials for negotiations, he said, because the United States
  was Great Satan. But the US government proposed, and Khomeini accepted,
  that the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) be the mediator. The PLO
  eagerly participated because, it said, it wanted to help protect American
  lives... And then the PLO in fact obtained a promise from Khomeini that the
  safety of the hostages would be guaranteed (it was). The New York Times
  quipped that Yasir Arafat is so busy playing statesman,</span><a href="#_ftn1"><span><span lang="EN-US">[1]</span></span></a><span lang="EN-US">but the New York Times had eagerly built Arafat up for the role (as
  shown below), helping this antisemitic terrorist organization to shine on the
  world stage as powerbroker and benefactor. One is entitled to wonder: What in
  the world is the PLO? How does it get away with this? This piece will
  seek to throw some light on these questions. 
  </span><a name="intro"><span lang="EN-US">__</span></a><span lang="EN-US">_________________________________________________________</span></p> <p><span lang="EN-US">Introduction</span></p> <p><span lang="EN-US">This piece is the second in a series of articles that HIR is producing
  to fill out the historical background necessary to understand US president
  George Bush Jr.'s ongoing war on Iraq. So you may be wondering: What is the
  relevance of the Iranian hostage crisis of 1979 to a US war against Iraq
  taking place in the year 2005? </span></p> <p><span lang="EN-US">In 1979, as I will argue, the US ruling elite produced the Iranian
  hostage crisis in order:</span></p> <blockquote><p><span lang="EN-US">1) to raise the prestige of Khomeini's loudly anti-Israeli Islamists,
  who took over Iran; and</span></p> <p><span lang="EN-US">2) to raise the prestige of the <ins>PLO<span lang="EN-US">.</span></ins> </span></p> </blockquote> <del>PLO.</del> <p><span lang="EN-US">As I will show, these two objectives were subgoals of a more general
  strategy to support Islamist Iran against secular Iraq, and simultaneously to
  generate a diplomatic process towards a PLO state on Israeli soil --
  precisely what the US government is also doing now (and what it did in
  between). The point of all that will be explained further below and in
  subsequent pieces, but I give a general picture of the present situation in
  the <a href="#appendix">appendix</a>.</span></p> <p><span lang="EN-US">In sum, a proper understanding of the hostage crisis of 1979, I aim to
  show, will help us see just how consistently pro-PLO, pro-Iran, and
  pro-Islamist -- and in consequence how anti-Israeli -- US policy has been
  over the years. This piece will focus on the PLO side of the equation; the coming
  pieces will take a closer look at the Iranian connection.

  hostage crisis</span><span lang="EN-US">_____________________________________________________</span></p> <p><span lang="EN-US">The Iranian Revolution of 1978-79 forced the Iranian shah (or king)
  Mohammed Reza Pahlavi to flee the country. The shah had been a repressive,
  right-wing US puppet (</span><span><a href="http://www.hirhome.com/iraniraq/iran-coup.htm" target="_blank"><span lang="EN-US">more on this in
  forthcoming pieces</span></a></span><span lang="EN-US">). After his exile, the de facto head
  of state, soon to be made de jure head of state, became the Ayatollah
  Ruhollah Khomeini, a leader of the opposition forces and an Islamist
  terrorist who achieved undisputed total power when he violently defeated the
  progressive workers movements that had joined his Islamist forces in fighting
  against the shah (more about this important struggle in forthcoming pieces).</span></p> <p><span lang="EN-US">The PLO had not been a mere observer in the events leading up to
  Khomeini's rise to power. In fact, the PLO had been training Iranian
  guerrillas since the early 1970s. As a token of thanks for this, once in
  power, the Ayatollah Khomeini immediately seized the Israeli diplomatic
  mission in Tehran and gave it to the PLO.</span><a href="#_ftn2"><span><span lang="EN-US">[2]</span></span></a><span lang="EN-US">Also: Arafat received a pledge from Ayatollah Khomeini that the Iranians
  would turn to the issue of victory over Israel after Iran had consolidated
  its strength.</span><a href="#_ftn2a"><span><span lang="EN-US">[2a]</span></span></a><span lang="EN-US">The PLO had
  been calling (still is) for the destruction of Israel, so that is what
  victory meant.</span><a href="#_ftn2b"><span><span lang="EN-US">[2b]</span></span></a><span lang="EN-US">Khomeini took
  to denouncing Israel every opportunity he had.</span></p> <p><span lang="EN-US">Later that year, as many will vividly remember, student followers of
  Khomeini in Tehran, protesting that the US had allowed the exiled shah into
  the US for medical treatment, seized the US embassy in Tehran on 4 November
  and took hostage those in it, producing the hostage crisis. They would not
  release the hostages, the students said, until the US turned the shah over
  for trial in Iran. Many were shocked. But what was truly shocking was <ins>this:
 </ins> <del><i>this</i>:
 </del> four days later The New York Times announced that the PLO, a terrorist
  organization, had begun efforts to protect the lives of Americans held
  hostage.</span></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">UNITED
  NATIONS, N.Y., Nov. 7 -- Palestine Liberation Organization officials said in
  interviews here today that a two-member PLO delegation, headed by a leader of
  Al Fatah, the main guerilla group, had arrived in Teheran and had begun
  efforts to protect the lives of Americans held hostage by students in the
  United States Embassy.</span><a name="_ftnref3"><span lang="EN-US">[3]</span></a></p> <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">(For those of you
  whose eyes are popping, I have provided a scan of the original NYT piece in
  the footnote.)</span></p> <p><span lang="EN-US">And why was the PLO doing this?</span></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">In response
  to a question as to whether the initiative of the PLO was an effort to
  improve its image, [PLO spokesperson Rahman] said: It is what we consider
  our moral responsibility toward a group of human beings.</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Really.</span></p> <p><span lang="EN-US">The New York Times </span><span lang="EN-US">also reported that, Zehdi Labib
  Terzi, the chief Palestinian observer here, said that the delegation had been
  the idea of Yasir Arafat, head of the PLO. But somebody else was claiming
  the credit for planting the idea in Arafat's head: the US <ins>government.
 </ins> <del>government.
 </del> In fact, there had been a formal request, as reported in the same NYT piece:</span></p> <blockquote><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In Washington,
  Representative Paul Findley, Republican of Illinois, said that he telephoned
  Mr. Arafat in Beirut yesterday and proposed the mission, knowing that Mr.
  Arafat was a friend of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.</span></p> </blockquote> <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">This may require a
  pause for proper digestion. Yasser Arafat was not nobody. In 1979, he was a friend
  of the Ayatollah Khomeini, whom he had helped install in power, and an
  American congressman was boasting to the press about having phoned Mr.
  Arafat to ask if he could help the United States, a superpower, in a crisis.</span><span lang="EN-US">The PLO didnt
  merely oblige this US congressman but announced happily that it had the
  problem licked:</span></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">Mr. Terzi
  said: We have great hope the Iranian students will respond to our appeal.
  The aim of the mission as reported from here last night was to seek the
  release of the hostages. Today, Mr. Terzi and Mr. Rahman spoke of protecting
  the hostages lives.</span></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">The PLO
  delegation in Teheran will just sit down and reason with the students, Mr.
  Terzi said, adding: We have learned how to handle such cases.</span><a href="#_ftn4"><span><span lang="EN-US">[4]</span></span></a></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">Do you see anything incongruous in how these PLO
  officials swaggered? They breezily announced that they would free the
  hostages in Tehran! The next day they limited themselves to claiming they
  would protect the hostages lives. And how? Theyd sit down with the students
  and talk it out because the PLO, they said, was quite good at this. How nice.
  But at the precise moment these PLO officials spoke, 7 November <ins>1979,
 </ins> <del>1979,
 </del> the Ayatollah Khomeini -- an iron-fisted, repressive Islamist terrorist --
  was putting a rubber stamp on what had been obvious for months: that he was
  the supreme, absolute, and totalitarian ruler of Iran.</span><a href="#_ftn5"><span><span lang="EN-US">[5]</span></span></a><span lang="EN-US">This Ayatollah Khomeini had publicly endorsed the takeover of the US embassy
  in Tehran, and the PLO had yet to have its first official contact with
  Khomeini on the hostage issue. But the PLO was already announcing the problem
  solved? The PLO did not behave like a stateless terrorist group fighting for
  a scrap of land in the Middle East; it strode like an imperial power on its
  way to deal with a vassal state.</span></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">If it waddles like a duck and quacks like a duck...</span></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">What am I saying? That perhaps the PLO was in
  reality an imperial power dealing with vassal states? That would be absurd.
  But a slightly different proposal is not absurd, and it will easily account
  for the PLOs behavior. Make two assumptions: 1) the PLO was (and is) a
  covert US pet, and 2) so was Khomeini. Now the interpretation becomes that
  the United States, a de facto imperial power with client states and organizations
  all over the world, was producing its own Grand Theater. This explains why
  the whole idea of PLO mediation came from the US ruling elite.</span></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">Let us call this my hypothesis.</span></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">Is it reasonable? Let us first see whether my
  hypothesis can account for how the two PLO officials above swaggered. Here is
  my proposal: In the glare of the spotlight, overconfident PLO mercenaries who
  understood that the profile of their organization was being raised by their
  patron superpower, and who could see that the outcome was foreordained,
  became too giddy and spoke too boldly in their first press appearances on
  this matter, going so far as to attribute the whole initiative to Yasser
  Arafat (see above), and to declare the problem solved already. A mistake.</span></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">But my hypothesis can neither stand nor fall on how
  it accounts for such a small detail as this; it must be evaluated against a
  background of facts. And it must form part of a reasonable theory. What
  theory would this be? In other words, if the Iranian hostage crisis was
  US-produced Grand Theater, what was the purpose of it?</span></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">I claim it had two immediate objectives:</span></p> <blockquote><p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">1) To raise the prestige of the PLO, the better to
  generate a diplomatic process leading to a PLO state on Israeli soil.</span></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">2) To present Islamist terrorism as a supposedly
  effective way to oppose Western, and especially US, imperialism, the better
  to win many Muslims to this ideology.</span></p> </blockquote> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">Is this reasonable?</span></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">The first claim will be shocking if you hold to the
  mainstream hypothesis that the US is an ally of Israel. And the second will
  be shocking if you hold to the mainstream hypothesis that the US ruling elite
  fights Islamist terrorism. (The idea that the US ruling elite was sponsoring
  an enemy state may also trouble you, but that is not what I am proposing -- I
  think the Iranian ruling elite is allied with the US ruling elite, and the
  rest is <ins>theater).</ins> </span> <del><i>theater</i>).</del> </p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">However counter-intuitive my proposals may at first
  seem, what matters is whether they agree with the historical evidence.</span></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">I have researched the history of US foreign policy
  towards the Jewish people and state since the 1930s to the present, and this
  evidence supports the view that the US ruling elite -- contrary to the common
  belief -- is an enemy of Israel. These findings will mostly not be addressed
  in this piece, </span><span><a href="http://hirhome.com/israel/hirally.htm" target="_blank"><span lang="EN-US">but you are free to
  consult them</span></a></span><span lang="EN-US">.</span><a href="#_ftn5b"><span><span lang="EN-US">[5b]</span></span></a><span lang="EN-US">As
  for Islamist terrorism, though its foot soldiers certainly do hate the United
  States, their leaders are in my view allied with the US ruling elite, which
  sponsors this ideology in part because it assists US imperialism, as
  it destabilizes the great Asian powers with Muslim populations on their
  borders: Russia, China, and India. It is Jared Israel who first proposed this
  interpretation.</span><a href="#_ftn5c"><span><span lang="EN-US">[5c]</span></span></a></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">The question of US policy towards Iranian Islamism,
  and of the US's broader geopolitical strategy in Asia, will be taken up more
  fully in other HIR pieces, still to come. Here below I will evaluate, against
  a background of relevant facts, my hypothesis that the US ruling elite meant
  to raise the PLO's prestige in 1979, and that, in order to do this, it set
  the Iranian hostage crisis in motion.</span></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><a name="a"><span lang="EN-US">__</span></a><span lang="EN-US">___________________________________________________</span></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">The geopolitical

  _____________________________________________________</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Exhibit A: The PLOs behavior 
  __________________________</span></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">Here is a basic question:</span></p> <blockquote><p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">What should follow the PLOs arrogant declaration,
  made without first speaking to Khomeini, that the PLO will solve a
  hostage-taking which Khomeini has publicly endorsed, in Khomeinis country,
  where Khomeini is the supreme, autocratic, and totalitarian ruler?</span></p> </blockquote> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">The answer to this question will be a prediction
  and what it states will depend, naturally, on our working hypothesis. So let
  us consider two competing hypotheses.</span></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">The mainstream hypothesis:</span></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">Assumptions</span><span lang="EN-US">:
  The US ruling elite is an ally of Israel and an enemy of Islamist
  terrorism. The PLO is what it seems: a stateless terrorist group. And the
  Islamist terrorist Khomeini is also what he seems: the enemy of the US.</span></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">Relevant facts
  not under dispute</span><span lang="EN-US">: Khomeini is the leader of a new
  Islamist state, using the hostage crisis to raise his prestige in his own
  country and on the world stage as a supposed challenger to the United States,
  calling the US Great Satan.</span><a href="#_ftn5d"><span><span lang="EN-US">[5d]</span></span></a><span lang="EN-US">The request
  for PLO mediation has been made by -- of all countries -- Great Satan: the
  United States.</span></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">Prediction</span><span lang="EN-US">:
  As a consequence of the PLOs absurd effrontery, a product of Great Satan
  intervention, Khomeini will protect his prestige and rule out any role for
  PLO mediation.</span></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">My hypothesis:</span></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">Assumptions</span><span lang="EN-US">:
  The US ruling elite is an enemy of Israel. The PLO and Khomeini are both
  covert instruments of the US ruling elite, which is using both instruments to
  conduct Grand Theater on the world stage, one purpose of which is to make the
  PLO shine in a positive light the better to use it against Israel.</span></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">Analysis</span><span lang="EN-US">:
  Under these assumptions, Khomeini will have to allow the PLO to play its role
  and shine, despite its effrontery. Why? Because this is what the US ruling
  elite wants, and they call the shots. Of course, it will be necessary first
  to get PLO officials to tone it down a bit in public, so as not to embarrass
  Khomeini too much because Khomeini is playing his own role: that of defiant
  anti-American leader. He has to look fearless.</span></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">Prediction</span><span lang="EN-US">:
  After some corrective official statements by the PLO to the effect that, <ins>ahem,
 </ins> <del><i>ahem</i>,
 </del> the PLO really cant do anything unless Khomeini gives permission, because
  Khomeini is the boss, Khomeini will allow the PLO to act as mediator, letting
  this terrorist organization shine as supposed protector of American lives.</span></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">Of course, the above are not really
  predictions, because we are looking at the past, not making guesses about the
  future. But that matters little. What matters is which hypothesis is most
  consistent with the facts. Science can look forwards or backwards; what a
  scientist may not do is defend absurdities.</span></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">Let us now review what happened.</span></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">The day immediately after the PLOs Zehdi Labib
  Terzi made his strikingly confident statements that the PLO would solve
  everything quickly, The New York Times reported statements from the
  PLO that sounded a different note:</span></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">PLO
  officials here [in Tehran], appearing somewhat embarrassed, were saying that
  there had been no offer of mediation. The organizations observer at the
  United Nations, Zehdi Labib Terzi, had said the trip was aimed at insuring
  safety of the hostages. The PLO officials here appeared to be concerned that
  the organization not seem to be intruding itself into the situation against
  the wishes of the Ayatollah.</span></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">The PLO
  office in Teheran has never announced such a thing and never has anything
  been said about mediation, said Sakher Darvish, the Palestinian spokesman
  here. This is spread by the press agencies and we completely deny the
  matter.</span></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">...The PLO has
  said at its Beirut headquarters that the mission to Teheran was inspired by
  humanitarian objectives. Officials here, however, were guarded in their
  comments, knowing that any mediation must have the approval of Ayatollah
  Khomeini.</span><a href="#_ftn6"><span><span lang="EN-US">[6]</span></span></a></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">But even as the PLO corrected its exuberance of the
  day before, there was no question that its profile was being raised. The same
  NYT article wrote that,</span></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">The PLO
  appeared to be the strongest hope of negotiating the release of the hostages
  after Ayatollah Khomeini last night refused any meeting with former Attorney
  General Ramsey Clark, named by President Carter as special representative in
  the embassy crisis.</span></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">The PLO: the strongest hope, according to The
  New York <ins>Times.</ins> </span> <del>Times.</del> </p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">And then, two days <ins>later,</ins> <del>later,</del> again consistent
  with my hypothesis, there was the following NYT front page headline:</span></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">NEW IRAN
  OFFICIAL REAFFIRMS DEMAND [THAT] US TURN OVER SHAH BUT CONFERS WITH PLO
  AIDES</span><a href="#_ftn7"><span><span lang="EN-US">[7]</span></span></a></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">Consider the context. The NEW IRAN OFFICIAL was
  Abolhassan Bani-Sadr, Irans new foreign minister in the government that
  Khomeini had just appointed. The shah was the repressive right-wing US puppet
  whom the Khomeini movement had replaced, and he was hated in Iran. The world
  was told that the seizure of the US embassy and its hostages was in
  retaliation for the US having allowed the shah to enter the United States for
  medical treatment. First the students, then Khomeini, and now Khomeinis new
  government were refusing to release the hostages unless the shah were turned
  over for trial in Iran. So what we learn above is that, though the Iranians
  may have been snubbing US representatives, they certainly were talking
  to the PLO. The headline above was saying that the Iranians were tough
  mothers but the PLO might be able to deal with them.</span></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">It was front page news in the New York Times that
  the new Foreign Minister of Iran met with the PLO.</span></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">But if you think that is amazing, consider the <ins>subtitle
 </ins> <del><i>sub</i>title
 </del> for the same article, written in lower case type:</span></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">Foreign Minister
  Also Meets U.S. Chargé</span></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">This was a reference to L. Bruce Laingen, the
  American chargé daffaires under guard in the [Iranian] Foreign Ministry
  building since the takeover of the embassy. So, in the middle of a hostage
  crisis at the US embassy in Iran, The New York Times was treating the
  meeting of Bani-Sadr with the PLO as more important than his meeting with the
  highest-ranking US embassy official in Iran at the time.</span><a href="#_ftn8"><span><span lang="EN-US">[8]</span></span></a></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">The same article explained that The new [Khomeini-appointed]
  Foreign Minister met this morning with two officials of the Palestine
  Liberation Organization, Abu Walid and Hani al-Hassan, head of the PLOs
  office hereDr. Bani-Sadr was scheduled to meet with them again. But The
  New York Times assured its readers that the Ayatollah Khomeini, not the
  PLO, called the shots in Iran, a point that apparently required
  clarification: But they [the PLO] cannot make any move without approval from
  the Ayatollah.</span></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">Something else that is worthy of note is the representation
  of the PLO in The New York Times as brave peace-seekers.</span></p> <blockquote><p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">A PLO official said they must decide soon whether
  to drop the efforts. Already the leaders of Al Fatah, the main guerrilla
  group in the PLO, are under attack from more radical [Palestinian]
  organizations</span></p> </blockquote> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">So the most prestigious print source in the world
  told its readers that the PLO was taking political risks to help the
  hostages; the PLO, therefore, should be considered moderate, said the NYT,
  relative to more radical organizations. This is precisely the
  representation that was required to launch, a little over a decade later, the
  Oslo Peace Process, which the US forced Israel to participate in (consult
  the footnote), and which brought the PLO into Israeli soil, from which
  position it has been much better able to murder innocent Israelis and
  indoctrinate the West Bank and Gaza Arabs into its ecstatic genocidal
  ideology.</span><a href="#_ftn9"><span><span lang="EN-US">[9]</span></span></a><span lang="EN-US">So this is
  consistent with the hypothesis that we are looking at US-driven political theater
  meant, in part, to raise the prestige of the PLO in order to attack Israel --
  so long as we assume, that is, that the New York Times does the

  that the PLO had secured the safety of the hostages, and might yet free them.
  Again, this is consistent with my hypothesis. In fact, the PLO swaggered so
  mightily at this time that it allowed itself to insult the United States
  publicly in the middle of its mediation process, explaining that it was not
  acting impartially but taking Khomeini's side, which the US, by the way, took
  sitting down.</span><a href="#_ftn5a"><span><span lang="EN-US">[10a]</span></span></a></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">One week later The New York Times carried

  merely that he leave the US.</span><a href="#_ftn11a"><span><span lang="EN-US">[11a]</span></span></a><span lang="EN-US">Apparently,

  Mexico there would be no problem</span></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">Amazing. Total confidence was back: the PLO had
  become the de facto Foreign Ministry of Iran, speaking for its

  a senior P.L.O. delegation, including Abu Jihad, Abu Walid (who is in charge

  team, in a series of meetings with Iranian revolutionary leaders arranged by
  Abu Hassan, proposed the assault on the United States Embassy that took place
  on Nov. 4. It is impossible to prove or disprove this report in the absence
  of further details. But Western European intelligence sources report that Abu
  Hassan was one of the counselors who urged Khomeini to reject any prompt
  resolution of the embassy occupation, and that the original assault force
  included several Iranians who had been trained at Palestinian camps in
  Lebanon.</span><a href="#ftn11c"><span><span lang="EN-US">[11c]</span></span></a></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">What happened, in the end?</span></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">The shah was not turned over to Iran, but instead
  spent time in Egypt, Morocco, Bahamas, and Mexico. And the hostages,
  precisely as the PLO promised, were not killed. The US proposed buying the freedom
  of the hostages to the tune of $5.5 billion.</span><a href="#_ftn12"><span><span lang="EN-US">[12]</span></span></a><span lang="EN-US">On
  21 January 1981, the hostages were freed; they had been treated well.</span><a href="#_ftn13"><span><span lang="EN-US">[13]</span></span></a><span lang="EN-US">The payment to Iran was closer to $8 billion -- it was called the largest
  private financial transfer in history, and it came in very handy for Irans
  war with Iraq, which raged since September 1980.</span><a href="#_ftn13a"><span><span lang="EN-US">[13a]</span></span></a></p> <blockquote><p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">[Iran used the money to buy US weapons, which the US
  sent secretly throughout the Iran-Iraq war. When exposed, this was called the
  Iran-gate scandal (or the Iran half of the Iran-Contra scandal, because
  Ronald Reagan was simultaneously training the Contra terrorists who murdered
  innocent peasants in Nicaragua). But that's another story, </span><span><a href="http://www.hirhome.com/iraniraq/gulfwar.htm" target="_blank"><span lang="EN-US">to be told in a
  forthcoming piece</span></a></span><span lang="EN-US">.]</span></p> </blockquote> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">By the time the hostages were released, the PLO was
  keeping itself out of this particular spotlight because the Arab states had
  taken Iraqs side against Iran in the Iran-Iraq war, and the PLO couldnt
  afford to be opposing the entire Arab world (Iraq had an Arab ruling
  elite, and the Iranians are not Arabs). Still, the PLO got to shine quite a
  bit, dressed up as a positive diplomatic force on the world stage.</span></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">The behavior of the PLO, then, is consistent with my
  hypothesis. And so is the behavior of the president of the United States, to
  which I now turn.</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Exhibit B: Jimmy Carters behavior 
  _______________________________</span></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">As you may recall, the officially given reason for
  allowing the exiled Iranian shah into the US had been that he needed medical
  treatment. According to Khomeini, admitting the shah had been the trigger for
  taking the US embassy hostage, and he was promising not to release the
  hostages unless the shah were turned over by the United States for trial in
  Iran. But had the US really admitted the shah for medical reasons? On 21
  March 1980, a NYT editorial proposed instead that The [shahs] medical
  emergency may have been a convenient pretext.</span><a href="#_ftn14"><span><span lang="EN-US">[14]</span></span></a></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">Why this suggestion?</span></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">The New York Times</span><span lang="EN-US">was
  addressing a question that many people had to be turning over in their minds
  because, obviously, President Carter did know that to admit the Shah would
  run at least a diplomatic risk. In fact, [Carter] was warned that admitting
  the Shah might jeopardize the [US] embassy. And yet despite all this Jimmy
  Carter allowed the deposed Iranian dictator into the United States. This
  provided quite a bit of fodder for speculation, because the shah, after all,
  was universally reviled. If admitting him into the United States carried a
  significant probability of losing the US embassy in Tehran to an armed mob,
  Carter obviously should have left him outside, whether or not the shah
  needed US medical treatment.</span></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">It turns out, however, that the shah didn't even
  need US medical treatment. As the NYT piece explained, [David] Rockefeller
  and Henry Kissinger had made the Shah a symbol of American constancy, and David
  Rockefeller, who was a personal friend of the shah, favored the Shahs
  permanent residence in the United States as the least that should be done for
  a former ally. So it is more than a little suspicious that The Shahs
  condition was diagnosed mainly by a single doctor engaged by David
  Rockefeller. This doctor must have been less than honest because there was,
  apparently, no medical emergency requiring a US hospital: [The shahs]
  health did not require him to come to the United States after all...there is
  no special magic to the hospitals in New York.</span></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">So why did Jimmy Carter let the shah in?</span></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">After pointing out the problems with the official
  story, The New York Times proposed this alternative: that Carter's
  move was perhaps meant to test Irans tolerance for the Shahs permanent
  residence in the United States. This is a remarkable hypothesis. Are we to
  believe that Carter, despite having been warned that this might cost him the
  US embassy in Tehran, with 90 people in <ins>it,</ins> <del>it,</del> let the shah into the United
  States, anyway, just to see if something bad really would follow? The
  New York Times would like you to think that the people who run superpower
  states approach foreign policy like the child who, warned not to stick his
  hand into the hornet's nest, does it anyway -- to see what happens. This is
  absurd under any circumstances, but more so with an impending US
  presidential election, and Carter running for a second <ins>term,</ins> <del>term,</del> as was the
  case.</span></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">One does not resolve an apparent absurdity by
  proposing a bigger one.</span></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">My</span><span lang="EN-US">hypothesis says that Khomeini
  belonged to the US ruling elite, and that Jimmy Carter needed to produce the
  appearance of a provocation so that Khomeini could seize the US embassy in
  Tehran. The point? To get the Grand Theater rolling. And why? Because Jimmy
  Carter wanted to raise the profile of both Khomeini and the PLO, his clients.
  Losing the US election was neither here nor there for Carter -- it was part
  of the US ruling elite's Grand Theater (Reagan's policies towards the PLO and
  towards Iran were Carter's</span><a href="#_ftn14a"><span><span lang="EN-US">[14a]</span></span></a><span lang="EN-US">).</span></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">Is this absurd?</span></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">Not if it agrees with the evidence. </span><span><a href="http://www.hirhome.com/iraniraq/gulfwar.htm" target="_blank"><span lang="EN-US">A forthcoming HIR

  relationship of the Ayatollah Khomeini to the US ruling elite of both
  parties, Democrat and Republican; here, let us focus on Jimmy Carter's
  pro-PLO diplomacy.</span></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">Only two years before, in 1977, Jimmy Carter had
  been working overtime to give the PLO the dignity of a government in exile,
  as opposed to the dignity of a terrorist <ins>organization,</ins> <del>organization,</del> and had been
  energetically pushing for the idea of a PLO state.</span><a href="#_ftn15"><span><span lang="EN-US">[15]</span></span></a></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">This is what The New York Times wrote in
  1977:</span></p> <blockquote><p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">[Congress] watches, with a mixture of admiration
  and doubt, Jimmy Carters efforts to reassure the Israelis while trying to
  get them back to the pre-1967 borders with a new Palestinian homeland on
  their flank.</span><a href="#_ftn15a"><span><span lang="EN-US">[15a]</span></span></a></p> </blockquote> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">If Congress had admiration for the presidents
  Middle East diplomacy, which involved </span><span><a href="http://www.hirhome.com/israel/hirally.htm#1967b" target="_blank"><span lang="EN-US">trying
  to force the Israelis to give up strategic territory won in a defensive war
  in which Israel's Arab enemies had meant to exterminate the Israeli Jews</span></a></span><span lang="EN-US">,
  what does this mean?</span><a href="#_ftn15aa"><span><span lang="EN-US">[15aa]</span></span></a><span lang="EN-US">That the US
  government, across the board, favored an anti-Israeli policy.</span></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">And who would Carter's Palestinian homeland be
  for? Two months later, the Associated Press wrote this (my emphasis):</span></p> <blockquote><p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">Reports in the state-controlled Egyptian news media
  said the Americans were suggesting that the Palestinians form a
  government in exile as one way of making themselves eligible for [the] Geneva
  [peace conference]. The argument, the reports said, was that the Palestine
  Liberation Organization cannot now be invited because it does not
  represent a state.</span><a href="#_ftn15b"><span><span lang="EN-US">[15b]</span></span></a></p> </blockquote> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">If the Americans wanted the PLO to have the
  dignity of a government in exile so it could participate at the Geneva
  peace conference, then the US ruling elite was obviously trying to create a
  PLO state. And Jimmy Carter was passionate about this. A few days later, The
  New York Times wrote,</span></p> <blockquote><p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">[US] Sec[retary] of State Vance agrees with Arab
  nations... [and] observes [that] US is anxious over Israeli refusal to accept
  2 Arab pre-conditions to conf[erence], including relinquishment of most of
  the territory occupied since '67 war and acknowledgement of right for
  existence of some kind of Palestinian state. [He] remarks [that] if Israelis
  continue to refuse to make commitments before conference, Pres Carter has
  said that he would publicly issue peace plan.</span><a href="#_ftn15c"><span><span lang="EN-US">[15c]</span></span></a></p> </blockquote> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">The PLO was murdering innocent Israeli civilians, consistent
  with its founding charter mandate, which openly calls for the destruction of
  Israel via the extermination of the Jewish people.</span><a href="#_ftn15d"><span><span lang="EN-US">[15d]</span></span></a><span lang="EN-US">And yet US Secretary of State Cyrus Vance was pretending that the problem was
  the Israeli refusal to accept...right for existence of some kind of
  Palestinian state.  But that's not the end of it. As you can see above,
  either the Israelis would cooperate with Jimmy Carter's effort to create a
  PLO state in the West Bank and Gaza, or Carter would launch the process
  leading to such a state without involving the Israelis: if Israelis continue
  to refuse to make commitments before conference, Pres Carter has said that he
  would publicly issue peace plan. The anti-Israeli stance of the United
  States government was simply extreme. And Carter's position is uncannily
  similar to </span><span><a href="http://www.hirhome.com/israel/hirally2.htm#1991" target="_blank"><span lang="EN-US">the threats that
  George Bush Sr. delivered to the Israelis in 1991</span></a></span><span lang="EN-US">,
  when the US finally succeeded in getting an Israeli government to participate
  in the effort to create a PLO state.</span><a href="#_ftn15e"><span><span lang="EN-US">[15e]</span></span></a></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">The next year, in 1978, when Israel tried to defend
  itself from PLO attacks against its civilians, launched from PLO bases in southern
  Lebanon, United States President Jimmy Carter forced the Israelis to back
  down.</span><a href="#_ftn16"><span><span lang="EN-US">[16]</span></span></a></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">The above is all consistent with my hypothesis, and
  makes it entirely unsurprising that Jimmy Carter should have tried to improve
  the PLO's image the year after, in 1979, by setting in motion the 'hostage
  crisis.' By contrast, the mainstream hypothesis, namely, that the United
  States ruling elite favors Israel, is not supported by the above mountain of
  relevant facts.</span></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">From this perspective, the spectacularly flawed and
  disastrous Delta Force operation to rescue the hostages looks like more Grand
  Theater, there to convince everybody that everything had been tried and now a
  diplomatic <ins>solutionbuying</ins> <del>solution<i>buying</i></del> the
  hostages to the tune of $8 billion, as it turns outwould have to be found.</span></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">But there are other facts, as well, that support my
  hypothesis. I turn to these next.</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Exhibit C: The behavior of US Intelligence and the State Department 
  __________</span></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">Just seven years before the taking of the hostages in
  Tehran, at the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich,</span></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">members of
  the Israeli Olympic team were taken hostage by the Palestinian terrorist
  organization Black Septemberthe attack led directly to the deaths of 11
  Israeli athletes</span><a href="#_ftn17"><span><span lang="EN-US">[17]</span></span></a></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">According to a State Department document unearthed
  by historian Russ Braley, and reproduced on the web by World-Net Daily in
  2002, US Intelligence knew, at least as early as <ins>1973,</ins> <del><i>1973</i>,</del> that
  Black September was just a cover for Yasser Arafat's Al <ins>Fatah,</ins> <del>Fatah,</del> the controlling core of the PLO.</span><a href="#_ftn18"><span><span lang="EN-US">[18]</span></span></a><span lang="EN-US">Indeed, the document says: no significant distinction now can be made
  between the BSO [Black September Organization] and Fatah. The document
  further explains that The collapse of Fatahs guerrilla efforts led Fatah to
  clandestine terrorism against Israel and countries friendly to it. It
  concludes: Fatah leadership including Arafat now seem clearly committed to
  terrorism.</span></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">The 1973 State Department document was sent to
  American embassies all over the world, and they were instructed as follows:
  This brief should not be attributed to CIA in any way, and owing to extreme
  sensitivity of information it should be conveyed orally only. So the State
  Department preferred that the general public not know these things about the
  PLO. </span></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">But why? Why was the confirmation that the PLO was
  responsible for the Munich massacre, and that it would henceforth focus on
  terrorist activity, so sensitive that the public shouldnt know about it?
  Why was it so sensitive that, beyond the recipients of this document, the
  few who could be privy to this information should get it only as a
  rumor, rather than a claim officially confirmed by US Intelligence?</span></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">The mainstream hypothesis that the US government is
  opposed to terrorism and allied with Israel would seem to require the US to
  make this information public in order to embarrass the PLO, because nobody
  denied back then that the PLO was a terrorist organization dedicated to the
  destruction of Israel. If you accept the mainstream hypothesis, then, it is
  not merely awkward but absurd that the US State Department should have
  protected the PLO. And if degrees of absurdity can be contemplated, then the
  US State Department's behavior is radically absurd, because the PLO was
  guilty of murdering US diplomats -- that is to say, employees of the US State
  <ins>Department.</ins> </span> <del>Department.</del> </p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">On that point, consider what else the 1973 State
  Department document mentioned above says:</span></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">Question of
  link between Black September Organization (BSO) and Fatah has been subject of
  much public discussion since murder of US diplomats in <ins>Khartoum.</ins> <del>Khartoum.</del> Fatah
  leader Arafat has disavowed connection with BSO, and many in Arab world and
  elsewhere have pointed to Arafats disavowal as justification for continuing
  financial and other support for Fatah.</span></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">Arafat
  continues to disavow publicly any connection between Fatah and terrorist
  operations. Similarly, Fatah maintains its pretense of moderation vis-à-vis
  the Arab governments, a pose which most of these governments find convenient
  for their public position toward the Palestinian cause. [emphasis added]</span></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">Diplomats are supposed to be sacrosanct in
  international law, so the murder of diplomats is about as serious as a crime
  gets. But the US didn't want to prosecute. On the contrary, the State
  Department -- the employer of the US diplomats whom the PLO murdered in
  Khartoum -- made clear in this 1973 document that assisting the PLOs
  pretense of moderation was vital to the United States government. It kept
  this information secret and assisted Arafats denials, it appears, to avoid
  inflaming the American public against the PLO, and to foster a political
  climate that made it possible for the Arab states to support the PLO under
  guise of furthering the Palestinian cause.</span></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">That was 1973.</span></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">By late 1979</span><span lang="EN-US">, our year of
  focus, despite the State Department's efforts, the general public understood
  perfectly well that the PLO was in the business of killing innocent men,
  women, and children. This was not especially difficult given that PLO terrorism
  from southern Lebanon had made necessary an Israeli invasion in order to
  protect its civilians, as mentioned above. To get a sense for how clear it
  was in the public mind that the PLO was a terrorist organization, consider
  that in September of that year African American leaders of the SCLC (Southern
  Christian Leadership Conference), the late Martin Luther King's organization,
  met with Yasser Arafat. To what end? These fools were there to destroy Kings
  legacy by having a hug fest with a world famous racist, heaven knows why. But
  political correctness required them to say that they were  appealing to the
  PLO to stop killing Israeli men, women and children andurgingthe PLO to
  recognize the right of Israel to exist, [SCLC chairman] Fauntroy said.</span><a href="#_ftn19"><span><span lang="EN-US">[19]</span></span></a><span lang="EN-US">In
  1979, therefore, the public was not confused: it understood that the PLO was
  a terrorist organization.</span></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">So what happened is this: During the Iranian hostage
  crisis of 1979, the United States turned to a famous terrorist organization,
  which the US government knew since 1973 was guilty of murdering American
  citizens, and asked it to -- what? To go save the lives of American
  <ins>citizens.</ins> </span> <del>citizens.</del> </p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">Isn't this an absurdity? It certainly is under the
  mainstream hypothesis, which says that the US ruling elite is a friend of
  Israel and opposed to terrorism, and moreover, responsible to the US
  citizenry, members of whom the PLO had murdered. But under my hypothesis what
  the US ruling elite did is not absurd.</span></p> <blockquote><p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">1) Grant that the PLO cannot help but murder
  innocent Israelis -- it is the PLO's very purpose for existing, as explained
  in its founding charter.</span></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">2) Grant that people are therefore bound to notice
  that the PLO is terrorist (as I've documented above).</span></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">3) Assume that the US ruling elite took the PLO
  under its wing in order better to attack Israel by creating a PLO state on
  Israeli soil.</span></p> </blockquote> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">What follows?</span></p> <blockquote><p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">That the US ruling elite will have an interest in
  mobilizing a dramatic circus to clean up the PLO's international image,
  because without improving the PLO's image as the supposed 'relative
  moderates,' the creation of a PLO state will be impossible</span><span lang="EN-US">.</span></p> </blockquote> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">Under my hypothesis, what the US government did
  makes sense.</span></p> <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">My analysis here supports the view that the PLO is a
  client organization of the US ruling elite, wielded by this elite as a weapon
  against Israel. For more documentation of this hypothesis, consult:</span></p> <blockquote><p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">Is the US an Ally of Israel?: A Chronological Look

  to destroy Iraq as a state, turning it instead into a messy collection of
  militias and Islamist terrorist groups that prey on innocent people and for
  which no state will publicly take responsibility; and</span></span></ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins><span><span lang="EN-US">2)
  upon US withdrawal, to make Iraq a de facto province of Iran.</span></span></ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins><span><span lang="EN-US">This is happening at the same time

  westernmost province, almost borders Israel.</span></span></ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins><span><span lang="EN-US">Important and powerful groups inside
  Lebanon and Syria also mean to destroy the Jewish state, and here too, </span></span><a href="http://www.hirhome.com/israel/hezbollah2.htm"><span><span lang="EN-US">Iran plays a role, through its support of the Lebanese Hezbollah
  terrorists who are also patronized by the government of Syria</span></span> Link: http://www.hirhome.com/israel/hezbollah2.htm </a><span><span lang="EN-US">, a
  situation that US officials appear to approve of. Consider:</span></span></ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins><span><span><span lang="EN-US">...successive American
  administrations have been reluctant to openly push for an end to Syrian
  protection of Hezbollah. In fact, the United States has been unwilling even
  to publicly request that the Syrians end this protection. While this
  stems in part from the long-standing American policy of avoiding public
  statements which mention or suggest that Syria controls Lebanese policy
  decisions, it may also reflect a tendency to underestimate the degree of
  control that Damascus has established over Hezbollah, which is usually
  regarded as an Iranian proxy.</span></span></span><a href="#_ftn1e"><span><span><span lang="EN-US">[1e]</span></span></span> Link: #_ftn1e </a></ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins><span><span lang="EN-US">At first blush this is all consistent
  with an anti-Israeli US policy, as are many other things.</span></span></ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins><span><span lang="EN-US">Notice, for example, in the map above
  that Saudi Arabia is a mortal enemy of Israel which, like Iraq, is prevented
  from having a border with Israel only by diminutive Jordan. Saudi Arabia is
  also ultimately...the largest beneficiary of U.S. weapons sales in the
  entire world [and] one of the most heavily armed countries in the world.</span></span><a href="#_ftn1ab"><span><span><span lang="EN-US">[1ab]</span></span></span> Link: #_ftn1ab </a></ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins><span><span lang="EN-US">Remember, also, that under US
  pressure the Israeli government allowed the PLO to become the sovereign
  in Gaza, with the Gaza-Egypt border no longer even patrolled by Israeli
  troops.</span></span><a href="#_ftn1c"><span><span><span lang="EN-US">[1c]</span></span></span> Link: #_ftn1c </a><span><span lang="EN-US">Though most people dont know this, US Intelligence certainly does:
  PLO/Fatah is an organization
  descended from the WWII Final Solution against the Jews, and chartered to
  finish it<a name="_ftnref1b">.</a></span></span><a href="#_ftn1b"><span><span><span lang="EN-US">[1b]</span></span></span> Link: #_ftn1b </a></ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins><span><span lang="EN-US">Egypt is a country that in fact
  borders Israel in the south and which, in the past, has mobilized wars
  against Israel with the loudly stated objective of exterminating the Israeli
  Jews.</span></span><a href="#_ftn1d"><span><span><span lang="EN-US">[1d]</span></span></span> Link: #_ftn1d </a></ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins><span><span lang="EN-US">One hardly needs to be a military
  strategist to see that the Israeli Jews are being squeezed from all sides
  with their backs against the Mediterranean sea. If a military strategist were
  needed, however, we could turn to the Pentagon, because the Pentagon authored
  a study in 1967 that concluded Israel could not survive without the West Bank
  and Gaza Strip.</span></span><a href="#_ftn1f"><span><span><span lang="EN-US">[1f]</span></span></span> Link: #_ftn1f </a><span><span lang="EN-US">(By the way, the US would like for the West Bank also to be completely
  in PLO hands.) So, taken together, the effects of US policy are to
  prepare the ground for the next great genocide of the Jewish people, which is
  to take place in Israel in the near future -- perhaps the very near future.</span></span></ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins><span><span lang="EN-US">Is this what the US ruling elite
  wants?</span></span></ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="MsoFootnoteText"><ins><span><span lang="EN-US">We cannot exactly say they are against it, because the US
  ruling elite has gone rather out of its way to produce such results. And when
  we look back into history, we find that what happened in 1979 has a
  geopolitical structure identical to the current concatenation of events -- so
  this is no fluke. You may now appreciate why there is good reason to pay
  attention to 1979 when puzzling over present events.</span></span></ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="MsoFootnoteText"><ins><a href="#_ftnref1"><span><span lang="EN-US">[1]</span></span> Link: #_ftnref1 </a><span lang="EN-US">A

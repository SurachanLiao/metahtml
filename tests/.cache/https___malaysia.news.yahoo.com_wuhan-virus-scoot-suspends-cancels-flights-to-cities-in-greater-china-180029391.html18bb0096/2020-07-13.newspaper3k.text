UPDATE: Singapore Airlines and SilkAir have also announced that they are reducing their flights to China from next month.

SINGAPORE — Scoot said it will suspend, cancel and cut flights to a number of cities in Greater China due to weak demand amid the Wuhan virus outbreak.

In a post on Facebook on Friday morning (31 January), the Singapore-based low cost airline said it will suspend flights between Singapore and 11 cities in mainland China - Harbin, Hangzhou, Shenyang, Xi’an, Changsha, Nanchang, Zhengzhou, Ningbo, Jinan, Nanning and Wuxi - from early February until end March 2020.

Affected customers booked on these flights will receive full refund via original mode of payment.

Scoot will also cut frequencies to eight cities - Fuzhou, Guangzhou, Haikou, Kunming, Nanjing, Qingdao, Tianjin and Macau - from 1 February to 28 March 2020.

In addition, Scoot will cancel some flights between Singapore and Guangzhou, Nanjing, Macau and Hong Kong.

Affected customers affected by the cut in flight frequencies and cancellations will be informed about refunds and rebooking options via emails from Scoot.

Meanwhile, SIA also put up a Facebook post providing details of affected SIA and SilkAir flights. It added that affected customers will be notified and re-accommodated onto other flights.

Customers can contact their travel agents or email the Singapore reservations team if they require assistance.

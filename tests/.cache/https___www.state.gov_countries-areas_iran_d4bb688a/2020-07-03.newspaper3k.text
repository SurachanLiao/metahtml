The Islamic regime in Iran is the world’s leading state sponsor of terror. For over 40 years their malign behavior and support for terrorist proxies has spread uncurbed. The implementation of the JCPOA, informally known as the “2015 Iran Nuclear Deal,” has placed even more resources and money at the regime’s disposal, furthering the reach and aggression of their malign activities. This is why the United States left the JCPOA and implemented decisive sanctions to curb the regime’s ability to fund terror.

However, time is running out on international agreements restraining the Iranian regime. For example, the head of the brutal Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Hossein Salami, and 21 other dangerous individuals will be allowed to travel on October 18, 2020. At the same time, the Iranian regime will also be free to sell weapons to anyone including terrorist proxies, and countries like Russia and China will be able to sell the Iranian regime tanks, missiles, and air defense equipment. This could start a new arms race in the Middle East and further destabilize the region and the world.

The international community must stand together against the Iranian regime’s support for terror. Time is ticking.

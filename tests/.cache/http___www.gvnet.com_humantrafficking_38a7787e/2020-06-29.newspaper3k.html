      Trafficking </b><b>&amp;</b><b> Modern-day Slavery<p></p></b></p>
      <p>Around the world,
      millions of people are living in bondage. They labor in fields and
      factories under brutal employers who threaten them with violence if they
      try to escape. They work in homes for families that keep them virtually
      imprisoned. They are forced to work as prostitutes or to beg in the
      streets, fearful of the consequences if they fail to earn their daily
      quota. They are women, men, and children of all ages, and they are often
      held far from home with no money, no connections, and no way to ask for
      help.<p></p></p>
      <p>This is modern
      slavery, a crime that spans the globe, providing ruthless employers with
      an endless supply of people to abuse for financial gain. Human trafficking
      is a crime with many victims: not only those who are
      trafficked, but also the families they leave behind, some of whom never
      see their loved ones again.<p></p></p>
      <p>Trafficking has a
      broad global impact as well. It weakens legitimate economies, fuels
      violence, threatens public health and safety, shatters families, and
      shreds the social fabric that is necessary for progress. And it is an
      affront to our basic values and our fundamental belief that all people
      everywhere deserve to live and work in safety and dignity.<p></p></p>

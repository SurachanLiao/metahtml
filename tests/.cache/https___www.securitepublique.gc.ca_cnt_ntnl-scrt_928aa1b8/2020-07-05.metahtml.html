<main class="col-md-9 col-md-push-3"><h1>National Security</h1><p>The first  priority of the Government of Canada is to protect the safety and security of  Canadians both at home and abroad.</p><p>Public Safety Canada spearheads this effort by coordinating the activities of federal departments and agencies tasked with protecting Canadians and their communities, businesses and interests. Public Safety is also responsible for developing policies and providing advice to the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness.</p><p>The preservation of national security is a multi-faceted endeavor that requires cooperation across a diverse range of initiatives and programs. Public Safety Canada functions as a centralized hub for coordinating work in counter-terrorism, critical infrastructure, cyber security and transportation security.</p><p>Additionally, Public Safety Canada engages with Canadian citizens to ensure that our country's national security efforts reflect and benefit the interests of all communities.</p><h2></h2><p>Protecting our communities from the threat of terrorism is of the utmost importance to the Government of Canada. Guided by Canada's Counter-terrorism Strategy, Public Safety Canada coordinates efforts to align government activities according to the four elements that underpin the Strategy aimed at preventing, detecting, denying and responding to terrorism.</p><p>The success of our counter-terrorism efforts depends on collaboration with all levels of government, including provincial and territorial governments, law enforcement and civil society.</p><h2></h2><p>Public Safety Canada created the Cross-Cultural Roundtable on Security in order to engage Canadian community leaders on matters related to national security. The group provides advice and perspectives to the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness and the Minister of Justice, focusing on emerging developments in national security and their impact on Canada's diverse and pluralistic society.</p><h2></h2><p>The Government of Canada is countering the spread &#8211; or proliferation &#8211;  of chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) weapons by preventing  the acquisition of related goods and technologies, advanced knowledge and expertise  and financial support by illegal CBRN weapons proliferators.</p><h2></h2><p>Disruptions of critical infrastructure could result in catastrophic loss of life or adverse economic effects, and significantly undermine the safety and wellbeing of Canadian communities. Public Safety Canada works with partners to strengthen the resilience of Canada's vital assets and systems such as our electricity grids, transportation, communications and public safety systems.</p><h2></h2><p>In order to embrace the full advantages of cyberspace, Canada must guard against those who would attack our digital infrastructure to undermine our national security, economic prosperity and quality of life. Public Safety Canada works closely with domestic and international partners as part of the global effort to protect critical assets and information and combat cyber crime. </p><h2></h2><p>The Government has created a clear authority for federal Government  institutions to share national security-relevant information with other  designated federal Canadian Government institutions that have national security  responsibilities. &#160;This allows for faster  access to critical information when swift action is required, while respecting  Canadians' security and privacy.</p></main>

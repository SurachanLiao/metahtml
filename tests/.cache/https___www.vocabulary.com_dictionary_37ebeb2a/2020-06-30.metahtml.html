	 	<p class="short">Systematic describes something that is planned out and careful. In your systematic search for your mother's car keys, you start in one room, looking everywhere from bottom to top before moving to the next room.</p>
		<p class="long">Use the adjective systematic to describe things that are orderly and efficient. The Latin root of systematic is systema, an arrangement or system. Think about a multi-step process that you have found the fastest and best way to complete &#8212; you do it over and over. You might be systematic about packing for a long trip or the way you travel up and down the aisles at a grocery store, probably with a list in your hand.</p>

 <span class="level"><span class="part">endemic</span><span class="slash">/</span>
 <span class="level"><span class="part">epidemic</span></span></span>
</a>
			<p>Endemic and epidemic are both words that diseases love, but something endemic is found in a certain placeand is ongoing, and epidemic describes a disease that&#8217;s widespread.

 <span class="level"><span class="part">appraise</span><span class="slash">/</span>
 <span class="level"><span class="part">apprise</span></span></span>
</a>
			<p>To appraise is to estimate the value of something, but  remove the second &#8220;a,&#8221; and you have apprise, which means &#8220;to tell.&#8221; If you hire someone to appraise your house, you might have to apprise your family of the fact that you  now owe the bank more than your house is worth.

 <span class="level"><span class="part">oral</span><span class="slash">/</span>
 <span class="level"><span class="part">verbal</span></span></span></span>
</a>
			<p>Aural refers to the ear or hearing,  and oral to the mouth or speaking. Something verbal is  expressed in words, either spoken or written. Listen to the aural sensations of songs from outer space when you&#8217;ve been gassed for your oral surgery. Then stay non-verbal because you can&#8217;t use words for a  long time after the dentist wakes you up.

</a>
			<p>Aha! A capital is a  stash of money or the government headquarters of a state. Oh, a capitol is a building.

</a>
			<p>Something expedient is helpful to you. If you vote your friend in for student  body president just because you know she&#8217;ll hook you up &#8212; that&#8217;s an expedient choice. But expeditious is speedy, like your expeditious exit from the voting booth  because you know didn&#8217;t do the right thing.

</a>
			<p>You  might see a gorilla in a zoo, but a guerrilla (sometimes spelled with one &#8220;r&#8221;), is someone who belongs  to a group of independent fighters. If you remember your high school Spanish,  you&#8217;ll know the difference.

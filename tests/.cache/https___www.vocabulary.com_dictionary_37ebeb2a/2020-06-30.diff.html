The Latin root of systematic is systema, an arrangement or system. Think about a multi-step process that you have found the fastest and best way to complete — you do it over and over. You might be systematic about packing for a long trip or the way you travel up and down the aisles at a grocery store, probably with a list in your hand.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="centeredContent"><ins></ins></p><h2><ins><a href="/articles/chooseyourwords/">Choose your words Link: /articles/chooseyourwords/ </a></ins></h2><ins> </ins><h3><ins><a href="/articles/chooseyourwords/">Caught between words?

Then stay non-verbal because you can’t use words for a  long time after the dentist wakes you up.

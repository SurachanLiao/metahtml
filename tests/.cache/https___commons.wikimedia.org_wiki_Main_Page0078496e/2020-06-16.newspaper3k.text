Image of the Virgin of Los Remedios ("Lady of the Cures") in the homonymous Baroque chapel of the church of John the Baptist Castile and Le√≥n , Spain. The chapel was built in 1697 by Count of Villarea. The originally Romanesque church (visible in its portal ) was built in the second half of the 12th century and reworked in the 16th century with Gothic Renaissance and Baroque elements, while the reredos behind the image dates from the 18th century.

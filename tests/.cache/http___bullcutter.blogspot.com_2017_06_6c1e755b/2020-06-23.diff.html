again. And again. Every day liberals come up with SOMETHING with
which to “bother” Donald Trump. I say, “bother” because it
really does nothing to him. He “fires back” and just goes on
doing what he does, which is destroying the little fiefdoms of
liberals. The latest is the absurd “notes” Comey says he took the
day he CLAIMS Trump asked (told) him to “forget the Mike Flynn
“investigation.” He says those notes are “evidence” Trump
tried to get him to stop the investigation. Comey has a lot of Trump
in him. Like Trump, when he is “abused” (in his opinion), he
“fights back” in the best way he can. He has no real proof of
anything, so he manufactures some with his “notes.” Dumbocrats,
of course, jump right on it, and are now clamoring for a subpoena to
force him to “turn over his notes” so they can exploit them.</span></span></span></span></span></span></ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="western"><ins><span><span><span><span><span><span>Like
he really NEEDED a subpoena. He WANTS his “notes” to be made
public so he can “get back” at the president for firing him,
Liberals call Comey's “ notes” Trump's “smoking gun,” an
allusion to Nixon's tapes, which, when released, were sure proof of
obstruction of justice, which is a crime, and grounds for
impeachment. But Comey's “notes” aren't nearly “sure proof.”
They are only HIS WORD against that of the president. I expect Comey
to make a feeble effort to keep from releasing them, but it WILL be
feeble. The assumption that his firing was DESIGNED to stop an
investigation is absurd, since the investigation WILL go on, and
agents will work even harder to get to the truth, to avoid being
accused of a coverup.

Out of control.
And that they have to get rid of the guns for law-abiding people to
solve that “problem. They're wrong, of course. They've always been
wrong. Targeting the gun when they should be targeting the PEOPLE who
misuse their guns is short-sighted and stupid. But don't try and tell
them that. They think they're “all-knowing” and that they're
right, on all things. But they're not. And there is evidence all over
the place to prove it. But they ignore it, and keep telling us there
IS no evidence to prove them wrong. Yes, in some places (like
Chicago, where they have ALL their stupid laws in place while gangs
kill each other daily, and kill innocent people in their crossfire)
it IS “out of control. California is another place where they have
a full complement of stupid gun laws that do NOTHING to stop “bad
guys” from killing people with their ILLEGAL guns. It's only going
to get worse, folks, with the entrance of millions of Islamic
terrorists who have SWORN to kill all “unbelievers” in their
silly “religion,” disguised as “refugees,” you can count on
gun violence to skyrocket in the next few years, right along with the
rape figures, since theirs is a “rape culture.” (<a href="http://www.captainsjournal.com/2017/04/20/christians-had-better-gun-up-in-the-face-of-muslim-threats/">The Captain's Journal Link: http://www.captainsjournal.com/2017/04/20/christians-had-better-gun-up-in-the-face-of-muslim-threats/ </a>)</span></span></span></span></span></ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="post-footer-line post-footer-line-1"><ins><span class="post-author vcard">Posted by

small margin in Georgia (where they were supposed to win, BIG) to
delude themselves that they won. Dumocrats winning there was supposed
to be THE END of Trump, signaling that the voters had lost confidence
in him. But what it did show was that the voters still loved Trump,
and they couldn't even BUY an election with $50 million bucks spent.
But they still (on the surface, anyway) call it a victory, signaling
future wins—which aren't going to happen. They've lost FOUR major
elections just lately. And they're going to lose more and more, as
time goes on. But they don't think so. In their muddled world,
they're “gaining momentum” and will soon start winning again.
They just can't accept the fact that it is THEMSELVES who are at
fault in losing these elections. They keep promoting their socialist
ideas, ignoring the fact that the American people just aren't
interested in their giveaways.

THREE random people ”because he hated white people” and who
shouted “Allahu Akbar” as he did so was a felon in possession of
a gun. California has ALL the anti-gun fools' silly laws in force,
but none of them prevented this crazy felon from getting the gun he
used to kill three random innocent people. What I want to know is,
when are the anti-gun fools going to wake up to the fact that NONE of
their laws do ANYTHING to prevent gun violence and, in fact, INCREASE
it, by disarming honest, law-abiding people? I keep asking it, but I
never get an answer. They ignore me. Chicago is another glaring
example. They also have all the “tough gun laws,” but their
streets are “running red with blood,” as gang members kill one
another while innocent people, including CHILDREN, get caught in the
cross-fire.

open carry will be dangerous and get more cops killed.” Which shows
his complete stupidity on the subject. Rank and file cops KNOW that
more guns in the hands of law-abiding people is NOT a danger, and, in
fact, means there could be some HELP for cops from that sector. His
opinion completely IGNORES the millions of ILLEGAL guns already in
the hands of NON-law-abiding people, which IS a danger; not only to
cops, but to everybody. Many “top cops” have never been “in the
trenches,” and consequently know nothing about how things work.
This is apparently one of those, or if he was, he never LEARNED the
way the world works. The “gun violence problem” does not come
from the law-abiding, but from the CRIMINALS, crazies, and Islamic
terrorists. And keeping guns out of the hands of GOOD people only
gets them killed. But this chief will never learn that. He needs to
look at the gun violence and see how many are caused by people
legally allowed to have and carry guns, vs. those with ILLEGAL guns.
It they even bother to keep such records, he will no doubt find that
most, if not ALL of them are committed by holders OF ILLEGAL guns. IF
he's interested.

they are “resisting” is the lawfully elected president, and all
his works, which are DESIGNED to “drain the swamp” in DC. And
they ARE “the swamp.” They're trying mightily to make their
violent politics seem to be a “logical reaction” to something
bad. It is NOT. It is merely their reaction to LOSING the election
because they had a lousy candidate, and we had a good one, dedicated
to getting rid of their attempts to establish socialism as the ruling
idea in this country.. They just can't accept that, and they're
working HARD to reverse that election, by any means necessary. And
those means include PAID “demonstrations” in which demonstrators
are INSTRUCTED to become violent, imaginary “charges” against
Trump AND his people, including a daily “anal exam” they use, in
hopes of coming up with something, ANYTHING they can use against
them. Lavrenti Beria said to Stalin, "Show me the man, and I'll FIND the crime he has committed." Left unsaid is that if no crime exists, I'll CREATE one.

market collapsing” after Trump got elected. They can't have it both
ways, but they just can't see that. They were crying and whining
before over the fact that people were buying guns in record numbers
during Obama's tenure because so many people wanted to get their guns
before Obama took that right away.. Now they're crying about the gun
market “collapsing” after Trump got elected, and they're
“surprised. The poor gun sellers! Boo, hoo! There's a reason for it
that they won't talk about. People know that gun rights will be
respected under Trump, so they aren't buying guns in record numbers.
They want us to think that there's something “sinister” in the
reduced gun sales—but there is NOT. It's just an expected reaction
(to intelligent people) to Trump's election.

and killed a burglar who was at the time assaulting him in his own

They've
lost the presidency. They've lost THOUSANDS of seats in state
legislatures, as well as many governorships. They're in panic. Every
day comes a new attempt to displace the legally elected president of
the United States. None of them are based on EVIDENCE, only on lies,
innuendo, and twisted facts. They can't come up with anything REAL,
so they make it up, hoping something will stick. So far, nothing has.
Not the “Russian connection” pipe dream, nor the Comey
firing/obstruction of justice fairy tale. They criticize him for
everything they can, including the fairy tale that, at official
dinners, he gets TWO SCOOPS of ice cream while the rest get only one.
They go after all his people, giving them regular “anal exams,”
hoping something there will stick. One of the latest is their attempt
on Kellyanne Conway, and the “fake news” story that his attorney
general is about to either be fired or resign. They PAY people to go
out and create violent riots, claiming they are “spontaneous.” It
would be comical if it weren't so serious.

For the longest time
they have been clamoring for FBI Director Comey to be fired—so
Trump fired him. Now they're whining and crying about him being
fired--and HOW he was fired. Firing a top government official like
that is not done,” they say. ANYTHING they figure they can whine
and cry crocodile tears over, they do. They really think the American
people don't notice—and they're right, with those who “pay no
attention to politics” and still vote. Now they're changing the
direction of their BS. They're “jumping on” Trump's crack about
“recordings,” saying now that he IS recording his visits in the
White House, and now they want to SUBPOENA those tapes—which may
not even exist. They KNOW they do not exist, but they pretend they do
exist, and when Trump says they don't exist, they accuse him of a
“coverup.” There's no evidence of a coverup, either, but they
will insist on it, to their dying day. (Just common sense)</span></span></span></span></span></span></ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="post-footer-line post-footer-line-1"><ins><span class="post-author vcard">Posted by

that—but they won't. And she is apparently too stupid to realize
it. If her kind of gun laws prevented “gun violence,” there
wouldn't have been 29 people shot in Chicago in 18 hours, which HAS a
bunch of her kind of gun laws in effect. She and her fellow fools
just don't realize that all their efforts do not work, because
they're all concentrated on the GUN, not the PEOPLE. You have to make
use of a gun worth many more years in prison--or death, to do any
good at all, if only it takes those who DO commit violence off the
streets for a longer period of time.

some teachers are allowed to bring their LICENSED guns to school, so
they will be able to shoot back if some crazy comes in to kill a few
students. He's pushing legislation to take away from administrators
the power to ALLOW certain licensed shooter teachers to bring their
guns to school. He says his bill “closes the loophole in the
'gun-free school' act.” He further says, “A safe learning
environment is essential for our children to be successful in the
classroom. That’s not possible if a school district allows armed
civilians to roam California school campuses.” He does not tell us
how making teachers defenseless when somebody IGNORES that “:gun
free zone” and brings his ILLEGAL gun in and kills a few students.
As with all anti-gun fools, he doesn't tell us how DISARMING people
does not make them defenseless. That's apparently “above his pay
grade.” As is everything else.

says, “There is a life or death battle going on in this country for
gun safety, and caring Americans support gun control. Others support
the gun lobby.” (Hee, hee!) It's hilarious how the anti-gun fools
think they have the only right position while anybody on the other
side just “supports the gun lobby.” That might be true if only
their silly ideas ever WORKED. Not a single “gun law” pushed upon
us by Shannon and her fellow goons has ever saved a SINGLE life. On
the contrary, they have COST lives by disarming law-abiding people
while IGNORING the millions of ILLEGAL guns there are out there in
the hands of people who wish to do us harm. She really thinks her
brand of “gun control” gives her the “high ground,” while we
get the “low ground.” This is one cocky broad whose ideas MIGHT
change if she ever encountered a criminal with a gun. That's if she
doesn't already carry her own gun, as so many anti-gun fools do.

by the anti-gun fools to make sure NOBODY who is law-abiding is ever
allowed to have a gun to defend him/herself from such attacks. That's
what the anti-gun fools do: make sure everybody is DEFENSELESS if
they OBEY laws—which it is obvious this shooter does NOT. The
anti-gun fools have no imagination. They know only one way to MAYBE
stop “gun violence” in America. That is to take away the means of
self defense from people who obey laws. That this makes those people
DEFENSELESS means nothing to them, apparently. Lawless people are not
bothered by their laws. They just go out and shoot people and DAMN

nothing there to stop him killing everyone there in the time it took

Republican congresspeople were practicing for a charity baseball game
when shots rang out, seriously wounding one congressman and two cops, among others.
There were MANY congresspeople there, most without any kind of
protection from people such as this Bernie Sanders supporter/Trump
hater. Scalise has a security detail, and they sprung into action,
first pinning him down, then killing the shooter before he could hurt any more people. Two “guys
with guns” stopped this from becoming a massacre of specifically
Republicans. It is said that he specifically ASKED if these were
Democrats or Republicans before opening fire. When innocently told
they were Republicans, he happily opened fire, hoping to kill as many
as he could. This proves again what I've been saying, all along. That
one or two guns on the premises can STOP such shootings in their
tracks. But the anti-gun fools still aren't listening, and are
already demanding more of their USELESS laws keeping honest citizens
unarmed and defenseless.

absolutely, the actions of Muslims, wherever they live. It enslaves
women to their men, and its basic tenets are contrary to the
Constitution of the United States. Now they want to extend it to
Americans, and that is largely OPPOSED by intelligent Americans. In
Denver the other day, they held a “demonstration” on the steps of
the State Capitol building in SUPPORT of Sharia. On the other side of
the street, separated by many cops, was a counter demonstration in
OPPOSITION to Sharia Law, It was largely a peaceful demonstration on
both sides, though there was lots of shouting and name-calling, on
both sides. The only arrests made were on a couple of Sharia
opposition demonstrators who got righteously indignant at something
the Sharia supporters said, and tried to take a punch at the person
who said it. One woman told us we were “misrepresenting” Sharia,
and that our minds were made up and not subject to changing. But
Sharia speaks for itself. She cannot say HOW we “misrepresented
it,” because we haven't. We have NOT “misrepresented it,” but
have merely looked at it and told the truth about what it says. It is
the ENEMY of constitutional law, and has NO PLACE in America, not
even for Muslims who live here. If they are American citizens, they
are subject to the Constitution and OUR laws, NOT Sharia. Sharia takes away their
rights, and the Constitution RECOGNIZES and guarantees certain human
rights that Sharia takes away.

an automatic weapon. When they arrived, they discovered it was not a

“warning” not to do that again. I guess they hoped the cat would
obey their “warning” and no longer carry around something that
looked like a gun. How absolutely STUPID is that? Like “school

restrictions on gun ownership, and use. He hasn't yet been able to
get rid of many laws passed by a Democrat Congress, but he has ENDED
those “rules” made by fiat (executive orders). Gun sales in
America are going down, since the people are no longer afraid of
further restraints on their ability to get and use the means to self
defense, a gun. Before now, “authorities” have worked HARD to
keep Americans from being able to defend themselves against the
ILLEGAL guns arrayed against them by criminals, crazies, and Islamic
terrorists. They seemed more interested in keeping us from being able
to defend ourselves than lowering “gun violence.” And that may
continue locally for a while. They (in some places) even targeted
stun guns and other non-gun methods of self defense. If it could
possibly be used in self defense, they wanted to BAN it. But that is
mostly going away, thanks to Trump's election as president.

old mob wars, who served his time, has a simple cure for terrorism: “Kill terrorists.”
Don't “capture” them and put them in a prison at GITMO or
anywhere else. Just KILL them. That's all they understand. Then hang
them up for all to see and call the media. You can't stop them,
otherwise. The only answer is to kill as many of them as you can and let other terrorists know what you're doing.
Dead terrorists don't kill many unbelievers. And that's what they do:
kill everybody who refuses to believe in their phony “religion.”
Or their VERSION of their “religion.” They are convinced, through
brainwashing, that theirs is the ONLY “true religion,” and that
they should shun or KILL those who refuse to convert to it. And
there's no reasoning with them, and no “negotiating.” They
believe that, to kill “unbelievers” is their highest calling and,
if they, themselves, get killed in the attempt, they'll get
possession of 74 “virgins” with which they can have sex forever
while they for some reason REMAIN virgins. A silly belief, but
they're convinced.

Michael Bloomberg is determined to violate our constitutional right
to own and use a gun for self defense. Apparently he believes that
anti-gun fool crap that the way to self defense is to DISARM yourself
and “run away” while waiting the eternal (seems like) time it
takes for a cop (with his gun) to get there. He has pledged to spend
another $25 million this year to take away our right to self defense
and the tools to make it possible, Many politicians are right with
him, criminalizing everything that possibly can become a self defense
weapon, everywhere, as soon as it is discovered. But the people are
NOT “with him,” which is why, no matter how much money he spends,
he loses most of the time his atrocities are actually put up to a
popular vote. The NRA depends on private contributions of millions of
people, not on “buying” the votes necessary to pass his
atrocities.

used to describe other investigations in DC, many of which have been
going on for months, and using up the time of many congresspeople and
appointed officials and costing millions of dollars, to
discover—nothing. I'll tell you what the BIGGEST “nothingburger”
in DC is—it's the investigation into the “Russian Connection”
and the imagined Trump collaboration with it. There is not a single
shred of evidence to support the contention of the Dumocrats that the
Russians had Trump's collaboration with ANY Russian attempts to
undermine and subvert our election, but they persist in insisting it
is true, and are spending $millions of our tax dollars to prove the

him. La Te Dah! So the hell WHAT? I don't think there's anybody right
now who RATES assassination more than he does. But frankly, if Trump
wanted to get rid of this pot-bellied cartoon dictator and all his
cartoon generals with their medals reaching down to their knees, he'd
just send a MOAB bomb to explode over wherever he is that day. I'm
sure they're keeping track of his movements and location at all
times. But again, quite frankly, I think assassination would be am
much better way of dealing with this fool, as it would kill a lot
fewer of his citizens” than would an airstrike. He's certainly
doing everything he can to EARN an assassination, but he's really not
important enough to bother. I'm surprised somebody else hasn't
assassinated him, already. Maybe a relative of one of the cartoon
generals he has murdered. <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/05/05/north-korea-accuses-us-south-korea-kim-jong-un-assassination-plot.html">(Fox News) Link: http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/05/05/north-korea-accuses-us-south-korea-kim-jong-un-assassination-plot.html </a></span></span></span></span></span></span></ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="post-footer-line post-footer-line-1"><ins><span class="post-author vcard">Posted by

The worst of them is the fiction that taking guns out of the equation
would stop violent crime. It would NOT. If there were no guns, the
“bad guys” would find some other way to commit their violence, as
they did before guns became common. Another fool notion is that
“gun-free zones” will keep people from bringing guns into them
and thus there will be no shootings there. Recent developments prove
otherwise. Actual mass shooters have told us they SEEK OUT gun-free
zones in which to do their dirty work. For instance: “Everytown For
Gun Safety” (a silly name at best) was forced to note recently that
there have been 220 SCHOOL shootings in America since 2013. And that
doesn't even count shootings in OTHER “gun-free zones.” Since ALL
schools in America are gun-free zones, that says a lot. The entire
idea that making laws against law-abiding people getting guns to use
in self defense is a “damfool notion.” They do NOTHING to prevent
people from getting guns ILLEGALLY, and only make law-abiding people
DEFENSELESS against the millions of ILLEGAL guns out there. Laws made
to control the PEOPLE who misuse guns would do a lot more. The gun
laws they do have have not prevented a SINGLE gun crime.

such a critic to a DUEL! He wanted to KILL him! Frankly—and correct
me if I'm wrong—I don't think anyone before has ever shown
him/herself holding the severed head (however phony) of a sitting
president. That was so ignorant, it doesn't even rise to importance.
But she did it, and I thought the response was pretty mild. But
whatever the president, or any member of his family said about her
silly picture, she had it coming. And if it ruins her career, so be
it. She brought it on herself.

rid of all the more conservative hosts, while bringing in more
liberal ones, such as Marie Harf, a former Obama spokesbabe. With
their recent firing of their TOP ratings-getter, Bill O'reilly,

questionable sexual misconduct “charges,” they shook up their entire
list, moving “The five” to the old post-O'reilly slot and

“Outnumbered” is also VERY similar to “The Five, in that is is

supposed to be that the male guest is supposed to be opposed to the
women  and the show a “fight” between them. But it never works
out that way because the man always plays the admiring guest, rarely
disagreeing with them. Meanwhile, the women, who all wear the usual
VERY short dresses, display their considerable legs—which I think
is the understated prime attraction of the show. Don't get me
wrong—I'm certainly not complaining, I'm just commenting. They
ought to call that show, “Legs.” It would be much more
descriptive. But my overall point is that almost ALL their new shows
are like “cookie cutters” of previous, more successful ones. I
predict that their ratings will soon start their fast downward slide,
if they haven't already, through bad management. (Just common sense)</span></span></span></span></span></span></ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="post-footer-line post-footer-line-1"><ins><span class="post-author vcard">Posted by

in Iowa, hoping to defeat the measure that was moving through the
legislature to be called the “stand your ground” law to replace
the “responsibility to run” thing. That is, if you can outrun
bullets fired by criminals from their ILLEGAL guns. Their “massive
turnout” included SEVEN well-paid members of “MOMS.” And it was
a massive failure, as the bill passed, and was signed into law by the
governor the other day. Iowa then became the latest of the 35 “stand
your ground” states. Which is a majority. MOMS claims a massive
membership, but can't turn out even TEN paid members to their
“demonstrations” in many places; Iowa being one of them. That

of it (sometimes MOST of it) being </span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>taken</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>by the government and GIVEN, </span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>unearned,</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>to those who “needed” it, making NEED a DEMAND on the earnings of
others. Never mind their “system” depended upon the THEFT of new
wealth from what few were left to earn it, for the benefit of those
who, for whatever reason, did NOT earn it. Never mind it destroyed
personal initiative. I could go on and on, but there are too many
people just not listening. That's why some people still favor
communism and the idea survives, even though it has failed wherever
it has been tried, eventually, Russia is one example, and Venezuela,
where people are RIOTING as a result of it, is another. It is in its
“death throes” there, right now.

Period. Why? Because they infringe on a constitutional right. For
instance: the law that in some states says the applicant for a “carry
permit” must demonstrate a NEED for such a permit IS an
infringement on a constitutional right. Look at it this way: what if
the government told you that you must demonstrate a NEED before you
can speak freely (under the First Amendment on freedom of speech)?
That would be immediately recognized as being ABSURD, wouldn't it?
Why then, can states get away with requiring a NEED before they will
issue a carry permit? Limits on how guns can be stored are similarly
infringements. In one state, you can get a “carry permit,” but
the gun you carry MUST BE UNLOADED! What the hell good does an
UNLOADED gun do you? Gun locks make it virtually impossible to get
your gun into operation fast enough to deal with a criminal with an
ILLEGAL  gun. And they do NOTHING to hinder that CRIMINAL'S use of
his illegal gun to kill you while you try to get to your
legally-owned gun.

want to live in a world where young, dumb people advise my president,

ANYTHING. Everything they've “learned” in school is wrong. And
from what I've seen of them, their advice would be a disaster. One
thing about them is that they regard freedom of speech to be theirs

Not only are guns mostly outlawed, despite
the constitutional prohibition on such things, so are knives, and
other forms of self defense devices. Things like “The Asp” are
mostly designated as “law enforcement only,” and are a favorite
for them. But not for us. If we are found with one, it is routinely
confiscated, and we are sometimes even punished for having it. Same
with Tasers and other stun guns. They're legal on paper (but illegal
in other places), but if they get used in self defense, they take
them away, too. In some places they even charge us with a crime for
using them, even in pure self defense. ANYTHING that is used as a
weapon, even in self defense, is “frowned upon” by law
enforcement. And Lo and behold, if you use a gun, even against a
deadly criminal who would murder you, often they file charges against
YOU. I have come to the conclusion that they just want to make self
defense itself illegal. There are many items legally owned that CAN
be used in a pinch as a self defense weapon, but if you do, they'll
be often “labeled” a weapon, and you will often be punished for
their use. This must STOP. But it probably won't be soon.

ice floe knowing he's gonna starve because the ice is melting. Only
one problem. It was a phony. Polar bears can swim hundreds of miles
and are NOT facing hardship or extinction because the “ice is
melting.” The ice is NOT melting. Believers tell you it is, but
they're lying. In fact, it has INCREASED considerably in recent
years. Global warming (or climate change as they call it now) is a
CON. A SWINDLE that has made $BILLIONS for the con men spreading it's
goo, most notably former VP AlGore, and more recently, Barack Obama.
Believers in the global warming “religion” are now trying to get
laws made to make questioning global warming a CRIME. They want to
JAIL people for doubting them. They can't back up their fairy tales

Governor Gavin Newsom thinks he's doing.
He used Twitter to “call out” the NRA, and said “gun control
saves lives.” Of course, he just SAID that. He didn't offer any
proof. He didn't have any. He said “gun laws have won the day,”
but they haven't. Even other anti-gun fools like Shannon watts, boss
lady of “MOMS Against Guns” (or something like that) think “gun
violence in California is out of control” .He's the typical kind of
brain-dead politician they usually elect in California. How Reagan
ever got elected there, is a mystery. They must have been ignorant on
what he stood for. The NRA fired back, saying , “even Californians
have the </span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>Constitutional
right</span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>to be armed.” Like every anti-gun fool politician, he thinks he can
“ride roughshod” over the Second Amendment—but he can't. He
make MAKE his unconstitutional laws, but when they get to the Supreme
Court, they'll be “tossed out with the other trash,” where they
belong. Unfortunately, they will have been long-enforced until then.
Some people will be out a lot of money in fines, in prison, or dead
because they couldn't get the means for self defense.

Period. If guns didn't exist, there would still be violence, and the
people wanting to DO violence would use the next best thing, as they
did years ago when guns DIDN'T exist, or were too costly for most
people. They used knives. They used swords; or clubs—or their bare
hands. Whatever was at hand. I don't recall anybody ever bemoaning
“sword violence” 200 or 300 years ago. It was “just violence.”
Islamic terrorists and their “fellow travelers” even use CARS,
and TRUCKS to kill people. They also use explosives. The point is,
is, it's NOT “gun violence,” it's just plain VIOLENCE.</span></span></span></span></span></span></ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="western"><ins><span><span><span><span><span><span>And those
who wish to DO violence will do it, using whatever is available. And
taking away the means for “parity” with those using guns to
commit violence is STUPID. But the anti-gun fools work HARD to do
just that. “Bad guys” have no trouble getting their guns,
ILLEGALLY. Honest people have more trouble getting guns than do bad
guys, making honest people “easy targets” for violence committed
by “bad guys with guns.” Disarming yourself is NOT the way to
self defense. But somehow, the anti-gun fools don't understand that.
They SHUDDER to think of law-abiding people being armed in self
defense, but IGNORE all the “bad guys,” who have guns, out there.
I just saw a video of a mugger trying his best to KILL his victim,
after already shooting him once. The only thing that saved this
victim was the thug's gun jamming, probably due to lack of knowledge
in gun handling. (Just common sense)</span></span></span></span></span></span></ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="post-footer-line post-footer-line-1"><ins><span class="post-author vcard">Posted by

he murdered because he was about to reveal something that will shoot
Hillary “down in flames?” His murder is not the first time
someone has been killed just before testifying to something Hillary
or Bill don't want on the record. The cops, who regularly release
security videos of such crimes when they are available, refused to
release this one, which DOES exist. All efforts at gaining
information about this murder have been rebuffed, by all
“authorities” concerned. The doctor who is thought to have
declared him dead is a known associate of the Obamas, and visited the
White House regularly. Veeeery suspicious.

eliminate the jobs of those local judges who pretend to know more

totally IGNORING those millions of ILLEGAL guns out there in the
hands of criminals. The very things they get all bent out of shape
over PROVE the absurdity of their thinking. A CHILD brings a
transparent WATER pistol to school, or chews a Pop Tart into a shape
that LOOKS like a gun. You can't stop children from playing “cops
and robbers.” Both will get the child suspended, maybe expelled.
Now they want to put them in JAIL! Then there's the child who pointed
his FINGER at another child while playing a game. The school
suspended that child, and threatened expulsion. Talk about PARANOIA!

We are doing all we can to protect our families. But imagine going through this crisis with not enough food to feed your family. No hope of isolating yourself and your loved ones because you live in a crowded home with many others.

That's the reality for millions of refugees. And that's why we need your help to act now.

UNHCR Malaysia's work for protection, health and assistance services will continue for highly vulnerable refugees, even during the movement control order. But we can't tackle this alone.

We will only overcome this crisis if we unite and help the most vulnerable refugees together.

As the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi says, "the worst of crises requires the best of humanity."

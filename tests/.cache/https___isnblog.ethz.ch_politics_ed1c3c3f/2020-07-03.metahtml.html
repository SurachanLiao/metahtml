</p><p>In a world of complexity, interconnectedness, uncertainty, and rapid social, economic and political transformations, policy-makers increasingly demand scientifically robust policy-advice as a form of guidance for policy-decisions. As a result, scientists in academia and beyond are expected to focus on policy-relevant research questions and contribute to the solution of complicated, oftentimes transnational, if not global policy problems. Being policy-relevant means to supply future-related, forward-looking knowledge &#8211; a task that does not come easy to a profession that traditionally focuses on the empirical study of the past and present, values the academic freedom of inquiry, and often sees its role in society as confronting and challenging power and hierarchy.</p><p class="read-more-button-wrap"><a href="https://isnblog.ethz.ch/security/the-politics-and-science-of-the-future#more-66569" class="more-link"><span class="faux-button">Continue reading</span> <span class="screen-reader-text">&#8220;The Politics and Science of the Future&#8221;</span></a></p><ul class="post-meta">

This is a dangerous bet by a regime afraid of economic downturn and appearing weak &#8211; similar to several other regimes with strongman leaders. Given Belarusians lack faith in the government&#8217;s response and official data, they are taking personal responsibility for their fate. This goes against the grain of the political culture in the country and underscores that authoritarian regimes&#8217; habitual methods may reach their limits during such a crisis.</p><p class="read-more-button-wrap"><a href="https://isnblog.ethz.ch/politics/europes-outlier-belarus-and-covid-19#more-66272" class="more-link"><span class="faux-button">Continue reading</span> <span class="screen-reader-text">&#8220;Europe&#8217;s Outlier: Belarus and Covid-19&#8221;</span></a></p><ul class="post-meta">

In doing so, he surprised the elite and even some in the presidential administration, deceiving those around him&#8212;though not the public&#8212;with his talk of changes in leadership and overhauling Russia&#8217;s political system. His real intentions are impossible to know, but his priority is clear: keeping his options open.</p></article></main>

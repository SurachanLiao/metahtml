<div><p>Relatives of Aisyah also came out to say that she believed that she was traveling to China to appear in a comedy film. Aisyah&#8217;s mother, Benah, stated that it was &#8220;impossible&#8221; that her daughter was an assassin: &#8220;My daughter is not like that, she is just a country girl.&#8221;</p><p>The assassination has launched a great deal of speculation into who, exactly, is responsible. Many believe that the North Korean government organized the hit, due to the reigning family&#8217;s complicated relationship to Jong-Nam. Jong-Nam was a public critic of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, as it is known internally.</p><p>Although Jong-Nam was the eldest son of previous dictator Kim Jong-Il, it was clear early on to the family that Jong-Nam lacked the particular leadership skills they felt were necessary. Born in 1971 to Jong-Il and actress Song Hye-rim, it is speculated that the dictator at the time and Jong-Il&#8217;s father, Kim Il-sung, disapproved of his son&#8217;s relationship with Song, who was still married and had children when they began their relationship. Because of this, Jong-Nam was kept out of school and essentially hidden away. Nonetheless, his father doted on Jong-Nam, even sleeping in a bed with him. In 1979, Jong-Nam left North Korea to study outside the country, and apparently his father was so upset that he got drunk and wept.</p><p>In 2001, Jong-Nam was caught using a fake passport to enter Japan, claiming he wanted to visit Disneyland in Tokyo. It is thought that this embarrassed Jong-Il, costing Jong-Nam succession to his father&#8217;s position. Jong-Il died in 2011, allowing Jong-Nam&#8217;s younger brother access to his position as Dear Leader. Then, in 2012, Jong-Nam wrote a book in which he criticized his family&#8217;s control of North Korea, and stated his belief that his younger brother lacked leadership skills, further pushing him out of favor.</p><p>Jong-Nam gained a reputation as a playboy and jet-setter, but was living with his wife and two children in Macau on the south of China at the time of his death.</p><p>The Malaysian government has not agreed to release the body or autopsy reports to North Korea until a DNA sample is provided from one of Jong-Nam&#8217;s relatives.&#160;&#8220;So far no family member or next of kin has come to identify or claim the body,&#8221; Abdul Samah Mat said. &#8220;We need a DNA sample of a family member to match the profile of the dead person. North Korea has submitted a request to claim the body but before we release the body we have to identify who the body belongs to.&#8221;</p></div>

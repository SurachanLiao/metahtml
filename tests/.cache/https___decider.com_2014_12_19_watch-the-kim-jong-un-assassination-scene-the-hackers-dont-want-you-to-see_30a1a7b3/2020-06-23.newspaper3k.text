It was inevitable for bits and pieces of the now-cancelled comedy The Interview to hit the Internet (and who knows how long it’ll take for the whole movie to find its way online?), particularly the most controversial scene of all: the assassination of North Korea’s Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un.

Defamer got its hands on a GIF of the money shot, which they ran on Monday evening long before the shit — and the flames consuming Kim Jong-un’s face, really hit the fan.

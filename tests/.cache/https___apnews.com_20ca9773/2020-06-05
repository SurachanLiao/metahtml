The S&amp;P is now just 5.7% below its pre-pandemic peak, after plummeting 34%. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>An exultant Trump \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/c7a125390466d7b8152e2a7b7fd1ece2\">seized on the report\u003c/a> as evidence that the economy is going to come back from the coronavirus crisis like a “rocket ship.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>“This shows that what we’ve been doing is right,” said the president, who has pushed governors aggressively to reopen their economies amid warnings from public health officials that the country is risking a second wave of infections on top of the one that has killed over 100,000 Americans.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>Kamins and other economists credited the government’s small-business lending effort, the Paycheck Protection Program, with encouraging employers to rehire. Overall, Washington has provided about $3 trillion in emergency relief funds during the crisis.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>Nearly all industries added jobs last month, a sharp reversal from April, when almost all cut them. Hotels and restaurants added 1.2 million jobs in May, after shedding 7.5 million. Retailers gained 368,000, after losing nearly 2.3 million in the previous month. Construction companies added 464,000 after cutting 995,000.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>The crisis has also exposed wide disparities that may have contributed to the unrest set off in many U.S. cities by the death last week of George Floyd: While the unemployment rate for white Americans was 12.4% in May, it was 17.6% for Hispanics and 16.8% for African-Americans.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>Solid employment gains will probably continue through the end of the year, economists said, but the job market is in such a deep hole that it could take years to dig out. The U.S. economy still has 20 million fewer jobs than it did in February. Oxford Economics, a consulting firm, forecasts that 60% of jobs could be regained by the end of this year, leaving unemployment in the 8%-to-10% range. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>So far, some reopened companies are seeing only a limited number of customers.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>Jacob Liou, 26, is back at work as a kitchen manager and sous chef at a Chattanooga, Tennessee, restaurant. It is allowed to seat up to 50% of its former capacity but rarely reaches that. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Our store normally pulls around $35,000 a week,” he said. “Now we’re lucky to hit $10,000.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>Scott Grondin and Jorge Sanchez, owners of a gym in Miami, are preparing to reopen Monday after closing down three months ago. Making money in the coming months could be tough. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>About 25% of members have canceled their memberships. Classes will be smaller to accommodate social distancing. The gym has dropped prices. And not everyone is ready to return.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Some will say, ‘I want to wait one week,’ some will want to wait a month,” Grondin said. “They want to make sure we have the proper plans.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>Gwyneth Duesbery, 22, returned this week to her job as a restaurant hostess in Grand Rapids, Michigan, as Bowdie’s Chop House prepares to reopen with tables 6 feet apart and seating capacity reduced to about one-quarter. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I am concerned that it will expose me to potential diseases, and expose others, no matter the precautions that we take,” she said. “It’s kind of uncharted waters.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>There are other signs the economy is steadily recovering, even in hard-hit industries. American Airlines said it will fly 55% of its U.S. routes in July, up from 20% in May. And the Cheesecake Factory said one-quarter of its nearly 300 restaurants have reopened, though with limited capacity. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>Some economists say, however, that the longer the economy struggles, the more permanent damage may occur. Movie theater chain AMC, for example, \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/d5e09c45c57fc8a1e6d77ce785dd6f26\">said Wednesday\u003c/a> it may not survive.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>The United States has suffered far worse job losses than other countries. European and some Asian nations have set up programs to subsidize employees’ wages and keep them employed.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>A study \u003ca href=\"https://eml.berkeley.edu/~yagan/GRY_jobs-x-country.pdf\">released this week found \u003c/a> that while the U.S. shed about 15% of its jobs from January to April, the loss in countries such as Germany, South Korea, Australia and Israel was roughly 4% or lower. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>Friday’s report showed that the government continues to struggle with how it classifies millions of out-of-work Americans. The Labor Department admitted that government household survey-takers mistakenly counted about 4.9 million temporarily laid-off people as employed.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>The government doesn’t correct its survey results for fear that will look like political manipulation.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>Had the mistake been corrected, the unemployment rate would have risen to 16.1% in May, while the corrected April figure would have been 19.5%, rather than 14.7%.

By the time many patients are critical enough to seek hospital attention, they often have low blood oxygen levels that require immediate attention. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"hub-link-embed\" id=\"afs:Content:9004660439\">Full Coverage: Virus Outbreak\u003c/div>\u003cp>That was the case for Armando Ancajima’s uncle, who was taken Sunday to a hospital in Talara, an oil producing city near Peru’s northern coast. Struggling to breathe, his nails purple, he had just 35% oxygen saturation on arrival. The family was told the hospital had no oxygen, suggesting that they rapidly find a way to buy it themselves.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Ancajima said he saw 10 people die during the night he spent with his uncle.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“This is the inheritance of 30 years of inattention,” he said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Peru was one of the earliest nations in Latin America to institute a strict lockdown, but that failed to stop infections from skyrocketing. With nearly 185,000 cases, the country has the second-highest number in the region. Peru’s large informal sector — about 70% of the economy — means many have to break quarantines to earn money and buy food.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But the oxygen shortages are also symptomatic of the overall difficulties Latin America encountered in ramping up medical supplies during the pandemic. By the time the first cases were diagnosed in late February and early March, global supplies were drying up. Unable to buy from the U.S. or Europe, many turned to China for ventilators, which have been slow to arrive.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The opportunity to buy goods had already passed when the first cases were diagnosed,” said Dr. Ciro Ugarte, director of the Pan American Health Organization’s health emergencies department.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Aid groups have tried to fill some of the gaps. The U.K.-based Hope Health Action will soon opena COVID-19 ward with 10 oxygen concentrators in the port city of Cap-Haitien in Haiti. The concentrators produce medicinal oxygen using electricity and ambient air.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Nonetheless, they have limitations. The machines typically supply up to 10 liters per minute and severe COVID-19 cases can require more, said Rob Dalton, an emergency nurse with the organization. Each concentrator can serve just one patient.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We need even more,” Dalton said. “We need as many as we can get.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>In Peru, Vizcarra on Thursday announced nearly $25 million to purchase oxygen and $3.2 million to develop plants and generators.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“If we can meet the demand nationally, we will,” he said. “If plants and generators cannot be secured that way, we’ll go wherever necessary.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Perhaps the most severe shortages have been in Peru’s Amazon, where doctors in Iquitos were tending to 500 patients in a hospital meant for 225. With no oxygen plant, health workers were depending on outside shipments until recently. The government promised 60 tanks a day by air, though only 24 were arriving.\u003c/p>\u003cp>With the help of the church and local communities, two plants have since been purchased and overall need and shortages have gone down. \u003c/p>\u003cp>But the oxygen scarcity is increasingly being felt outside the Amazon as well. \u003c/p>\u003cp>In recent days, lines of people waiting to fill oxygen tanks for loved ones with COVID-19 have been seen even in better-equipped Lima. And in northern Peru, where Marchan’s family lives, many say price gougers are taking advantage.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The family was spending about $150 a day on oxygen until recently, hoping to avoid taking her to the hospital, which doctors warned was on the verge of collapse. But as she grew worse and no oxygen could be found, they decided to seek help.\u003c/p>\u003cp>A day after admitting her to the hospital, Sorroza said a doctor called, saying they didn’t have oxygen and asking the family to bring some. Later that night, she said, one doctor called a cousin offering to sell them a tank for around $120.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Three days later, she was dead. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The family was alerted at 6 a.m. on a Saturday that she’d passed and was told she’d be buried four hours later at a newly created cemetery. They rushed to say a hasty goodbye, enlisting a carpenter cousin to construct a simple white cross out of wood.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I didn’t get to see her,” Sorroza said. “Nothing.”\u003c/p>","mediaCount":5,"shortId":"3d6e8318f13663b54f6dc1c7f355b9b3","localLinkUrl":"https://apnews.com/3d6e8318f13663b54f6dc1c7f355b9b3","interactiveLinkUrl":null,"downloadSettings":null,"interactiveLinkUrlText":null,"richEmbeds":[{"leadHubLink":true,"displayName":"Virus Outbreak","calloutText":"Full Coverage:","isPermanentlyPlaced":true,"tag":{"name":"Virus Outbreak","isPr":false,"id":"VirusOutbreak"},"type":"Hub Link","id":"afs:Content:9004660439"}],"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:3d6e8318f13663b54f6dc1c7f355b9b3","media":[{"altText":null,"imageFileExtension":".jpeg","id":"ff508ed88baa44858bae972d250074c4","videoRenderedSizes":[],"imageMimeType":"image/jpeg","externalId":null,"videoMimeType":null,"type":"Photo","imageRenderedSizes":[3000,2000,1000,800,600,400],"aspectRatio":1.5,"gcsBaseUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/ff508ed88baa44858bae972d250074c4/"}],"videoContext":"\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>","tagIds":["apf-topnews","Peru","UnderstandingtheOutbreak","apf-Health","SouthAmerica","apf-GeneralNews","apf-latinamerica","Bogota","Colombia","VirusOutbreak","apf-intlnews"],"hasTextOverlay":false,"bylines":"By CHRISTINE ARMARIO","leadPhotoId":"ff508ed88baa44858bae972d250074c4"},{"embedHeight":null,"contentSponsor":null,"mediumIds":["21c139f081304ba2bc25549ad6a78435"],"title":"US-MED--Virus Outbreak-Malaria Drug","headline":"Malaria drug didn't help virus patients, big UK study finds","localMemberName":null,"updated":"2020-06-05 16:34:27","contentType":"text","layoutType":"Small Photo","tagObjs":[{"name":"AP Top News","id":"apf-topnews","isPr":null,"order":9},{"name":"United Kingdom","id":"UnitedKingdom","isPr":null,"order":0},{"name":"Malaria","id":"Malaria","isPr":null,"order":0},{"name":"Health","id":"apf-Health","isPr":null,"order":1},{"name":"General News","id":"apf-GeneralNews","isPr":false,"order":0},{"name":"Oxford","id":"Oxford","isPr":null,"order":0},{"name":"Business","id":"apf-business","isPr":null,"order":10},{"name":"Racing for a Remedy","id":"RacingforaRemedy","isPr":null,"order":0},{"name":"Virus Outbreak","id":"VirusOutbreak","isPr":null,"order":0},{"name":"Europe","id":"apf-europe","isPr":null,"order":4},{"name":"U.S. News","id":"apf-usnews","isPr":null,"order":10}],"embedCaption":null,"gcsUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/contents/urn:publicid:ap.org:2e04ef1d5c3aef7a92c4a0739782f876","embedLinkURL":null,"language":null,"leadVideoId":null,"firstWords":"\u003cp>Leaders of a large study in the United Kingdom that is rigorously testing the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine and other medicines for hospitalized COVID-19 patients say they will stop putting...\u003c/p>","published":"2020-06-05 16:34:24","embedHTML":null,"sequenceNumber":null,"notificationId":null,"storyHTML":"\u003cp>Leaders of a large study in the United Kingdom that is rigorously testing the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine and other medicines for hospitalized COVID-19 patients say they will stop putting people on the drug because it’s clear it isn’t helping. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>Results released Friday from 1,542 patients showed the drug did not reduce deaths, time in the hospital or other factors.

Defense Minister Walter Martos said Thursday the country needs 173 tons of oxygen per day. The dean of the Medical College of Peru estimates the nation is producing about 20% of that.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The problem is a consequence of decades of underinvestment in hospitals, corruption and poor management, several medical leaders said. The hospital in Tumbes, near the border with Ecuador, where Marchan’s family resides, has a plant that has been inoperative for years because someone stole an electronic card needed to operate it. Officials are hoping to get it back up Saturday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In the meantime, Tumbes health workers have imported oxygen from Ecuador and trucked in tanks from the nearest Peruvian plant, five hours away. The biggest public hospital usually utilizes 30 tanks a week but now needs about 200.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Many also blame Peru’s governments for failing to prepare earlier.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“This exposes failings throughout the country,” said Dr. Harold Burgos, regional health director for Tumbes. “It was coming and no one took it seriously.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean are facing – or soon likely to encounter – oxygen shortages. In Colombia’s Amazon, doctors have had to airlift patients to Bogota because the only oxygen plant in the region is barely functioning. Haiti is heavily reliant on one oxygen plant for a population of over 11 million.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>About 15% of all COVID-19 patients experience severe illness that requires oxygen therapy, while another 5% need ventilation, according to the World Health Organization.

Struggling to breathe, his nails purple, he had just 35% oxygen saturation on arrival. The family was told the hospital had no oxygen, suggesting that they rapidly find a way to buy it themselves.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Ancajima said he saw 10 people die during the night he spent with his uncle.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“This is the inheritance of 30 years of inattention,” he said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Peru was one of the earliest nations in Latin America to institute a strict lockdown, but that failed to stop infections from skyrocketing. With nearly 185,000 cases, the country has the second-highest number in the region. Peru’s large informal sector — about 70% of the economy — means many have to break quarantines to earn money and buy food.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But the oxygen shortages are also symptomatic of the overall difficulties Latin America encountered in ramping up medical supplies during the pandemic. By the time the first cases were diagnosed in late February and early March, global supplies were drying up. Unable to buy from the U.S. or Europe, many turned to China for ventilators, which have been slow to arrive.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The opportunity to buy goods had already passed when the first cases were diagnosed,” said Dr. Ciro Ugarte, director of the Pan American Health Organization’s health emergencies department.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Aid groups have tried to fill some of the gaps. The U.K.-based Hope Health Action will soon opena COVID-19 ward with 10 oxygen concentrators in the port city of Cap-Haitien in Haiti. The concentrators produce medicinal oxygen using electricity and ambient air.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Nonetheless, they have limitations. The machines typically supply up to 10 liters per minute and severe COVID-19 cases can require more, said Rob Dalton, an emergency nurse with the organization. Each concentrator can serve just one patient.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We need even more,” Dalton said. “We need as many as we can get.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>In Peru, Vizcarra on Thursday announced nearly $25 million to purchase oxygen and $3.2 million to develop plants and generators.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“If we can meet the demand nationally, we will,” he said. “If plants and generators cannot be secured that way, we’ll go wherever necessary.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Perhaps the most severe shortages have been in Peru’s Amazon, where doctors in Iquitos were tending to 500 patients in a hospital meant for 225.

Posts featuring the misidentified photo were viewed thousands of times on social media on Wednesday, with comments expressing outrage about the damage. “The Vietnam Memorial defaced by rioters,” read one Facebook post with nearly 80,000 views. “Total disrespect! There are just no words to express my outrage. This wall honors those who gave their last measure of devotion.” “The Vietnam Memorial?! Really? Are you still for the cause?!” read another. But a reverse image search of the photos being shared online revealed they show a replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Venice, Los Angeles. They also aren’t current. The graffiti pictured appeared at the Los Angeles site in 2016 and has since been scrubbed off. The Associated Press reported in 2017 on the sentencing of the man who vandalized the Los Angeles replica. He was sentenced to four years in state prison. But other monuments in the nation’s capital, including the Lincoln Memorial and the World War II memorial, have been damaged during protests following the death of George Floyd, a black resident of Minneapolis. He died after a white officer held him to the ground with his knee on his neck for several minutes, even as he said he couldn’t breathe, during an arrest on May 25.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>CLAIM: Photo shows all the exterior and interior lights out at the White House on Sunday night, as President Donald Trump hid in a bunker.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>THE FACTS: An image shared thousands of times online that appears to show all the lights out in and around the White House was taken before Trump even assumed office. AP photographs taken Sunday night show the front of the White House illuminated by exterior lights and the portico lantern turned on, but the mansion’s interior is dark. The viral photo, which has been edited, can be found on Getty Image’s stock website, where it was uploaded in December 2015. In the original, the lantern hanging in the White House portico is lit, along with several lights that surround the fountain in the front lawn. The edited version that is being widely shared online has been darkened, and edited to black out the lit lantern. Dozens of social media users shared the edited 2015 photo, claiming it showed the White House on Sunday night. “Lights out at #WhiteHouse is a powerful symbol,” one Twitter user wrote. Others claim it showed the White House on Sunday night as Trump took shelter in a bunker. The Associated Press reported that Secret Service agents rushed the president to a White House bunker Friday night, as hundreds of protesters surrounded the executive mansion.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>CLAIM: MSNBC knowingly used footage from the movie “World War Z” and claimed it showed the current protests, to push a narrative that America is on fire.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>THE FACTS: MSNBC did not use footage from “World War Z,” a 2013 movie about a virus that turns humans into zombies, in a report Sunday. A Twitter user created what was meant to be a spoof video of MSNBC coverage from protests on Sunday using a clip from “World War Z.” Alexandra Roberts, director of communications at MSNBC, confirmed in an email to AP that the video was fabricated. Posts circulating online Monday attacked the cable television station, falsely claiming they had used the movie footage to make protests in the U.S. appear worse. The manipulated video took an MSNBC report on protests Sunday and replaced the video with a clip from “World War Z.” The report actually showed protests in the U.S., including Atlanta and Philadelphia. The audio from the report and the chyron along the bottom of the report remained the same: “CURFEW IMPOSED ACROSS U.S. AS PROTESTERS HIT THE STREETS,” read the caption information under a Breaking News banner. However, on the altered video, “not real” can be found in the corner of the screen, and “bad scooter,” is just above the chyron in small font. A Twitter user who goes by Bad Scooter with the handle @OfficialSlop took credit for the video. “And I deeply apologize again, I did not expect what so ever this would spread,” the creator tweeted Monday. The altered video was shared online as an actual news report, with some social media users grabbing a photo from the movie to pair with a still photo of the fabricated MSNBC report. “#MSNBC using World War Z movie trailer as “Breaking News” footage of aftermath of riots and looting. Don’t believe all you see on TV,” said one tweet with more than 2,000 likes showing the side-by-side photos.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>CLAIM: Photo shows two buses emblazoned with “Soros Riot Dance Squad” at a Milan, Michigan, gas station, offering proof that billionaire philanthropist George Soros and far-left militant groups are transporting out-of-town rioters to protests.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>THE FACTS: A photo of two unmarked buses was manipulated to add the words “Soros Riot Dance Squad” to the side of each vehicle. The buses are not being used to transport people to protests; they belong to a local transportation company and are providing a local shuttle service. On Tuesday, a photo said to show two “Soros Riot Dance Squad” buses passing through a gas station in a small town near Ann Arbor, Michigan, was circulating widely on social media. Posts and articles claimed the image was proof that Soros, a Democratic donor, and anti-fascist networks were transporting militant rioters to protests from out of town. “Democrats &amp; George Soros are Paying &amp; Busing In White Antifa to Come Into the Communities To Incite Violence &amp; Destruction so that The Focus isn’t on Peaceful Protest &amp; Justice For George Floyd,” said one tweet using the photo. “It’s official, the riots are staged,” read the headline of an article about the photo on Intellihub, a website that has frequently spread false conspiracy theories. Sean Duval, the owner of Golden Limousine International, a local transportation company, confirmed the buses belong to his company, but they don’t have any writing on them. Duval also provided evidence the photo was altered -- a Facebook user who appeared to be from Milan, Michigan, on Friday posted the original version of the gas station photo, which showed they were plain white buses. He said the buses pictured have a contract for a daily shuttle service to Romulus, Michigan, and were not transporting rioters to any protest. “It’s frustrating when people from the outside start instigating and try to turn American against American,” Duval said. “It is so important to not let these guys win.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>CLAIM: Photo shows a fire set at the children’s hospital in Columbus, Ohio.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>THE FACTS: The fire in the photo occurred in an empty apartment complex in Columbus on Sunday, May 31, about a mile away from the Nationwide Children’s Hospital. Social media posts circulating Sunday claimed the hospital was set alight during weekend protests in Columbus. “CHILDRENS HOSPITAL IN COLUMBUS OHIO SET ON FIRE DURING RIOT MAY 30,2020!” a Twitter user falsely claimed. “Y’all really did this to ‘Children Hospital,’” said one early morning Facebook post followed by two emoji broken hearts. “It’s Kids in there man.....this is a HOSPITAL.” A screenshot of the photo was also used in a false Facebook post claiming the fire broke out at a children’s hospital in Birmingham, Alabama. “UAB Children’s Hospital last night,” stated the post shared on Monday. The Children’s of Alabama Hospital confirmed on Twitter that there was no fire there. In Columbus, the apartment complex — Residences at Topiary Park — was under construction and was not occupied. A closer look at the photo posted on social media shows that the smoke was coming from behind the hospital’s building. “The building is the Big Lots Behavioral Health Pavilion, but the fire was not on our property,” said Katelyn Hanzel, media relations specialist with Nationwide Children’s Hospital. The Columbus Division of Fire on Monday shared information about the fire on Facebook, confirming the apartment complex was on fire, and stating that there were no reported injuries.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>CLAIM: An old photo of Adolf Hitler shows him holding up a Bible in front of a crowd, similar to how U.S. President Donald Trump held a Bible in front of a church Monday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>THE FACTS: The photo has been edited to show Hitler holding a Bible. In the original photo, Hitler is dressed in a Nazi uniform and raising his hand in response to children saluting him. The photo was taken in the 1930s by Heinrich Hoffman and is archived in Getty Images. Social media users are widely circulating that photo of Hitler, edited to show him holding a black book that people claim is a Bible. The manipulated photo is being used in posts to compare Hitler to Trump, after law enforcement forcefully cleared peaceful protests at Lafayette Park in Washington with tear gas and flash bangs on Monday. After the protesters were cleared, Trump walked from the White House Rose Garden to St. John’s Church where he stood in front of cameras and raised a black-covered Bible for reporters to see. The church was damaged in a protest fire the night before. Trump’s actions sparked bipartisan criticism, with some on social media comparing him to the Nazi dictator, using the false photo. “Spot the difference between Hitler and Trump,” one Twitter user wrote, sharing a photo of Trump with the Bible next to the manipulated image of Hitler. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>CLAIM: Starbucks has a promotion offering a free Frappuccino drink of choice to anyone who goes to a Starbucks store and shouts “Black Lives Matter.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>THE FACTS: The offer is not real. The fake Starbucks promotion shows the hands of two people, one white and one black, holding up brightly colored blended coffee drinks with whipped cream on top. \"We’re all in this together,” it says. “BLACK LIVES MATTER! Come to any of our stores shouting these words for a free Frappuccino of your choice. The louder you shout, the larger the size you’ll get!” Thousands of Facebook and Twitter users on Thursday shared the fake advertisement in support of the coffee chain. “This is why they get all my money,” one Facebook user wrote. “Starbucks anyone?! #BLM definitely works!” said another. However, a Starbucks spokesperson confirmed the offer is not valid and wasn’t created by the company. “Our customers may confirm any Starbucks promotion by checking the Starbucks app, reaching out to our customer care line or asking a Starbucks barista,” the company said in an emailed statement. Starbucks has made public statements in the wake of George Floyd’s death, denouncing racism and announcing plans to design anti-bias resources and training. “Black lives matter,” the company said in a tweet on Thursday. “We are committed to being a part of change.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>This is part of The Associated Press’ ongoing effort to fact-check misinformation that is shared widely online, including work with Facebook to identify and reduce the circulation of false stories on the platform.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>___ \u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>Find all AP Fact Checks here: https://apnews.com/APFactCheck\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>___ \u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>Follow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>","mediaCount":2,"shortId":"17fbf84d509d00010c9acbc070cb8369","localLinkUrl":"https://apnews.com/17fbf84d509d00010c9acbc070cb8369","interactiveLinkUrl":null,"downloadSettings":null,"interactiveLinkUrlText":null,"richEmbeds":null,"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:17fbf84d509d00010c9acbc070cb8369","media":[],"videoContext":null,"tagIds":["Media","apf-GeneralNews","Socialmedia","Riots","AmericanProtests","Veterans","APFactCheck"],"hasTextOverlay":false,"bylines":"By ALI SWENSON, AMANDA SEITZ, BEATRICE DUPUY and ARIJETA LAJKA","leadPhotoId":"b10ebc1e474541d1b3e09ae5b8a1388a"}],"notificationUrl":null,"textColor":"#000000","sponsorUrl":null,"teamLimit":null,"cardType":"Wire Story","sponsorServeAd":false,"notificationText":null,"notificationUpdated":null},{"feed":[],"pollUpdated":null,"headlineWidget":null,"dividerColor":"#000000","tagObjs":[],"sponsorImageUrl":null,"hubPeekLinkText":null,"borderColor":null,"cardTitle":null,"localMemberName":null,"collectionTagObjs":[],"notificationTitle":null,"minimizedStoryCount":null,"shortId":"05476b9620f2b5f9900e16ccc8dc3a75","allowAd":true,"layoutType":"Small Photo","pollWeek":null,"disclaimerText":null,"teams":null,"hubPeekTagName":null,"sponsorAttribution":null,"bracketsSettings":null,"textScale":null,"expandedStoryCount":null,"hubPeekTagId":null,"cardHeadline":null,"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:05476b9620f2b5f9900e16ccc8dc3a75","pollId":null,"contents":[{"embedHeight":null,"contentSponsor":null,"mediumIds":["e3a25ea408ee4b21a356a14c016c3dfc","c721796cbe9d4a46adcdfe7575682348","0c23a4d6d2304ddfb3a7260202898aec","2cc1a8f61a4f40f3986b2f9d440825e2","1ac11d2b55da44349f41776c6f0566c8","f7f2599e21604c38aef9c5cb85d909c7","a678e95c836345efba63809109e240c0","d1d878cf3ec44a62b60756b3a3823ff6","1a8752281f5343559ce13f5da2c0b0ea","8ebd7950539841138ed510845d828eb8","9dd18f29bbca4ff688a67535905e2189","babc3e0055984bee8682a2de6a5ca7ea","5a664cb34c1d4384922a0f759eb9c1b8","f43001dcef2749828e397b03f3c394c6","6c6ae0d3012241cb9338bc4356e77a69","b2b3f85c524a40d9b6224dbf95b218ca","07f925e2a8e74913b21086ab80239653"],"title":"US--America Protests","headline":"Demonstrators vow to sustain momentum until change happens","localMemberName":null,"updated":"2020-06-05 21:26:05","contentType":"text","layoutType":"Small Photo","tagObjs":[{"name":"George Floyd","id":"GeorgeFloyd","isPr":null,"order":0},{"name":"AP Top News","id":"apf-topnews","isPr":null,"order":3},{"name":"General News","id":"apf-GeneralNews","isPr":false,"order":4},{"name":"Minneapolis","id":"Minneapolis","isPr":null,"order":0},{"name":"American Protests","id":"AmericanProtests","isPr":null,"order":0},{"name":"U.S. News","id":"apf-usnews","isPr":false,"order":2},{"name":"International News","id":"apf-intlnews","isPr":null,"order":10}],"embedCaption":null,"gcsUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/contents/urn:publicid:ap.org:05476b9620f2b5f9900e16ccc8dc3a75","embedLinkURL":null,"language":null,"leadVideoId":"8ebd7950539841138ed510845d828eb8","firstWords":"\u003cp>WASHINGTON (AP) — Protesters stirred by the death of George Floyd vowed Friday to turn an extraordinary outpouring of grief into a sustained movement as demonstrations shifted to a calmer, but no...\u003c/p>","published":"2020-06-05 05:24:34","embedHTML":null,"sequenceNumber":null,"notificationId":"urn:publicid:ap.org:05476b9620f2b5f9900e16ccc8dc3a75","storyHTML":"\u003cp>WASHINGTON (AP) — Protesters stirred by the death of George Floyd vowed Friday to turn an extraordinary outpouring of grief into a sustained movement as demonstrations shifted to a calmer, but no less determined focus on addressing racial injustice. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>In Minneapolis, where Floyd died in police custody, the city agreed to ban police chokeholds and require officers to intervene any time they see unauthorized force by another officer.

It was an era in which discrimination was still rampant across the county, but especially in the South, and nearly a decade before President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the The Civil Rights Act of 1964. The things Sampson saw as a child came flooding back when he saw the video from Minneapolis.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>“To me, he might as well have had a pillowcase over his head with his eyes dotted out and his nose dotted out,\" Sampson said. “It just brought back memories of the Ku Klux Klan from the ‘50s and ’60s.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>Sampson said the look on the face of Officer Derek Chauvin, who has since been charged with 2nd-degree murder, gave him the impression that “he was enjoying what he was doing.

At 83, Penske is considered at high risk for the coronavirus and he will avoid large crowds by working inside the paddock from a transporter separate from the rest of his team.

The schedule has been overhauled, his beloved Indianapolis 500 moved to August from the Memorial Day weekend date it held for 73 years, and Penske has spent nearly six months ocused on improvements for his newest properties. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>Penske said he is at IMS at least two days a week overseeing massive upgrades.

Its first event, a doubleheader between NASCAR and IndyCar Series, will run July 4 weekend without spectators. In making that decision earlier this week, Penske said it moves the speedway closer “to execute with full fans” for the Indy 500. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We really wanted to go forward with fans but it wasn't realistic,” Penske said. “If we had fans and had any problems, that would absolutely close the door on for us for the 500.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>HIS HEALTH \u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>Penske said he travels from his Michigan home to Indianapolis twice a week and wears gloves and a mask while working. His Bloomfield Hills office is a three-minute drive from his home and he said a nurse is on site and “everybody has to go through a temperature check.” Penske, a cancer survivor who received a kidney transplant in 2017, said Penske Corp. practices social distancing at work.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I’ve been at home with my wife and have been careful on any interface,” he said. “All my transportation has been from Pontiac Airport to Indianapolis and back.

All work on the track was halted early in the pandemic under stay-at-home orders, but moving the 500 to August allowed time for capital improvements. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>He'd often likens his visions for the speedway to pristine Augusta National. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Every time I walk around I find something else to do,” he said. “I thought there were only so many chapters in the book. Every time I get to the last chapter, there’s one or two more to look at. Time is always beneficial.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>He said new video boards at the speedway would not have been in place for the 500 if had been run in May as scheduled. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I’ve never been more excited about what we’ve been able to accomplish,” he said. “The future is very, very bright.

The series will practice and qualify before Saturday night's race, unlike NASCAR, which has cut both so far. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>He said both worked to to get the series' foreign drivers back into the United States in time for the opener, and, Penske believes IndyCar's teams have largely weathered the financial shutdown. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>“They’re all ready to go racing ourselves. No question about it,” he said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>As for his own team of reigning champion Josef Newgarden, and back-to-back Indy 500 winners Simon Pagenaud and Will Power: “Texas at those speeds, I told them they are going to have to have their heads on.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>NASCAR \u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>Team Penske has four wins through nine races even after the bossswapped all three crews for drivers Ryan Blaney, Brad Keselowski and Joey Logano. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>Logano won two before the shutdown and Blaney inked a contract extension. Keselowski, in a free agent year, won two Cup races last week and is fourth in the standings. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I certainly am not saying he’s not going to run for us,” Penske said of Keselowski. “We have to talk to Brad and we have not done that during this pandemic. Quite honestly, we’re not negotiating something with a driver over Zoom. We’ll get together with him.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>He said Team Penske is working in split shifts at the shop for social distancing, and he's holding out for economic impact analysis before he gives an opinion on NASCAR's frantic current schedule. To make up its postponed events, the three national series raced nine times over 15 days. There have been two midweek races and all have been without spectators. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We’re happy with the outcome of operations but I think the more important thing is what’s the impact on the sport? You know, what do our races look like in the future?\" said Penske. “As competitors and for our sponsors there's a comfort level that we’re back racing.

Increasing tensions between the United States and China are also raising worries about a resumption in the trade war between the world’s two largest economies. Some investors are also worried about volatility that could be created by this fall’s U.S. elections. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>Nevertheless, investors on Friday continued their recent trend of focusing more on companies that would benefit most from a growing economy, rather than those that had been earlier winners in the weak, stay-at-home economy.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>Smaller stocks had the market’s biggest gains, as they often do when expectations for the economy are rising.

In April, the coronavirus shutdown had caused 20 million-plus job losses. Mounting applications for unemployment benefits had suggested that the misery continued through May. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>It didn't. The gap between what was expected and what happened when the Labor Department issued the jobs report Friday morning was so vast that it raised some doubts about its accuracy. But as analysts dug into the numbers, they found the numbers to be correct and suggested that the pessimistic forecasts might have mainly reflected how hard it is to gauge economic performance during a pandemic.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>Here are five major takeaways from a jobs report that showed the economy faring better than believed, even if the overall picture remains bleak, with many millions still jobless and unemployment well into double digits.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>IS THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE REALLY 13.3%?\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>The drop in the unemployment rate was a shocker. Economists had expected the rate to approach 20%, driven up from 14.7% by job losses topping 8 million. Their forecasts woefully missed the mark. Part of the explanation is the difficulty of assessing data when the situation is changing so quickly.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>But it also reflects an acknowledged difficulties by the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics in its information-gathering. Millions of people appeared to be erroneously classified by the survey as not working but employed. These people should have been classified as on temporary layoff and therefore unemployed. Had they been counted correctly, the jobless rate would have been roughly 3 points higher — 16% — the government said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>The same issue marred the April jobs report. In that case, the unemployment rate would have been roughly 5 points higher than the 14.7% reported. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>The jobs report is drawn from a pair of surveys. A survey of households establishes the unemployment rate. A separate survey of employers determines how many jobs were added or lost. Response rates for these surveys were lower than usual in May because of the viral outbreak. But the government still gathered enough responses to produce the jobs report. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The household survey response rate, at 67 percent, was about 15 percentage points lower than in months prior to the pandemic,” the report noted.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Labor Department also includes a broader measure of unemployment. This measure includes not only people who are out of work and looking for a job but also people who stopped looking or who were reduced to part-time hours. That rate was 21.2% in May. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>PERSISTENT RACIAL INEQUALITY\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>The past 10 days have achingly illustrated the persistence of systemic racism in the United States. Protests emerged in nearly every major U.S. city after George Floyd's killing at the hands of Minneapolis police officers. The May jobs report pointed to the multitude of disadvantages that African-Americans endure.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>Their unemployment rate ticked up last month from 16.7% to 16.8%. By contrast, unemployment for whites fell to 12.4% from 14.2% in April. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>Why did the rate rise for African-Americans? More of them began searching for work in May and weren't necessarily hired. This meant that the number of officially unemployed African-Americans seeking jobs rose by 87,000 to 3.3 million.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>But white people who began job hunts were mostly hired: The number of unemployed white people fell by more than 2 million.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>African-American women have suffered the brunt of layoffs. Before the pandemic, their unemployment rate was lower than it was for black men. But that relationship inverted during the past two months. African-American women are now more likely to be jobless.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>The racial disparities run counter to the odd assertion made Friday by President Donald Trump that Floyd was “looking down” from heaven with admiration for the May jobs report.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It’s a great day for him, it’s a great day for everybody, this is a great, great day in terms of equality,\" Trump said, ignoring the figures that show otherwise.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>TEMPORARY LAYOFFS\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>It's not just the job totals that matter — it's where the gains came from.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>There were 2.7 million people who had been temporarily laid off and returned to their jobs in May. This was essentially the lowest-hanging fruit of any recovery. They are people who could quickly return to offices, restaurants, stores and factories that had gradually resumed operations. This left 15.3 million people who were temporarily laid off and still awaiting to return. Even if May's pace of job growth could be sustained — something most economists doubt — it would take at least six months to bring them all back to work.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>MORE PART-TIMERS\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>The May jobs report revealed a curious increase in people saying they working part-time for “non-economic” reasons. The number of part-timers in this category grew by 2 million in May, a major driver of the overall gains.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>This category is important because it excludes part-timers who can't work as many hours as they'd like because of poor business conditions. Instead, these workers are working fewer hours because of issues involving child care, school and other family obligations. It hints at a likely economic drag if schools and child care centers can't fully re-open.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>There was also an increase in “self-employed” workers. This number rose by 401,000 in May to 7.9 million. That figure is still about 1 million jobs below its pre-COVID-19 levels. But it still suggests that parts of the the economy began to pick up last month.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>STILL WORSE THAN THE GREAT RECESSION\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>It was an uplifting jobs report after so many bleak numbers. But it's worth putting those numbers into context next to the Great Recession, the severe downturn that started in late 2007 and ended in mid-2009. The Great Recession was caused by a housing bust and financial market collapse, a far more gradual decline than what the coronavirus caused.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>But even with the solid hiring in May, the current jobs picture is still worse than in the Great Recession. During that downturn, unemployment peaked at 10% in October 2009. That is 3.3 points lower than the current rate. With the Great Recession, it took until 2016 for the unemployment rate to return to pre-downturn levels. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>In the aftermath of the pandemic, U.S. employers would have to replicate the strong gains from the May jobs report for the next seven months to return the country to where it was in February. This means the results of the June jobs report, to be released early next month, will be a critical test of the potential recovery's strength.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>","mediaCount":1,"shortId":"d7e34eeb80b8030d5c1f77f5358318c1","localLinkUrl":"https://apnews.com/d7e34eeb80b8030d5c1f77f5358318c1","interactiveLinkUrl":null,"downloadSettings":null,"interactiveLinkUrlText":null,"richEmbeds":null,"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:d7e34eeb80b8030d5c1f77f5358318c1","media":[],"videoContext":null,"tagIds":["apf-usnews","Raceandethnicity","Unemployment","apf-business","AmericanProtests","VirusOutbreak","Economy"],"hasTextOverlay":false,"bylines":"By JOSH BOAK","leadPhotoId":"7b74d5e3b58f45bb81ba5e77f5a09a66"}],"notificationUrl":null,"textColor":null,"sponsorUrl":null,"teamLimit":null,"cardType":"Wire Story","sponsorServeAd":false,"notificationText":null,"notificationUpdated":null},{"feed":[],"pollUpdated":null,"headlineWidget":false,"dividerColor":null,"tagObjs":[],"sponsorImageUrl":null,"hubPeekLinkText":null,"borderColor":null,"cardTitle":null,"localMemberName":null,"collectionTagObjs":[],"notificationTitle":null,"minimizedStoryCount":null,"shortId":"bf3026a2c6f3e7256973b596fac40322","allowAd":true,"layoutType":"Small Photo","pollWeek":null,"disclaimerText":null,"teams":null,"hubPeekTagName":null,"sponsorAttribution":null,"bracketsSettings":null,"textScale":null,"expandedStoryCount":null,"hubPeekTagId":null,"cardHeadline":null,"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:bf3026a2c6f3e7256973b596fac40322","pollId":null,"contents":[{"embedHeight":null,"contentSponsor":null,"mediumIds":["6e1a4e5562a74ffbb09afb8dfc2dc8e7"],"title":"US--Consumer Borrowing","headline":"US consumers shunned borrowing in April as economy shut down","localMemberName":null,"updated":"2020-06-05 20:25:26","contentType":"text","layoutType":"Small Photo","tagObjs":[{"name":"General News","id":"apf-GeneralNews","isPr":false,"order":0},{"name":"Virus Outbreak","id":"VirusOutbreak","isPr":null,"order":0},{"name":"Economy","id":"Economy","isPr":null,"order":0},{"name":"Business","id":"apf-business","isPr":false,"order":10},{"name":"U.S. News","id":"apf-usnews","isPr":null,"order":4}],"embedCaption":null,"gcsUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/contents/urn:publicid:ap.org:bf3026a2c6f3e7256973b596fac40322","embedLinkURL":null,"language":null,"leadVideoId":null,"firstWords":"\u003cp>WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. consumer borrowing plunged in April as households fretted about the disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic and cut back on their use of credit.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>The...\u003c/p>","published":"2020-06-05 20:10:20","embedHTML":null,"sequenceNumber":null,"notificationId":null,"storyHTML":"\u003cp>WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. consumer borrowing plunged in April as households fretted about the disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic and cut back on their use of credit.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Federal Reserve reported Friday that total borrowing fell by $68.8 billion, or 19.6%.

Just 2 in 10 voters believe the country is headed in the right direction, a Monmouth University poll found earlier in the week.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>Few things matter more to Trump's political future than the state of the U.S. economy, which was all but shut down by state governments this spring to prevent greater spread of the deadly coronavirus. Defying health experts, the president has aggressively encouraged states to re-open and has assailed state leaders by name who resist.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>At the same time, he's taken an uneven approach to explosive racial tensions in the wake of Floyd's death. As he has in recent days, Trump on Friday offered a sympathetic message to Floyd in one breath and lashed out at protests in his name the next. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>Local governments \"have to dominate the streets,\" Trump said. \"You can’t let what’s happening happen.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>The president spoke in the Rose Garden after the Labor Department said that U.S. employers added 2.5 million workers to their payrolls last month. Economists had been expecting them instead to slash 8 million jobs in continuing fallout from the pandemic. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>The jobless rate, at 13.3%, is still on par with what the nation witnessed during the Great Depression. And for the second straight month, the Labor Department acknowledged making errors in counting the unemployed during the virus outbreak, saying the real figure is worse than the numbers indicate. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>Still, after weeks of dire predictions by economists that unemployment in May could hit 20% or more, the news was seen as evidence that the collapse may have bottomed out in April.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>Friday’s report made for some tricky reaction gymnastics for Trump's Democratic election opponent, Biden, who sought to contrast the improving figures with the fact that millions of Americans are still out of work. The high jobless rate, he said, is due to the Trump administration mishandling the response to the pandemic.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Let’s be clear about something: The depth of this jobs crisis is not attributable to an act of God but to a failure of a president,\" Biden declared in a Delaware speech shortly after Trump spoke. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>The presumptive Democratic nominee said Trump was patting himself on the back as America faces some of its sternest challenges ever.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It’s time for him to step out of his own bunker, take a look around at the consequences,” Biden said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>It’s unclear how many jobs that were lost as a result of the pandemic are permanently gone or whether the reopenings in states will create a second surge of COVID-19 deaths. In addition, the report from mid-May doesn’t reflect the effect that protests across the nation have had on business.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>Many economists digging into the jobs report saw a struggle ahead after the burst of hiring last month.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>Friday’s report reflected the benefits of nearly $3 trillion in government aid instead of an organic return to normal. Only one of every nine jobs lost because of the pandemic has been recovered, and the specter of corporate bankruptcies hangs over the recovery.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>Much of the growth came from 2.7 million workers who were temporarily laid-off going back to their jobs. This likely reflected $510 billion in forgivable loans from the Payroll Protection Program to nearly 4.5 million employers—an administration initiative that helped push the unemployment rate down to 13.3% from 14.7% in April. African American unemployment rose slightly to 16.8 percent.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>As the money from the PPP program runs out, there could be another round of layoffs, warned Sung Won Sohn, an economist at Loyola Marymount University.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>“There will be continuing residual fear and uncertainty,” Sohn said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump on Friday defended his handling of the pandemic, contending that more than 1 million Americans would have died had he not acted. More than 108,000 people are confirmed to have lost their lives due to the coronavirus, according to a count from Johns Hopkins University.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>Now, though, Trump said states and cities should be lifting remaining restrictions. “I don’t know why they continue to lock down,” he said of some jurisdictions that have maintained closings. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>Former South Carolina Gov. and Rep. Mark Sanford, a Republican who briefly mounted a primary challenge to Trump last year, dismissed any employment gain due to federal deficit spending.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>“What we have right now is federal policy aimed solely at boosting numbers that obviously would help in a reelection effort,” Sanford said in an interview. “We’re literally buying jobs.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>But there was little sign of concern among Trump and his Republican allies in Washington. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>“This shows that what we’ve been doing is right,\" Trump said of the jobs numbers. He added: “Today is probably the greatest comeback in American history.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>He pitched himself as key to a “rocket ship” rebound that would fail only if he doesn't win reelection. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I’m telling you next year, unless something happens or the wrong people get in here, this will turn around,” Trump said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>Will Weissert in Dover, Delaware contributed.

I don’t want to see stores looted or even buildings burn. But African-Americans have been living in a burning building for many years, choking on the smoke as the flames burn closer and closer. Racism in America is like dust in the air. It seems invisible — even if you’re choking on it — until you let the sun in. Then you see it’s everywhere.

It’s about clinching your purse. It’s about believing we don’t belong. It’s about failing to acknowledge and understand my very existence, my pain. It’s about repeating the sins of the past.

Nielson, executive director of the church’s missionary department. “We’ve learned that finding people, teaching people online is much more effective than trying to meet people in person on a bus or on a street corner or somewhere else. This will change what we do, I think, forever.” \u003c/p>\u003cdiv id='ccda630c2de14f50bec18ead4b31aaf8' class='media-placeholder'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>Missionary work has changed drastically for young people like Rather and Castrillo, who had spent long days walking through the streets in the Philippines to spread the word of their faith before the pandemic hit.

In Brazil, McCain had one of those “little brick phones” and largely spoke to people face to face. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Sometimes we feel like pioneers,” said McCain, a 19-year-old from Texas. “We’re not used to using social media in this way and, like, I never made videos and posted them online before. ... We’re all learning, and it’s really interesting and really fun.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>The church began incorporating online faith outreach when it gave some missionaries tablets six years ago. It's since made technology more prevalent, giving most missionaries smartphones even before the pandemic, Nielson said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>A more online-based approach would be a major shift and could diminish the appeal for some young church members who crave an enriching cultural experience, said Ryan Cragun, a sociology professor at the University of Tampa who specializes in religion and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The time in the community also breaks up the drudgery of being alone with a fellow missionary, said Cragun, a former church member who served a mission in Costa Rica.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>“There’s this quasi-tourist experience of going to these cool places, but there is also the connection you get to the people,” Cragun said. “That’s probably one of the more meaningful things that happens to them.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>McCain said she sees an opportunity to use online tools to reach more people. Still, “we would love to go and be able to teach in people’s houses.” She and King went to the home of the family they have been teaching to share the sacrament, while social distancing. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Finding and teaching people online is really effective,” Nielson said, “but we also think there’s a personal touch, too, of meeting people” and having them come to church when things open up more. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>The virus forced church officials to scramble for flights to get missionaries home from far-flung countries like Ethiopia, Australia and Vietnam. But Nielson said the church never wavered in keeping the missionary program going. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>It shows the importance the church places on sharing its gospel and giving young people the chance to fulfill an important rite of passage.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>About 5,000 missionaries who were brought home have been sent out again in the United States. Thousands more are heading out soon. The church gave them the option to wait a year, but the large majority chose to start again now, Nielson said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>Missions, which last two years for men and 18 months for women, are as much about locking in young church members for life as converting others, Cragun said. The average number of people converted per missionary has risen slightly in the last three years, to 3.7, but is still less than the average of five in the previous decade, church figures show.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>Nielson said the pandemic has made people hungry for the missionaries’ message of hope.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>“There’s never been a time when more people have wanted to know about religion than there is now,” Nielson said. “People searching for peace. People searching for answers. People searching for someone to talk to.

That is an abject failure that cannot happen.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>His comments came the morning after protesters torched a police station that officers abandoned during a third night of violence. Livestream video showed protesters entering the building, where intentionally set fires activated smoke alarms and sprinklers. President Donald Trump threatened action, tweeting “when the looting starts, the shooting starts,” which prompted a warning from Twitter for “glorifying violence.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id='d3683d5f198f4928b9d58d0684b14e4c' class='media-placeholder'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>The governor faced tough questions after National Guard leader Maj.

Walz said it became apparent as the 3rd Precinct was lost that the state had to step in, which happened at 12:05 a.m. Requests from the cities for resources “never came,” he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“You will not see that tonight, there will be no lack of leadership,” Walz said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Dozens of fires were also set in nearby St. Paul, where nearly 200 businesses were damaged or looted. Protests spread across the U.S., fueled by outrage over Floyd’s death, and years of violence against African Americans at the hands of police. Demonstrators clashed with officers in New York and blocked traffic in Columbus, Ohio, and Denver.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump threatened to bring Minneapolis “under control,” calling the protesters “thugs” and tweeting that \"when the looting starts, the shooting starts.” The tweet \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/f62ed59014cbf43fc1da21e3fcbfe904\">drew another warning\u003c/a> from Twitter, which said the comment violated the platform’s rules, but the company did not remove it.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Trump also blasted the “total lack of leadership” in Minneapolis. \u003c/p>\u003cp>A visibly tired and frustrated Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey made his first public appearance of the night early Friday at City Hall and took responsibility for evacuating the precinct, saying it had become too dangerous for officers. As Frey continued, a reporter cut across loudly with a question: “What's the plan here?”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“With regard to?” Frey responded.

CNN said on Twitter that the arrests were “a clear violation of their First Amendment rights.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>Firefighters worked Friday to contain a number of blazes as National Guard troops blocked access to streets where businesses had been damaged.

As minutes pass, Floyd slowly stops talking and moving.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Minutes after the precinct burned, the Guard tweeted that it had activated more than 500 soldiers across the metro area. By Friday morning, a couple dozen Guard members armed with assault-style rifles blocked a street near a Target store that has sustained heavy damage by looters.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Guard said a “key objective” was to make sure firefighters could respond to calls, and said in a follow-up tweet that soldiers would assist the Minneapolis Fire Department.

The son-in-law was referred to in the report as “family member 1.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>While at the Wolf Trap concert, Domenech was seated with the EPA official and “used his position to gain access to the EPA senior official when he believed family member 1 could not,\" the report said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Domenech told investigators that one of the emails he sent to the EPA official to follow up on the meeting at Wolf Trap was a “courtesy\" to move the process along.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“When asked if moving the process along was a way to influence the EPA hiring process, Domenech said, ‘Well, when I think of influencing ... I guess you’re right. I was trying to influence the process to move along. That’s different than influencing the process to hire,'\" the report said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Investigators for Inspector General Mark Greenblatt concluded Domenech's actions were specifically aimed at getting his son-in-law hired, the report said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>No criminal violations were found, according to the report. Interior spokesman Nicholas Goodwin said Domenech was required to undergo additional ethics training as a result of the findings. No further action was taken and the matter is considered resolved, he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The underlying events regarding Mr. Domenech occurred in 2017 before the Department initiated an unprecedented effort to invest in building a culture of ethical compliance and dramatically expanding the Department of the Interior’s Ethics Office Program, which has resulted in tripling the number of career ethics officials within the Department,” Goodwin said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Domenech did not respond to an emailed request for comment.\u003c/p>\u003cp>House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Raul Grijalva, an Arizona Democrat, called on Interior Secretary David Bernhardt to fire Domenech.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“Firing Mr. Domenech is the only serious course of action at this point – another round of ethics training is clearly just a waste of time, since it hasn’t sunk in by now,” Grijalva said in a statement.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Domenech, who worked in the Interior Department under former President George W. Bush, went through two rounds of ethics training when he first joined the Trump administration as a senior advisor to Zinke in 2017, according to the investigation. \u003c/p>\u003cp>That training included specific admonitions against using his office “to endorse friends, relatives or persons with whom you are affiliated in a non-governmental capacity,\" the report said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The identity of the senior EPA official was not disclosed in the report.

Joseph Addabbo has been pushing his state to adopt mobile and online sports betting as a way to generate new revenue, including recapturing money from gamblers crossing the border into New Jersey to bet on sports.

Andrew Cuomo, also a Democrat, maintains that approving mobile sports betting would require amending the state's constitution.\u003c/p>\u003cp>While casinos in many states are moving to reopen, including Nevada next week, not all gamblers will be anxious to race back into crowded, enclosed buildings with the virus still spreading.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“If social distancing safeguards remain in place, it is possible that some gamblers would prefer to play from home rather than going into a casino,” said David Schwartz, a gambling historian with the University of Nevada Las Vegas.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Yaniv Sherman, head of commercial development for the online gambling company 888 Holdings, said the virus is accelerating trends that were already in motion before the virus hit, including growing acceptance of sports and online betting.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The virus has highlighted the need for revenue diversification,” he said. “The future is around online growth, and it’s right now, not in 5 or 10 years.

It always was a big gamble, but less than 10% of them have worked in the last two seasons.\u003c/p>\u003cp>So Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie suggested giving teams an alternative. They could still try the onside kick, or they could opt for a fourth-and-15 play from the kicking team's 25-yard line (barring penalties on the previous scoring plays that would be applied on the kickoff).

Likely.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Not ready for prime time? Apparently so.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I thought that (what) was a real healthy discussion was the ability to advance that play, defensively,\" Vincent says, pointing out one consequence of fourth-and-15. \"Where on an onside kick, there’s no advancement.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“This would have been a substantial change the way it was written up, and I give credit to Jeffrey. He addressed it, he heard from his colleagues and made adjustments just over the last two weeks to the amendment. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“But things of that nature — ‘Well, if you can’t advance this, is it truly fair?’” Vincent adds options on onside kicks as opposed to fourth-and-15 scrimmage players, \"and you start looking at point margin, and is it only the team having the ability to have the option twice? Or can a team have it for only just being behind (on the scoreboard)? Those were some of the things that jumped out. Those are things we really need to go back and say, ‘What kind of fundamental change does this actually happen to the game?’”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Changes are substantial enough that further discussion is required. Also remember this is a league that took years to adopt the 2-point conversion. Decades to move back the extra point kick after it became as automatic as the Browns not making the playoffs.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Plus, of course, all those alterations to the catch rule that took it from confounding to, well, more confounding.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We probably talked some 20-30 minutes on that and ended up tabling it,\" McKay says. \"Just taking a little bit of an understanding of where teams stood on it, the questions they had on it. The commissioner has asked us as a committee to make sure we get all feedback from the teams, where they are, and are there ways to address this type of proposal and bring it back at some point? So that’s what we’ll do as a committee.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Although we didn’t take a formal vote, we probably had more clubs that support this year (than in the past). It’s a change, and so as a change mark there were a lot of really good questions about the impacts of all the nuances of the rule, and how that may affect the end of a game. It was a good discussion.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Rules like this take time. It took us a long time to make a change like the extra point. This is a pretty major change in giving the offense the ball on fourth-and-15.

This does. Right now, umpiring is still a passion.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The path to becoming one of MLB’s 76 full-time umps is daunting. Many at the top of the profession remember a day in Billings or Bluefield when they were at a crossroads — the long drives for a two-person crew in the lower levels, working most every day for salaries in the range of $2,000-$4,000 per month, the overwhelming odds take their toll.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We’ve discussed that,” said former big league ump Dusty Dellinger, the director of umpire development for minor league baseball. “I understand the difficulties and challenges these guys face.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>A tough call for some.\u003c/p>\u003cp>A.J.

Mario Cantone, who doesn’t play a detective, but certainly has had detectives snooping around his career. We got famous TV detectives. And that was a lot of fun. And then this year, also, my wife came on the show and she did not hesitate to give it to me. She says her favorite thing to do was come on a TV show and give me the business.

My son, who turns 5 next month, told me the other day that ‘I miss the city.’ They’re not used to this. This is not normal. \u003c/p>\u003cp>AP: What do you miss most?\u003c/p>\u003cp>Baldwin: Being with my wife, who I worship, and walking the streets of New York together. My kids going to school, a real brick and mortar school. All that is on hold right now. And for my kids — and all kids — we’ve got to help them. My job is to help them get through that. Because they’re beginning to get that something is not right.\u003c/p>\u003cp>This is not normal for kids. And you have to try to help them to manage their feelings and manage your own feelings.

But there is no evidence for this — and while the executives and many employees of Twitter, Facebook and Google may lean liberal, the companies have stressed they have no business interest in favoring one political party over the other. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The trouble began in 2016, two years after Facebook launched a section called “trending,” using editors to curate popular news stories. Zuckerberg met with prominent right-wing leaders at the time in an attempt at damage control, and in 2018, Facebook shut down the “trending” section,.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In August 2018, Trump accused Google of biased searches and warned the company to “be careful.” Google pushed back sharply, saying Trump’s claim simply wasn’t so, and experts suggested his comments showed a misunderstanding of how search engines work.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Last year, Trump again blasted social media companies after Facebook banned a slew of extremist figures including conspiracy peddler Alex Jones from its site and from Instagram.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Meanwhile, the companies are gearing up to combat misinformation around the November elections. Twitter and Facebook have begun rolling out dozens of new rules to avoid a repeat of the false postings about the candidates and the voting process that marred the 2016 election.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak\">The coronavirus pandemic\u003c/a> has further escalated the platforms' response, leading them to take actions against politicians — a move they’ve long resisted — who make misleading claims about the virus. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Last month, Twitter began a “Get the Facts” label to direct social media users to news articles from trusted outlets next to tweets containing misleading or disputed information about the virus. \u003c/p>\u003cp>As the White House claimed that Trump was the subject of a fact check but Chinese disinformation about the coronavirus was not, Twitter moved Thursday to add a warning to a March tweet from a Chinese government spokesman falsely claiming the U.S. military spread the virus.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Even as he and his supporters complain of bias on the platform, Trump has used Twitter to build a potent and vocal online following. The president’s account currently has more than 80 million followers. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump’s success on social media suggests that his proposal may be more about politics than an actual interest in regulation, according to Rutgers University media professor John Pavlik, who studies the impact of technology on society and government.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Pavlik said that by trying to intimidate the platforms now, he’s seeking to control how the 2020 campaign plays out online and \"about appealing to his base.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>AP writers Amanda Seitz, Barbara Ortutay and David Klepper contributed.\u003c/p>","description":null,"pullQuoteObjs":[],"embedCaption":null,"sequenceNumber":null,"title":"US--Trump-Twitter","headline":"Trump escalates war on Twitter, social media protections","localMemberName":null,"dateline":null,"old_lead_video_key":"ce2689ee7c70417487bfe56cfe026dfa","id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:fc30f9ebdff9d3d33a870e7374f8ffa6","truncatedFirstWords":true,"etag":"fc30f9ebdff9d3d33a870e7374f8ffa6_16a10aza0c0","notificationId":null,"version":null,"videoContext":"s much can be done without an act of Congress.\u003c/p>","latestEtag":null,"embedLinkURL":null,"bylines":"By ZEKE MILLER","revision":null,"mediumIds":["ce2689ee7c70417487bfe56cfe026dfa","328549a4282442d5a20c0242a2fd02d8","b990328049bc46e7826600f45d976ac9","07b9211738ed43e7b6ead17fbc2e278c","201cccc7b7494c14912a2d0029957081","88165893f0744d4793c98ae355469dad","94bba11b31ce463eaa2df47c1ff0e541","c9fb58f6d12f4c52b166953eacbe23e6","da1b273e228f497197341d3d92b10e9c","34ee206d5b684c878b834a24b7bb2fda","bbeda6d1d7eb46ad82f1b31a4db40d29"],"media":[{"altText":null,"imageFileExtension":".jpeg","audioMimeType":null,"id":"ce2689ee7c70417487bfe56cfe026dfa","alignment":null,"embedCaption":null,"videoRenderedSizes":[640],"title":null,"imageMimeType":"image/jpeg","state":null,"etag":"ce2689ee7c70417487bfe56cfe026dfa_0a3aza9c0","externalId":"pHJL8pqTa_8","videoMimeType":"video/mpeg","managementId":"ce2689ee7c70417487bfe56cfe026dfa","flattenedCaption":"President Donald Trump escalated his war on social media companies Thursday, signing an executive order challenging the liability protections that have served as a bedrock for unfettered speech on the internet (May 28)","videoFileExtension":".mp4","type":"YouTube","caption":"\u003cp>President Donald Trump escalated his war on social media companies Thursday, signing an executive order challenging the liability protections that have served as a bedrock for unfettered speech on the internet (May 28)\u003c/p>","imageRenderedSizes":[1920,1000,800,600,400],"aspectRatio":1.7777777777777777,"xxUpdated":"2020-05-29 15:55:49","gcsBaseUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/ce2689ee7c70417487bfe56cfe026dfa/"},{"altText":null,"imageFileExtension":".jpeg","audioMimeType":null,"id":"328549a4282442d5a20c0242a2fd02d8","alignment":null,"embedCaption":null,"videoRenderedSizes":[640],"title":null,"imageMimeType":"image/jpeg","state":null,"etag":"328549a4282442d5a20c0242a2fd02d8_0a4aza9c0","externalId":"Jn6U88Q1-fM","videoMimeType":"video/mpeg","managementId":"328549a4282442d5a20c0242a2fd02d8","flattenedCaption":"President Donald Trump on Wednesday threatened social media companies with new regulation or even shuttering a day after Twitter added fact checks to two of his tweets.

(AP) — President Donald Trump, the historically prolific tweeter of political barbs and blasts, threatened social media companies with new regulation or even shuttering on Wednesday after Twitter added fact checks to two of his tweets. He turned to his Twitter account — where else? — to tweet his threats.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The president can’t unilaterally regulate or close the companies, and any effort would likely require action by Congress. His administration has shelved a proposed executive order empowering the Federal Communications Commission to regulate technology companies, citing concerns it wouldn't pass legal muster. But that didn't stop Trump from angrily issuing strong warnings.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Tech giants “silence conservative voices,\" he claimed on Twitter early Wednesday. “We will strongly regulate, or close them down, before we can ever allow this to happen.” Later, also on Twitter, he threatened, “Big Action to follow.” And in one more late-night tweet, he said “Big Tech” was “going absolutely CRAZY. Stay Tuned!!!”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters Trump would sign an executive order relating to social media companies but provided no further details. White House strategic communications director Alyssa Farah said Trump would sign it Thursday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In his tweet, he repeated his unsubstantiated claim — which sparked his latest showdown with Silicon Valley — that expanding mail-in voting “would be a free for all on cheating, forgery and the theft of Ballots.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>There was no immediate \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/e2560e949bd0d7413bd6244c6d4d51ca\">reaction from Twitter \u003c/a> to the president’s threats.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"related-story-embed\" id=\"6e35be10-91f0-11ea-a7ea-7d441a713c1b\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Twitter’s decision to mark the president’s tweets regarding mail-in balloting came as the president was sparking another social media firestorm, continuing to stoke a debunked conspiracy theory accusing MSNBC host Joe Scarborough of killing a former staffer. Prominent Republicans, including Rep. Liz Cheney and Sen. Mitt Romney, urged Trump to drop the attack — which has not been marked with a fact check by the social media company.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump and his campaign had lashed out at the company Tuesday after \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/700c52aab0869253625b80255a397f19\">Twitter added a warning phrase to two Trump tweets \u003c/a> that called mail-in ballots “fraudulent” and predicted that “mail boxes will be robbed,” among other things. Under the tweets, there is now a link reading “Get the facts about mail-in ballots” that guides users to a Twitter “moments” page with fact checks and news stories about Trump’s unsubstantiated claims.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump replied on Twitter, accusing the platform of “interfering in the 2020 Presidential Election” and insisting that “as president, I will not allow this to happen.” His 2020 campaign manager, Brad Parscale, said Twitter’s “clear political bias” had led the campaign to pull “all our advertising from Twitter months ago.” Twitter has banned all political advertising since last November.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"social-embed\" id=\"se0:96134fa0-91f0-11ea-c71c-0d360d3cefe5\">\u003cblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">.\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/Twitter?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Twitter\u003c/a> is now interfering in the 2020 Presidential Election.

The president’s critics, meanwhile, have scolded the platforms for allowing him to put forth false or misleading information that could confuse voters. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Some Trump allies have questioned whether platforms like Twitter and Facebook should continue to enjoy liability protections as “platforms” under federal law — or be treated more like publishers, which can face lawsuits over content.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The protections have been credited with allowing the unfettered growth of the internet for more than two decades, but now some Trump allies are advocating that social media companies face more scrutiny.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Big tech gets a huge handout from the federal government,\" Republican Sen. Josh Hawley told Fox News. “They get this special immunity, this special immunity from suits and from liability that’s worth billions of dollars to them every year. Why are they getting subsidized by federal taxpayers to censor conservatives, to censor people critical of China?”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Twitter’s first-ever use of a label on Trump’s tweets comes as platforms gear up to combat misinformation around the U.S. presidential election. Twitter and Facebook have begun rolling out dozens of new rules to avoid a repeat of the false postings about the candidates and the voting process that marred the 2016 election.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The advent of the coronavirus pandemic has further escalated the platforms' response, leading them to take actions against politicians — a move they’ve long resisted — who make misleading claims about the virus. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Last month, Twitter began a “Get the Facts” label to direct social media users to news articles from trusted outlets next to tweets containing misleading or disputed information about the virus. Company leaders said at the time that the new labels could be applied to anyone on Twitter, and that it was considering using them on other topics. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Twitter has said it will decide internally when to use a label, and on which tweets, and it will draw from information curated from news outlets.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg weighed in on the matter during a Fox News interview Wednesday. “We have a different policy, I think, than Twitter on this,\" he said. \"I just believe strongly that Facebook shouldn’t be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>Meanwhile, Republicans were turning their fire on one of the Twitter executives responsible for adding the fact checks: Yoel Roth, its head of site integrity. They are pointing to tweets he sent in 2016 and 2017 railing against the president and his allies. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“From their bogus ‘fact check’ of @realDonaldTrump to their ‘head of site integrity’ displaying his clear hatred towards Republicans, Twitter’s blatant bias has gone too far,” tweeted Republican National Chairman Chair Ronna McDaniel.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Jack Balkin, a Yale University law professor and First Amendment expert, said any attempt to regulate social media companies for the content on their sites would likely need congressional input and approval — and probably face strong legal challenges.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The president can’t do very much, but that’s not the point,” he said. “This is an attempt by the president to, as we used to say in basketball, work the refs.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“He’s threatening and cajoling with the idea that these folks in their corporate board rooms will think twice about what they’re doing, so they won’t touch him.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>—-\u003c/p>\u003cp>AP writers Amanda Seitz and David Klepper contributed.\u003c/p>","description":null,"pullQuoteObjs":[],"embedCaption":null,"sequenceNumber":null,"title":"US--Trump-Twitter","headline":"Twitter fact-checks Trump; he threatens new regs or shutdown","localMemberName":null,"dateline":null,"old_lead_video_key":"da1b273e228f497197341d3d92b10e9c","id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:c8898aad60175df06ebd160023285001","truncatedFirstWords":true,"etag":"c8898aad60175df06ebd160023285001_13a9aza0c0","notificationId":null,"version":null,"videoContext":" stories about Trump’s unsubstantiated claims.\u003c/p>","latestEtag":null,"embedLinkURL":null,"bylines":"By ZEKE MILLER","revision":null,"mediumIds":["e8fe597f968346b191e833db24063441","a7f0a8c1c00b4b748119b24eb623c730","da1b273e228f497197341d3d92b10e9c","328549a4282442d5a20c0242a2fd02d8","c9fb58f6d12f4c52b166953eacbe23e6"],"media":[{"altText":null,"embedCaption":null,"imageFileExtension":".jpeg","title":null,"videoMimeType":null,"gcsBaseUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/e8fe597f968346b191e833db24063441/","state":null,"flattenedCaption":"President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump arrive at Andrews Air Force Base, Md., Wednesday, May 27, 2020, after traveling to Florida.

Friday's Commerce Department figures reinforced evidence that the economy is gripped by the worst downturn in decades, with consumers unable or too anxious to spend much.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Even with employers cutting millions of jobs, though, incomes soared 10.5% in April, reflecting billions of dollars in government payments in the form of unemployment aid and stimulus checks. Wages and salaries, normally the key component of overall income, sank by an annualized $740 billion in April. By contrast, income in the form of government support jumped by an annualized $3 trillion. That form of income, though, will likely fade in coming months as certain government aid programs expire.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Friday’s report showed sharp declines in consumer spending across the board — from durable goods like cars to non-durable items such as clothing to services ranging from doctor visits to haircuts. Spending tumbled 17.3% for durable goods, 16.2% for non-durables and 12.2% for services. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“The economics of fear and sudden stops were apparent in April as fearful and locked-down households cut back on spending,” Gregory Daco, chief economist at Oxford Economics, said in a research note. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The depth of the spending drop is particularly damaging because consumer spending is the primary driver of the economy, accounting for about 70% of economic activity. Last month’s figure signaled that the April-June quarter will be especially grim, with the economy thought to be shrinking at an annual rate near 40%. That would be, by far, the worst quarterly contraction on record.\u003c/p>\u003cp>With spending plunging and incomes surging on the strength of government support payments, Americans' personal savings rate hit a record high of 33% of after-tax income in April. Economists said this underscored how anxiety and uncertainty about the economy are making consumers reluctant to spend.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Daco suggested that “more frugal consumer behavior ... will dampen the recovery.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>“This is particularly true as the social benefits will gradually erode over time, leaving households more financially constrained,” he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Friday’s report showed that an inflation gauge preferred by the Federal Reserve fell 0.5% after a 0.2% drop in March. Fed officials have cited the absence of inflation pressures as one reason they can be aggressive in supporting the economy by cutting their benchmark interest rate to near zero and pumping billions of dollars into credit markets to keep them flowing smoothly.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In April, the nation's jobless rate was 14.7%, the highest since the Great Depression, and many economists think it will top 20% for May. States are gradually restarting their economies by letting some businesses reopen with certain restrictions, and some laid-off employees are being recalled to work. Still, the job market remains severely depressed, and the outlook for the rest of the year is still bleak.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Some financial support for the tens of millions of consumers who have been laid off over the past two months is coming from the weekly unemployment benefits. Besides whatever unemployment aid states are providing to laid-off workers, the federal government is providing $600 a week in additional benefits.\u003c/p>\u003cp>A debate in Congress over whether to extend the $600 a week in federal unemployment aid looks sure to intensify, with the number of people receiving that aid now topping 30 million — one in five workers. The money is set to expire July 31.

Kevin Brady, R-Texas, are promoting a plan that would provide $450 a week for laid-off workers who return to their jobs, as a “back to work” bonus. This payment would also expire by July 31, though. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Larry Kudlow, the top White House economic adviser, said earlier this week that the proposal is “something we're looking at very carefully.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>Separately, Rep. Don Beyer, D-Va., vice chair of the Joint Economic Committee, has proposed reducing the $600 benefit to $300 in stages by the end of the year. This plan, Beyer suggested in an interview, would sharply reduce the number of people who are receiving more money from jobless aid than they would from working.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“If you solve that problem, there’s a good chance of extending unemployment,\" Beyer said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Typically, state unemployment aid replaces only about one-third to one-half a laid-off worker's pay to encourage the recipients to seek new work. The $600 in federal benefits was added as a way to replace all of an average worker's lost income. But because those who have lost jobs since the virus hit are disproportionately low-wage workers, most of them are receiving more in unemployment aid than they did from their old jobs, economists estimate.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Shannon Conway, director of operations at R&amp;L Hospitality Group in Richmond, which owns five restaurants and a catering company, said she and other restaurant operators have encountered reluctance from some of their laid-off workers to return. \u003c/p>\u003cp>That's partly because of the $600-a-week in federal unemployment aid, she said. But another factor is the uncertainty about what the restaurant business will look like in the coming weeks and months, Conway added. It's unlikely that servers will earn anything close to what they used to, she said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“Recalling staff is definitely an issue,\" Conway said. \"Why would they give up a sure thing when they know we don’t know what’s going to happen through these early stages of reopening? I can't guarantee them their same shifts.\" \u003c/p>\u003cp>Madelyn Figgers, 26, lost her job as a server in March at one of the restaurants Conway operates, Lunch and Supper. Figgers said the extra $600 in unemployment benefits has allowed her to keep up with all her bills and rent. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“I don’t think I would be able to stay afloat without the $600,” she said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Figgers acknowledged that the extra money would make her hesitant to return to her old job, particularly if it was for fewer hours than she had before. But she also knows that legally she is required to accept an offer for work, or risk losing all her benefits. \u003c/p>\u003cp>So far, Figgers hasn't been asked to return. But she doubts that the restaurant industry will return to what it was, when she could earn $300 in tips on a busy weekend night. She is considering leaving the industry and is looking for administrative jobs that she could do from home.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/2020-62/\">Research by \u003c/a> University of Chicago economist Peter Ganong and two of his colleagues has found that, because of the extra $600, two-thirds of laid-off workers are receiving benefits that exceed the paychecks they previously earned from working. One-fifth could receive at least twice their previous pay. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Ganong says that such large payments could delay some laid-off workers from switching to new careers that might be more in demand in the future.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But he also thinks that Congress should keep an enhanced benefit in place because more jobless aid is crucial in the midst of a deep recession. Jobless benefits enable recipients to pay for necessities and cover more bills, including, crucially, their rent or a mortgage, Ganong said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>He proposes replacing the flat $600-a-week payments with a percentage increase to each recipient’s benefit check, with the goal of matching the worker’s previous earnings but not going much higher.

The Holy Synod did not back him up, however, saying only it had the authority to excommunicate.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Greece imposed a lockdown early on, a move credited with curbing infections. The country has reported 175 deaths and 2,900 confirmed cases.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But many of the faithful chafed under the lockdown that closed places of worship for all religions for about two months. It ran through Easter, the most important religious holiday for Christians, and the inability to attend services weighed heavily on many. \u003c/p>\u003cp>When it was lifted May 17, thousands flocked to church. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“The issue of Holy Communion in particular is the only red line of the church and of the faithful in our souls,” said 19-year-old Michalis Gkolemis, attending services in Thessaloniki. “We don’t say that Holy Communion is the cure for all diseases, from the flu, for example, but we say that you cannot get sick by receiving Communion. You can’t catch a virus, something which isn’t proven scientifically but exists through experience.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>After ordering churches closed, the government has been more circumspect and has avoided the sensitive issue of Holy Communion. The limited spread of the virus also has reduced the risk of a renewed outbreak, at least for now.\u003c/p>\u003cp>For scientists, concern is tempered by knowing that opposing the powerful Orthodox Church, with a majority of Greeks as believers, could be counterproductive.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“This is a matter of public health concern,” said Dr. Gkikas Magiorkinis, assistant professor of hygiene and epidemiology at the University of Athens. “As an epidemiologist, I would like to be able to reduce the risk of transmission.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>But changing the minds of the faithful is “very difficult,” he said. “It’s a matter that can only be solved through discussion, and theological discussion rather than scientific discussion. Scientific discussion never helped, and it might have even worse results.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Discussions with the church were always open, said Magiorkinis, who also advises the government on the virus.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Only the church can provide a solution,” he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>—-\u003c/p>\u003cp>Kantouris reported from Thessaloniki.

Pavone said McCorvey’s “burden of pain” from her involvement in the Roe v.

Rob Schenck, a prominent evangelical and former anti-abortion activist, described some of that compensation as more indirect than a specific payment to leave the abortion-rights camp.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“In a movement, and especially in the Christian evangelical side of the movement, it’s only seen as right take care of people financially,” said Schenck, who now supports the Roe decision.\u003c/p>\u003cp>McCorvey quips in the documentary that “I am a good actress.” But Schenck, who worked with her following her anti-abortion shift, said “I never felt like I was paying an actress” even though he did worry at times that McCorvey felt neglected enough by anti-abortion groups to consider switching sides.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump has rallied behind anti-abortion groups' goals as he works to lock in conservative religious voters, an effort Pavone is assisting as an adviser to the president's Catholic outreach project.

Kirschblum of Lenczner Slaght Royce Smith Griffin represented Mr. Friedman on the appeal. In upholding the appeal, the Court of Appeal found (with one exception) that the US had not waived its sovereign immunity and therefore was not liable to be sued by Friedland. Immunity had only been waived, the Court held, in respect of any provable claim arising from the undertaking as to damages given when the Mareva was obtained. Friedland&#8217;s counterclaim was therefore dismissed. David W. Scott and Michael D. Crinson of Borden Elliot Scott &amp; Aylen were counsel for the three US government lawyers on the counterclaim. &#8230; <a href="https://www.lawbreakingnews.com/1999/11/friedland-counterclaim-dismissed/" class="more-link">[Read more...] <span class="screen-reader-text">about Friedland Counterclaim Dismissed</span></a></p></article><article class="post-41441997 post type-post status-publish format-standard entry"><p>Legal advice was provided to Celestica by Tom Smee of Davies, Ward &amp; Beck and Lynn Toby Fisher of Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays &amp; Handler, LLP (New York), and to the underwriters by Doug Marshall of Osler, Hoskin &amp; Harcourt LLP and Jason Lehner of Shearman &amp; Sterling.The fully marketed offering completed in November 1999 was the second financing completed by Celestica in 1999, the first offering having been done by way of a bought deal in March which raised approximately $340,000,000. &#8230; <a href="https://www.lawbreakingnews.com/1999/11/celestica-inc-720m-offering-of-subordinate-voting-shares/" class="more-link">[Read more...] <span class="screen-reader-text">about Celestica Inc. $720M Offering of Subordinate Voting Shares</span></a></p></article><article class="post-41440869 post type-post status-publish format-standard entry"><p>The law, based on now discredited Eugenics&#8217; theory, authorized a four person Eugenics Board to direct the sterilization of persons deemed to be mentally disabled or mentally ill. Relying on the Reasons of Madam Justice Joanne B. Veit in the Muir case, the Plaintiffs argued that the Board routinely acted outside the law and that all sterilizations directed by it were wrongful.Throughout the three-year course of the litigation, the Plaintiffs were led by a three-lawyer committee consisting of P.

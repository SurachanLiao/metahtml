    <p>Well, it finally happened. North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un reportedly had heart surgery and suffered a severe complication that left him in a dire medical situation. He could also be dead. That&#8217;s what CNN and NBC News&#8217; Katy Tur peddled out respectively. Granted, this is a closed society, so be cautious and after China totally botched a science experiment in one of their virology labs in Wuhan which led to the current COVID-19 pandemic&#8212;I&#8217;m not trusting their sources either. It led to some excellent memes and social media posts. There were also very serious discussions about who would take over. Kim&#8217;s children are very young. He has one daughter and two other children who we really don&#8217;t know about.</p>

<p>Tur dropped an atom bomb that Kim Jong-un was brain dead after he slipped into a coma. She later deleted the tweet out of an abundance of caution and for good reason because the South Korean government pretty much refuted the entire story, adding that there isn&#8217;t anything unusual occurring across the 38th Parallel. No movements&#8212;nothing.</p>

<p>Now, come tomorrow, we may find out more&#8212;but for now, it looks like CNN and NBC News, especially jumped the gun on this one. Look, even writers at the left-wing Nation knew to take this story with a grain of salt, but then we got the brain dead angle. Dear Lord.</p>

North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un reportedly had heart surgery and suffered a severe complication that left him in a dire medical situation. He could also be dead. That’s what CNN and NBC News’ Katy Tur peddled out respectively. Granted, this is a closed society, so be cautious and after China totally botched a science experiment in one of their virology labs in Wuhan which led to the current COVID-19 pandemic—I’m not trusting their sources either. It led to some excellent memes and social media posts. There were also very serious discussions about who would take over. Kim’s children are very young. He has one daughter and two other children who we really don’t know about.</p> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">BREAKING: The US is monitoring intelligence that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is in grave danger after surgery, according to a US official <a href="https://t.co/WyprxoyV94">https://t.co/WyprxoyV94</a></p>— CNN International (@cnni) <a href="https://twitter.com/cnni/status/1252413501793951744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 21, 2020</a></blockquote> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><ins>Decisions, decisions <a href="https://t.co/vpAk72ECGP">pic.twitter.com/vpAk72ECGP Link: https://t.co/vpAk72ECGP </a></ins></p><ins>— Matthew Foldi (@MatthewFoldi) </ins><ins><a href="https://twitter.com/MatthewFoldi/status/1252444027250753536?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 21, 2020 Link: https://twitter.com/MatthewFoldi/status/1252444027250753536?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw </a></ins></blockquote> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">When KJU dies, what will the Washington Post call him in their obituary?</p>— Matthew Foldi (@MatthewFoldi) <a href="https://twitter.com/MatthewFoldi/status/1252422196376428545?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 21, 2020</a></blockquote> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Attempting to predict the Washington Post obituary for Kim Jong Un... <a href="https://t.co/lU3Y0NfOD4">pic.twitter.com/lU3Y0NfOD4</a></p>— ForAmerica (@ForAmerica) <a href="https://twitter.com/ForAmerica/status/1252432052592377856?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 21, 2020</a></blockquote> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Kim Jong Un dying on 4/20 is the most Seth Rogan and James Franco shit EVER. <a href="https://t.co/zqdPNgraNd">pic.twitter.com/zqdPNgraNd</a></p>— SMOKESCREEN SZN ETHAN (@EthanGSN) <a href="https://twitter.com/EthanGSN/status/1252426882076688385?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 21, 2020</a></blockquote> <p>Tur dropped an atom bomb that Kim Jong-un was brain dead after he slipped into a coma. She later deleted the tweet out of an abundance of caution and for good reason because the South Korean government pretty much refuted the entire story, adding that there isn’t anything unusual occurring across the 38th Parallel. No movements—nothing.</p> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">NEW: Trump admin received information that Kim Jong Un had heart surgery last week and if he's alive, his health is poor, I'm told.

        Rep. Brian Mast (R., Fla.) ripped Democratic leadership for adjourning the House of Representatives almost immediately Tuesday without allowing Republican lawmakers to speak about the need for more small business relief.

"Some of my colleagues asked to speak here, asked to be recognized, asked to talk a little bit about what's going on here, express some of the urgency that we get to work here in the House of Representatives," Mast said in a Facebook video recorded on the House floor.

"No willingness to speak about when we will come back into session. No willingness to speak about the urgency that's needed for Americans today.

        CBS This Morning anchor and Barack Obama donor Gayle King gushed over Georgia Democrat Stacey Abrams on Tuesday morning, saying the former state legislator and failed gubernatorial candidate is "extremely qualified" to be vice president of the United States.

Abrams is openly lobbying to serve as Joe Biden's running mate come November, despite never being elected to any office beyond the state legislature. As she touted her voting rights work and "competence and skills and willingness to serve," King cut in to praise her as ready to be a heartbeat away from the presidency.

"That's a great nuts and bolts answer because everybody knows you're extremely qualified," King said.

        President Trump says his upcoming executive order to pause most legal immigration to the United States will ensure that the roughly 22 million unemployed Americans will be &#8220;first in line&#8221; for jobs when the nation reopens in the midst of the coronavirus crisis. During his daily press briefing on Tuesday, Trump outlined some specifics of his executive order pausing most legal immigration to the U.S. &#8212; a plan that will include a moratorium on issuing green cards to foreign nationals for at least 60 days. Trump said the decision is one based on morals and fairness for American workers:

        The Lyrid meteor shower will be in full effect in some regions &#8212; thanks to clear skies and a new moon &#8212; on Tuesday night.

The meteors&#8217; path springs from the star Vega, within their namesake constellation Lyra the Harp, which will be almost directly overhead by 4 a.m. Wednesday morning. For the most comfortable viewing, consider bringing a blanket or lounge chair for lying down and looking up.

What&#8217;s the best time to see the Lyrids?
While meteors could be seen through April 25, peak viewing occurs around 2 a.m. on Wednesday morning, according to Space.com, when as many as 10-20 meteors  &#8212; a k a &#8220;shooting stars&#8221; &#8212;

        CNN political commentator Van Jones said Tuesday that the decision by some states to ease stay-at-home restrictions and open businesses is effectively "a death sentence for communities of color," which have been disproportionately affected by the novel coronavirus. His comments follow Republican Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp's announcement that some businesses in the state would be able to reopen as early as Friday, as other state leaders signaled similar plans. "I think it's incredibly reckless. And, you know, signing these orders is signing a death certificate for many, many, many people who do not need to die and who will," Jones

        Every crisis has a self-reflection point. Six weeks into the coronavirus pandemic, we now have data and information available. We have seen the face of the enemy. Tragically, lives have been lost to the virus, but many victims have survived, and even more Americans have remained healthy through it all. It is time to begin examining what we have done and whether, with the benefit of hindsight, we were right to do it.

        Texas Gov. Greg Abbott discussed reopening his state Sunday during an online church service from Dallas, stressing that he wants to lead the nation in &#8220;returning to our lives and our livelihoods,&#8221; as the governor previously characterized the process.That the Republican did so by putting his faith in God, and praised God&#8217;s hand for the gains that have been made so far in the fight against COVID-19 is sure to draw the ire of many on the left.In an interview with Prestonwood Baptist Church Pastor Jack Graham, Abbott talked about opening businesses and churches, noting the importance of Texans getting back to work and earning paychecks.

They also sent the letter to the acting director of the Justice Department&#8217;s Office of Professional Responsibility, Jeffrey Ragsdale.

        Ivy League schools have been criticized for netting millions in taxpayer-funded coronavirus bailouts despite swimming in endowments worth billions. The country's most prestigious private universities including Harvard, Princeton and Yale are among the beneficiaries of Washington's $2trillion rescue package to keep businesses afloat during the epidemic. Higher education institutions have been apportioned $14billion of the aid provided under the CARES Act to weather the financial hits landed by the lockdown. Students have been sent home, and while many are taking classes remotely, the schools risk not collecting the totality of tuition fees. Of the top private schools, Cornell and Columbia will receive the most at $12.8million each.

        The smell may be hell but the mist could leave you pissed.

Two Australian doctors are weighing in about the spread of the coronavirus &#8220;down under&#8221; &#8212; whether it can be spread through farts, that is.

During Friday&#8217;s episode of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation&#8217;s &#8220;Coronacast&#8221; podcast, producer and host Dr. Norman Swan made a cautionary suggestion when it comes to particles of feces set adrift within a fart and the spread of COVID-19.

&#8220;No bare-bottom farting,&#8221; Swan advised about posterior pandemic panic, in a measured, mildly amused tone.

        WASHINGTON &#8211; Americans have come to expect that they will know who their next president is on election night, but that&#8217;s likely to change this fall.  In fact, because of a huge increase in mail-in voting in states that are not used to it, the presidential election could take a week or more to be decided. Public officials and advocates are just now beginning to grapple with how to prepare themselves, and the country, for this unprecedented situation.  &#8220;It&#8217;s a culture shift that&#8217;s going to be required,&#8221; said Vanita Gupta, president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights,

        CARSON CITY, Nev. &#8212; A strip club business that operates in Las Vegas has filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Small Business Administration after not receiving money from the $2 trillion federal coronavirus aid bill. Little Darlings owner Jason Mohney has struggled obtaining emergency funding from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act after Congress grouped the business into the category of operations of a prurient sexual nature, the Las Vegas Sun reported. Mohney argues the exclusion is discriminatory toward a class of workers who perform a legal and legitimate service through the Flint, Michigan-based company, which operates 200 exotic

        The government&#8217;s top auditor gave ICE and the Border Patrol a mostly clean bill of health Tuesday when it comes to treatment of pregnant illegal immigrants, finding that while dozens of complaints of maltreatment are lodged, few of them can be substantiated. Complaints that were backed up included one instance where a pregnant woman in custody of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement wasn&#8217;t given prenatal vitamins, according to the Government Accountability Office. Another substantiated complaint against the Border Patrol found that an agent had posted a picture and information about a pregnant woman online, violating the agency&#8217;s social media policy, the GAO said.

        CNN anchor Chris Cuomo dramatically staged a post-coronavirus emergence from his basement on Monday&#8217;s &#8220;Cuomo Prime Time,&#8221; falsely implying the footage captured the &#8220;official&#8221; first moment he left his basement quarantine. Cuomo&#8217;s staged emergence came after the journalist, who reported his diagnosis on March 31, discussed prior travels from his home, rendering Monday&#8217;s video report misleading at best and an outright lie at worst.

First and foremost, praise God Cuomo recovered from the virus, his infected wife seems to be healing, and the couple is with their children. But Cuomo himself was first to mention the trip he took outside his home on Easter Sunday.

        Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer compared the COVID-19 battle to World War II and asked:
&#8220;In World War II, there weren&#8217;t people lining up at the capitol to protest the fact that they had to drop everything they were doing and build planes or tanks, or to ration food.&#8221;

Does anyone want to tell Whitmer the difference is during the war effort people were working and getting paid; but under her unilateral decrees people are forbidden from working and no-one is earning a living&#8230;. Which is the entire reason for the protests, DUH.

        Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was forced to delete a tweet Monday saying 'you absolutely love to see it' while celebrating the price of oil crashing. The Democrat quickly removed the post after being criticized for celebrating job losses, but still used the economic collapse to plug her Green New Deal, which focuses on environmental issues.  The price of U.S. oil crashed into negative for the first time in history Monday as demand dries up and producers effectively pay buyers to take barrels off their hands. In the latest never-before-seen number to come out of the economic coma caused by the coronavirus pandemic, the cost to have a barrel of U.S. crude

        It is almost unbelievable that the Democrats have allowed themselves to be so completely out-maneuvered by President Trump in the coronavirus and economic crises. They are all calling for an indefinite protraction of the economic hemorrhage, with unemployment increasing by hundreds of thousands every day, even as the incidence of the virus declines.

The Democrats started out with every advantage: the crisis came out of the blue and burst over the administration. As soon as there was any hint of how aggressive and dangerous the virus was, the anti-Trump press went wild&#8212;frightening the public with visions of a bubonic plague that threatened the life of everyone despite the fact that approximately

        As we go through yet another week of Wuhan virus restriction in the United States, do you find yourself becoming annoyed at the daily sloganeering?  We see these messages on television, hear them on radio and flashed before us while driving.  I, for one, am beginning to tire of this "we're all in this together" claptrap, along with "flattening (or bending) the curve"; social distancing; and "stay safe, stay strong."  However, the one slogan that is most irritating is "stay at home...save lives."

        The lefties are melting down over the decision by some governors to begin re-opening their states to the business that is their lifeblood.  They are enraged by the people around the country who are protesting this ongoing shutdown of the economy.  As usual, they are calling them racists, Nazis, etc., the same-old, same-old epithets they hurl at everyone who supports the president and the Constitution.

They have no sympathy for the horrific damage this lockdown is doing to millions of Americans: small businesses, the restaurants we love, the shops we patronize in our neighborhoods, or the countless other industries it has hobbled.

Most of the complaints were unfounded, involving people "turning in" companies that were deemed essential by the county. Sure enough, he got them.  Here.

        A meat-processing company which shut down a South Dakota plant after more than 700 employees became infected with COVID-19 said the outbreak was due to the factory&#8217;s &#8216;large immigrant population&#8217;. Smithfield Foods blamed the migrant workers' &#8216;living circumstances&#8217; that are &#8216;different than they are with your traditional American family.&#8217; The company said the indefinite closure of the pork plant in Sioux Falls disrupted its supply chain, forcing the closure of a facility in Martin City, Missouri. Smithfield also shuttered a plant in Cudahy, Wisconsin, after employees tested positive for the virus. South Dakota's governor said the temporary closure of the plant

        SAN JOSE, Calif. - New data from San Jose Police reveals overall crime in the city is down since the shelter-in-place order was issued. Domestic violence crimes are slightly up and surprisingly, there&#8217;s a big spike in school burglaries. Chief Eddie Garcia said he&#8217;s pleased with the downward direction but knows when the order is lifted the numbers won't stay low.

Clyde Fischer Middle School in San Jose has been burglarized three times since distance learning began back on March 16. Thieves broke windows and rummaged through the front office. The principal said virtual reality sets and random computer equipment was taken and he's

        According to The New York Times coronavirus report, as of Sunday, April 19, 2:48 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, there were 35,676 COVID-19 deaths in the United States. Of those deaths, 18,690 were in the New York metropolitan area.

(The New York metropolitan area is generally regarded as consisting of the five boroughs of New York City, the five New York State counties surrounding New York City -- Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester, Rockland and Orange -- and the populous parts of New Jersey and Connecticut.)That means that more than half (52%) of all deaths in America have occurred in the New York metropolitan area.

He has also said that COVID-19 is a &#8220;great argument for universal health care coverage.&#8221; His plan is politically motivated &#8212; and deadly.When President Trump expressed concerns about the shutdown, his critics presented a false choice between mitigating deaths and the economy.

No longer can responsible nations tolerate the regime&#8217;s destabilizing interference around the world. Post-COVID-19, there will be a new world map, and this is what it is going to look like.

        On a brisk day in January, hunter and trapper Robert Lyle is opening the gate to the Willamar tract of the Lower Rio Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuge, a 1,162-acre brushy patch of federally protected land near Port Mansfield, when another pickup pulled up behind Lyle&#8217;s Chevy Silverado. &#8220;You with the oil patch?&#8221; the driver asked Lyle.

&#8220;No,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I manage the hogs.&#8221;

The stranger paused. &#8220;Can you do that?&#8221;

&#8220;Well, we try,&#8221; Lyle chuckled. 

Since 2014, Robert and his wife Vickie have been the only trappers allowed year-round on the 140-plus national refuge units sprinkled across the lower Rio Grande Valley, and they also hunt on private land

        Everyone knows the shootdown of Isoruku Yamamoto relied on the knowledge of his itinerary  The P-38s were waiting for him.  More recently Hellfire armed drones were ready to receive Qassem Soleimani:

    "The Americans were waiting for him.

    Armed with a tip from informants at the airport in the Syrian capital of Damascus, the CIA knew exactly when a jet carrying Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani took off en route to Baghdad. Intelligence from Israel helped confirm the details."

Knowledge is power. The Soleimani strike, like Yamamoto's, was made possible by information. The routine of heads of state is sensitive information,

        U.S. oil prices plummeted in historic fashion Monday, crashing below zero as traders unloaded positions ahead of the May contract's Tuesday expiration.

West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures for May delivery cratered by 305 percent to -$36.73 a barrel. At a price below zero, buyers would be paid to take delivery as there are costs associated with transportation and storage.

Jared Polis said Monday. Polis credited widespread compliance with social distancing and shelter-in-place orders for state information that suggests COVID-19 hospitalizations are leveling off, allowing the most severe restrictions imposed last month to expire on April 27. He urged residents who can work at home to keep doing so, to stay at home as much as possible

        No doubt, NeverTrumpers are clutching their pearls over the visceral new campaign ad released under President Trump&#8217;s imprimatur. It certainly isn&#8217;t gentlemanly the way George W. Bush was; it&#8217;s primal in its attack on Nancy Pelosi and its appeal to class resentments. It&#8217;s not the sort of lose-with-dignity approach favored the last generation of the GOP establishment.

But in an era of phony impeachment efforts and Special Counsel investigations and &#8220;blood on his hands&#8221; accusations, it is giving back to the Democrats exactly what they have hurling Trump&#8217;s way.

        Well, it finally happened. North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un reportedly had heart surgery and suffered a severe complication that left him in a dire medical situation. He could also be dead. That&#8217;s what CNN and NBC News&#8217; Katy Tur peddled out respectively. Granted, this is a closed society, so be cautious and after China totally botched a science experiment in one of their virology labs in Wuhan which led to the current COVID-19 pandemic&#8212;I&#8217;m not trusting their sources either. It led to some excellent memes and social media posts.

        After weeks of lockdown, several states have begun to outline plans for returning to business as usual. The economies in these states don&#8217;t need political schemes. They simply need to be released from government chains.
Governments don&#8217;t create economies. It&#8217;s not only beyond their legitimate functions, it&#8217;s beyond their abilities. They need to stay out of the way and let the wisdom of markets steer us back to normal. But some officials see an opening through which they can drive their big government dreams.
For instance elected officials in California, which is likely to be the last state to fully

        At this stage of a normal presidential election year, idle media speculation tends to focus on who will be the candidates&#8217; running mates, the vice presidential candidates vying to be sent to so many foreign funerals. In recent times, it hasn&#8217;t really mattered much beyond political cosmetics. But the secrecy surrounding the selection process &#8212; sometimes lasting almost until the summer convention &#8212; attracts media like flies on roadkill. [Snip] Biden&#8217;s occasional confusion and frequent nonsensical syntax have prompted questions about his mental state, even among Democrats. But, hey, they overwhelmingly selected him as their chosen champion to oust the despised usurper of 2016. So, he must be

        Not only is Nigerian president Muhammadu Buhari behind what several international observers are calling a &#8220;genocide&#8221; of Christians in his nation, but Barack Hussein Obama played a major role in the Muslim president&#8217;s rise to power. These two interconnected accusations are increasingly being made -- not by &#8220;xenophobic&#8221; Americans but Nigerians themselves, including several leaders and officials.

        A couple of weeks ago I predicted correctly that President Trump would reopen the economy midway between the point where the Democrats would blame him for doing it too early and the point where the Democrats would blame him for opening the economy too late.

I now realized that the president has gone one better than that, he has actually threaded the needle on opening the economy. He has decreed a road-map and left it up to the governors how to drive the road back to town.

The genius of this move, to me, is breathtaking. It really puts the Democratic governors on the spot.

        Senator Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced an unplanned Senate session will take place Tuesday as Democrats continue their refusals to restock funding for the Paycheck Protection Program. 

&#8220;It&#8217;s now been four days since the Paycheck Protection Program ran out of money. Republicans have been trying to secure more funding for this critical program for a week and a half. At this hour, our Democratic colleagues are still prolonging their discussions with the Administration, so the Senate regretfully will not be able to pass more funding for Americans&#8217; paychecks today," McConnell said in remarks on the floor Monday.

        Reps. Rashida Tlaib and Pramila Jayapal will save us all from crushing government debt &#8212; just make two coins worth $1 trillion each and parcel the money out! L. Randall Wray, a proponent of Modern Monetary Theory, disagrees. He says the Federal Reserve, not the U.S. Mint, should make lots of money and give it to all. The mistake here, as with all of Modern Monetary Theory (a.k.a. the Magic Money Tree), is to think that money is important.

It isn't.

Sure, we'd all like to have more money. Send some in, and I'll make sure it's spent on happy things. That last part is the very proof of the failure

        Cory Chalmers&#8217;s cleaning team looks a lot like Stormtroopers out for a raid.

And, of course, the pi&#232;ce de r&#233;sistance: electrostatic guns loaded with sodium troclosene, a disinfectant that, when dissolved in water, creates a fine mist of chlorine gas. The guns give the sodium troclosene particles a static charge that makes them cling to objects. When Chalmers and his gang of Galactic Empire cleaners want to disinfect something, all they have to do is point and shoot.

Chalmers, the president of biohazard and crime scene cleanup company Steri-Clean, Inc., has been busy this spring.

        When Joseph R. Biden&#8217;s top campaign advisors huddled to plot the rollout of key endorsements this spring, Hillary Clinton&#8217;s name flew under the radar.

The former Democratic presidential nominee has gone from being the face of her party to being persona non grata among Democrats.

&#8220;There is too much at stake to be fighting old political battles, which is why I think figures like Obama, Sanders, and Warren will play a great role between now and November,&#8221; said a major Democratic fundraiser familiar with the situation.

        Over the last month or two, as the coronavirus has burst into public consciousness, we have witnessed a long-running show called Liberals Behaving Badly. Liberals like Nancy Pelosi initially pooh-poohed the virus and criticized President Trump for taking meaningful action against it by blocking travel from China. But once it became apparent that the virus would be a significant problem, they did a 180 and began to accuse Trump of not doing enough. We have all seen this ad nauseam, and there is no need to catalog thousands of instances.

        Last week, members of New York&#8217;s Reclaim Pride Coalition demonstrated outside the Samaritan&#8217;s Purse field hospitals in Central Park. Protesters wielded signs reading &#8220;Help Not Hate&#8221; and &#8220;Hate Won&#8217;t Heal,&#8221; as if anyone had ever thought or suggested otherwise.

In contrast to their armchair detractors, the volunteers for Samaritan&#8217;s Purse put themselves in harm&#8217;s way, acting as backstops for a municipal hospital system at risk of being overrun with coronavirus patients. The group&#8217;s Evangelical Christian volunteers expose themselves to infection and disease at no charge to patients, treating the sick without regard to race, religion, sexual orientation, or any of the other identity groups under putative &#8220;siege&#8221; in the United States.

        In criminal law, everyone is presumed to intend the &#8220;natural and probable consequences&#8221; of his or her actions.

Thus, an accomplice who only agrees to rob a bank may be prosecuted for intentional murder if a guard is killed, because the robbery created a dangerous situation that could foreseeably result in death.

By this standard, we should all be talking about possible Chinese interference in the 2020 presidential election. Only two months ago, many political commentators, even on the left, thought Donald Trump was a shoo-in to be reelected in November, since he was riding the wave of a booming economy and successful trade deals.

        The virus isn&#8217;t the only thing going on in Washington that Wall Street and investors need to pay attention to.

There is another Black Swan about to take flight that could poop on the markets.

As I&#8217;ve been telling you for a long time, there are going to be repercussions from the political scandals of 2016.

The time is coming soon &#8211; maybe very soon &#8211; when we will find out who will be indicted and what impact these legal actions will have on the 2020 presidential election.

        I&#8217;m not sure how much this will matter now that we&#8217;re basically out of places to store all of the oil that we&#8217;re pumping, but it&#8217;s still worth looking this proposal over. Last week we discussed the possible opportunity available to us if the EPA would agree to at least suspend the mandates of the Renewable Fuel Standard until the worst of the pandemic is behind us. Getting rid of it entirely would be preferable, but that would require congressional action that the Democrats would never agree to and it&#8217;s unclear if the President could be convinced to support the idea even if they did.

        There&#8217;s nothing worse than coming home after vacation, especially when a worldwide pandemic broke out while you were gone.

One cruise ship that originally departed in early January is finally ending its voyage in a world that has drastically changed. For the passengers onboard the boat, not one has set foot on dry land in six weeks. The MSC Magnifica cruise ship originally set sail from Genoa, Italy, on Jan. 5, the BBC reports. At that time, many of the 1,760 passengers had reportedly not even heard of the new virus that originated in Wuhan, China.

        On Monday, April 20, 2020, the price of oil traded deep into the red falling below zero for the first time ever shocking even the most seasoned energy traders and oil executives.

What happened? The market was well aware the coronavirus has decimated demand across the globe as economies have come to a screeching halt but was that enough to push crude into negative territory?

FOX Business takes a look at what drove the price into a freefall and if it can recover.

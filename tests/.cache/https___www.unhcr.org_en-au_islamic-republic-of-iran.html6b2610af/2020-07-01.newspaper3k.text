The Islamic Republic of Iran is host to one of the largest and most protracted urban refugee populations worldwide, with approximately 3 million Afghans living in the country. UNHCR works with refugee communities and assists the most vulnerable.

We are supporting progressive government policies on education to ensure refugee and host-community childrenâ€™s continued and enhanced access to safe learning spaces, through the construction of schools in densely refugee-populated areas. By the end of 2018, our aim is that 89 per cent of primary school-aged refugee children will be enrolled in school.

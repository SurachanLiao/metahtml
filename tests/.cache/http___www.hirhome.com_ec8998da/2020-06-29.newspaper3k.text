An interesting sequence of events: 1) Trump says he is about ready to get out of Syria; then 2) the White Helmets accuse Bashar al Assad of dumping chemical weapons on Syrian civilians; 3) Trump expresses outrage, dumps missiles on Assad; 4) Trump is now satisfied; hell be out of Syria soon. Did Assad really use chemical weapons? And if he didnt, what was this all about?

When we examine the backgrounds of those chosen to make foreign policy for Trump, we find they are Establishment figures with a history of supporting pro-jihadi policies.

Is US policy-making run by a bipartisan elite cartel? Perhaps the president is a figurehead; the media show changes, but the long-term goalschosen by the CFRare always the same. If so, Trumps Middle East policies will feel different, but they will yield familiar fruits.

According to many in the mainstream media, the Trump-Netanyahu summit evidenced a pro-Israeli turn. That would be a direct challenge to the HIR model. But we dont see it. The result of the summit, we claim, was pro Iran. To say otherwise, as we show, requires important historical omissions.

Can Trump (assuming he wants to) transform US foreign policy in the Middle East? To get a sense for how difficult this might be, we must appreciate how traditional the pro-jihadi policy has been. (It wasnt just Obama.)

Will Trump be different? Israeli patriots expect him to be. After all, he postures as an enemy of Iran and ISIS. But, what evidence will be diagnostic that Trump really is delivering on his Mideast promises?

Resolución de la UNESCO sobre la Ciudad Vieja de Jerusalén. A favor el voto de México, pero en contra el embajador mexicano. Es liberado de su cargo, y el voto, retractado. ¿Por qué tanta controversia?

How to explain that, after four decades of US policy in the Middle East, the theocratic and Islamist Iranian statepart of the Axis of Evil according to George Bush Jr.s diatribesis stronger than ever?

This series of articles is a primer. It contains selected historical knowledge minimally sufficient to abandon the Establishment model of geopolitical processes and to begin constructing an alternative model that will explain and predict the world of international relations. Below is the first installment.

THE IRAN DEAL: WHAT DOES IT TEACH US? Immediately after signing the US-Iran nuclear deal, Iran tested ballistic missilesmeant for Israelthat can carry nuclear warheads. The US response? Nothing. What geopolitical theory can explain this?

The Rojava Revolution in northern Syria is a gender-equal, fiercely democratic, religiously tolerant Muslim movement that is bravely fighting and defeating ISIS on the ground. It is inspiring ordinary people all over the West, and some are lining up to fight with the Rojavans against the Islamists. Those interested in world geopolitics and the future of democracy worldwide would do well to pay attention to the fate of the Rojava movement. For its fate, like the fate of Republican Spain in the prelude to World War II, will be a harbinger of things to come.

Nov 2015  Jan 2016

At a Jewish community event called Día Limud I spoke of Netanyahus claims concerning the relationship between the German Nazis and Husseini, father of the Arab Palestinian movement and creator of PLO/Fatah, todays Palestinian Authority. This information, I explained, is the Achilles heel of the enemies of Israel. In attendance, José Hamra Sassón, former News Director of Mexicos Channel 11 (TV), challenged me to produce a single academic reference to support myself. An interesting public debate with Hamra has ensued.

ISIS attacks Paris, all eyes on ISIS: a gang of terrorists that lord a chunk of the Middle East and claim to be a State. Out of nowhere they came, it seems. But any hat trick needs misdirectionthe magicians trade. Now you see it, now you dont. Case in point: strike terror in Paris, capture the attention, erase history. ISIS was US policy. It was brewing since 2003, when the US invaded Iraq and gifted Iraqis with jihadist terrorism that set the US-military prison system to overflowing, becoming a jihadi university, as the general in charge called it. When jihadi university graduates produced ISIS, and ISIS produced the Syrian Civil War, the US helped them again. Pay attention, or you wont see the next trick coming

Peace for Our Time, announced a proud Neville Chamberlain after placing the Czechoslovaks in Hitlers foaming bite, one he relaxed only to spit threats of European war and anti-Jewish genocide. Peace in our time promised Barack Obama in his inaugural speech of 2013. History may not repeat itself, but it does rhyme. Obama prepares already the signature that will normalize the nuclear program of terrorist Ali Khamenei, Supreme Leader (official title) of Iran, and would-be emulator of Hitlers crime against the Jews.

25 May 2010

The US government pushes very hard for Israel to give strategic territory to PLO/Fatah in exchange for a promise of peace. But what if PLO/Fatah, also known as the Palestinian Authority, is a proxy of Iran?

This is the case whether or not you measure it by military spending, by various indices of military power (e.g. <a title="https://www.unz.com/akarlin/mei-2015/" href="https://www.unz.com/akarlin/mei-2015/">MEU</a>, <a title="https://www.unz.com/akarlin/cap-2013/" href="https://www.unz.com/akarlin/cap-2013/">CAP</a>, or the <a title="https://www.unz.com/akarlin/top-10-militaries-2015/" href="https://www.unz.com/akarlin/top-10-militaries-2015/">CMP</a> developed on this blog), or as pertains to the narrower if arguably more relevant naval sphere, by <a title="https://www.unz.com/akarlin/tracking-chinas-naval-power/" href="https://www.unz.com/akarlin/tracking-chinas-naval-power/">naval megatonnage</a> (even if the gap with China rapidly shrinks <a title="https://twitter.com/akarlin88/status/1329207441276477446" href="https://twitter.com/akarlin88/status/1329207441276477446">as the PLAN adds</a> <a title="https://twitter.com/akarlin88/status/1345742369388425223" href="https://twitter.com/akarlin88/status/1345742369388425223">the equivalent</a> of a major European Great Power navy every single year).</span></p>
<p  class='container'  id='p_1_2'  wcount='41' ><span  class='contents' >However, there are increasing reasons to think that large parts of this superiority could be becoming illusory &#8211; a dangerous state of affairs, given the recovery of <a title="https://www.unz.com/anepigone/team-america-world-police-social-worker/" href="https://www.unz.com/anepigone/team-america-world-police-social-worker/">bipartisan support</a> for US military intervention and American elites&#8217; oft-stated confidence in their military supremacy.</span></p>
<p  class='container'  id='p_1_3'  wcount='113' ><span  class='contents' >Some of these reasons are well covered in the military/strategy sphere, such as those relating to issues of the technological convergence of Chinese and other potential adversaries&#8217; weapons systems. The most hyped example are Russian/Chinese hypersonic weapons, though there are many more prosaic examples, ranging from progressive improvements in Chinese fighter engines to the <a title="https://www.unz.com/akarlin/iran-takes-3/" href="https://www.unz.com/akarlin/iran-takes-3/">unexpected precision</a> of Iranian ballistic missiles. This is accompanied by US procurement failures, with the F-35 program being the most high-profile example. However, what has not been written as much about  is the rapid degradation of the human capital component in the US military &#8211; a factor that is no less important than military capital or technological prowess.</span></p>

<p  class='container'  id='p_1_5'  wcount='60' ><span  class='contents' >High IQ is especially important in commanding positions and in the more &#8220;g loaded&#8221; services.

Klein, it seems to have been going rapidly down even before the diversity drives of the 2010s. The cognitive performance of US Marine officers has seen a 10 IQ point decline between the 1980s and 2010.</span></p>

But, good and aesthetic as fitness maxing is, brawn doesn&#8217;t do nearly as much for your combat effectiveness as brains. During WW2, American officers were Chad jocks who could outrun their platoons, while German officers <a title="https://www.quora.com/Were-US-Marines-tougher-than-elite-German-troops-in-WW2/answer/Joseph-Scott-13?ch=2&amp;share=f6d2d818&amp;srid=osVU" href="https://www.quora.com/Were-US-Marines-tougher-than-elite-German-troops-in-WW2/answer/Joseph-Scott-13?ch=2&amp;share=f6d2d818&amp;srid=osVU">were nerds</a> who studied military history, weapon specs, and did just one hour of athletics per week. Consequently, German units were much more combat effective than American ones, with the best US Marine divisions only being equivalent to second-tier Wehrmacht ones. On the rare occasions that they were more or less evenly matched on the battlefield, with no American logistics or air power preponderance, the Germans almost always won.</span></p>
<p  class='container'  id='p_1_10'  wcount='120' ><span  class='contents' >This decline is systemic and probably unavoidable in so far as private sector salaries have become much more competitive relative to public sector salaries, including military ones. The attraction of military service as a civic and patriotic ideal has also declined. In academic terms, West Point is a decidedly middling school; it is not where the intellectual gifted go. In fairness, this problem is not unique to the US Armed Forces. There have been similar trends in the Russian Armed Forces, though I imagine China may be more buffered from this by the banal fact that it has just 2 million soldiers out of 1.4 billion people. This should in principle allow China to be much more discerning in its selection criteria.</span></p>

Probably not &#8211; as we see above, it was already in progress throughout the US Armed Forces for at least the past couple of years, including during a period when Republicans were ascendant. Moreover, it has its antecedents in the other Anglo-Saxon countries, having started off in Canada and progressed onto the UK from around 2015. A British military affairs watcher with whom I&#8217;ve occasionally exchanged emails presented the following timeline a couple of years ago:</span></p>
<blockquote><p  class='container'  id='p_1_34'  wcount='130' ><span  class='contents' >
Britain has gone from, in just 5 years, the ability to train, organize and deploy the highest quality brigade-level expeditionary forces in the world to having an eroded military now more focused on &#8220;wokeness&#8221; and &#8220;diversity&#8221; than combat capability. This decline is not an overnight, black and white phenomena, but appears intractable due to entrenched ideology. Britain now has &#8220;woke&#8221; Zampolits in the armed forces, the JEDIs (yes, seriously), the Joint Equality, Diversity and Inclusion unit. Canada &#8211; as a pioneer of military &#8220;wokeness&#8221; in the Anglo-Saxon countries &#8211; has had these for some time, but have increased in power and scope under Trudeau. Canadian Federal government offices even have &#8220;Positive Space Champions/Ambassadors&#8221;, equipped with rainbow lapel pins, to enforce/observe compliance with ideology around transgenderism, immigration, 2SLGBTQQIA+ and even climate change.</span></p>
<p  class='container'  id='p_1_35'  wcount='66' ><span  class='contents' >The Canadian case is less surprising as it clobbered it&#8217;s armed forces with politically correct ideology from around 1989/1990 onwards. The British case is far more extraordinary in it&#8217;s radical rearrangement of core ethos and human resources pipeline in such a short time and at such a rapid pace. Britain had stubbornly resisted attempts to alter it&#8217;s armed forces with such ideology until around 2015.
</span></p></blockquote>
<p  class='container'  id='p_1_36'  wcount='84' ><span  class='contents' >One might argue that this is not such a big deal for Canada since it doesn&#8217;t have any Great Power pretensions and is hardly going to go toe-to-toe with China anytime soon. However, the UK most certainly does retain imperial aspirations, if suborned to American ones &#8211; and yet it drank the Kool-Aid regardless. Since most social trends towards &#8220;liberalism&#8221; in the UK end up migrating across the Atlantic after a few years, that the US would follow shortly afterwards was close to inevitable.</span></p>

But even there, it was accompanied from extremely harsh military discipline from the get go, with several divisions&#8217; worth of Soviet troops getting shot for cowardice, desertion, self-wounding, and the like during the course of the war. Meanwhile, more than a hundred US soldiers <a title="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-pentagon-tbi-exclusive-idUSKBN2041ZK" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-pentagon-tbi-exclusive-idUSKBN2041ZK">claimed &#8220;brain injuries&#8221;</a> from being in a bunker while Iranian missiles rained down on them for a few minutes.

<p  class='container'  id='p_1_41'  wcount='66' ><span  class='contents' >The whitepill in this, so far it is, is that all of this self-destructive activity might imply that the US is much less serious about fighting a Great Power than its public rhetoric lets on.

The military under Carter was in poor condition.  Old weapons,  old 782 gear, low standards for entry and most importantly, less training.  That changed under Reagan, quickly.  I'm not saying that was a good thing because Ron got foolish in Beirut and then compensated for his mistake with Grenada.    Our officers were arrogant pricks but seemed smart enough.

Of course when you have cases of grenades everywhere - that got everybody's  attention. - real fast .

The post-Vietnam, volunteer military was at a low ebb throughout the 70s, with bad morale (especially demoralized officers &amp; NCOs), poor discipline, worse readiness, continuing racial problems, &amp; declining percentages of enlistees who were high school graduates. Then came Reagan, an immediate 15% pay raise for all ranks, &amp; soon after, the "Reagan recession" of 1981-83, which drove many unemployed but competent people into the military so they could have a relatively decent job. This caused a dramatic rise in the overall quality of enlistees. In the Army we had people with masters degrees in statistics enlisting in combat arms.

Had they stayed private sector, they'd have been corporate managers, personnel supervisors, or non-guild technicians of various types.  In other words, they'd have been the sort of people getting laid off in droves in the last dozen years.  The all-in pay scales for military officers versus white-collar professionals may look comparable, but a big chunk of private-sector white-collar professionals are un- or under-employed, so an honest comparison would have to average in a lot of zero or low incomes to the private-sector side.  Even worse for the military, their officers who would end up unemployed in the private sector kinda know it, so they stick to the military like limpet mines, meaning that the military disproportionately ends up with the lower tiers of the professional classes.

Low IQ government educated multi racial recruits and the abandonment of the military by the traditional private boarding school educated professional classes. <br />In turn this has been exaggerated by cutting officer training by a year at the induction phase and dumbing down intermediate training by similar reductions. Add to that racial diversity and the ingestion of vast numbers of low IQ women and the result is vast numbers of pregnant officers and ordinary ranks who are affected negatively by emotional tiffs. <br />The real problem though, is the deteriorating pool of potential officers caused by mass immigration against the wishes of the indigenous population. This is compounded by the total lack of political opportunity to change this fact since the UK is to all intents and purposes governed by Israel and Zionist supporting Quislings in Parliament. <br />There is no longer anything worth defending in the UK now that rapists get off with two or three year sentences and the populace gets beaten up by the police for demonstrating (with the exception of Antifa or BLM), and the LGBTQ+ lot are above the law. <br />With the obvious Covid19 scam and the continuous lockdown/furlough scam no one in their right mind is going to join a military that now patrols the nation’s streets, schools and attacks it citizens online (77th Brigade and 13th Signals). Only a fascist government uses its military against its own population. <br />This is not just the end of Empire, but the end of western Christian civilisation in the UK.</div></span></div> </div></div></li><li  class='comment'  id='comment-4507297'  thread='4507297'  commenter='kent_nationalist' ><div  class='comment-body' ><div  class='comment-heading' ><div  class='comment-author' ><a  class='commenter-link notranslate'  title='See Commenting History - Over 1,300 Comments Since 2015'  href="/comments/all/?commenterfilter=Kent+Nationalist" >Kent Nationalist</a><span  class='says' > says:</span></div><div  class='comment-date' ><a  class='comment-link'  href="#comment-4507297" >March 5, 2021 at 7:11 pm GMT</a></div></div><div  class='comment-text' ><p>You missed  this classic</p>

<p>that doesn&#8217;t mean the Army guys are dumb. or at least, they weren&#8217;t dumb. they&#8217;re getting dumb now though. i noticed the dumbness starting to creep into the enlisted guys in the 80s, but the officers struck me as smart. 130 wechsler seemed believable for them on average, or about 2 steps smarter than enlisted troops, going by my interactions with Army and Navy officers in the 80s and 90s. my best friend&#8217;s dad was a Navy recruiter in the 80s and 90s and i went to West Point as a recruit in the 90s, but i decided to not join the Army after checking it out.</p>
<p>still, the dumbest an enlisted guy is allowed to be even today is about 96 wechsler. so i would estimate that what&#8217;s happening is less smart guys on average and at the top. the generals today in particular are extremely unimpressive. part of that is due to politics becoming a factor at the colonel level and up. part of it is due to them just being less smart and less capable now than ever. smart guys avoid the military now. </p>

<p>Air Force brainpower is probably somewhere in between Navy and Army. although design and construction of aircraft and missiles is at the highest intelligence level, above Navy. Air Force Academy has declined like the other academies, and the Air Force people have declined as well, although i don&#8217;t know for sure by how much. less than Navy and Army is my estimation. NASA on the other hand, a related government agency, has declined greatly, in their manned space mission capability, and cannot even function now. their SLS efforts are embarrassing.</p>
<p>despite all that, i am under the impression that in the current voluntary US military, the actual trigger pullers are better than ever. for the Army, Marines, and Air Force, the enlisted guys who kill the enemy, and the non-com officers and some of the academy officers who are directly involved in killing the enemy, are really pretty good. so far, this makes up for the sharp decline among the rest of the forces. it won&#8217;t be able to make up for the decline of the average Navy personnel in the surface fleet though. the submarine fleet is still staffed ok, for now. minus the useless women.

<p>other than a society wide decline in cigarette smoking, and, possibly, a decline in hard drug use (maybe), it&#8217;s hard to say what has improved. those 150 pound guys in 1952 who smoked cigs and fought in Korea were a lot fitter than the troops today who don&#8217;t smoke, but weigh 200 pounds of flab. my dad chain smoked all thru Vietnam and weighed about 160 during his green beret service running around in the jungle.</p>

Ergo, that nuclear weapons will quickly decide the outcome of WW3, and what matters to win this war is the whole missile design/delivery package with the highly skilled people running it.<br /><br />So, if this is right, then a SJW, Woke military won't make any difference at all, as long as they're kept out of this small area of critical skills.<p/><strong>Replies: @RoatanBill, @reiner Tor</strong></div></span></div> </div></div></li><li  class='comment'  id='comment-4507365'  thread='4507365'  commenter='anyone_with_a_brain' ><div  class='comment-body' ><div  class='comment-heading' ><div  class='comment-author' ><a  class='commenter-link notranslate'  title='See Commenting History - Over 40 Comments Since 2015'  href="/comments/all/?commenterfilter=anyone+with+a+brain" >anyone with a brain</a><span  class='says' > says:</span></div><div  class='comment-date' ><a  class='comment-link'  href="#comment-4507365" >March 5, 2021 at 7:56 pm GMT</a> &#8226;&nbsp;200 Words</div></div><div  class='comment-text' ><p>the dismissal of Rapone is a symptom of the deeper problem which is intolerance and groupthink.

<p>They are not going to fight Chinese.  They are going to fight Russia. It is very simple.  You tailor your army ideology by dehumanizing your future enemy, and selecting your fighters accordingly.  True believers will always be more effective &#8211; just ask ISIS vs Arab national armies. </p>
<p>For example, 9/11 was used to increase recruitment or rednecks who didn&#8217;t have much love for Muslims. Those rednecks were then used as cannon fodder to invade Iraq.  Those rednecks are Christian however, and are quite sympathetic towards Russia.  So they need to be purged from the ranks and replaced with ideologically reliable cannon fodder that can be counted on to hate Russia.  </p>
<p>Which us why Russia is the nexus of racism, white nationalism, male gaze chauvinism, subhuman online microagressionism, and sexual assault on democracy.  To make the world a safe space for rainbow minorities and women, first cancel the rednecks, then Putin, then Russia.</p>
<p>Woke are evil sociopaths, but they are not stupid &#8211; you don&#8217;t win the ideological fight for the heights of political and corporate power by being stupid.  They are very effective at setting the terms of the debate which is basically anti-access/area denial strategy.  If war is continuation of politics, it should translate to the battlefield rather well. </p>
<p>As for tactics such as driving warships into fish boats, those things happen but they will learn, with practice.  And drone operators sitting in air conditioned trailers in Nevada get plenty of practice. </p>

Had they stayed private sector, they&#8217;d have been corporate managers, personnel supervisors, or non-guild technicians of various types.  In other words, they&#8217;d have been the sort of people getting laid off in droves in the last dozen years.  The all-in pay scales for military officers versus white-collar professionals may look comparable, but a big chunk of private-sector white-collar professionals are un- or under-employed, so an honest comparison would have to average in a lot of zero or low incomes to the private-sector side.  Even worse for the military, their officers who would end up unemployed in the private sector kinda know it, so they stick to the military like limpet mines, meaning that the military disproportionately ends up with the lower tiers of the professional classes.  The results of this adverse selection cycle is on display in the dopey flag officer ranks alluded to by other commenters. </p>

Lots of malls, office buildings and smaller structures that once housed restaurants and other small business endeavors are no longer able to make their mortgage payment. The moratorium on payments can't last forever, and the owed payments haven't vanished so there's a huge balloon payment due at some point and almost no one will be able to pay it. Even if notes are refinanced via some new laws, the business activity that once existed to fund the mortgages just isn't there any longer.<br /><br />People working from home largely aren't going back to offices. The corporations that leased office space aren't going to need near as much as they once did. Billions of dollars worth of real estate valuations have or are going to evaporate due to the Covid nonsense. <br /><br />The call for a continuation of UBI is going to be hard to suppress and UBI is what has been instituted even if they refuse to call it that. The Democrats are itching to spend for minimum wage and their desire for more free stuff programs is insatiable. The political environment is perfect for spending on a scale the world has never seen before and all of it will be monetized by the Fed. The US Dollar will get inflated and foreigners will be incentivised to get rid of that hot potato as much as possible, meaning those dollars flow back into the US to send price inflation soaring for just about everything.

US codebreakers had broken the vaunted Japanese Purple Code several weeks before 12-7-41.  Roosevelt, Admiral King and General Marshall all knew well beforehand the general outline of the Japanese attack strategy.  They resolutely refused to allow General Short and Admiral Kimmel in on the dope.  What was the reason?<br /><br />Led by the likes of Charles Lindbergh Jr., the America First movement was large and influential. As a body the American people did not want to get involved in another war, whether against the Germans in Europe or Asia versus the Japanese.  This state of affairs presented a major stumbling block to the financier Cabal's plans to crush Germany, take Japan down a few notches and make the U$ the new hegemon in world affairs.  That, of course, hinged on continued behind the scenes control over the U$ government by the financial elite's "Federal" Reserve Bank.<br /><br />Presenting a face of running the show, FDR desperately did all he could to aid Britain and eventually Soviet Russia through Lend-Lease and various other stratagems.  The most egregious of those was to use American naval forces to escort convoys of merchant ships bringing war materiel to Britain.  On the Asiatic front, the Grand Strategy involved the U$, Britain and the Dutch government in exile to cut off all oil and iron exports to the Japanese, who were, at that time, deeply involved in their invasion of China.  How the hell you gonna make a major war of aggression in 20th Century terms without oil and steel?  Impossible.<br /><br /> The Asian strategy worked.  The Germans failed to fall for the sucker-bait and strike back as the U$ naval forces depth-charging their U-Boats.  By June of '41 Germany was drawn into a two-front war as they had invaded the Soviet Union.  No way did they want to face America's industrial might and its military besides.  So Roosevelt and Churchill employed the back-door route via the Japanese as those two nations had signed a mutual defense pact.  Deprived of the materials to keep up their war on China, Japan desperately developed their plan of attack on Pearl Harbor.<br /><br /> With high casualties at Pearl Harbor that Sunday morning and with Battleship Row devastated, the American people were easily goaded into war-fever.  Admiral Kimmel and General Short caught it in the shorts.  Scapegoats were needed.  They drew the short straw.  Roosevelt, Churchill and the Rottenfeller and Rottenchild Crime Clans cutting the orders for those two smarmy prostiticians, got their war.  <br /><br /> The truth about Pearl Harbor was all about politics up front and stealthy highest finance calling the shots.<p/><strong>Replies: @Alfa158</strong></div></span>, <span  class='comment-replylink' ><a  href="#comment-4509462" ><span  class='notranslate' >@China Japan and Korea Bromance of Three Kingdoms</span></a><div  class='comment-sourcetext' ><strong>@YetAnotherAnon</strong><p/>1. Japan’s escalating to a full scale war with China in 1937 was never planned. The bulk of IJA elite was in Manchuria planning for an operation against the Soviets comparable in size with Barbarossa https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kantokuen<br /><br />2. If Japan had planned to invade China proper, the wise move was to follow the Manchu strategy, attack through Beijing-Wuhan and Beijing-Shanghai axis. The latter especially suitable for mechanized units.<br /><br />3. But Chiang followed advice from his German advisors, to draw Japan to the much less favorable terrain of Shanghai-Wuhan axis.<br /><br />4. After taking Shanghai in a bloodbath, Tokyo was content with occupying Manchuria and area near Shanghai, but the IJA hawks on ground kept moving forward expecting Chiang to surrender and get even bigger spoils.<br /><br />5. But they were wrong cause Chiang told the Japs fuck you after even losing capital Nanjing and Wuhan. And retreated further west to Chongqing<br /><br />6. By 1940 IJA was in quagmire and secretly considered retreating to Manchuria. But saw an opportunity when France fell in 6 weeks. This gave them an opening to invade Vietnam and cut off one of Chiang’s last supply routes.<br /><br />7. This is when US sanctions against Japan started, so bear in mind that previous whole 3 years US was Japan’s biggest materiel supplier in the China war<br /><br />8. Nomonhan Incident was a wake up call for IJA as they realized their armor and materiel was were clearly inferior to Soviets. So even as Guderian and Hoth were at the gates of Moscow, they declined requests from Hitler to join Barbarossa. <br /><br />9. Also, Japan was shocked to find when Germany had signed Molotov-Ribbentrop without telling them. Was shocked again when Germans launched Barbarossa without giving them heads up. <br /><br />10. So by this point Japan had only 2 options, either give all their conquests south of Manchuria*, or Nanshin-ron, i.e. strike first at US, UK and Dutch colonies<br /><br />*I don’t know this for sure, but I think FDR was deliberately ambiguous about whether Japan can keep Manchuria. This was non-negotiable as Manchukuo was a state within a state for the Kanto Army. Okamura Yasuji would later advise the KMT in the Liaoshen Campaign, and remarked <br />宁可丢本土，不可丢满洲 „We can afford to lose the Home Islands before we can lose Manchuria."<p/><strong>Replies: @Chinaman</strong></div></span></div> </div></div></li><li  class='comment'  id='comment-4507621'  thread='4507307'  commenter='not_only_wrathful' ><div  class='comment-body' ><div  class='comment-heading' ><div  class='comment-author' ><a  class='commenter-link notranslate'  title='See Commenting History - Over 900 Comments Since 2015'  href="/comments/all/?commenterfilter=Not+Only+Wrathful" >Not Only Wrathful</a><span  class='says' > says:</span></div><div  class='comment-date' ><a  class='comment-link'  href="#comment-4507621" >March 5, 2021 at 10:55 pm GMT</a></div></div><span  class='comment-replylink' ><a  href="#comment-4507337" ><span  class='notranslate' >@Anatoly Karlin</span></a><div  class='comment-sourcetext' ><strong>@prime noticer</strong><p/>In many cultures, Air Forces and special forces tend to be most right-wing, Navies most left-wing, with the Army in between.<br /><br />Interesting to what extent this reflects current reality.

Well, what do invaders want?  They want to take our jobs, our resources, our lands, and eventually, political control.  Which is what is going on.</p>

<p>The US military runs up big profits for politically connected defense contractors, it runs interference for the state of Israel, it lets spoiled rich kids pretend to be Talleyrand (when they are closer to wrong-way Corrigan) and play with real soldiers as if they were toy miniatures&#8230; none of which matters to me.</p>

They are going to fight Russia. It is very simple.  You tailor your army ideology by dehumanizing your future enemy, and selecting your fighters accordingly.  True believers will always be more effective - just ask ISIS vs Arab national armies. <br /><br />For example, 9/11 was used to increase recruitment or rednecks who didn't have much love for Muslims. Those rednecks were then used as cannon fodder to invade Iraq.  Those rednecks are Christian however, and are quite sympathetic towards Russia.  So they need to be purged from the ranks and replaced with ideologically reliable cannon fodder that can be counted on to hate Russia.  <br /><br />Which us why Russia is the nexus of racism, white nationalism, male gaze chauvinism, subhuman online microagressionism, and sexual assault on democracy.  To make the world a safe space for rainbow minorities and women, first cancel the rednecks, then Putin, then Russia.<br /><br />Woke are evil sociopaths, but they are not stupid - you don't win the ideological fight for the heights of political and corporate power by being stupid.  They are very effective at setting the terms of the debate which is basically anti-access/area denial strategy.  If war is continuation of politics, it should translate to the battlefield rather well. <br /><br />As for tactics such as driving warships into fish boats, those things happen but they will learn, with practice.  And drone operators sitting in air conditioned trailers in Nevada get plenty of practice.<p/><strong>Replies: @The Wild Geese Howard</strong></div></span><div  class='comment-text' ><blockquote>

So making the US military more tropical in culture and more preoccupied with status feuds over internal racial and gender differences. <br /><br />Intuitively Woke military ideas seem most akin to some of the wilder left wing theories from the early 20th century, like the hard left 'people's war' one in which spontaneously organised  bands of armed proletarians were supposed to be  capable of easily crushing any  traditional 'bourgeois' structure force.</div></span>, <span  class='comment-replylink' ><a  href="#comment-4508550" ><span  class='notranslate' >@Anatoly Karlin</span></a><div  class='comment-sourcetext' ><strong>@John Gruskos</strong><p/>The Russian Empire didn't lose any core territories and lost 5 times fewer troops than the USSR, so adjusted for 24 years of industrial and technological development (effectively 14 thanks to the Bolsheviks), the answer isn't as unambiguous as it might seem.<br /><br />The Red Army did of course have harsher discipline and that made it stronger.

<p>The actual purpose of US military spending is to ensure hegemony in Europe.</p>
<p>The US subsidizes European defense, so Europe can spend more on social programs. </p>
<p>This would not be objectionable to me if the US used this influence to push Europe back into social conservatism.</p>

Without doxing myself I can tell you some very negative things that go unreported about the military. </p>
<p>1.Much of the heavy equipment is non functional. The trucks, artillery pieces, apcs, heavy weapons, etc have not been getting replaced. Maybe for an average armored unit 30-40% of the vehicles could operate sustained operations. </p>
<p>2. Female integration into combat units has led to many instructors for initial entry training to be replaced by women who have no experience in the field. As a result the red blooded men are receiving poor instruction on how to actually fight. If they receive instruction at all.</p>
<p>3. Command is largely oblivious to the fact the men are receiving poor quality training and equipment. They disbelieve or frankly do not care about actual combat operations. I would say 80% of organizational focus is simply SHARP (sexual harassment complaints) and EO (equal opportunity) </p>
<p>I could write more but this could quickly become 20-30 bullets of major issues I ve seen in the US military. Issues, no significant officer seems to realize. </p>

<p>The modern military really isn&#8217;t about noble foot soldiers duking it out with fire arms anyway.  Drones, underwater drones, drone tanks, stealth drones, and swarms of drones, don&#8217;t require valiant and honest soldiers.

Carriers are done. Any built after the nimitz class are a total waste, meaning the Ford class, along with the F35. Plus, as Anatoly said, we don't posses the MANpower to man carriers and squadrons. In 76, between hangar deck and the roof, Nimitz routinely sailed with 8 squadrons 100 aircraft, big planes, F14s and A6 Intruders. My first cruise we also carried 3 or 4 Vigilante recon planes. And 6000 total crew. The planes were big bastards. Because we can't MAN them anymore they only carry 65 or 70. With worse range and fewer refuelling assets than in the 70s through 80s, NAVAIR is vastly outgunned with current-state F18s at sea. Throw in China/Russia/Iran defensive missiles and you can see why carriers are toast. But Anatoly is most correct about MANpower. When you add in the hideous personnel issues, homos and the Alphabet Soup of Sexual Depravity and single black  mothers and the rest contrasted with the deliberate <br /> disappearing of White brains and talent, this alone will destroy carrier ops. MANpower.

Besides having undiagnosed severe PTSD (which eventually disabled me) and being pissed off at everything, there were 2 main areas of issues that caused me to quit.</p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t going to be responsible for the well-being of loyal, hard working people, who were being treated like disposable cannon fodder while billions were spent on ridiculous weapon systems.</p>
<p>The technically talented were spread way too thin, and were being set up for failure, and when they eventually make that mistake, they are crucified, not the brass that made the policies that set them up for failure.</p>
<p>Read the reports on fatal accidents in the military &#8211; especially friendly fire accidents. Too often there is some poor sucker who is spread too thin to do well at what they are doing, makes a fatal mistake in where to cut corners, and then is scapegoated for that.</p>
<p>Yes, there are some amazing high-tech weapons systems. And it takes an amazingly bright and talented person to fully leverage those systems. Without that talented person, those amazing high-tech systems are junk and money down the drain. It also takes very talented people to maintain those systems.</p>
<p>So draw a graph &#8211; the complexity of weapon systems is going up, while the IQ is going down &#8211; extrapolate that out, and predict the results.</p>
<p>Then there is the issue that much of the high-tech stuff doesn&#8217;t actually work well in the field because they were designed by eggheads who didn&#8217;t understand the real world.</p>
<p>I joined to defend democracy, not defend the profits of billionaires.</p>
<p>I have no talent for skating thru corrupt systems, full of predators who are looking for scapegoats, so I got out.</p>
<p>Recently I realized that I probably would have ended up being one of those would-be whistleblowers who gets assassinated. So all in all, its good I got out.</p>
<p>What really pisses me off now is how many people are so badly chewed up by that corrupt military system that they kill themselves, and the fucking hypocrites just ignore this. I suppose this is another graph that is going to get lots worse. Graph using idealism as a recruiting gimmick, against an increasingly corrupt and incompetent system.</p>
<p>In general the idea of the collapse of wokeness (after a major military defeat) and collapse of the empire sounds like a good idea to me. One of the writers on Unz said &#8220;Make America Ordinary Again&#8221;. That sounds fine to me. I like things like a big potluck of friends and family at the park on a summer day.</p>
<p>The tricky part is that when psychopaths are forced to see reality and let go of their illusions, they often have psychotic breaks, and these psychopaths are heavily armed with nuclear weapons. Putin&#8217;s big challenge is to avoid a nuclear war while the US is collapsing in on itself, and keep avoiding that war until after all of the nuclear weapons in the US have become nonfunctional due to lack of parts and competent maintenance. This could take a long time. </p>

<p>Well, officially the US military is there to fight wars &#8211; so it should be set up to meet the most likely major war scenarios. </p>
<p>Large international corporations do scenario planning and attach probabilities to prepare themselves for different commercial environments &#8211; so the military presumably goes through the same exercise to ensure that their capabilities meet potential needs. </p>
<p>This would involve realistic scenarios for WW3, and there seems to be a problem here.</p>
<p>Militaries in general look like they&#8217;re organized for WW2 ( large scale troop movements, invasions, sea power aircraft carrier battle groups etc.) whereas a more realistic assessment would plan for the use of tactical nuclear weapons (never mind ICBMs) and exercises along these lines have show that military operations soon collapse.

It would also seriously damage industrial capabilities in both belligerents. Therefore, the war would then continue with whatever assets and forces there remain after the initial nuclear strikes, which would be the majority of the peacetime forces. And then the war would be decided by them, plus whatever the remaining and reorganized manufacturing would be able to produce and forces organized after that. In general I doubt that the units organized in wartime would be better than whatever existed in peacetime.<p/><strong>Replies: @128</strong></div></span></div> </div></div></li><li  class='comment'  id='comment-4508494'  thread='4508494'  commenter='nodwink' ><div  class='comment-body' ><div  class='comment-heading' ><div  class='comment-author' ><a  class='commenter-link notranslate'  title='See Commenting History - Over 600 Comments Since 2015'  href="/comments/all/?commenterfilter=Nodwink" >Nodwink</a><span  class='says' > says:</span></div><div  class='comment-date' ><a  class='comment-link'  href="#comment-4508494" >March 6, 2021 at 10:42 am GMT</a></div></div><div  class='comment-text' ><p>Leftists are either ruthless killing machines, capable of taking out their enemies by the million; or they are limp-wristed soy boys who don&#8217;t know which way to fire a rifle.

<p>OTOH the Woke ideology is not Leninism nor 1790s French Republicanism.  </p>
<p>Apart from promoting the mentally unstable, its main purpose seems to be centring non-white groups, non-white culture and perspectives and ensuring the balkanisation of any organisation along identity group lines.  So making the US military more tropical in culture and more preoccupied with status feuds over internal racial and gender differences. </p>
<p>Intuitively Woke military ideas seem most akin to some of the wilder left wing theories from the early 20th century, like the hard left &#8216;people&#8217;s war&#8217; one in which spontaneously organised  bands of armed proletarians were supposed to be  capable of easily crushing any  traditional &#8216;bourgeois&#8217; structure force. </p>

The most important contributions were materiel and France's attempt to wrest away British colonies in the West Indies and India, such that British forces were tied down there.<p/>In actual fighting in the rebellious colonies France contributed little.  In 1779 a Franco-American attempt to recapture Savannah was a disaster because d'Estaing impatiently ordered a frontal assault on the British fortifications and thereby caused very high American casualties.  The French force landed in Rhode Island in 1780 did little until Washington utilized it for the siege at Yorktown.  Cornwallis was in the vulnerable position at Yorktown because he had been chewed up by the Scots-Irish militia (and relatively fewer Continentals) in the Carolinas and went to Virginia to join a British force there to reorganize.  The French West Indian fleet did block the British from carrying out an evacuation by sea, an important contribution of course.<p/>The fact is that the British never successfully held any part of the countryside and were cooped up in New York, Charlestown, and Savannah.  Their only attempt to establish outposts in the hinterland was in South Carolina, and that attempt was defeated mostly by militia, with the aid of relatively few Continental troops, in 1780 and 1781.

While superficially the subject matters are distinct, there are common ideological questions to both articles.<p/>Anatoly Karlin in the past had taken the trouble of differentiating between communists and liberals.

<p>I did overstate the point myself by claiming that Rapone was just too early. In reality, he would probably be discharged from West Point for repeating that Communism Will Win stunt even today.

So they re-wrote it as a novel (a novel with copious footnotes).<br /><br />The first half is a dive into technical weaknesses of U.S. equipment and infrastructure.  Very vulnerable to disruption, but met with "not my problem" etc. at low and high levels.  So when the Chinese/Russian hammer falls, the U.S. meets defeat in the Pacific.<br /><br />The second part of the book is, as you say, about the deus-ex-machina plot twists that allow the U.S. to weasel its way to victory through diversity.  It's not just preposterous but absurdist.  It adds nothing of importance to the book's message, I wouldn't be surprised if the publisher insisted on this Happy Ending (allusion intended) to garner positive reviews on amazon.<br /><br />The solution is to read through to the climax, then use the remaining pages to light your wood stove.</div></span></div> </div></div></li><li  class='comment'  id='comment-4508572'  thread='4508551'  commenter='bardon_kaldian' ><div  class='comment-body' ><div  class='comment-heading' ><div  class='comment-author' ><a  class='commenter-link notranslate'  title='See Commenting History - Over 4,900 Comments Since 2015'  href="/comments/all/?commenterfilter=Bardon+Kaldian" >Bardon Kaldian</a><span  class='says' > says:</span></div><div  class='comment-date' ><a  class='comment-link'  href="#comment-4508572" >March 6, 2021 at 11:50 am GMT</a></div></div><span  class='comment-replylink' ><a  href="#comment-4508551" ><span  class='notranslate' >@gotmituns</span></a><div  class='comment-sourcetext' >A few years ago UI was up in NYC's Penn Sta. and saw some NY Nat. guardsmen slouching around like a bunch of slobs.

<p>During WW2, American officers were Chad jocks who could outrun their platoons, while German officers were nerds who studied military history, weapon specs, and did just one hour of athletics per week. Consequently, German units were much more combat effective than American ones, the best US Marine divisions only being equivalent to second-tier Wehrmacht ones. On the rare occasions that they were more or less evenly matched on the battlefield, with no American logistics or air power preponderance, the Germans almost always won.</p>

<p>Especially since there were very few US Marines in the ETO to oppose them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This decline is systemic and probably unavoidable in so far as private sector salaries have become much more competitive relative to public sector salaries, including military ones. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other way around. Military and public sector salaries rose significantly during the so-called War for Talent of the early ‘00s to compete with the private sector, where in the past you served in the military for either patriotic reasons or for a leg-up, e.g. GI Bill, coming out of service, while public sector civilians enjoyed near iron-clad job security. Now the public sector has it relatively better than the private sector, except pergaps at the highest levels, but the “revolving door” between public and private sextors takes care of that. </p>

Besides having undiagnosed severe PTSD (which eventually disabled me) and being pissed off at everything, there were 2 main areas of issues that caused me to quit.<br /><br />I wasn't going to be responsible for the well-being of loyal, hard working people, who were being treated like disposable cannon fodder while billions were spent on ridiculous weapon systems.<br /><br />The technically talented were spread way too thin, and were being set up for failure, and when they eventually make that mistake, they are crucified, not the brass that made the policies that set them up for failure.<br /><br />Read the reports on fatal accidents in the military - especially friendly fire accidents. Too often there is some poor sucker who is spread too thin to do well at what they are doing, makes a fatal mistake in where to cut corners, and then is scapegoated for that.<br /><br />Yes, there are some amazing high-tech weapons systems. And it takes an amazingly bright and talented person to fully leverage those systems. Without that talented person, those amazing high-tech systems are junk and money down the drain. It also takes very talented people to maintain those systems.<br /><br />So draw a graph - the complexity of weapon systems is going up, while the IQ is going down - extrapolate that out, and predict the results.<br /><br />Then there is the issue that much of the high-tech stuff doesn't actually work well in the field because they were designed by eggheads who didn't understand the real world.<br /><br />I joined to defend democracy, not defend the profits of billionaires.<br /><br />I have no talent for skating thru corrupt systems, full of predators who are looking for scapegoats, so I got out.<br /><br />Recently I realized that I probably would have ended up being one of those would-be whistleblowers who gets assassinated. So all in all, its good I got out.<br /><br />What really pisses me off now is how many people are so badly chewed up by that corrupt military system that they kill themselves, and the fucking hypocrites just ignore this. I suppose this is another graph that is going to get lots worse. Graph using idealism as a recruiting gimmick, against an increasingly corrupt and incompetent system.<br /><br />In general the idea of the collapse of wokeness (after a major military defeat) and collapse of the empire sounds like a good idea to me. One of the writers on Unz said "Make America Ordinary Again". That sounds fine to me. I like things like a big potluck of friends and family at the park on a summer day.<br /><br />The tricky part is that when psychopaths are forced to see reality and let go of their illusions, they often have psychotic breaks, and these psychopaths are heavily armed with nuclear weapons. Putin's big challenge is to avoid a nuclear war while the US is collapsing in on itself, and keep avoiding that war until after all of the nuclear weapons in the US have become nonfunctional due to lack of parts and competent maintenance.

Ergo, that nuclear weapons will quickly decide the outcome of WW3, and what matters to win this war is the whole missile design/delivery package with the highly skilled people running it.<br /><br />So, if this is right, then a SJW, Woke military won't make any difference at all, as long as they're kept out of this small area of critical skills.<p/><strong>Replies: @RoatanBill, @reiner Tor</strong></div></span><div  class='comment-text' ><p>I don’t think that the current stock of nukes would be enough to destroy all military assets of a peer or near peer power like Russia or China.

Mostly this is due to the abysmally low quality of the officer class. Low IQ government educated multi racial recruits and the abandonment of the military by the traditional private boarding school educated professional classes.<br />
In turn this has been exaggerated by cutting officer training by a year at the induction phase and dumbing down intermediate training by similar reductions. Add to that racial diversity and the ingestion of vast numbers of low IQ women and the result is vast numbers of pregnant officers and ordinary ranks who are affected negatively by emotional tiffs.<br />
The real problem though, is the deteriorating pool of potential officers caused by mass immigration against the wishes of the indigenous population. This is compounded by the total lack of political opportunity to change this fact since the UK is to all intents and purposes governed by Israel and Zionist supporting Quislings in Parliament.<br />
There is no longer anything worth defending in the UK now that rapists get off with two or three year sentences and the populace gets beaten up by the police for demonstrating (with the exception of Antifa or BLM), and the LGBTQ+ lot are above the law.<br />
With the obvious Covid19 scam and the continuous lockdown/furlough scam no one in their right mind is going to join a military that now patrols the nation’s streets, schools and attacks it citizens online (77th Brigade and 13th Signals). Only a fascist government uses its military against its own population.<br />
This is not just the end of Empire, but the end of western Christian civilisation in the UK. </p>

</blockquote>
<p>A role yes, but any claim of crucial is dubious.  The most important contributions were materiel and France&#8217;s attempt to wrest away British colonies in the West Indies and India, such that British forces were tied down there.</p>
<p>In actual fighting in the rebellious colonies France contributed little.  In 1779 a Franco-American attempt to recapture Savannah was a disaster because d&#8217;Estaing impatiently ordered a frontal assault on the British fortifications and thereby caused very high American casualties.  The French force landed in Rhode Island in 1780 did little until Washington utilized it for the siege at Yorktown.  Cornwallis was in the vulnerable position at Yorktown because he had been chewed up by the Scots-Irish militia (and relatively fewer Continentals) in the Carolinas and went to Virginia to join a British force there to reorganize.  The French West Indian fleet did block the British from carrying out an evacuation by sea, an important contribution of course.</p>
<p>The fact is that the British never successfully held any part of the countryside and were cooped up in New York, Charlestown, and Savannah.  Their only attempt to establish outposts in the hinterland was in South Carolina, and that attempt was defeated mostly by militia, with the aid of relatively few Continental troops, in 1780 and 1781.  With the size of the British force sent and the infantry tactics employed, Britain never had a chance to subdue the revolt.  When the British realized that they couldn&#8217;t send out foraging parties successfully, they should have given up and negotiated.  Maybe they could have obtained some expansion of Florida or Canada that way. </p>

The South African military was feared even by the Russian, Cuban and East German forces opposing them. Why ? Because SA black troops were trained and led by whites and fought beside whites. Even those black Angolans who fought the Portuguese, were already experienced and battle hardened and were inducted into the SA army were retrained to SA standards. The SA paratrooper and Special Forces courses were the most demanding and exhausting anywhere  testing the limitations and endurance of even former British and American military  who joined up.<p/>Rhodesians, already experienced from their struggle also brought a lot of experience to bear in SA. 32 Battalion was particularly fearsome and ruthless. To this day black/white South African combinations working as free lancers still rule the roost with Government contracts from other African countries unable to cope with problems in their own countries Mozambique being the latest.<p/>Today the SA military, blacks led by blacks is SHIT.

Those are far and few even today. Generally, most were already experienced (although in a rag tag way) , some guerrilla deserters and others recruited for their language skills and pre-military experience living in the bush.<br /><br />The effectiveness of white led black troops was the result of merciless discipline and training and ability to live in the field without helicopter supply, a la Viet Nam of cold beer, hot pizza, Thanksgiving Turkey and cranberry sauce and stuffing. Severe beatings/ punishment were frequent when mistakes were made and live fire training was common with troopers trained to the extent they ignored close misses. Even Russian and East German trainers despaired over the quality of their students. Not so the SA Military.<br /><br />I also think though that the black man (training aside) was stiffened especially in particularly adverse situtions by whites (racist as they were supposed to be) who were prepared to die alongside them. <br /><br />I understand that Cuban troops who served in that theatre later implemented many of the training techniques used by the SA Army and some of their own. For example, in live fire training the trainee had to move from point A to B to C within certain time frames usually over difficult terrain/ obstacles. A machine gunner would dust down Point A, then Point B at times when the trainee should have moved on and was not supposed to be there. Too bad if Jose or Paco had not struggled forward with their load.<br /><br />The US Military encountered some of these individuals in Grenada and commented on their (The Cubans) extraordinary military ability. <br /><br />The US military better stop dicking around and get back to Viet Nam and pre-Nam training or we are going to be at a disadvantage in any major conflict.</div></span></div> </div></div></li><li  class='comment'  id='comment-4508902'  thread='4508902'  commenter='bob' ><div  class='comment-body' ><div  class='comment-heading' ><div  class='comment-author' ><a  class='commenter-link notranslate'  title='See Commenting History - Over 100 Comments Since 2015'  href="/comments/all/?commenterfilter=Bob" >Bob</a><span  class='says' > says:</span></div><div  class='comment-date' ><a  class='comment-link'  href="#comment-4508902" >March 6, 2021 at 3:26 pm GMT</a> &#8226;&nbsp;100 Words</div></div><div  class='comment-text' ><p><b>Military thought experiment Part 1<br />

<p>Some countries do reform themselves after military defeats.<br />
For example, Prussia after Napoleonic wars.</p>
<p>Other countries continue doing more of the same. A good example would be the Ottoman Empire, whose decline after the disaster at Vienna lasted 230 years. Rotten Ottoman Empire survived by playing European powers against each other and I expect the US to play China, Russia and India against each other. </p>

It was just that so many things had to be changed that it was impossible all at the same time. <br /><br />After the defeat at Vienna they lost so much that within a few years the Christians were close to Constantinople. But then they managed to turn the tide and pushed back the Christians, so that the actual territorial losses were not so large. <br /><br />They also remained a strong power, their subsequent wars with the Habsburgs (and increasingly the Russians) were fought with mixed success, basically defeats followed by victories, and so the decline took a very long time. <br /><br />Roughly a century after the war the Ottomans got so weak that on their own they were too weak to defeat any Christian power. That’s when they started needing outside help. But I wouldn’t describe it as playing others against each other, they survived as a result of tensions between the Christian powers, but it didn’t really have anything to do with some masterful Ottoman diplomacy, it just happened outside their influence. <br /><br />The very biggest difference between the post-Vienna Ottomans and the US after a hypothetical defeat is that the Ottomans were a premodern empire with no printing presses, so the elites could just keep the masses down, and the decline wasn’t even that obvious for someone living in the central provinces of the empire. They didn’t know how much more developed the Christians were. <br /><br />So I’m not sure if that could happen in the age of the mobile internet. Possible, but I tend to think that the ideology would be at least partly discredited.<p/><strong>Replies: @128</strong></div></span></div> </div></div></li><li  class='comment'  id='comment-4508938'  thread='4508938'  commenter='128' ><div  class='comment-body' ><div  class='comment-heading' ><div  class='comment-author' ><a  class='commenter-link notranslate'  title='See Commenting History - Over 1,000 Comments Since 2015'  href="/comments/all/?commenterfilter=128" >128</a><span  class='says' > says:</span></div><div  class='comment-date' ><a  class='comment-link'  href="#comment-4508938" >March 6, 2021 at 3:52 pm GMT</a></div></div><div  class='comment-text' ><p>But the public approval rating for the military remains very high at 72%, higher than Congress, the media, or the President.

<p>Serious wars between near peer competitors tend to be desperate affairs where everyone is taping their kit together and making do as best they can. The two Iraq invasions were an exception because the US (and allies) were utterly overwhelming. No military has ever been so organised and effective and possibly never will be. The German blitzkrieg through the Ardennes in WW2 was more of a donkey and cart affair than some incredible armoured manoeuvre, for example. </p>

<p>I also feel the US would need to rehome or build new fabs. </p>
<p>That&#8217;s based on Taiwan&#8217;s present ability to reach 3nm features. I am not aware of a US fab that can do that.</p>

<p>The US corporate structure and short term thinking are what&#8217;s keeping the development of better fabs at a distance. As long as they can contract the work and don&#8217;t have to spend on R&amp;D, they&#8217;re happy to do so. I believe the lithographic skills are available to reach parity with TSMC but there&#8217;s no will to try.</p>
<p>Micron and even Intel and AMD could ramp up memory production if they wanted to. As long as its cheaper to allow the Asians to do it and to avoid all the US regs on pollution, etc, that&#8217;s what they&#8217;re going to do.</p>

Carriers are done. Any built after the nimitz class are a total waste, meaning the Ford class, along with the F35. Plus, as Anatoly said, we don&#8217;t posses the MANpower to man carriers and squadrons. In 76, between hangar deck and the roof, Nimitz routinely sailed with 8 squadrons 100 aircraft, big planes, F14s and A6 Intruders. My first cruise we also carried 3 or 4 Vigilante recon planes. And 6000 total crew. The planes were big bastards. Because we can&#8217;t MAN them anymore they only carry 65 or 70. With worse range and fewer refuelling assets than in the 70s through 80s, NAVAIR is vastly outgunned with current-state F18s at sea. Throw in China/Russia/Iran defensive missiles and you can see why carriers are toast. But Anatoly is most correct about MANpower.

<p>That may have been a turning point for the consolidation of power. But if you are not familiar with the Dulles brothers&#8230;John Foster and Allen, I think you would enjoy reading about them.

Thank you.</p>
<p>If I may, I would take slight issue with the following statement: &#8220;This decline is systemic and probably unavoidable in so far as private sector salaries have become much more competitive relative to public sector salaries, including military ones.&#8221;</p>
<p>Private sector jobs?  Salaries?  In reality the U.S. has devolved into a highly socialist economy driven and controlled by the Federal government.  The comprising states have been absorbed into an enormous bureaucracy through Federal largess and burgeoning state governments.  Hardly, any industry is free or &#8220;private&#8221; from healthcare, insurance, manufacturing, aviation, education, social services, non-profits, construction, and even charities, etc.</p>
<p>It is not therefore, private sector salaries which are more lucrative than military salaries, but simply, all jobs in the plethora of government controlled activities which are afforded greater political and social value, e.g. You are considered more valuable as an indoctrinated teacher or professor than as a member of today&#8217;s military.  And, of course, do not forget &#8220;diversity&#8221; employment.  Consequently, I would change your original wording to perhaps read &#8220;societal salaries&#8221;, eliminating any illusion to free and private enterprise.</p>
<p>Now, of course, the military industrial complex grows enormously wealthy, but, that is a story for another day!  🙂 </p>

Those are far and few even today. Generally, most were already experienced (although in a rag tag way) , some guerrilla deserters and others recruited for their language skills and pre-military experience living in the bush.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of white led black troops was the result of merciless discipline and training and ability to live in the field without helicopter supply, a la Viet Nam of cold beer, hot pizza, Thanksgiving Turkey and cranberry sauce and stuffing. Severe beatings/ punishment were frequent when mistakes were made and live fire training was common with troopers trained to the extent they ignored close misses. Even Russian and East German trainers despaired over the quality of their students. Not so the SA Military.</p>
<p>I also think though that the black man (training aside) was stiffened especially in particularly adverse situtions by whites (racist as they were supposed to be) who were prepared to die alongside them. </p>
<p>I understand that Cuban troops who served in that theatre later implemented many of the training techniques used by the SA Army and some of their own. For example, in live fire training the trainee had to move from point A to B to C within certain time frames usually over difficult terrain/ obstacles. A machine gunner would dust down Point A, then Point B at times when the trainee should have moved on and was not supposed to be there.

I was also assuming a large warhead, most warheads are smaller. The US also needs to think about Russia. For Russia it might be smart to just evacuate the big cities and then launch the missiles to America. Anyway the Americans have to plan for that, so they cannot even use all of their nukes against China. <br /><br />The important thing is that China as a political entity would remain (even killing all urbanites would leave you with a population double that of America...), and probably you wouldn’t be able to destroy even the urban population.

US codebreakers had broken the vaunted Japanese Purple Code several weeks before 12-7-41.  Roosevelt, Admiral King and General Marshall all knew well beforehand the general outline of the Japanese attack strategy.  They resolutely refused to allow General Short and Admiral Kimmel in on the dope.  What was the reason?</p>
<p>Led by the likes of Charles Lindbergh Jr., the America First movement was large and influential. As a body the American people did not want to get involved in another war, whether against the Germans in Europe or Asia versus the Japanese.  This state of affairs presented a major stumbling block to the financier Cabal&#8217;s plans to crush Germany, take Japan down a few notches and make the U$ the new hegemon in world affairs.  That, of course, hinged on continued behind the scenes control over the U$ government by the financial elite&#8217;s &#8220;Federal&#8221; Reserve Bank.</p>
<p>Presenting a face of running the show, FDR desperately did all he could to aid Britain and eventually Soviet Russia through Lend-Lease and various other stratagems.  The most egregious of those was to use American naval forces to escort convoys of merchant ships bringing war materiel to Britain.  On the Asiatic front, the Grand Strategy involved the U$, Britain and the Dutch government in exile to cut off all oil and iron exports to the Japanese, who were, at that time, deeply involved in their invasion of China.  How the hell you gonna make a major war of aggression in 20th Century terms without oil and steel?  Impossible.</p>
<p> The Asian strategy worked.  The Germans failed to fall for the sucker-bait and strike back as the U$ naval forces depth-charging their U-Boats.  By June of &#8217;41 Germany was drawn into a two-front war as they had invaded the Soviet Union.  No way did they want to face America&#8217;s industrial might and its military besides.  So Roosevelt and Churchill employed the back-door route via the Japanese as those two nations had signed a mutual defense pact.  Deprived of the materials to keep up their war on China, Japan desperately developed their plan of attack on Pearl Harbor.</p>
<p> With high casualties at Pearl Harbor that Sunday morning and with Battleship Row devastated, the American people were easily goaded into war-fever.  Admiral Kimmel and General Short caught it in the shorts.  Scapegoats were needed.  They drew the short straw.  Roosevelt, Churchill and the Rottenfeller and Rottenchild Crime Clans cutting the orders for those two smarmy prostiticians, got their war.  </p>
<p> The truth about Pearl Harbor was all about politics up front and stealthy highest finance calling the shots. </p>

The Purple Code that was broken was a diplomatic code and contained no details on the movements or plans of military assets. The traffic basically said  that Japan was going to make one last effort to break the blockade and sanctions diplomatically and if that failed it would mean war.<br />The Japanese fleet had disappeared from view several weeks prior and was  training in the extreme northern islands of Japan. When they sailed for Pearl Harbor they took a route that evaded commercial shipping, observed strict radio silence and kept garbage on board the ships so any patrols would spot it floating in their wake.<br />The US military and government was aware that something was up, but thought if there was a surprise attack it would be conducted closer to Japan against someplace like the Philippines.<br />For the purposes of the Crime Clans getting the US into WW2, it really was largely irrelevant how devastating a surprise attack would be or which base was struck, the specific details weren’t that important. They just needed an attack to draw the US in. It was a bonus for them that Germany foolishly honored their mutual defense  treaty with Japan and declared war on the US.<br />The US Navy sent the carriers and their escorts out to sea on a combination training mission and sweep to see if the Japanese fleet was anywhere in the area, but the Japanese made sure  to approach Pearl Harbor from the least expected direction. <br />When the code breakers reported that the Japanese embassy had orders to burn their papers they actually tried to send messages to their bases including Pearl Harbor. Because of atmospheric radio conditions, the transmission by radio didn’t work and Washington used the Western Union cable to send coded telegrams that weren’t decoded and delivered to Kimmel until after the attacks.<br />The US lucked out by having out to sea the ships that it turned out would be most important for fighting WW2 ; the carriers and their escorting cruisers and destroyers.  As shocking as the spectacle of the devastation and loss of life was, all the Japanese accomplished was to blow up the US Navy’s meticulously preserved collection of charming but obsolete WW1 battleships. The oil supplies and repair facilities mostly survived because the Japanese became concerned that the missing carriers might be stalking them and Ozawa called off follow ups attacks. It was like Ford trying to cripple Chevrolet’s ability to sell cars by blowing up the classic Corvette museum in Bowling Green. <br />The lightening advances of the Japanese during the first six months of the war were not due to the loss of the battleships, but because the Japanese Army Navy and Air Forces  had  superiority in numbers, training, morale,  technology and weapons systems. The US knew it was unprepared and that a war was planned so when the war broke out the design and building of the new ships, aircraft and weapons that would win the war was already underway. That was why the Essex carriers, fast battleships, Avengers, Hellcats, P-38’s, P-47’s, B-24’s and so forth entered service within only a couple of years of Pearl Harbor.</div></span></div> </div></div></li><li  class='comment'  id='comment-4509109'  thread='4508340'  commenter='schuetze' ><div  class='comment-body' ><div  class='comment-heading' ><div  class='comment-author' ><a  class='commenter-link notranslate'  title='See Commenting History - Over 600 Comments Since 2015'  href="/comments/all/?commenterfilter=Schuetze" >Schuetze</a><span  class='says' > says:</span></div><div  class='comment-date' ><a  class='comment-link'  href="#comment-4509109" >March 6, 2021 at 5:17 pm GMT</a> &#8226;&nbsp;200 Words</div></div><span  class='comment-replylink' ><a  href="#comment-4509010" ><span  class='notranslate' >@The Wild Geese Howard</span></a><div  class='comment-sourcetext' ><strong>@Schuetze</strong><p/><blockquote><br />China, wittingly or unwittingly, has ensnared its self in this kabbala spider web.<br />&nbsp;</blockquote>Ehhhh, at minimum I think China is the highly admired globalist model for social control. <br /><br />I think it's likely China is helping to drive a lot of what is going on at present. <br /><br />I'm basing those thoughts on the number of divisions Xi controls versus Gates and Schwab.<p/><strong>Replies: @Schuetze</strong></div></span><div  class='comment-text' ><blockquote>

Failure of NATO C3 and efficacy of Ru artillery fire control &#8211; also an inability of NATO special forces  detachments to compete with Ru regulars (see WW2-style Polish casualties at Slavyansk and Dziewulski&#8217;s SF  unit near-annihilation at Ilovaysk.Many others.) </p>

<p>Well China appears to be playing along with a large part of this Great Reset/Globo-Homo agenda.  Perhaps Xi thinks, like all the talmudic hedge fund owners, that he can pull the rip cord at the last minute and parachute to safety after having danced in the gay disco for decades.  That still seems possible at this moment, but I would say that the evidence points to the likelyhood that Xi was owned by these Baphomet worshippers from the very beginning, just like Mao.  The same applies to the crypto jew Putin, who was hand chosen by Yeltsen. </p>

The trucks, artillery pieces, apcs, heavy weapons, etc have not been getting replaced. Maybe for an average armored unit 30-40% of the vehicles could operate sustained operations. <br /><br />2. Female integration into combat units has led to many instructors for initial entry training to be replaced by women who have no experience in the field. As a result the red blooded men are receiving poor instruction on how to actually fight. If they receive instruction at all.<br /><br />3. Command is largely oblivious to the fact the men are receiving poor quality training and equipment. They disbelieve or frankly do not care about actual combat operations.

<p>I wonder if the &#8220;long march through the institutions&#8221; was supposed to include the armed forces.

Japan’s escalating to a full scale war with China in 1937 was never planned. The bulk of IJA elite was in Manchuria planning for an operation against the Soviets comparable in size with Barbarossa <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kantokuen" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kantokuen</a></p>
<p>2. If Japan had planned to invade China proper, the wise move was to follow the Manchu strategy, attack through Beijing-Wuhan and Beijing-Shanghai axis. The latter especially suitable for mechanized units.</p>
<p>3. But Chiang followed advice from his German advisors, to draw Japan to the much less favorable terrain of Shanghai-Wuhan axis.</p>
<p>4. After taking Shanghai in a bloodbath, Tokyo was content with occupying Manchuria and area near Shanghai, but the IJA hawks on ground kept moving forward expecting Chiang to surrender and get even bigger spoils.</p>
<p>5. But they were wrong cause Chiang told the Japs fuck you after even losing capital Nanjing and Wuhan. And retreated further west to Chongqing</p>
<p>6. By 1940 IJA was in quagmire and secretly considered retreating to Manchuria. But saw an opportunity when France fell in 6 weeks. This gave them an opening to invade Vietnam and cut off one of Chiang’s last supply routes.</p>
<p>7. This is when US sanctions against Japan started, so bear in mind that previous whole 3 years US was Japan’s biggest materiel supplier in the China war</p>
<p>8. Nomonhan Incident was a wake up call for IJA as they realized their armor and materiel was were clearly inferior to Soviets. So even as Guderian and Hoth were at the gates of Moscow, they declined requests from Hitler to join Barbarossa. </p>
<p>9. Also, Japan was shocked to find when Germany had signed Molotov-Ribbentrop without telling them. Was shocked again when Germans launched Barbarossa without giving them heads up. </p>
<p>10. So by this point Japan had only 2 options, either give all their conquests south of Manchuria*, or Nanshin-ron, i.e. strike first at US, UK and Dutch colonies</p>
<p>*I don’t know this for sure, but I think FDR was deliberately ambiguous about whether Japan can keep Manchuria. This was non-negotiable as Manchukuo was a state within a state for the Kanto Army. Okamura Yasuji would later advise the KMT in the Liaoshen Campaign, and remarked<br />
宁可丢本土，不可丢满洲 „We can afford to lose the Home Islands before we can lose Manchuria.&#8221; </p>

<p>Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction</p>
<p>&#8220;This report examines U.S. efforts since 2002 to support Afghan women and girls and advance gender equality. Today, policymakers face a critical question: How can the United States best continue to support Afghan women and girls, preserving and expanding on the gains they have made—in the midst of conflict, poverty, a global pandemic, and the prospect of an Afghan government in which the Taliban exerts considerable influence?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;the report assesses U.S. programs focused on women and girls, to better understand what worked and did not work, and what assumptions and theories of change drove U.S. activities.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;SIGAR’s analysis found that the U.S. government has disbursed more than $787.4 million for activities primarily intended to support Afghan women and girls. However, because hundreds of other U.S. programs and projects included an unquantified gender component, this amount significantly understates the actual level of U.S. support for women, girls, and gender equality.&#8221;</p>

Too often there is some poor sucker who is spread too thin to do well at what they are doing, makes a fatal mistake in where to cut corners, and then is scapegoated for that.<br /><br />Yes, there are some amazing high-tech weapons systems. And it takes an amazingly bright and talented person to fully leverage those systems. Without that talented person, those amazing high-tech systems are junk and money down the drain. It also takes very talented people to maintain those systems.<br /><br />So draw a graph - the complexity of weapon systems is going up, while the IQ is going down - extrapolate that out, and predict the results.<br /><br />Then there is the issue that much of the high-tech stuff doesn't actually work well in the field because they were designed by eggheads who didn't understand the real world.<br /><br />I joined to defend democracy, not defend the profits of billionaires.<br /><br />I have no talent for skating thru corrupt systems, full of predators who are looking for scapegoats, so I got out.<br /><br />Recently I realized that I probably would have ended up being one of those would-be whistleblowers who gets assassinated. So all in all, its good I got out.<br /><br />What really pisses me off now is how many people are so badly chewed up by that corrupt military system that they kill themselves, and the fucking hypocrites just ignore this. I suppose this is another graph that is going to get lots worse. Graph using idealism as a recruiting gimmick, against an increasingly corrupt and incompetent system.<br /><br />In general the idea of the collapse of wokeness (after a major military defeat) and collapse of the empire sounds like a good idea to me. One of the writers on Unz said "Make America Ordinary Again". That sounds fine to me. I like things like a big potluck of friends and family at the park on a summer day.<br /><br />The tricky part is that when psychopaths are forced to see reality and let go of their illusions, they often have psychotic breaks, and these psychopaths are heavily armed with nuclear weapons. Putin's big challenge is to avoid a nuclear war while the US is collapsing in on itself, and keep avoiding that war until after all of the nuclear weapons in the US have become nonfunctional due to lack of parts and competent maintenance.

<p>I suspect the plutocratic elites are focused on their immediate personal advantage &#8211; how do <b>I</b> get richer and more powerful, next month, next week? They started and are riding the Woke wave, using it to gain immediate power advantages. If that means the US military loses wars 10 years from now, so what? If a place called the United States breaks apart, so what?<br />
Something like this must have happened in the Soviet Union, which explains how the all-powerful Communist Party lost control of the country.<br />
Compare this to a Roman Patrician who would die for Rome, or Teddy Roosevelt Jr. earning a medal of honor on D-day.<br />
An elite can be corrupt and selfish and still build a successful enterprise, if they have that extra layer of loyalty to the common cause. Even a mafia can do this. When a later generation of elites lose that loyalty the common enterprise can quickly fall apart. </p>

China has the biggest and most sophisticated and trained navy in the world. Unlike Americans, Chinese military personnel (navy, soldiers, and pilots) are well trained, courageous and will fight for honour to defend their nation.

Besides having undiagnosed severe PTSD (which eventually disabled me) and being pissed off at everything, there were 2 main areas of issues that caused me to quit.<br /><br />I wasn't going to be responsible for the well-being of loyal, hard working people, who were being treated like disposable cannon fodder while billions were spent on ridiculous weapon systems.<br /><br />The technically talented were spread way too thin, and were being set up for failure, and when they eventually make that mistake, they are crucified, not the brass that made the policies that set them up for failure.<br /><br />Read the reports on fatal accidents in the military - especially friendly fire accidents. Too often there is some poor sucker who is spread too thin to do well at what they are doing, makes a fatal mistake in where to cut corners, and then is scapegoated for that.<br /><br />Yes, there are some amazing high-tech weapons systems. And it takes an amazingly bright and talented person to fully leverage those systems. Without that talented person, those amazing high-tech systems are junk and money down the drain. It also takes very talented people to maintain those systems.<br /><br />So draw a graph - the complexity of weapon systems is going up, while the IQ is going down - extrapolate that out, and predict the results.<br /><br />Then there is the issue that much of the high-tech stuff doesn't actually work well in the field because they were designed by eggheads who didn't understand the real world.<br /><br />I joined to defend democracy, not defend the profits of billionaires.<br /><br />I have no talent for skating thru corrupt systems, full of predators who are looking for scapegoats, so I got out.<br /><br />Recently I realized that I probably would have ended up being one of those would-be whistleblowers who gets assassinated. So all in all, its good I got out.<br /><br />What really pisses me off now is how many people are so badly chewed up by that corrupt military system that they kill themselves, and the fucking hypocrites just ignore this. I suppose this is another graph that is going to get lots worse. Graph using idealism as a recruiting gimmick, against an increasingly corrupt and incompetent system.<br /><br />In general the idea of the collapse of wokeness (after a major military defeat) and collapse of the empire sounds like a good idea to me. One of the writers on Unz said "Make America Ordinary Again". That sounds fine to me. I like things like a big potluck of friends and family at the park on a summer day.<br /><br />The tricky part is that when psychopaths are forced to see reality and let go of their illusions, they often have psychotic breaks, and these psychopaths are heavily armed with nuclear weapons. Putin's big challenge is to avoid a nuclear war while the US is collapsing in on itself, and keep avoiding that war until after all of the nuclear weapons in the US have become nonfunctional due to lack of parts and competent maintenance. This could take a long time.<p/><strong>Replies: @John Q Duped, @Bill Jones, @Carroll Price</strong></div></span><div  class='comment-text' ><blockquote>

<p>Respectfully, I am not so sure about what they are competent at. Finance? Creating false media narratives to baffle the plebs? The financial and social engineering the US and UK bourgeousie have excelled at for a century are creating fissures in the entire civilization that may be ultimately fatal.

When you get bulked up in the gym and sometimes act you’ve got a chip on your shoulder, naturally people are going to wary of you.<br /><br />In the 80s Sino-Japanese relations were at a high peak because PRC provided Japan Inc with natural resources and cheap labor, and was a market for consumer electronics. <br /><br />Now they still have some high end industrial technologies, which is why they had the upper hand on Koreans during their trade dispute. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan%E2%80%93South_Korea_trade_dispute). <br />But in emerging tech they are falling behind to BOTH China and US. They have no answer for Huawei OR Tesla.

Japan’s escalating to a full scale war with China in 1937 was never planned. The bulk of IJA elite was in Manchuria planning for an operation against the Soviets comparable in size with Barbarossa https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kantokuen<br /><br />2. If Japan had planned to invade China proper, the wise move was to follow the Manchu strategy, attack through Beijing-Wuhan and Beijing-Shanghai axis. The latter especially suitable for mechanized units.<br /><br />3. But Chiang followed advice from his German advisors, to draw Japan to the much less favorable terrain of Shanghai-Wuhan axis.<br /><br />4. After taking Shanghai in a bloodbath, Tokyo was content with occupying Manchuria and area near Shanghai, but the IJA hawks on ground kept moving forward expecting Chiang to surrender and get even bigger spoils.<br /><br />5. But they were wrong cause Chiang told the Japs fuck you after even losing capital Nanjing and Wuhan. And retreated further west to Chongqing<br /><br />6. By 1940 IJA was in quagmire and secretly considered retreating to Manchuria. But saw an opportunity when France fell in 6 weeks. This gave them an opening to invade Vietnam and cut off one of Chiang’s last supply routes.<br /><br />7. This is when US sanctions against Japan started, so bear in mind that previous whole 3 years US was Japan’s biggest materiel supplier in the China war<br /><br />8. Nomonhan Incident was a wake up call for IJA as they realized their armor and materiel was were clearly inferior to Soviets. So even as Guderian and Hoth were at the gates of Moscow, they declined requests from Hitler to join Barbarossa. <br /><br />9. Also, Japan was shocked to find when Germany had signed Molotov-Ribbentrop without telling them. Was shocked again when Germans launched Barbarossa without giving them heads up. <br /><br />10. So by this point Japan had only 2 options, either give all their conquests south of Manchuria*, or Nanshin-ron, i.e. strike first at US, UK and Dutch colonies<br /><br />*I don’t know this for sure, but I think FDR was deliberately ambiguous about whether Japan can keep Manchuria. This was non-negotiable as Manchukuo was a state within a state for the Kanto Army. Okamura Yasuji would later advise the KMT in the Liaoshen Campaign, and remarked <br />宁可丢本土，不可丢满洲 „We can afford to lose the Home Islands before we can lose Manchuria."<p/><strong>Replies: @Chinaman</strong></div></span><div  class='comment-text' ><p>Let me ask you this. </p>
<p>We know the only reason the Americans are in South China Sea is because 80% of China’s oil is coming through the Malacca straits and they can pull a blockade if things went south.</p>
<p>How can China escape Japan’s fate ? </p>
<p>Can Russia and Iran ( through Afghanistan and Pakistan)  provide all the oil that China needs through the Pakistan landbridge  ? Is the Belt and Road, Afghan war and India incursion into Tibet all about oil ? I don’t see ant oil coming through the Himalayas just yet though. </p>

But you can manage relationships well with all neighbors without taking sides. Japan took sides, ditched Anglo-Japanese treaty and allied with Germans, only to be blindsided by Nazi-Soviet pact. Many in Japan wanted an alliance with KMT, namely Matsui Iwane, commander at Battle of Nanjing (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iwane_Matsui#The_%22China_expert%22,_1906%E2%80%9331). They botched that relationship to say the least. <br />Its a game of go and in the end, when the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality expired they were surrounded entirely by hostiles.<br />Whereas currently PRC has zero military alliances.<br /><br />So OBOR is key as backup to Malacca. The main point is a land trade route with EU/Germany, whose biggest trade partner now is also China. That is a *very* profitable trade. And will mean $$ to everyone sitting in between, obviously, Russia.<br /><br />Re S. China Sea, Americans tend to not know that 3 days after Pearl, IJN sank 2 Royal Navy capital ships near Malacca with only land borne aircrafts. This was another naval history first. So I think that’s the point of those artificial islands…<br /><br />And in that region you can’t please everybody. But the country I see most potential is… Vietnam. AK’s prolly covered this but Viets human capital is at least Turkey level if not Italy.

It is Tikkun Olam in action.  Just like the Plandemic and all the mRNA vaccines.</p>
<p>The Armed Forces from their very inception were highly Masonic, just think for 33 degree George Washington, or Lafayette.  Of course the entire &#8220;revolution&#8221; was really just a masonic rebellion and take over, but that is not the point here. The Airforce, and later NASA, are little more than giant freemason lodges.  The latest evidence comes from the &#8220;murder&#8221; of senior airman and devout throupler Ashli Babbit.</p>
<p>Freemasonry is just Kabbala and Baphomet worship for goyim.  Baphomet is of course the ultimate &#8220;woke&#8221; god, representing all androgyne/bisexual/bestiality/pedophilic perversions in one.  But not only does having a &#8220;woke&#8221; gay-disco army help promote Baphomet and Kabbalism directly, it also provides the loyal cadre necessary to enforce the woke world order, or as they are sugar coating it now as, &#8220;the great reset&#8221;.</p>
<p>This queer military is far more about enforcing perversion and the transformation of the US into Sodom and Gomorrah than it is about &#8220;defending&#8221; the &#8220;US&#8221;.  The globalist take over is complete anyway, the tech industry has created an electronic control matrix all across the planet.  China, wittingly or unwittingly, has ensnared its self in this kabbala spider web.</p>
<p>The modern military really isn&#8217;t about noble foot soldiers duking it out with fire arms anyway.

A good example would be the Ottoman Empire, whose decline after the disaster at Vienna lasted 230 years. Rotten Ottoman Empire survived by playing European powers against each other and I expect the US to play China, Russia and India against each other.<p/><strong>Replies: @reiner Tor</strong></div></span><div  class='comment-text' ><p>I think the Ottomans actually engaged in serious reform before. It was just that so many things had to be changed that it was impossible all at the same time. </p>
<p>After the defeat at Vienna they lost so much that within a few years the Christians were close to Constantinople. But then they managed to turn the tide and pushed back the Christians, so that the actual territorial losses were not so large. </p>
<p>They also remained a strong power, their subsequent wars with the Habsburgs (and increasingly the Russians) were fought with mixed success, basically defeats followed by victories, and so the decline took a very long time. </p>
<p>Roughly a century after the war the Ottomans got so weak that on their own they were too weak to defeat any Christian power. That’s when they started needing outside help. But I wouldn’t describe it as playing others against each other, they survived as a result of tensions between the Christian powers, but it didn’t really have anything to do with some masterful Ottoman diplomacy, it just happened outside their influence. </p>
<p>The very biggest difference between the post-Vienna Ottomans and the US after a hypothetical defeat is that the Ottomans were a premodern empire with no printing presses, so the elites could just keep the masses down, and the decline wasn’t even that obvious for someone living in the central provinces of the empire. They didn’t know how much more developed the Christians were. </p>
<p>So I’m not sure if that could happen in the age of the mobile internet. Possible, but I tend to think that the ideology would be at least partly discredited. </p>

Basically the military just follows the trends of society, so as society gets more liberal and woke, the military will get more liberal and woke, unless it wants to increase the social distance between it and the people that it serves, which brings forth another whole set of problems. Also if the social distance between the military and the people it serves becomes to great, that will also bring into peril civilian control over the military, if the people in the military feels increasingly distant and alienated from the people they are serving due to increasing gulf of social values.<p/>https://news.gallup.com/poll/1666/military-national-defense.aspx<p/><strong>Replies: @Shortsword, @reiner Tor</strong></div></span><div  class='comment-text' ><p>That’s a good point. It means that wokism won’t just have a corrosive effect on society and the economy, but it will simultaneously erode the military power. And not just indirectly, by increasing the cost of maintaining it (diversity requirements for the suppliers etc.), but also directly. But it also makes it more difficult to keep wokism in civilian life in the event of a military reform. So either wokism gets partly or fully rolled back or the military won’t get stronger even after serious defeats. </p>

They know the American military has spent decades degrading its human capital and that these Woke games are even worse, that driving straight White men out of the military and making it unappealing to new straight White men to enlist is a death sentence.&#8221; I certainly think that, and many people here think so, too, but the top brass says replacing White men with &#8220;diversity&#8221; provides a military advantage comparable to superior to China&#8217;s espionage and R&amp;D closing technology gaps and I think they believe that. </p>
<p>Alongside the Diversity and Inclusion drumbeat is a now sort of Truth and Reconciliation Commission starting with that &#8220;60 day stand down&#8221; to talk about how best to throw out right wing people from the U.S. military by calling those people White supremacists, domestic terrorists, political extremists and insurrectionist. That was the first thing the new black Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin did. All of that stuff is only going to increase. That&#8217;s the double whammy to hammer the human capital. Its not just that the freaks and geeks are going to be brought in and promoted, its that they are being brought in to replace the future purged military members and making enlisting in the military and re-enlisting in the military a total turn off.</p>
<p>I really do believe that the leadership does think that this diversity and inclusion stuff has made the military better, not worse, and that driving out &#8220;insurrectionists&#8221; will make it better and not worse, and making it less appealing to straight White men to remain in it and join it will be good, not bad.</p>
<p>Also, if NATO forces ever truly took a nice, thorough shellacking at the hands of a proper competitor or roughly equivalent military alliance, we all know what the apologetics for that would be. They didn&#8217;t lose because diversity and inclusion had turned the military into a Woke college campus farce.

Then came Reagan, an immediate 15% pay raise for all ranks, &amp; soon after, the &#8220;Reagan recession&#8221; of 1981-83, which drove many unemployed but competent people into the military so they could have a relatively decent job.

<p>I agree that this will be the argument of the wokist true believers. But how many hangers-on and opportunists will just think that this is now the weak horse? How many fence-sitters or casual believers will still be convinced after a military defeat? I mean people who just swallow wokism whole, but who never think much about it, because that’s what the smart and educated guys who keep winning say. They will now be the people who lost a serious war against a serious adversary. If not in America, then in places like Japan, Germany, Hungary, Poland, etc., people will certainly ask questions, and once those places are gone, how many people will think in America itself that perhaps they also needed to change..? </p>

German academics were humiliated when they were constrained to watch an experiment in a deep  coal mine in Silesia in which two spheres moved away from each other by a very short distance, and this was alleged to be due to the centrifugal force, as we would be living in a concave surface within a solid Earth, where the Sun would be at its center, and the ligth would be distorted to appear as if we were living on a convex surface. Indeed, the real reason of the movement done by the spheres was the gravitational force exerted by the landmass around them inside the mine. Adding this delusion to other myths such as Shamballah (from Palladic branches of freemasons, like Theosophism), Agartha (from Martinist branches of freemasons, like Traditionalists), etc. we conclude that gnosis leads to the destruction of rational science and other chloroquinisms.

Then came Reagan, an immediate 15% pay raise for all ranks, &amp; soon after, the "Reagan recession" of 1981-83, which drove many unemployed but competent people into the military so they could have a relatively decent job. This caused a dramatic rise in the overall quality of enlistees. In the Army we had people with masters degrees in statistics enlisting in combat arms.

The junior enlisted ranks were full of resentful, occasionally mutinous, low-IQ types (mostly blacks). Competent NCOs were leaving in droves. The motor pool was a shambles, weapons systems were often inoperable, &amp; readiness reports were lies. Budgets were too low for hard, realistic training (except in a few elite units, like Rangers &amp; perhaps the 82nd Airborne Division).  <br /><br />But we had no illusions. Everyone knew what the main problem was: we had shitty soldiers. We knew that if we survived the first day of the next war, even defeated, if we weren't totally destroyed we would get rid of the scum (by whatever means necessary), &amp; the good NCOs would be allowed to really take charge, impose discipline, &amp; get the job done.  We didn't have any PC regs that would have prevented that. <br /><br />Now, the entire military - except, maybe, a few special operations units - lives 24/7 under illusions: that women in combat units (&amp; others requiring physical strength) are equal to men, that insane ideas like "diversity makes us stronger" are valid principles of war, that white hillbillies &amp; white urban ethnics are more likely to be seditious racist terrorists than what they have always been in all our wars: the backbone of our combat forces.  <br /><br />And I have no confidence that even disastrous defeat would cause our leaders to change the "woke mil" to a military which could fight &amp; win, such is the apparent grip of radical egalitarian ideology upon our generals and admirals today.<p/><strong>Replies: @Jatt Aryaa, @Robert Dolan, @Abelard Lindsey</strong></div></span></div> </div></div></li><li  class='comment'  id='comment-4510573'  thread='4507540'  commenter='alfa158' ><div  class='comment-body' ><div  class='comment-heading' ><div  class='comment-author' ><a  class='commenter-link notranslate'  title='See Commenting History - Over 2,400 Comments Since 2015'  href="/comments/all/?commenterfilter=Alfa158" >Alfa158</a><span  class='says' > says:</span></div><div  class='comment-date' ><a  class='comment-link'  href="#comment-4510573" >March 7, 2021 at 4:31 pm GMT</a> &#8226;&nbsp;600 Words</div></div><span  class='comment-replylink' ><a  href="#comment-4509088" ><span  class='notranslate' >@Majority of One</span></a><div  class='comment-sourcetext' ><strong>@YetAnotherAnon</strong><p/>"Infamy" by John Toland explains the Pearl Harbor shtick.  US codebreakers had broken the vaunted Japanese Purple Code several weeks before 12-7-41.  Roosevelt, Admiral King and General Marshall all knew well beforehand the general outline of the Japanese attack strategy.  They resolutely refused to allow General Short and Admiral Kimmel in on the dope.  What was the reason?<br /><br />Led by the likes of Charles Lindbergh Jr., the America First movement was large and influential. As a body the American people did not want to get involved in another war, whether against the Germans in Europe or Asia versus the Japanese.  This state of affairs presented a major stumbling block to the financier Cabal's plans to crush Germany, take Japan down a few notches and make the U$ the new hegemon in world affairs.  That, of course, hinged on continued behind the scenes control over the U$ government by the financial elite's "Federal" Reserve Bank.<br /><br />Presenting a face of running the show, FDR desperately did all he could to aid Britain and eventually Soviet Russia through Lend-Lease and various other stratagems.  The most egregious of those was to use American naval forces to escort convoys of merchant ships bringing war materiel to Britain.  On the Asiatic front, the Grand Strategy involved the U$, Britain and the Dutch government in exile to cut off all oil and iron exports to the Japanese, who were, at that time, deeply involved in their invasion of China.  How the hell you gonna make a major war of aggression in 20th Century terms without oil and steel?  Impossible.<br /><br /> The Asian strategy worked.  The Germans failed to fall for the sucker-bait and strike back as the U$ naval forces depth-charging their U-Boats.  By June of '41 Germany was drawn into a two-front war as they had invaded the Soviet Union.  No way did they want to face America's industrial might and its military besides.  So Roosevelt and Churchill employed the back-door route via the Japanese as those two nations had signed a mutual defense pact.  Deprived of the materials to keep up their war on China, Japan desperately developed their plan of attack on Pearl Harbor.<br /><br /> With high casualties at Pearl Harbor that Sunday morning and with Battleship Row devastated, the American people were easily goaded into war-fever.  Admiral Kimmel and General Short caught it in the shorts.  Scapegoats were needed.  They drew the short straw.  Roosevelt, Churchill and the Rottenfeller and Rottenchild Crime Clans cutting the orders for those two smarmy prostiticians, got their war.  <br /><br /> The truth about Pearl Harbor was all about politics up front and stealthy highest finance calling the shots.<p/><strong>Replies: @Alfa158</strong></div></span><div  class='comment-text' ><p>I would agree with almost all of that, but it is not really established that the US  knew there would be a surprise attack specifically on Pearl Harbor. The Purple Code that was broken was a diplomatic code and contained no details on the movements or plans of military assets. The traffic basically said  that Japan was going to make one last effort to break the blockade and sanctions diplomatically and if that failed it would mean war.<br />
The Japanese fleet had disappeared from view several weeks prior and was  training in the extreme northern islands of Japan. When they sailed for Pearl Harbor they took a route that evaded commercial shipping, observed strict radio silence and kept garbage on board the ships so any patrols would spot it floating in their wake.<br />
The US military and government was aware that something was up, but thought if there was a surprise attack it would be conducted closer to Japan against someplace like the Philippines.<br />
For the purposes of the Crime Clans getting the US into WW2, it really was largely irrelevant how devastating a surprise attack would be or which base was struck, the specific details weren’t that important. They just needed an attack to draw the US in. It was a bonus for them that Germany foolishly honored their mutual defense  treaty with Japan and declared war on the US.<br />
The US Navy sent the carriers and their escorts out to sea on a combination training mission and sweep to see if the Japanese fleet was anywhere in the area, but the Japanese made sure  to approach Pearl Harbor from the least expected direction.<br />
When the code breakers reported that the Japanese embassy had orders to burn their papers they actually tried to send messages to their bases including Pearl Harbor. Because of atmospheric radio conditions, the transmission by radio didn’t work and Washington used the Western Union cable to send coded telegrams that weren’t decoded and delivered to Kimmel until after the attacks.<br />
The US lucked out by having out to sea the ships that it turned out would be most important for fighting WW2 ; the carriers and their escorting cruisers and destroyers.  As shocking as the spectacle of the devastation and loss of life was, all the Japanese accomplished was to blow up the US Navy’s meticulously preserved collection of charming but obsolete WW1 battleships. The oil supplies and repair facilities mostly survived because the Japanese became concerned that the missing carriers might be stalking them and Ozawa called off follow ups attacks. It was like Ford trying to cripple Chevrolet’s ability to sell cars by blowing up the classic Corvette museum in Bowling Green.<br />
The lightening advances of the Japanese during the first six months of the war were not due to the loss of the battleships, but because the Japanese Army Navy and Air Forces  had  superiority in numbers, training, morale,  technology and weapons systems. The US knew it was unprepared and that a war was planned so when the war broke out the design and building of the new ships, aircraft and weapons that would win the war was already underway. That was why the Essex carriers, fast battleships, Avengers, Hellcats, P-38’s, P-47’s, B-24’s and so forth entered service within only a couple of years of Pearl Harbor. </p>

Louis 14’s middle aged sons, young adult grandsons and 2 of Louis 14 great grandsons and some of their wives died. That left Louis 15 , a great grandson as the only surviving male descendant of Louis 14.  <br /><br />At the time, many, including Louis 14 assumed that the Duc d’Orleans, Phillipe, nephew of Louis 14 took advantage of the disease outbreak to poison all the male members of the royal family.  Because if all of Louis 14 direct male descendants  died, the descendants of Louis 14 brother, the first Duc ‘d Orleans would become king. <br /><br />After his parents and toddler brothers died in the alleged measles epidemic, Louis 15’s ladies barricades themselves and little Louis in an apartment with sufficient chickens for eggs and goats for the boy’s milk until things got back to normal. <br /><br />80 years later the then Duc ‘D Orleans, the George Soros of his time attempted to take over during the French Revolution.<br /><br />40 years after that, 1830, the Orleans Ducal family finally succeeded in seizing the throne for a few years.</div></span></div> </div></div></li><li  class='comment'  id='comment-4510663'  thread='4507201'  commenter='wilburn_sprayberry' ><div  class='comment-body' ><div  class='comment-heading' ><div  class='comment-author' ><a  class='commenter-link notranslate'  title='Little Recent Commenting History'  href="/comments/all/?commenterfilter=Wilburn+Sprayberry" >Wilburn Sprayberry</a><span  class='says' > says:</span></div><div  class='comment-date' ><a  class='comment-link'  href="#comment-4510663" >March 7, 2021 at 5:56 pm GMT</a> &#8226;&nbsp;300 Words</div></div><span  class='comment-replylink' ><a  href="#comment-4510567" ><span  class='notranslate' >@Abelard Lindsey</span></a><div  class='comment-sourcetext' ><strong>@Wilburn Sprayberry</strong><p/>Let me ask you this.

Partially the result of Wokeist influence?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Army pays the price<br />
The <b>size of the army will be drastically reduced</b>, with personnel to be cut by 10,000 by 2024 and a further 2,500 by 2030, to a target size of 70,000. Ministers aim to do this by cuts in recruitment rather than making soldiers redundant.</p>
<p>Army chiefs envisage a smaller, better-trained army, with better kit, operating as a high-skill, high-readiness unit similar to the US Marines. But that will <b>involve the loss of legacy capabilities and reduce the war-fighting division from four to two armoured brigades and the shrinking or disbanding of 23 battalion-sized units</b>. Cancelling an upgrade to 600 Warrior troop carriers will save £1.5 billion.</p>
<p>General Sir Mark Carleton-Smith, the chief of the general staff, has twice had to resubmit plans for the redesign because they did not feature enough robots, attack drones and AI. AS-90 155mm self-propelled howitzers and multi-launch rocket systems will be replaced late in the decade with attack drones and precision-guided rockets, while 89 howitzers dating from the 1970s will be withdrawn.</p>
<p>Drones for jets<br />
An order for 90 more F-35 Lightning combat jets is to be cancelled in favour of the Tempest fighter, built in Lancashire, while 24 older Typhoon fighters will be retired early. Whole fleets of aircraft will be taken out of service as drones become ever more common.</p>
<p>The RAF will lose 11 manned spy planes, a 45 per cent cut, with the Sentinel and Islander aircraft not being replaced after their retirement this year. There will also be a gap in coverage from E-3D Sentry airborne early-warning radar planes for two to three years, while replacement Wedgetails will be cut from five to three. Also to be scrapped are 14 C-130J Hercules transport planes used by the SAS.</p>
<p>BAE-146 passenger jets from 32 (Royal) Squadron, used by the Queen, Prince Charles and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, will be replaced by leased aircraft. The transport helicopter fleet will be cut by 45 helicopters or 41%.</p>
<p>Scuttling of the subs<br />
The Royal Navy gets new frigates, supply ships and underwater surveillance vessels. However, in the middle of this decade a third of the frigate fleet and half the nuclear attack submarines will have to be retired on safety grounds before replacements are ready, because of delays.</p>

<p>The government announced late last year that it is increasing the defense budget by £24.1 billion (U.S. $33.6 billion) over the next four years. Most of that is going toward equipment.

<p>In Sweden that number is like 70%, so Swedes hate Chinamen too? Most of them don’t give a rats ass about China and just hear stuff on fake news. When you get bulked up in the gym and sometimes act you’ve got a chip on your shoulder, naturally people are going to wary of you.</p>
<p>In the 80s Sino-Japanese relations were at a high peak because PRC provided Japan Inc with natural resources and cheap labor, and was a market for consumer electronics. </p>
<p>Now they still have some high end industrial technologies, which is why they had the upper hand on Koreans during their trade dispute.

But in emerging tech they are falling behind to BOTH China and US. They have no answer for Huawei OR Tesla. They don’t even have a game plan for 5G and AI. Can you name any Japanese software firms, or how many Made in Japan household products do you own? This is driving their anxiety.</p>

<p>In summer of 1945 their slogan was, „The sooner the Americans come the better, 100 million shattered jewel“  一亿玉碎<br />
I don’t think they rolled over easily. And I don’t think anybody in the 80s would say that they were kneeling to USA</p>
<p>After the war the Americans gave them a good deal, no partition (also upon Chiang’s insistence), protection against Soviets, and a chance to earn. And they took full advantage. So good for them.</p>
<p>But now they at a bad spot, cuz the boss is getting less and less charming all the time, and wants to goad them get hostile with China. At the same time their biggest trade partner, and main/only source of growth, is China. That’s why they signed up for RCEP.<br />

It is more visceral and arise from some deep-seated superiority complex. (And inferiority complex to white people). They look down on the Chinaman and will always do until we show them. ( I guess that’s my inferiority complex speaking). <br /><br />Of course, a total war with Japan which is economically destructive to both our countries only benefits the Americans so I have always advocated peace and Bromance with our neighbours. However, COVID is the 百年未见之大变局 (or accelerates it) and change the geopolitical picture significantly.

I thought I was fit then, but those guys could keep going much longer than I could.

Developmental needs, internal strife plus a bit of hubris is the formula for empire overreach. <p/>Let’s take Australia for example. They realised now that the Chinese have overrun them and trying to decouple. Assuming the spat gets worst and it gets to the point where these Aussies , at America’s bidding and against their best interest, denies China the resources it needs for its growth. It would be very tempting to use China’s  overwhelming military advantage against these Aussies hicks. As you concluded, the Jap didn’t have too much of a choice too in WW2.<p/>I certainly don’t wish that to happen now but assuming America implodes or turn away from world affairs in the next 30 years, I definitely see this as the natural course of things ...20 million lazy hicks sitting on a wealth of resources and a weak military.

I assembled the higher officers and wept tears of anger before them, as Commander-in-Chief ...

Quite embarrassed that I have not heard of him. It is quite shocking that the man who was held responsible for the Nanking Massacre was also a Sinophile and an advocate of pan-Asiaism ( as I am)! How Japan ended up, not pacifying but massacring his brother must be of extreme anguish to him. He even said that it was happy that he was made an example. He probably saw Chiang as a Hanjian\sellout and think that white people have gotten to him. That’s kind of how I see Japanese leadership now! The usual Divide and conquer and playing both sides from the White devil. It is sad that, despite all the good intentions, war and greed have a logic of its own. <p/>I think the fundamental problem was that Japan wanted to be the leader\centre of this pan-Asia Union, which historically and economically, could not have been the case. It makes me think we need a very high level of economic and cultural integration in order for the pan-Asia Union to succeed. Not only economic power but cultural soft power like Manga or South Korean boy band kind of thing. That’s the only way pan Asia-ism can succeed. China is lacking in this area and there really needs to be a cultural revival that would suck Koreans and Japanese into our orbit. <p/>I guess this won’t happen when two Chinaman is using English to communicate..<p/><strong>Replies: @China Japan and Korea Bromance of Three Kingdoms, @GomezAdddams</strong></div></span></div> </div></div></li><li  class='comment'  id='comment-4510942'  thread='4507820'  commenter='fasteddiez' ><div  class='comment-body' ><div  class='comment-heading' ><div  class='comment-author' ><a  class='commenter-link notranslate'  title='Little Recent Commenting History'  href="/comments/all/?commenterfilter=fasteddiez" >fasteddiez</a><span  class='says' > says:</span></div><div  class='comment-date' ><a  class='comment-link'  href="#comment-4510942" >March 7, 2021 at 9:03 pm GMT</a></div></div><span  class='comment-replylink' ><a  href="#comment-4508680" ><span  class='notranslate' >@Arilando</span></a><div  class='comment-sourcetext' ><strong>@Anatoly Karlin</strong><p/>You used the term whitepill, but i can see that it could just be a reference to the first sentence of the paragraph only.<p/><strong>Replies: @fasteddiez</strong></div></span><div  class='comment-text' ><p>One pill makes you larger<br />

Germans were perceived as reliable by both sides and and clearly has the most to gain from Japan and China being frens. But in the end that couldn’t be helped<br /><br />https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trautmann_mediation<br /><br />The original Japanese demand was only *de facto* recognition of Manchukuo. Even the most hawkish KMT brass, Guangxi-clique’s Bai Chongxi remarked „If these are the only conditions, then why do we need to go to war?“<br /><br />Then on Oct 1937, IJA sends a third round of re-enforcement to Shanghai, Heisuke Yanagawa’s 10th Army lands in Hangzhou Bay south of Shanghai unopposed, outflanks the Chinese, who retreats in disarray.  Ignoring orders from Tokyo, the 10th Army then begins a race with Shanghai Expedition Army (SEA) to Nanjing, which in short time build to a Kesselschlacht.<br /><br />The doves mainly, Hayao Tada, cited this precedent and got overruled<br />https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayao_Tada#Second_Sino-Japanese_War<blockquote><br />In order to prevent "unnecessary bitterness of feeling or desire for revenge" and forestall intervention by France or Russia, Bismarck pushed King William I of Prussia to make peace with the Austrians rapidly, rather than continue the war in hopes of further gains<p/>&nbsp;</blockquote>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austro-Prussian_War<br /><br />So now Tokyo ups the ante to *explicit* recognition of Manchukuo and then some. This was of course unacceptable to Chiang. So after Nanjing, IJA scores more victories, Chiang refuses to surrender but did *not* leave the door closed for negotiation.

The junior enlisted ranks were full of resentful, occasionally mutinous, low-IQ types (mostly blacks). Competent NCOs were leaving in droves. The motor pool was a shambles, weapons systems were often inoperable, &amp; readiness reports were lies. Budgets were too low for hard, realistic training (except in a few elite units, like Rangers &amp; perhaps the 82nd Airborne Division).  <br /><br />But we had no illusions. Everyone knew what the main problem was: we had shitty soldiers. We knew that if we survived the first day of the next war, even defeated, if we weren't totally destroyed we would get rid of the scum (by whatever means necessary), &amp; the good NCOs would be allowed to really take charge, impose discipline, &amp; get the job done.  We didn't have any PC regs that would have prevented that. <br /><br />Now, the entire military - except, maybe, a few special operations units - lives 24/7 under illusions: that women in combat units (&amp; others requiring physical strength) are equal to men, that insane ideas like "diversity makes us stronger" are valid principles of war, that white hillbillies &amp; white urban ethnics are more likely to be seditious racist terrorists than what they have always been in all our wars: the backbone of our combat forces.  <br /><br />And I have no confidence that even disastrous defeat would cause our leaders to change the "woke mil" to a military which could fight &amp; win, such is the apparent grip of radical egalitarian ideology upon our generals and admirals today.<p/><strong>Replies: @Jatt Aryaa, @Robert Dolan, @Abelard Lindsey</strong></div></span><div  class='comment-text' ><p>Thanks for your info.</p>
<p>I heard that, in the 70&#8217;s, that there were military bases where officers visited certain areas only with armed MP escorts. I was in HS in 1980 when I heard that you could get any kind of hard drug you wanted in the army. I believe this is about the time that one of the branches (the Army, I think( declared itself &#8220;spent&#8221; and incapable of fighting a war.</p>
<p>Things did seem to turn around quickly with Reagan. I&#8217;m not surprised, I knew lots of people who went into the military upon graduation in &#8217;81 and &#8220;82 partly because of the recession and partly due to patriotism/loyalty to the country. </p>
<p>I think the current stuff started with the Clinton Administration, who decided to use the military for their social engineering BS. Richard Marchinko talked about this in his &#8220;Rogue Warrior&#8221; novels that were written during the 90&#8217;s. </p>

Reagan was a psychological morale booster, not only because of the huge pay raise, but because we sensed he liked the military &amp; would support efforts to reimpose good order &amp; discipline, &amp; give us more money for realistic training. The Democrats back then had become almost wholly identified with hating the military and the kinds of people (especially rural &amp; Southern whites) who still made up the bulk of the combat units. <br /><br />I was out before Clinton, but during his administration I was told by some Ft. Benning drill sergeants that standards were being lowered, including in basic training &amp; AIT (advanced individual training). PC was a term not widely in use yet, but things were going in that direction.<br /><br />Also, the generals never directly challenged the great lie of feminism, that women can be effective combat soldiers if only given the proper training and a fair chance, &amp; that only sexism has prevented gender-balanced armies throughout history. As a result, whenever Democrats like Clinton were in power, feminism advanced in the military. Whenever Republicans were in power, they were too cowardly to forthrightly condemn feminism as a form of insanity (&amp; hatred against normal men), &amp; let stand whatever feminist policies the Democrats had put in place.  <br /><br />So here we are.<p/><strong>Replies: @Znzn</strong></div></span></div> </div></div></li><li  class='comment'  id='comment-4511238'  thread='4507352'  commenter='abelard_lindsey' ><div  class='comment-body' ><div  class='comment-heading' ><div  class='comment-author' ><a  class='commenter-link notranslate'  title='See Commenting History - Over 600 Comments Since 2015'  href="/comments/all/?commenterfilter=Abelard+Lindsey" >Abelard Lindsey</a><span  class='says' > says:</span></div><div  class='comment-date' ><a  class='comment-link'  href="#comment-4511238" >March 8, 2021 at 12:07 am GMT</a> &#8226;&nbsp;100 Words</div></div><span  class='comment-replylink' ><a  href="#comment-4509016" ><span  class='notranslate' >@RoatanBill</span></a><div  class='comment-sourcetext' ><strong>@The Wild Geese Howard</strong><p/>People have been trying to start up rare earth mines for decades but the law makes it impossible at present.<br />https://youtu.be/lxwF93wnRQo<br />https://youtu.be/vZLPqA3eKtY<br />https://youtu.be/yh5rl4127eY<br /><br />The US corporate structure and short term thinking are what's keeping the development of better fabs at a distance.

When you get bulked up in the gym and sometimes act you’ve got a chip on your shoulder, naturally people are going to wary of you.<br /><br />In the 80s Sino-Japanese relations were at a high peak because PRC provided Japan Inc with natural resources and cheap labor, and was a market for consumer electronics. <br /><br />Now they still have some high end industrial technologies, which is why they had the upper hand on Koreans during their trade dispute. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan%E2%80%93South_Korea_trade_dispute). <br />But in emerging tech they are falling behind to BOTH China and US. They have no answer for Huawei OR Tesla. They don’t even have a game plan for 5G and AI. Can you name any Japanese software firms, or how many Made in Japan household products do you own? This is driving their anxiety.<blockquote><br />A case of the inferiority complex, “we are still kneeling to America masters , how dare you stand up to it .”<p/>&nbsp;</blockquote>In summer of 1945 their slogan was, „The sooner the Americans come the better, 100 million shattered jewel“  一亿玉碎 <br />I don’t think they rolled over easily. And I don’t think anybody in the 80s would say that they were kneeling to USA<br /><br />After the war the Americans gave them a good deal, no partition (also upon Chiang’s insistence), protection against Soviets, and a chance to earn. And they took full advantage. So good for them.<br /><br />But now they at a bad spot, cuz the boss is getting less and less charming all the time, and wants to goad them get hostile with China. At the same time their biggest trade partner, and main/only source of growth, is China.

<p>Of course, a total war with Japan which is economically destructive to both our countries only benefits the Americans so I have always advocated peace and Bromance with our neighbours. However, COVID is the 百年未见之大变局 (or accelerates it) and change the geopolitical picture significantly.

Reagan was a psychological morale booster, not only because of the huge pay raise, but because we sensed he liked the military &amp; would support efforts to reimpose good order &amp; discipline, &amp; give us more money for realistic training. The Democrats back then had become almost wholly identified with hating the military and the kinds of people (especially rural &amp; Southern whites) who still made up the bulk of the combat units. </p>
<p>I was out before Clinton, but during his administration I was told by some Ft. Benning drill sergeants that standards were being lowered, including in basic training &amp; AIT (advanced individual training). PC was a term not widely in use yet, but things were going in that direction.</p>
<p>Also, the generals never directly challenged the great lie of feminism, that women can be effective combat soldiers if only given the proper training and a fair chance, &amp; that only sexism has prevented gender-balanced armies throughout history. As a result, whenever Democrats like Clinton were in power, feminism advanced in the military. Whenever Republicans were in power, they were too cowardly to forthrightly condemn feminism as a form of insanity (&amp; hatred against normal men), &amp; let stand whatever feminist policies the Democrats had put in place.  </p>
<p>So here we are. </p>

<p>I think neither the Romans or the Americans ever started with imperial ambitions. Developmental needs, internal strife plus a bit of hubris is the formula for empire overreach. </p>
<p>Let’s take Australia for example. They realised now that the Chinese have overrun them and trying to decouple. Assuming the spat gets worst and it gets to the point where these Aussies , at America’s bidding and against their best interest, denies China the resources it needs for its growth. It would be very tempting to use China’s  overwhelming military advantage against these Aussies hicks. As you concluded, the Jap didn’t have too much of a choice too in WW2.</p>
<p>I certainly don’t wish that to happen now but assuming America implodes or turn away from world affairs in the next 30 years, I definitely see this as the natural course of things &#8230;20 million lazy hicks sitting on a wealth of resources and a weak military. What a waste&#8230;</p>

<p>Thanks for the introduction to Iwane Matsui. Quite embarrassed that I have not heard of him. It is quite shocking that the man who was held responsible for the Nanking Massacre was also a Sinophile and an advocate of pan-Asiaism ( as I am)! How Japan ended up, not pacifying but massacring his brother must be of extreme anguish to him. He even said that it was happy that he was made an example. He probably saw Chiang as a Hanjian\sellout and think that white people have gotten to him. That’s kind of how I see Japanese leadership now! The usual Divide and conquer and playing both sides from the White devil. It is sad that, despite all the good intentions, war and greed have a logic of its own. </p>
<p>I think the fundamental problem was that Japan wanted to be the leader\centre of this pan-Asia Union, which historically and economically, could not have been the case. It makes me think we need a very high level of economic and cultural integration in order for the pan-Asia Union to succeed. Not only economic power but cultural soft power like Manga or South Korean boy band kind of thing. That’s the only way pan Asia-ism can succeed. China is lacking in this area and there really needs to be a cultural revival that would suck Koreans and Japanese into our orbit. </p>

<p>That depends on how far in the past you have in mind.  Peasants up at least to the mid-1970&#8217;s in Latin America were very fit, as defined by having the stamina to work hard 10 hours a day, 6 days a week.   I thought I was fit then, but those guys could keep going much longer than I could.  Mayan peasants could be seen on Guatemalan roads carrying, I mean a single man carrying, a huge thick beam of lumber twenty feet long.  Peak fitness is about stamina, not a sculpted body. </p>

<p>That is a specious assertion. You cannot know whether the US Army&#8217;s strength is diminished without a decisive confrontation with a determined foe.

Because most of the problems were in the domestic troops and the reserves, the front-line troops in West Germany were largely in acceptable shape even in the mid to late 70s, the problem was the lack of reserves. And even before the M-1&#8217;s arrival the M-60 was roughly kept up to date with the T-72 with the M60A3 version, and the M60A3 TTS actually had a more advanced FCS than the M1 or M1A1. Somehow the Reagan administration found it a good idea not the fit the M1 with the 120mm gun until 1986, when the Germans were fitting the 120mm gun into their Leopards from the start in the early 80s. The Apache also was not introduced until 1986, although the AH-1 with TOWs and the German PAH-1 with HOT missiles, and the French Gazelle with HOTSs were a good tank hunters also. The M60A3, or even the M48A5 were actually not that bad for 70s tanks, the Chieftain also turned out to be a pretty good tank once the Stillbrew armour package was installed and the engine problems were fixed in the early 80s. </p>

<p>So now Tokyo ups the ante to <strong>*explicit*</strong> recognition of Manchukuo and then some. This was of course unacceptable to Chiang. So after Nanjing, IJA scores more victories, Chiang refuses to surrender but did <strong>*not*</strong> leave the door closed for negotiation. Japan comes back with even more aggressive demands. Which are then again refused.</p>
<p>This cycle of behavior repeats several times. They have to invade Wuhan in order to justify for the cost of existing conquests. And have to invade Vietnam because Chiang still doesn’t surrender after losing 80% of his GDP. When their biggest materiel supplier, US, cuts them off, they ended up launching Greater East Asia War just so they don’t lose everything. </p>

<p>Amusingly, the list does include Ghost Fleet, a sci-fi book in which China knocks out most of the US hi-tech weapons in a surprise attack and the US, through a series of deus ex machina, weasels its way back to victory with a combination of retrofitting mothballed rust-buckets with 3D printed weapons systems, Anonymous hackers, eccentric Silicon Valley oligarchs, and a color revolution in Moscow&#8230;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have a much more positive take &#8212; <i>Ghost Fleet</i> is an informative policy paper, and an easy read because it&#8217;s a sci-fi thriller.</p>
<p>The authors say the book was born out of their frustration to the indifference shown by the Washington establishment to the cybersecurity threats that they had previously examined in conventional policy papers.  So they re-wrote it as a novel (a novel with copious footnotes).</p>
<p>The first half is a dive into technical weaknesses of U.S. equipment and infrastructure.  Very vulnerable to disruption, but met with &#8220;not my problem&#8221; etc. at low and high levels.  So when the Chinese/Russian hammer falls, the U.S. meets defeat in the Pacific.</p>
<p>The second part of the book is, as you say, about the deus-ex-machina plot twists that allow the U.S. to weasel its way to victory through diversity.  It&#8217;s not just preposterous but absurdist.  It adds nothing of importance to the book&#8217;s message, I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if the publisher insisted on this Happy Ending (allusion intended) to garner positive reviews on amazon.</p>
<p>The solution is to read through to the climax, then use the remaining pages to light your wood stove. </p>

Peasants up at least to the mid-1970's in Latin America were very fit, as defined by having the stamina to work hard 10 hours a day, 6 days a week.   I thought I was fit then, but those guys could keep going much longer than I could.  Mayan peasants could be seen on Guatemalan roads carrying, I mean a single man carrying, a huge thick beam of lumber twenty feet long.

<p>Military defeat is one of the very few things that could decisively discredit the Woke ideology.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t the US lose every war now? Even when it has a clear win, it keeps fighting until it turns into a loss, or at best a pyrrhic victory.</p>
<p>Most of the time for a country to learn from a defeat, it has to be a brutal and costly defeat. And even then, the lesson may or may not sink in. Lessons about ground-level human factors like training, morale, and underlying talent of your men are probably the toughest lessons to sink in; lessons about weapon systems are some of the easiest.</p>
<p>Most of the time that human factors are clearly the culprit, the reason is that you&#8217;re collapsing, and a tiny but highly motivated, high-asabiyyah force is rolling up your theoretically much larger force and causing the men to defect or desert. Chinese dynasties tended to collapse in ways like this, but you also saw this dynamic in events like the Hamas capture of Gaza from Fatah. But in a Great Power war, there&#8217;s too much going on for many lessons to be drawn from differences in human capital, which in that context are probably going to translate to something on the order of 50% more efficiency, not 1000%+ as it might be in something like Hamas vs. Fatah.</p>
<p>So if we suppose that the US lost a major naval war against China, with one or more USN aircraft carriers sunk, I think the Pentagon, in its self-assessment, would say that it didn&#8217;t have the right tools for the job, not that it used its tools poorly. And the politicians would go along with that. &#8220;We need ships and aircraft that directly counter what China is doing! We&#8217;ve been too focused on counter-insurgency for too long!&#8221;</p>
<p>And the fact is that if China successfully took Taiwan, there would be no real need for another Sino-American War. So the US could go on retooling for the next war for a generation, without the war ever coming. I wouldn&#8217;t expect any kind of sincere correction in the face of that. </p>

Quite embarrassed that I have not heard of him. It is quite shocking that the man who was held responsible for the Nanking Massacre was also a Sinophile and an advocate of pan-Asiaism ( as I am)! How Japan ended up, not pacifying but massacring his brother must be of extreme anguish to him. He even said that it was happy that he was made an example. He probably saw Chiang as a Hanjian\sellout and think that white people have gotten to him. That’s kind of how I see Japanese leadership now! The usual Divide and conquer and playing both sides from the White devil. It is sad that, despite all the good intentions, war and greed have a logic of its own. <p/>I think the fundamental problem was that Japan wanted to be the leader\centre of this pan-Asia Union, which historically and economically, could not have been the case. It makes me think we need a very high level of economic and cultural integration in order for the pan-Asia Union to succeed. Not only economic power but cultural soft power like Manga or South Korean boy band kind of thing. That’s the only way pan Asia-ism can succeed. China is lacking in this area and there really needs to be a cultural revival that would suck Koreans and Japanese into our orbit. <p/>I guess this won’t happen when two Chinaman is using English to communicate..<p/><strong>Replies: @China Japan and Korea Bromance of Three Kingdoms, @GomezAdddams</strong></div></span><div  class='comment-text' ><blockquote>

Even the most hawkish KMT brass, Guangxi-clique’s Bai Chongxi remarked „If these are the only conditions, then why do we need to go to war?“<br /><br />Then on Oct 1937, IJA sends a third round of re-enforcement to Shanghai, Heisuke Yanagawa’s 10th Army lands in Hangzhou Bay south of Shanghai unopposed, outflanks the Chinese, who retreats in disarray.  Ignoring orders from Tokyo, the 10th Army then begins a race with Shanghai Expedition Army (SEA) to Nanjing, which in short time build to a Kesselschlacht.<br /><br />The doves mainly, Hayao Tada, cited this precedent and got overruled<br />https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayao_Tada#Second_Sino-Japanese_War<blockquote><br />In order to prevent "unnecessary bitterness of feeling or desire for revenge" and forestall intervention by France or Russia, Bismarck pushed King William I of Prussia to make peace with the Austrians rapidly, rather than continue the war in hopes of further gains<p/>&nbsp;</blockquote>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austro-Prussian_War<br /><br />So now Tokyo ups the ante to *explicit* recognition of Manchukuo and then some.

When their biggest materiel supplier, US, cuts them off, they ended up launching Greater East Asia War just so they don’t lose everything.<p/><strong>Replies: @Mitleser</strong></div></span><div  class='comment-text' ><p>Japan should have accepted the Lytton Report and its recommendations after reining in the IJA on the continent.</p>

Until the fall of Qing, Manchuria was sealed off from Han Chinese migration https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuang_Guandong. The Manchus have not fully assimilated by then, so it was not automatically assumed that Hans have legitimacy of rule there. Entering the power vacuum was a gambit between the Russians and the Japanese Pan-Asianists https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Dragon_Society, which culminated in the Russo-Japanese War.<br /><br />By the time of Mukden Incident, the Soviets already have a puppet state in Outer Mongolia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolian_People%27s_Republic#Consolidation_of_power_(1925%E2%80%9338),<br />So the Japanese thought it was thought it was hypocritical that the West would criticize them for doing the same in Manchuria but not SU for what they are doing in Mongolia. <br /><br />The architect of Mukden Incident was a Pan-Asianist https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji_Ishiwara and adherent to Nichiren Buddhism. Ishiwara contended for Manchukuo to be a multi-ethnic nation and for Japan, Manchukuo and China to be allies against the SU and West. <br /><br />He like other Pan-Asianist would later become disillusioned about the expansion of the war to China Proper, seeing it as a corruption of their ideals.</div></span></div> </div></div></li><li  class='comment'  id='comment-4514342'  thread='4512316'  commenter='128' ><div  class='comment-body' ><div  class='comment-heading' ><div  class='comment-author' ><a  class='commenter-link notranslate'  title='See Commenting History - Over 1,000 Comments Since 2015'  href="/comments/all/?commenterfilter=128" >128</a><span  class='says' > says:</span></div><div  class='comment-date' ><a  class='comment-link'  href="#comment-4514342" >March 9, 2021 at 2:20 pm GMT</a></div></div><span  class='comment-replylink' ><a  href="#comment-4514019" ><span  class='notranslate' >@reiner Tor</span></a><div  class='comment-sourcetext' ><strong>@128</strong><p/>COIN is largely irrelevant and might even be bad for actual warfighting abilities against great power adversaries.

UK military wants more women to join, but has only limited success at attracting them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At 1 October 2020 there were 16,110 women in the UK Regular Forces and accounted for 11% of the total trained and untrained strength.</p>
<p>The proportion of women in the UK Regular Forces has increased over the past few years. <b>At 1 April 1990 women accounted for around 6% of the total UK Regular Forces; by 1 April 2000 this proportion was around 8%</b>. Since 2000 the share of women in the Regular Forces has increased almost every year.</p>
<p><b>The 2015 SDSR stated that by 2020 at least 15% of the intake to the UK Regular Forces should be female. In the 12 months to 30 September 2020, 11.2% of the total intake was female.</b></p>
<p>On 8 July 2016 David Cameron (the then Prime Minister) announced that women would be allowed to serve in close combat roles by 2018. This was achieved on the 25 October 2018 when Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson announced that all roles in the military are open to women.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Filling the non-white quota is much easier, though there is the problem that the large majority of them serve in the British Army, the worst part of the British military.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>As at 1 October 2020 around 9.1% of personnel (13,200) identified as belonging to a non-white ethnic group. The Army had the highest proportion (13.4%), followed by the Royal Navy/Marines (4.8%) and RAF (3%).</b> As with women, the total proportion of non-white ethnic groups personnel across the UK Regular Forces has increased over recent years: <b>on 1 April 2000 around 1% of personnel identified as belonging to a non-white ethnic group.</b></p>
<p>The 2015 SDSR stated that by 2020 at least 10% of the intake to the UK Regular Forces should be personnel belonging to a non-white ethnic group. In the 12 months to 30 September 2020, 13% of total intake were personnel from a non-white ethnic group.</p>

<p>Concept of 4 Industrial Revolutions, 1st steam 2nd electric 3rd digital<br />
    &#8211; Anglos came up with all three. Japan/Germany joined in 2nd and 3rd<br />
    &#8211; China’s rise is successful industrialization. Counterexamples are India and LatAm<br />
    &#8211; Third world should not prioritize democracy over industrialization, without it you are as good as a colony<br />
    &#8211; 4th revolution in short is 5G+AI. At this point <b>leadership is China’s to lose</b>. There’s nothing magic about it except aping Kaiserreich plus being bigger. 1) „tech transfer“ from England 2) invest in r&amp;d 3) not have overextended colonies<br />
        &#8211; Also in these techs China/SK/US &gt;&gt; Japan/EU</p>
<p>The future is Eurasian Heartland Market connected by OBOR.<br />
    &#8211; In long term establishing standards pays off enormously. We are communicating in English. AU/NZ don’t make anything but can stay rich from being white and having Anglo institutions. Anglo univs still ranked higher vs. continental Europe. This is the other point of OBOR<br />
    &#8211; A <b>strong Franco-German relation and EU</b> helps the goal of multi-polarity and is very desirable for China. </p>
<p>US/Anglosphere will feel marginalized by Eurasian dominance and potentially lob more bombs in ME, but<br />
    &#8211; China will not challenge US in many high margin industries, i.e. finance, hence the pull back on Ant. Also civilian aerospace<br />
    &#8211; PRC is in any case seeking a Multi-polar balance of power, e.g. China-EU-US in econ, China-US-Russia in defense<br />

It was like watching a grandmaster toying an amateur in chess.   China made all the right moves while America made the stupidest mistakes, overplay their cards and got themselves in a position which they can’t extricate.

So it doesn’t know how it feels like when the enemy has the same resources as it does. I think it’s something they cannot even imagine. </p>

Where do you think all the stimulus money come from? I think 20% of it went to help people pay off debt. You need to read Ray Dalio. <br /> <br />Human civilisation was doomed once we started letting women go to university and letting them gain financial independence.  These 2 factors delay childbearing and dramatically reduce a women’s fertility. It is also dysgenic because their eggs accumulate more mutations as they get older. Contraception don’t help of course. Asian women have never ever gained financial independence in 5000 years of history and this is the most disastrous thing ever since they became really picky. This is especially bad for the ugly girls with high educational attainment. Korea and Taiwan Fertility is close to one now and it will never recover. <p/>There is a reason why every societies and religion have oppressed women from the earliest of times. It is not because it is misogyny but that societies just fall apart in a few generations. Wasn’t that what happened to Rome when most of the upper class became impotent from lead?  White people really fuck it up for humankind by liberating women.<p/><strong>Replies: @Steven80</strong></div></span></div> </div></div></li><li  class='comment'  id='comment-4515929'  thread='4507540'  commenter='rattus_norwegius' ><div  class='comment-body' ><div  class='comment-heading' ><div  class='comment-author' ><a  class='commenter-link notranslate'  title='See Commenting History - Over 200 Comments Since 2015'  href="/comments/all/?commenterfilter=Rattus+Norwegius" >Rattus Norwegius</a><span  class='says' > says:</span></div><div  class='comment-date' ><a  class='comment-link'  href="#comment-4515929" >March 10, 2021 at 10:22 am GMT</a> &#8226;&nbsp;100 Words</div></div><span  class='comment-replylink' ><a  href="#comment-4515524" ><span  class='notranslate' >@Chinaman</span></a><div  class='comment-sourcetext' ><strong>@China Japan and Korea Bromance of Three Kingdoms</strong><p/>Thank you.

An example- the German lands after the 30-year war lost half the people; The Balkans lost most of their population after the fall of Rome (kiled by invaders).I'm pretty sure it was the same in China in the long run. <br /><br />The problem now for birth rates is absolutely obvious to me and is solvable:<br /><br />1) Homes are expensive for young people so many of them have no family &amp; kids - because of money printing that inflates prices<br />2)Wages are low because money printing is hidden tax destroying wealth of workers everywhere, and women are forced to work because families need money. Now in most countries two parents have to work because governments collect 1/3  to 1/2 of income.<br /><br />There are cultural factors as well, but if a man has enough money to sustain a family, most women will choose to stay home and do some hobby-like work and take care of children instead of staying in the office. This is supported by many studies showing rich men have more kids.<br /><br />So the problem with fertility is mostly related to use  of sound money and stopping governments from printing. It is not easy, but is solvable - by crisis, bank collapse &amp; spread of fintech apps etc. The sooner the financial purge - the better for the whites. Sadly banks are owned by people who don't want that to happen and governments depend on them, so this is one very hard project.<p/><strong>Replies: @Chinaman</strong></div></span><div  class='comment-text' ><blockquote>

<p>It is the other way round&#8230;money printing inflates away the debt. Where do you think all the stimulus money come from? I think 20% of it went to help people pay off debt. You need to read Ray Dalio. </p>
<p>Human civilisation was doomed once we started letting women go to university and letting them gain financial independence.  These 2 factors delay childbearing and dramatically reduce a women’s fertility. It is also dysgenic because their eggs accumulate more mutations as they get older. Contraception don’t help of course. Asian women have never ever gained financial independence in 5000 years of history and this is the most disastrous thing ever since they became really picky. This is especially bad for the ugly girls with high educational attainment. Korea and Taiwan Fertility is close to one now and it will never recover. </p>
<p>There is a reason why every societies and religion have oppressed women from the earliest of times. It is not because it is misogyny but that societies just fall apart in a few generations. Wasn’t that what happened to Rome when most of the upper class became impotent from lead?  White people really fuck it up for humankind by liberating women. </p>

Productive people are those who manage to save and they get punished by this inflation. <br /><br />If you don't inflate currency, productive people manage to save and invest usually in something productive - this is the core of economic growth. If you do the opposite, you encourage non-productive people, and it always ends in disaster. This is like giving money to gamblers or addicts. Here's an oversimlistic example of what hapened with the Roman empire with their own currency debasement experiemnt:<br />https://www.visualcapitalist.com/currency-and-the-collapse-of-the-roman-empire/<br /><br />Read Mises (or Carl Menger, Hayek, Fon Bawerk) for serious economics if you are interested - Ray Dalio is not the best example for good economist and he is better known for good PR than mathematics. He is not stupid, but he made his money with political deals, not with technical skills.<br /><br />For the women - I totally agree it was a mistake. I don't know how this can be solved - perhaps a mix of media propaganda and financial aid only for women with 2+ children? The USA tried this in a stupid way and now all the blacks there are making babies and living on social security, deepening the state problems. Singapore did somehow better - they gave money to women that had kids and were students, but it didn't really boost fertility among the smartest. And yes, mutations are very bad - Decode's study results about this have been proven many times now.<br /><br />Brown preachers in the middle east and africa know that and this is why islam is so popular there - piests tell young men they will be masters of their wives if they don't embrace the "western values". By the way, the idea of women equality is from 10-th century Bagdad. Of course, all those progressives were swiftly killed when the Mongols came and no one was able to defend the country. https://www.academia.edu/8413567/THE_FATE_OF_EMPIRES_and_SEARCH_FOR_SURVIVAL .<p/><strong>Replies: @Chinaman, @Smith</strong></div></span></div> </div></div></li><li  class='comment'  id='comment-4517005'  thread='4512316'  commenter='vishnugupta' ><div  class='comment-body' ><div  class='comment-heading' ><div  class='comment-author' ><a  class='commenter-link notranslate'  title='See Commenting History - Over 300 Comments Since 2015'  href="/comments/all/?commenterfilter=Vishnugupta" >Vishnugupta</a><span  class='says' > says:</span></div><div  class='comment-date' ><a  class='comment-link'  href="#comment-4517005" >March 10, 2021 at 8:38 pm GMT</a> &#8226;&nbsp;100 Words</div></div><span  class='comment-replylink' ><a  href="#comment-4515055" ><span  class='notranslate' >@Abelard Lindsey</span></a><div  class='comment-sourcetext' ><strong>@Znzn</strong><p/>All is true. I think the last time the PLA had any real combat, prior to this current thing with India, was the border war with Vietnam in 1979. They did not do well, loosing 50,000 troops in a 6 week period. If you were a raw 18 yo conscript in 1979, you would be going on 60 today. Before that was a border war with India in 1962 which was mostly a pushover. Before that was Korea in 1951. <br /><br />In short, there is no institutional memory of combat in the PLA today.<p/><strong>Replies: @Vishnugupta</strong></div></span><div  class='comment-text' ><p>The same can be said about the USN which hasn&#8217;t fought a proper naval war since WW2.</p>
<p>USAF has bet the farm on stealth which would be of little use against advanced electro optical sensors and possibly new generation of radars as well.</p>
<p>The institutional memory it has is shooting fish in a barrel type mostly BVR engagements against middle eastern and Serbian pilots flying poorly maintained downgraded versions of Russian planes.</p>
<p>Coming to the US Army the last time it fought a high IQ country was Vietnam..I think we all know how that turned out..</p>

Until the fall of Qing, Manchuria was sealed off from Han Chinese migration <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuang_Guandong" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuang_Guandong</a>. The Manchus have not fully assimilated by then, so it was not automatically assumed that Hans have legitimacy of rule there. Entering the power vacuum was a gambit between the Russians and the Japanese Pan-Asianists <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Dragon_Society" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Dragon_Society</a>, which culminated in the Russo-Japanese War.</p>
<p>By the time of Mukden Incident, the Soviets already have a puppet state in Outer Mongolia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolian_People%27s_Republic#Consolidation_of_power_(1925%E2%80%9338)" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolian_People%27s_Republic#Consolidation_of_power_(1925%E2%80%9338)</a>,<br />
So the Japanese thought it was thought it was hypocritical that the West would criticize them for doing the same in Manchuria but not SU for what they are doing in Mongolia. </p>
<p>The architect of Mukden Incident was a Pan-Asianist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji_Ishiwara" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji_Ishiwara</a> and adherent to Nichiren Buddhism. Ishiwara contended for Manchukuo to be a multi-ethnic nation and for Japan, Manchukuo and China to be allies against the SU and West. </p>
<p>He like other Pan-Asianist would later become disillusioned about the expansion of the war to China Proper, seeing it as a corruption of their ideals. </p>

Carriers are done. Any built after the nimitz class are a total waste, meaning the Ford class, along with the F35. Plus, as Anatoly said, we don't posses the MANpower to man carriers and squadrons. In 76, between hangar deck and the roof, Nimitz routinely sailed with 8 squadrons 100 aircraft, big planes, F14s and A6 Intruders. My first cruise we also carried 3 or 4 Vigilante recon planes. And 6000 total crew. The planes were big bastards. Because we can't MAN them anymore they only carry 65 or 70. With worse range and fewer refuelling assets than in the 70s through 80s, NAVAIR is vastly outgunned with current-state F18s at sea. Throw in China/Russia/Iran defensive missiles and you can see why carriers are toast. But Anatoly is most correct about MANpower. When you add in the hideous personnel issues, homos and the Alphabet Soup of Sexual Depravity and single black  mothers and the rest contrasted with the deliberate <br /> disappearing of White brains and talent, this alone will destroy carrier ops. MANpower. Don't leave home without it.<p/><strong>Replies: @Andy Horton</strong></div></span><div  class='comment-text' ><p>He was saying Taiwan itself is an aircraft carrier. Be smarter. </p>

<p>On reflection, I think we might be misunderstanding the situation. Billionaires continue becoming wealthier regardless if the US is winning or loosing a war. In fact, they might prefer a loosing war because then money is thrown around without much oversight.</p>
<p>Many of the German industrialists, who were wealthy in 1900, were still wealthy in 1960, after loosing 2 world wars. Since there were close ties between the US and German industrialists, likely the military-industrial complex in the US has been learning from those Germans, who kept their wealth, while disastrously loosing those wars.</p>
<p>In addition, what does a billionaire globalist care as to which nation state is winning or loosing a war? They will be gaining wealth thru supplying both sides of every war. As long as there are wars, somewhere on the planet, there will be profiteering opportunities for increasing their wealth. The whole imperialism angle is largely a good excuse to start more wars.</p>
<p>Below I describe the impact of the woke/cancel culture on all of this, and then describe what can be done about it. As I kept reflecting, this essay kept growing to about 1900 words.<br />
 <div  class='hide-more' ><span  class='more-toggle'  title='Toggle Complete Text' >[MORE]</span><div  class='more' ><br />
&#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211;<br />
While the billionaires mostly don&#8217;t care who wins wars, likely care a lot about anything that would weaken the woke/cancel culture. Making an exception, saying the woke culture is really important, &#8220;but don&#8217;t do it in the military&#8221;, would significantly weaken that culture.</p>
<p>The woke/cancel culture is the functional equivalent of death squads and summary executions, but without any blowback. The woke/cancel culture makes it easy to create a fake case of political incorrectness, publicize it, and then turn loose the woke piranhas to destroy the power and influence of that person. The billionaires aren&#8217;t likely to risk the usefulness of a tool that is so effective in eliminating leaders of opposition against them.</p>
<p>In short, the billionaires don&#8217;t loose any wealth because the US military is weakened, and they gain more power by promoting the woke/cancel culture, which they steer thru their propaganda.</p>
<p>&#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211;<br />
An exception, to billionaire globalists not caring about the outcome of wars, is their desire to cancel and destroy whole countries who refuse to cooperate with globalism. However their track record in accomplishing this is pretty poor. Yes, the globalists have attacked and weakened many countries who resist them, but there is a very short list of countries they completely destroyed.</p>
<p>This reinforces my belief, that using the military-industrial complex as a cash cow, to milk decade in and decade out, is more important to billionaires than the actual competency and effectiveness of the US military.</p>
<p>Besides that, why would the globalists want to completely win most of the wars against countries opposing globalism? Most people have short memories, and dangling the forever wars (which greatly increase the wealth of globalists and decrease the power of the anti-globalists) in front of people, who are dragging their feet on globalism, is useful in coercing cooperation from the foot draggers.</p>
<p>In short, a weakened US military is highly effective as a cash cow, and is highly effective in coercing most of the global south to cooperate with globalism.</p>
<p>Further weakening the US military isn&#8217;t likely to significantly undermine those roles. On the other hand, currently the US military is a hotbed of opposition to most of the agendas in the great reset. At least once a year, somewhere in the world, a country&#8217;s military is instrumental in resolving an internal political crisis.</p>
<p>So replacing the traditional culture people in the US military (who greatly resist the great reset), and replacing them with woke zombies, who never question the propaganda, is likely high on the list of globalist priorities.</p>
<p>All in all, the woke/cancel culture is manna from heaven for the billionaire globalists.</p>
<p>&#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211;<br />
The servants of the billionaire globalists are extremely effective in psyops. In hindsight, I can now see roots of the woke culture developing in the 1960&#8217;s, so I have doubts that it is manna from heaven, and suspect the woke culture resulted from a very long-term psyop, in combination with a majority of people defaulting on their responsibility to do cultural stewardship.</p>
<p>Part of that psyop was propaganda promoting the idea that supporting divide-and-conquer wedges is cultural stewardship, not cultural suicide.</p>
<p>The billionaire globalists successfully convinced the majority of liberals and progressives in the value of &#8220;humanitarian&#8221; bombing of civilians.</p>
<p>If they can do that, then they can also succeed with promoting &#8220;peacekeeping thru violence&#8221;, and demonizing those who resist &#8220;peace&#8221;.</p>
<p>Look at antifa celebrating the death of Trump supporters. Compare that to anti-war protesters in the 1960&#8217;s handing out flowers to the national guard. The conversion of that peaceful anti-war culture into the violent antifa culture would make a very useful case study in how the globalists control society in the US.</p>
<p>40 years ago the USMC was promoting the slogan &#8220;lean, mean, green, killing machine&#8221;. While that was useful in honing the edge of a valuable tool for repressing anti-globalist countries, the people attracted to volunteering to do that were solidly in the traditionalist, conservative, &#8220;mom and apple pie culture&#8221;, which is headed in the opposite direction from the great reset. Probably the globalists have been having nightmares about that killing machine turning on them.</p>
<p>So it seems likely the billionaire globalists will succeed in replacing the traditional culture in the US military with a woke culture. Easy-peasy if you are a psyop expert, and don&#8217;t care about the effectiveness of the US military.</p>
<p>&#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211;<br />
Perhaps the most useful aspect of the woke/cancel culture, for the billionaires, is its use in crushing the general social capital of US society.</p>
<p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_capital" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_capital</a><br />
&#8220;It involves the effective functioning of social groups through interpersonal relationships, a shared sense of identity, a shared understanding, shared norms, shared values, trust, cooperation, and reciprocity.&#8221;</p>
<p>The billionaires are tyrants, and don&#8217;t want any of that unity stuff or ability to independently organize community groups &#8211; they just want people to shut up and do what they are told.<br />
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrant" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrant</a></p>
<p>The bulk of the skills, which make up the social capital in the US, is with the euroamerican ethnic group. Its very traditional for tyrants, who recently gained power, to kill all officers, teachers, and priests &#8211; the educated and trained people who would be capable of organizing effective opposition to the tyrant.</p>
<p>Once again, the billionaire tyrants can&#8217;t afford the blowback from physically killing the large numbers of people who oppose them. So they are demonizing the euroamericans (anybody with white skin, regardless of their ethnicity), which often destroys their social standing and income. This is better than killing them because now there are many victims floundering around, and draining resources from their social networks. Depressed people, with crushed self-confidence, who are living in poverty, aren&#8217;t much of a threat to the billionaire tyrants.</p>
<p>The billionaire tyrants are replacing the euroamerican people in the US with AI and foreign workers that they import, who aren&#8217;t in any position to object to anything. The billionaires don&#8217;t need the euroamericans in the US, and really want to avoid effective opposition to their tyranny. So the simple solution is to destroy the effectiveness of the euroamericans in the US, and particularly target those who become public figures, and then object to the woke culture.</p>
<p>Keep in mind the two most important goals of the propaganda from the billionaires is to get people to shoot themselves in the foot, and then limp around fighting the self-defeating battles triggered by divide-and-conquer wedges.</p>
<p>&#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211;<br />
We need to focus on 3 parallel efforts. The first is countering the propaganda from the billionaires. The second is organizing and mobilizing opposition to the billionaires.</p>
<p>The third is focusing on cultural stewardship to rebuild the strength of the society in the US. I don&#8217;t mean focusing on divide-and-conquer wedges like sexuality or abortion.</p>
<p>I mean encouraging opposition to hypocrisy, disrespect, narrowed perspectives, and self-serving agendas. The flip side of that is encouraging people to walk their talk, being respectful to all people, looking broad and deep for the best perspective, looking for the effects of actions, carefully balancing the needs of individuals and the community, and building cooperation in serving the community.</p>
<p>There are many examples of people who have been working to do this, who are building bridges, and are healing the damage caused by divide-and-conquer wedges. They do this by finding common ground and then using that common ground as a foundation for encouraging cooperation and greater understanding between different groups of people..</p>
<p>Part of finding the best perspective is thinking about the info you find, and comparing and contrasting that info to find the most useful perspective. Assessing the effects of actions also takes thinking. Balancing the needs of individuals and the community takes more thinking. All of this thinking will undermine the woke culture because doing all that thinking derails the knee-jerk acceptance of propaganda.</p>
<p>&#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211;<br />
This battle for the soul of humanity is going to be won thru teaching people better ways to live their lives, not violence. And it must be done thru a distributed network of people, like with the yellow vests in France, without any centralized control point that the billionaire globalists can co-opt or destroy.</p>
<p>We need time to educate those who have been suckered by the propaganda. We need some freedom of movement and communication, and some civil rights to accomplish this.</p>
<p>Violence will be used as justification to take away our remaining rights, which will make it extremely difficult and risky to work on educating those who have been suckered by the propaganda.</p>
<p>Very few people will ever read an essay like I wrote here, or study up on countering government propaganda.</p>
<p>On the other hand, likely many people would be interested in attending classes on &#8220;decision making for hard times&#8221;, &#8220;protecting your family from propaganda&#8221;, and &#8220;escaping debt slavery&#8221;. All of these classes would be great opportunities for doing the cultural stewardship I describe above.</p>
<p>&#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211;<br />
For hundreds of years many people worked to better the lives of the working class thru teaching them to read and write. Now the working class needs to be taught how to think well, and how to avoid being suckered into supporting the status quo that makes their lives miserable.</p>
<p>An early divide-and-conquer wedge was the lie that the professional-worker social-class isn&#8217;t a subset of the working class. If your income stops, when you stop showing up at work, then you are part of the working class, regardless if you are hourly or on salary. If your income is from interest, dividends, and capital gains, then you aren&#8217;t part of the working class &#8211; are part of the privileged class that runs most western governments, and especially the US.</p>
<p>I had a year of economics from a professor who could make economics humorous and interesting. If he could do that, then others can make it interesting to learn how to better your life thru better thinking.</p>
<p>The sharp, caustic humor of John Belushi and Eddie Murphy come to mind because the humor of both is very pointed, down to earth, and has a lot of compassion for the lives of ordinary people.</p>
<p>Humor like this could go a long ways to making it fun and useful to attend classes on improving your life thru improving your thinking skills.. </p>

Where do you think all the stimulus money come from? I think 20% of it went to help people pay off debt. You need to read Ray Dalio. <br /> <br />Human civilisation was doomed once we started letting women go to university and letting them gain financial independence.  These 2 factors delay childbearing and dramatically reduce a women’s fertility. It is also dysgenic because their eggs accumulate more mutations as they get older. Contraception don’t help of course. Asian women have never ever gained financial independence in 5000 years of history and this is the most disastrous thing ever since they became really picky. This is especially bad for the ugly girls with high educational attainment.

I assembled the higher officers and wept tears of anger before them, as Commander-in-Chief ... I told them that after all our efforts to enhance the Imperial prestige, everything had been lost in one moment through the brutalities of the soldiers. And can you imagine it, even after that, these officers laughed at me ...

Quite embarrassed that I have not heard of him. It is quite shocking that the man who was held responsible for the Nanking Massacre was also a Sinophile and an advocate of pan-Asiaism ( as I am)! How Japan ended up, not pacifying but massacring his brother must be of extreme anguish to him. He even said that it was happy that he was made an example. He probably saw Chiang as a Hanjian\sellout and think that white people have gotten to him. That’s kind of how I see Japanese leadership now! The usual Divide and conquer and playing both sides from the White devil. It is sad that, despite all the good intentions, war and greed have a logic of its own. <p/>I think the fundamental problem was that Japan wanted to be the leader\centre of this pan-Asia Union, which historically and economically, could not have been the case. It makes me think we need a very high level of economic and cultural integration in order for the pan-Asia Union to succeed. Not only economic power but cultural soft power like Manga or South Korean boy band kind of thing. That’s the only way pan Asia-ism can succeed. China is lacking in this area and there really needs to be a cultural revival that would suck Koreans and Japanese into our orbit. <p/>I guess this won’t happen when two Chinaman is using English to communicate..<p/><strong>Replies: @China Japan and Korea Bromance of Three Kingdoms, @GomezAdddams</strong></div></span><div  class='comment-text' ><p>Wikipedia is suspect at best &#8211;anyone can pen anything.

<p><strong></strong><strong></strong>Biomeme SARS-CoV-2 Tests detect the RNA of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), also known as "2019-nCoV" or "Wuhan coronavirus."&#160; Two RNA targets for the novel coronavirus are multiplexed together with Biomeme's process control assay for RNA extraction and RT-PCR (MS2). Assay targets include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>SARS-CoV-2</p>-Orf1ab gene</li>
<li>
<p>SARS-CoV-2</p>-S gene</li>
<li>RNA&#160;Process Control (RNA extraction and RT-PCR control utilizing MS2 bacteriophage)</li>
</ul>
<p>Our tests come in 3 different form factors for you to choose from:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Go-Strips </strong>(96 rxns per order): Each order consists of a single pouch containing a pre-cut and pre-aliquoted tray of (32) 3-well Go-Strips with void filling caps. Each well contains a 20&#160;<p>&#181;L lyophilized triplex reaction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Go-Plates </strong>(96 rxns per order): Each order consists of a single pouch containing a 96-well Go-Plate. Each well contains a 20&#160;<p>&#181;L lyophilized triplex reaction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Bulk Vials </strong>(~65 rxns per order): Each orders consists a single bulk vial, 675&#160;&#181;L of DNase/RNase free molecular grade water, and a 1 mL transfer pipette.</li>
</ul>
<p>All form factors include Biomeme&#8217;s&#160;lyophilized RNA Extraction and RT-PCR Process Control (&#8220;RPC&#8221; - MS2 bacteriophage).</p>

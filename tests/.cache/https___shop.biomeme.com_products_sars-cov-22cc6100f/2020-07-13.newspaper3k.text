Biomeme SARS-CoV-2 Tests detect the RNA of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), also known as "2019-nCoV" or "Wuhan coronavirus." Two RNA targets for the novel coronavirus are multiplexed together with Biomeme's process control assay for RNA extraction and RT-PCR (MS2). Assay targets include:

SARS-CoV-2 -Orf1ab gene

-Orf1ab gene SARS-CoV-2 -S gene

-S gene RNA Process Control (RNA extraction and RT-PCR control utilizing MS2 bacteriophage)

Our tests come in 3 different form factors for you to choose from:

Go-Strips (96 rxns per order): Each order consists of a single pouch containing a pre-cut and pre-aliquoted tray of (32) 3-well Go-Strips with void filling caps. Each well contains a 20 µL lyophilized triplex reaction.

(96 rxns per order): Each order consists of a single pouch containing a pre-cut and pre-aliquoted tray of (32) 3-well Go-Strips with void filling caps. Each well contains a 20 Go-Plates (96 rxns per order): Each order consists of a single pouch containing a 96-well Go-Plate. Each well contains a 20 µL lyophilized triplex reaction.

(96 rxns per order): Each order consists of a single pouch containing a 96-well Go-Plate. Each well contains a 20 Bulk Vials (~65 rxns per order): Each orders consists a single bulk vial, 675 µL of DNase/RNase free molecular grade water, and a 1 mL transfer pipette.

All form factors include Biomeme’s lyophilized RNA Extraction and RT-PCR Process Control (“RPC” - MS2 bacteriophage).

If you're looking for more of a turnkey solution, check out our SARS-CoV-2 Starter Kits which include everything you would need to collect and prepare your sample through interpreting results.

If you're looking to combine both sample extraction and testing, check out our SARS-CoV-2 Test Kits.

Note: The Biomeme SARS-CoV-2 test has been validated but FDA’s independent review of this validation is pending.

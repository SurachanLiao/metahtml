Of course, when you hear the word &#8216;Natanz&#8217;, most people think only of the Iranian nuclear enrichment controversy. But Natanz is also my most favourite small town in Iran, with some very special historic monuments. Please don&#8217;t miss seeing: the shrine; the monstrous plane trees; the Ilkanid mosque; the caravanserai; and the royal hawk pavilion.</p><p>First though, maybe you want a few words about the nuclear facilities in Natanz. These are the primary site for Iran&#8217;s gas centrifuge program. There are two primary facilities:&#160;the Pilot Fuel Enrichment Plant (PFEP) and the Fuel Enrichment Plant (FEP).</p><p>The <a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/images/Iran/irandeal.pdf">Comprehensive Nuclear Agreement</a>&#160;was signed by the P5+1 and Iranian negotiators on 2 April 2015. Under this, then for the next ten years the facility in Natanz will be the only place in Iran where uranium enrichment will take place. There will only be 5,060 of the less advanced, IR-1 first generation centrifuges. Iran&#8217;s more advanced centrifuge models (IR-2, IR-4, IR-5, IR-6, and IR-8) will be placed under IAEA care for the duration of the agreement.</p><p>The agreement provides for &#8220;continuous monitoring&#8221; of the Natanz as well as Fordow facilities. Inspectors supposedly will have unfettered access to these facilities whenever necessary.</p><p>Much has been said about the <a href="http://www.iranintelligence.com/nukefacilities" target="_blank">Iranian nuclear programme</a>, but I&#160;think that the video here is pretty well balanced (unlike much Western media coverage!). It certainly presents&#160;the historical perspective better than most reports. It has some really interesting points &#8211; including details of the pre-Revolutionary nuclear agreements. I didn&#8217;t previously know that Iran currently owns 10% of FRENCH. I was&#160;surprised to see Tony Benn in the video. He&#8217;s here in his guise as Energy Minister at the time of the last Shah. But he also underlines Iran&#8217;s absolute right to a civil nuclear programme, as part of the discussion of how the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty has been applied to Iran.</p><p>The Natanz facility is specifically mentioned in the video &#8211; and shown at 35.40 as clearly visible from the road. This contradicts the reports of its absolute secrecy.</p><p>While there is some discussion of the need for a balanced and long-term energy policy in Iran then, sadly, there&#8217;s no mention anywhere of the potential of cheap solar power in Iran. Solar would be even easier in sunny Iran than elsewhere in the world!</p><p>&lt;iframe width=&#8221;560&#8243; height=&#8221;315&#8243; src=&#8221;https://www.youtube.com/embed/uCvygCYVUFo&#8221; frameborder=&#8221;0&#8243; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</p><p>But please remember that Natanz is not only about nuclear facilities!</p><p>Click to read more about: the shrine; the monstrous plane trees; the Ilkanid mosque; the caravanserai; and the royal hawk pavilion.</p></article>

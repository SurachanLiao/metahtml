<div><p><b>MEMORANDUM FOR: </b>The Attorney General<br><b>FROM:</b> Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity (VIPs)<br><b>SUBJECT:</b> Mueller&#8217;s Forensics-Free Findings (Part 2)<br> REFERENCE: Our March 13, 2019 Memo to you: <a href="https://consortiumnews.com/2019/03/13/vips-muellers-forensics-free-findings/">&#8220;Mueller&#8217;s Forensics-Free Findings&#8221; (Part 1)</a></p>
<p>Dear Attorney General Barr:</p>
<p>Former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein&#8217;s June 4 testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee brings to mind our Memorandum to you of March 13, 2019 &#8211; nine days before Special Counsel Robert Mueller gave you his &#8220;Report on the Investigation Into Russian Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election&#8221;.</p>
<p>At the time of our Memo, it was already clear that Mueller&#8217;s findings would be fatally incomplete. We were virtually certain that Mueller&#8217;s report would lack the forensic findings that we VIPS had arrived at through the kind of rigorous investigation that the FBI avoided doing. So we gave our Memo to you with the title: &#8220;Mueller&#8217;s Forensics-Free Findings&#8221;.</p>
<p>Sans forensics, Mueller&#8217;s report fell far short of Rosenstein&#8217;s earlier commitment &#8220;to ensure a full and thorough investigation&#8221;. It was also clear to us that relying for forensics on CrowdStrike, a private cyber-security firm of checkered reputation, picked and paid for by the Democratic National Committee, would signal a conflict of interest on this controversial issue. Now we know a lot more as a result of testimony released last month (but widely ignored in Establishment media).</p>

A group of rioters, one of them holding a US flag, had strewn bricks dug up from pavements, using them as missiles against the police, while attempting to block the traffic light junction with garbage bins, etc. When police charged, a lone policeman chases after one of them who appeared to be directing the blockade. The chase crossed the road, and the video starts.</p> <p>That rioter is in red shirt. But when the police caught up with him, they both fell. Policeman is surrounded by other rioters and a bunch of Press photographers, most of who — and this is standard riot SOP — are themselves rioters disguised in the yellow Press vest. (Press passes can be obtained at HK$20 each from the US NED-funded Hong Kong Journalists Association, HKAJ, no accreditation nor vetting necessary. The HKAJ along with two political parties were organizers of the riots since last June, 2019. The vests are optional with separate payment.)</p> <p>The man to watch out for is on the left hand side of the screen, appearing with others from behind the pedestrian steel railing. He is in dark grey shirt, wearing a cap and repeatedly stabs the policeman on the shoulders as the latter got up, still hanging on to the suspect. (This is dedication to work.) Red shirt manages to free himself and escaped with another friend in sleeveless T-shirt. As they ran, the ‘Press’ disperse and doesn’t intervene to help the policeman soon soaking in blood. Note, for example, a girl in yellow Press vest in front of the injured policeman, nonchalant.</p> <p>None of all that is new. But contrast the situation (and events of the past) with years of Press propaganda reports (SCMP, New York Times, Washington Post, CNN), all drawn from pro-US Anglophile politicians who repeat the lie — repeated from Washington to London and in Mkini, Reuters offices — that China is suppressing all freedoms, freedom of expression, freedom of Press, silencing dissent, and that the new national security law would end HK autonomy, democracy and, with that, even more freedoms.</p> <ul><li>Yet, without these freedoms, these ‘democracy protesters’ (sic), continue their assault on the police, and that Causeway Bay incident was just one of 17 injuries caused on July 1, 2020. They included a policeman resting inside a parked police car that was set ablaze. Another three were injured after they were rammed by a motorcycle, flying the ISIS-like black flag from the rear seat.</li> <li>Without those freedoms, they have the past year managed to injure more than 160 policemen, almost all ending up in hospitals, one set alight with gasoline bomb, a dozen attacked with acid.</li> <li>Even without their freedoms, they manage to disrupt daily lives, attacked 91 subway Metros, and inflicted street terror on ordinary people, on top of arson and other terrorist acts.</li> </ul> <p>*</p> <h3>UNIVERSITY OF HONG KONG — AGAIN!</h3> <p>The man in dark shirt with an ice pick was masked from head to toe (top photo). But within six hours we identified that motherfucker then got him after he had cleared airport immigration, the plane door had closed, seated in his chair on a Cathay Pacific flight to London with a British National (Overseas) passport. His father was distraught (interview clip below):</p> <blockquote><p>“It is the fault of the Hong Kong University (HKU). They are the worse, they forced him, they won’t leave him alone and they don’t care if he has graduated…,” but they made him join the anti-Chinese demonstrations.</p> </blockquote> <p>The arrested suspect, Wong, age 24, was an engineering graduate of the HKU. Structured and largely taught by Anglo-American professors using English as the sole medium of instruction, the university is a racist, poisoned, anti-Chinese institution created in the exact image of Anglo-American universities.</p> <p>We Chinese have a long, long memory.</p> <p>But first, we’ll hammer that fucker with at least four charges which in combination will put him away for the rest of his life. Guaranteed! Next, we will hunt down and nail all his accomplices on that day, including his HKU girlfriend. After that his university mates and teachers, including the university vice-chancellor. These days, we have just the law to deal with all of them. In serious cases such as this one, trials can be conducted outside Hong Kong without those motherfucking Anglophile judges presiding.</p> <p>*</p> <p>*</p> <p>*</p> <p>*</p> <p>*</p> <p>Breaking: Pig American Flu found in China — Again!</p> <p>*</p> <p>*</p> <p><del><a href="https://shuzheng.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/mkini1.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51107" src="https://shuzheng.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/mkini1.png?w=500&amp;h=347" alt="" width="500" height="347"> Link: https://shuzheng.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/mkini1.png </a></del></p> <p>*</p> <p>To avoid facing the law and possibly jail, Steven Gan can run off to the US, his protector. This happened in dozens of cases in HK. Gan’s passport must be confiscated forthwith…</p> <p>*</p> <p><del><a href="https://shuzheng.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/mkini2.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-51108" src="https://shuzheng.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/mkini2.png?w=551&amp;h=65" alt="" width="551" height="65"> Link: https://shuzheng.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/mkini2.png </a></del></p> <p>*</p> <h3>JAIL FOR AN ANGLOPHILE</h3> <p>Malaysiakini and its editor Steven Gan are on trial not because of any absence of law. There are <a href="https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/532693">on trial for contempt</a>, that is, for the presence of a law that holds the sanctity and the integrity of the judicial system beyond any doubt. Arguments follow…</p> <ul><li>They hold in contempt not just the judiciary but all institutions of the government, including the King and the Parliament. The latest example of that contempt is given above, telling off the court to ‘be reasonable’. This means that, if Mkini and Gan are convicted, Premesh Chandran is saying, the court is ‘unreasonable’ and even restricts the freedom of speech. Premesh’s speech is clearly an attempt to assert pressure on the court and undermine its independence in favor of Mkini. He and on behalf of Mkini clearly don’t care for the underlying principle of sub-judice, and they regard themselves as superior to court decisions. That’s contempt.</li> </ul> <ul><li>They hold in contempt by relying not just on the spin and the omissions they commit in their so-called ‘news and views’ but also with anonymous hatchet jobs committed through an army of anonymous readers, who clearly and unmistakably, support their work financially. This sort of speech-contempt is contained in Mkini’s court argument (above top image-extract). It is that there is no such law to restrict online posting therefore Mkini can permit anything in by shifting the burden of proof for an assertion that is never falsifiable. Which is, Steven Gan didn’t know. Instead of the Christian preacher proving that God exists, Mkini’s argument requires the church congregation to prove there isn’t any. This kind of syllogism and mental somersault are passe and trite and Steven Gan must be called out — and, because they employ it, must be made to pay for the trickery. That’s contempt.</li> </ul> <ul><li>Mkini et al hold themselves to be accountable to nobody, other than their foreign sponsors, on the pretext-premise that freedom of the Press is above the law, indeed above everything, so that they spit at the constitution which insists all are equal before the law. They hold as their motto: ‘Speaking Truth to Power‘ as if only they have possession of the truth (whatever that is) and that, dressed as free Press, all power is theirs while all other powers are fair game to be undermined. In freedom of speech, they insist that speech is not an act, even though this is demonstrably false: ISIS, Iraq, Zakir Naik et al. That’s contempt.</li> </ul> <ul><li>If Steven Gan doesn’t know beforehand the existence of a contemptuous post, then he must produce the administrator who knew and who let that in. If the administrator doesn’t know, then Gan must produce the subscribers who posted those comments. Where does the buck stop? Yet he will do none of the above, again on the pretext of freedom of speech, in effect giving not only himself a free pass but also anyone who gives money to Mkini! That’s contempt.</li> </ul> <ul><li>There are other, extenuating circumstances that clearly indicate Mkini and Gan to be subversive forces that undermine the State of Malaysia and its position vis-a-vis the rest of the world:</li> </ul> <ul><li><ul><li>Being started, financed, and corralled into existence by the USA, which makes regime change and international <a href="https://orinocotribune.com/venezuela-rejects-new-us-sanctions-against-iranian-tanker-captains/">subversion of legitimate governments</a> (Ukraine, Venezuela, Russia, China) as their corner stone of foreign policy, the foreign financing makes Mkini and Gan complicit, direct and active participants in US propaganda agenda and unlawful objectives. That’s contempt.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul><li><ul><li>That they actively collude with the US to break international law, in <a href="https://orinocotribune.com/venezuela-submits-new-documents-against-us-in-the-hague/">crimes against humanity</a>, to propagate self-serving foreign-armed aggression (Iran, Syria, Libya), to break normal relationships among nations and neighboring states (China, Philippines), to violate sovereignty of independent states (Venezuela, Cuba), and to foment violations of law within the borders of respective countries (China, Nicaragua, Bolivia). That’s contempt.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul><li><ul><li>That, in cahoots with the US foreign and financial interest, Mkini attempts to influence domestic politics, thereby undermining the UN safeguards for non-interference and the UN respect for the sovereignty of other states. A Malaysian example is the 14th General Elections: Mkini colluded with US interests (such as its Department of Justice) in order to influence public perception and thereby undermine the credibility of the then Malaysian government of Najib Razak so as to totally replace it. That’s contempt.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Acting in Malaysia, which has international obligations, and bound by Malaysian laws, the activities of Mkini and Steven Gan have ramifications on Malaysia’s national prestige abroad. Following in the footsteps of Reuters and Anglo-America, Mkini weaponizes — indeed, profits from — racist hatred and hatred for indigenous governments on an international scale to serve White man’s imperialist goals. None of Mkini activities, past and present, must be tolerated anymore. Enough is enough.</p> <p>The danger of Mkini doing the work of its master, the USA, is plain for all to see in Hong Kong. There it has the Hong Kong Free Press and Apple Daily, both financed and directed by the CIA ‘NGO’ front the National Endowment for Democracy (NED).</p> <p>Mkini and its editors on its behalf must go to jail to serve as an example for the rest of the Press corp that the destiny of Malaysia is not for them to play with, that Malaysia doesn’t belong to Gan’s mother, that their days of acting with impunity are over, and that no matter who their rich and powerful masters may be, they are not above the law. That is, Malaysia’s judges must reassert the sovereign independence of the country they serve.</p> <p>The decision of the court (below) is therefore correct! Next, go straight to jail.

Here’s another moronic <a href="https://helenang.wordpress.com/">Anglophile Penang lang</a>.</p> <ul><li>Francis Light is founder? Kamal has proof Francis Light ‘founded’ the town? What does Kamal mean by founded? Light paved roads and introduced horse carts? As ‘founder’, Francis Light gave civilization to Kamal, taught him how to read in English, eat from plates not banana leaves, nibble scones in marmalade, and taught him how to fuck another Malaiyoo from the backside, like Anwar Ibrahim?</li> <li>Vandals? How does Kamal know they are vandals? He met and interrogated them, and they confessed to being ‘vandals’? Maybe Penang showers in red paint.</li> <li>Why vandals, and not ‘freedom fighters’? Or anti-racists?</li> </ul> <p>This Kamal podah …. Like Anglos, Anglophiles are convinced Columbus ‘founded’ — better yet, ‘discovered’ — America. For bigoted racist Anglophiles, history begins only with the Omputih, such nice people with an “English sense fairness” (the Malaiyoo Anglophile Zaid Ibrahim said that):</p> <blockquote><p>GEORGE TOWN: Vandals have splashed red paint on the statue of George Town founder Captain Francis Light here.</p> <p>The statue was erected 84 years ago to commemorate Francis Light’s contribution to the founding of George Town.</p> <p>Checks by The Star showed that the statue had been cleaned but some paint marks were still visible.</p> <p>The statue is a historical landmark in Penang and is located within the grounds of the famous Fort Cornwallis here.</p> <p>It was sculpted by FJ Wilcoxson and cast at Burton’s Foundry in Thames Ditton, England. It was erected to celebrate the 150th anniversary of George Town.</p> </blockquote> <p>The fucking statue should be brought down and thrown into the Malacca Straits or, more profitably, used to pave roads. Instead, it is treated like deity and demi-god.</p> <p>The world from Minneapolis to London is finally waking up to BLM, something we Chinese knew all along, that is, White racism but in Malaysia, slow as always, still worship their White masters, like Stevie, like Premesh, like Kamal.

Suffice to say, the Chinese word 国民 hold a different meaning. Consequently, the NSL also protects individual Chinese. An attack on one without provocation, without just cause, is an attack on all, that is the nation of Chinese. Meng Wanzhou is case in point, not because she is rich but because she is Chinese. This puts HSBC, its senior executives especially, liable under NSL. That, plus their money laundering past, their drug trade financing since 1841, and illicit transfer of monies to rioters, we swear they will pay. Don’t doubt the Chinese resolve to settle the score. Here’s a tip to Chinese serving HSBC: leave and disappear in the Amazon jungles.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>*</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>This time last year, 2019: Anglophiles</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>*</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Yesterday, 2020: Second Return of HK</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>*</ins></p><ins> </ins><h3><ins>How does freedom arise?</ins></h3><ins> </ins><p><ins>Some two or three weeks ago, the Hong Kong Police launched a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/HKPChannel">YouTube site Link: https://www.youtube.com/user/HKPChannel </a>.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>In yesterday’s riots, July 1, they reported the event live, simultaneous from two or more locations, and while doing inserted announcements about where roads and areas (principally in Causeway Bay) had been blocked or closed because of the pro-US disturbances. The problem yesterday was small beer, the police had handled events 100 times worse.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>In the live stream (below, 7 hours long) you can tell right off how the Press, typically Anglo-American ones, CNBC, Reuters and Mkini, lied in their reports, singularly to stick to the US spin of an anti-Chinese narrative campaign. That they believe their campaign will succeed to turn the Chinese against the authorities is because that sort of spin come from an Anglo-American (hence Anglophile) culture, facets of which you see a lot in Mkini, every day. In their culture, they regard authority as antagonistic, separate and outside of society.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Not so we Chinese. We see authorities — the police in particular — as social vanguards, with both duty and responsibility to serve us and protect us from enemies, even those within. (Also see the one from mainland China about the fireman, next clip.) Each time, each era they have lived up to the trust we place on them and expectations derived thereof. Conversely, enemies of the Chinese will be punished severely; the society demands it. Hence, the NSL.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>So confident are we about our authorities that the live stream received 540,000 views within a space of ten hours.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>It’s written in our old books in which freedom is such:</ins></p><ins> </ins><blockquote><p><ins>“Let the prince be the prince, the minister be the minister, the father be the father, the son be the son…”</ins></p><ins> </ins></blockquote><ins> </ins><p><ins>*</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>*</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>*</ins></p><ins> </ins><h3><ins><span class="tlid-translation translation" lang="zh-CN"><span class="" title="">我们的祖国更安全</span></span></ins></h3><ins> </ins><p><ins><span class="tlid-translation translation" lang="zh-CN"><span class="" title="">亲爱的 </span></span><span class="tlid-translation translation" lang="zh-CN"><span title="">工作完了</span> <span class="" title="">快</span><span class="" title="">回来了</span></span></ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>*</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>*</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>This is one such thousands of stories I have heard in the decade in Motherland China.

This may be paid days or years later, but always paid for by other people which we typically say, ‘the innocent’. Often those consequences are innocuous. But, if you’d take the trouble, it is possible to trace backwards, to the origins, i.e. roots — empirically — to the US and the like of the Lims, Lees and Wongs.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>In another phrasing, the clip below showing the family below suddenly ended.

For a reminder to the answer: Go back to Kosovo, to the family in Sulaimani, Iraq.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>We conclude this segment with Max Blumenthal’s expose on the US propaganda regime directed by the CIA front, the National Endowment for Democracy which also (happens) to pay Steven Gan and sponsors Malaysiakini.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Blumenthal’s reporting (below) is self-explanatory. But, from it, can you tell the identical MO in US directing and fabricating tales of torture and supposed human rights abuses that, invariably, are the prelude to regime change? (It happened in Libya, Iraq, and happening in Iran and Venezuela.)</ins></p><ins> </ins><ul><li><ins>The North Korea Human Rights Act and the Hong Kong Human Rights Act.</ins></li><ins> </ins><li><ins>Park Yeonmi and Joshua Wong.</ins></li><ins> </ins><li><ins>The exploitation of children for political purposes: When feted in western Press, Park was 15; Wong 14. Greta Thurnberg was 16. Of the 9,000 plus arrested in the HK 2019 riots since last June, 41 percent were under 18, some still in Standard 6 primary. Kids were paid to disguise as Press reporters; last month one arrested in a riot was 13, two weeks ago 11. In the Tiananmen riots, Chinese agents for the US used children to buy food and go to the market.</ins></li><ins> </ins><li><ins>The Oslo Freedom Forum for North Korea and for China. 
</ins></li><ins> </ins><li><ins>The unrelenting use of especially Anglophone Press propaganda, all controlled by the US, media distributed across America, from UK and Malaysia. For example, <a href="https://www.ted.com/speakers/yeonmi_park">Park appears on TED talks Link: https://www.ted.com/speakers/yeonmi_park </a>, never mind the endless lies.</ins></li><ins> </ins><li><ins>Never ending contradictory accounts which are internally inconsistent, and always, always impossible to verify.</ins></li><ins> </ins><li><ins>The same talking points: freedom, human rights, democracy.</ins></li><ins> </ins><li><ins>The paid uses of support opposition political and NGO groups, in Malaysia represented by Charles Santiago, Rais Hussin, Yeo Bee Yin, but usually people formerly from the media or academics who can put together a spin, with some coherence, hopefully.</ins></li><ins> </ins><li><ins>Bribery, lots of money changing hands. Park was paid a base sum of US$12,500 a month (speaking fees are separate for example, and expenses), three times the US per capita income, and not bad for an ex-North Korean farm girl. Joshua Wong gets a lump sum payment for each propaganda project, from the NED alone US$250,000 as ‘consultant fee’ for the Occupy Central project in 2014 when he was 18. In his personal bio distributed to the Press he was described at the time to be a University of HK student but if you check the enrollment there, his name won’t show up. He had only registered for an external certificate course after failing his university entrance exam. All these are matters of record but the Press will never verify. Why? Because it interferes with the spin — Student Activist, Poster Boy of Democracy, a <a href="https://twitter.com/joshuawongcf/status/1274608542247337984">David and Goliath Link: https://twitter.com/joshuawongcf/status/1274608542247337984 </a>., the last of which, if you think it through, has to be for an Anglophile and western market only because the Chinese never heard of those names much less appreciate the biblical metaphor.</ins></li><ins> </ins></ul><ins> </ins><p><ins>An Anglophile sucker is born every minute.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>***</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>*</ins></p><ins> </ins><h3><ins>A Spectre is Haunting the World</ins></h3><ins> </ins><p><ins>*</ins></p><ins> </ins><h3><ins>America the Closed Society…</ins></h3><ins> </ins><h3><ins>and the Closed Anglophile Mind

That report, above, ought to have landed the reporter and editor in jail. Nothing happened.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>But note the Reuters report had cited ‘internal investigation by HSBC’. What ‘investigation’ when the only reference in it is a set of MS power-point presentation slides used in a 2016 meeting between HSBC America and Meng Wanzhou to open a corporate bank account in California for Huawei?</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Facts to note:</ins></p><ins> </ins><ul><li><ins>(a) What is HSBC investigating when all that there is, is Huawei opening a bank account for its fledgling American business? Do they ‘investigate’ you if your company opens a corporate account? The most that they do is called ‘due diligence’.</ins></li><ins> </ins><li><ins>(b) What is HSBC investigating supposedly over a ‘suspected front company’ that was operating not in America but in Iran, and that was four years before the HSBC meeting, and it had no HSBC account?</ins></li><ins> </ins><li><ins>(c) What is HSBC investigating: that Huawei dealt with Iran which is subject to neither US law nor (internationally illegal) US sanctions, both having no jurisdiction over non-US companies?</ins></li><ins> </ins></ul><ins> </ins><p><ins>In all cases, (a) to (c), the subject matter — that is, trade with Iran — had nothing to do with the HSBC.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>But, solely on the basis of that meeting, and the power-point presentation Meng made at the meeting, the crime of ‘secretly dealing’ with Iran was invented — that is selling handphones — and that was by a defunct company four years prior and which Huawei didn’t own.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>See, how contrived the US justice system: they want to fix you and they can’t even create a proper fig leaf argument.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>To give, however, that invention of crime a legal and public legitimacy, Reuters was thus recruited — i.e. given an ‘exclusive’ — of Huawei having ‘secret dealings’ with Iran and hiding that from the US, as if that were a fact.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Note the date of the Reuters report (image above), Feb 26, 2019, was almost three months after Meng Wanzhou was abducted in Vancouver airport on transit, Dec 1, 2018. Or to restate that time line: Having nothing on Meng, the US government invented something, anything, then have Reuters do the dirty laundry work, in order to give justification for her arrest and extradition.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Even at that point, from December 2018 (her abduction) to February 2020 (Reuters report), Meng had not been charged! She was formally charged in absentia only in July 2019 so that the next month, in August, those US charge documents could be produced and sent to Canada’s government to buttress its court case of extraditing her.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Those prosecution documents are available online. Reading through them, you can see they made direct references to Reuters as a tip-off, i.e. for alerting the US Department of Justice (DOJ) which, in turn, used the 2016 HSBC-Meng meeting as proof of attempt to cheat the US and evade sanctions.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Now, contrast Meng’s supposed crime with HSBC itself, laundering drug cartel money, spread over a decade or more, until it became untenable for US and was exposed in 2012. Not one HSBC executive was prosecuted, though the sum of money laundered through worldwide via HSBC accounts exceeded US$10 billion.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>In 2016 when Reuters said HSBC conducted an ‘internal investigation’ against Huawei, the latter had also reached a deal with DOJ to pay a fine of US$1.6 billion but no prosecution, provided… this, this and that.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The same method was used against Goldman Sachs over 1MDB: no prosecution for the scam but pay a fine and help the US and its pro-US Malaysian politicians nail Najib Razak. It was time for regime change in Malaysia. To help the US drum up the case they brought in the Press, in that case, Sarawak Report and Malaysiakini and the Edge. That’s propaganda SOP; it is why you want to own Steven Gan and Clare Rewcastle-Brown. If HSBC CEOs are willing to be bought, why wouldn’t little media turds?</ins></p><ins> </ins><blockquote><p><ins>We Chinese are more determined than ever to see that HSBC will never last long operating on Chinese soil, and that includes Hong Kong where it has monopoly on the retail and mortgage markets. Because its CEOs work as a regime change agents for the US then they and the bank will be treated as foreign threats, undermining the interest of Chinese. We have just the kind of law and punishment for them motherfuckers — this we swear in the name of Huangdi.

</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>This brief post is about the legacy of Western colonialism, today being accompanied by the decline of the Anglo-American Anglophiles, before acting like a bullying colonialist power all because they speaka Inglish, feted in London and Washington, feeling great surrounded by coattails in timber reading rooms, raised on a Jane Austen diet, eat with a knife and fork, play cricket, have soccer clubs, calling themselves Manchester United, having learned to count (improperly) in English, and therefore, feels superior and sufficient to make them to feel powerful over people.

There is no mystery to the Indian myopia: When the Anglophile copies White ways, they also copy the latter’s racist bigotry.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>And, the Russian explanation is correct because, before the latest troubles from India, recall the mamak Kutty named Mahathir Mohamad: Same Anglophile culture, same warmongering attitude, same bigotry, same racism.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>So fond are Anglophiles for White culture that they believe only White people know how to govern, have democracy, are humane, have human rights, and can do science and be rich. All this in spite of their barbaric, voodoo religious culture and their genocidal and murderous records, their treatment of weaker peoples, all happening today even in Anglophile countries like India where the Anglophile elite routinely order the killing of minorities (Never reported. But see, for example, writings by <span class="ILfuVd"><span class="e24Kjd">Arundhati Roy.</span></span>) Hence, to combat the inconvenient historical truths, they rely on Press propaganda to change the story, in the same way Anglo-America relies on the same, for example, in those narratives coming out of Reuters and Malaysiakini.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Notice, too, that the same Anglophile racist bigotry is at work in Hong Kong: the US/UK meddling and the Anglophiles (supported by propaganda from Indians in HK) rioting for a year in order to drive out the Chinese from their land on the pseudo justification that they were raised in Anglo-Saxon culture and therefore Hong Kong belongs to Anglo-America (see, for example, Horace Chin Wan 陳云根 and Jack Lee Kai-tik 李啟迪<span>)</span>. The point isn’t whether such justifications make sense — they are not intended for that purpose. The point, instead, is who wields the power and who has the gun to hang on to the Truth.

"Never. Stay friends? Try to grow a small rose garden on the ashes of broken feelings? No, this will never work for you and me. It happens only after small affairs and it looks fake. Love should not be spoiled by friendship." 
* 
No one can become stranger than the person you once loved. 
* 
How clumsy a person behaves when he is truly in love! How quickly his self-confidence fades! And how lonely he feels; all his praised experience seems to be gone, just like fog, and he feels so weak and helpless. 
* 
Love cannot stand explanations. It requires actions. Love wants to be eternal. That is the source of the torture it causes us. 
* 
"I have always thought a woman should not tell a man she is in love with him. Her shining and happy eyes should bear witness to that." 
* 
"You have to break your principles sometimes. Otherwise they bring you no joy." 
* 
"Whatever you can’t get always seems better than whatever you have. This is the romance and the stupidity of our life." 
* 
"Nothing’s lost yet," I said. "You only lose someone when he’s dead."

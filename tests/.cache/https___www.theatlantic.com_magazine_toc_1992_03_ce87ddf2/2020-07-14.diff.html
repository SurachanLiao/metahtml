Several members of the group <a href="https://www.spokesman.com/stories/1997/apr/01/cult-returned-telescope-that-didnt-show-ufo/">bought Link: https://www.spokesman.com/stories/1997/apr/01/cult-returned-telescope-that-didnt-show-ufo/ </a> an expensive, high-powered telescope so that they might get a clearer view of the comet. They quickly brought it back and asked for a refund. When the manager asked why, they complained that the telescope was defective, that it didn’t show the spaceship following the comet. A short time later, believing that they would be rescued once they had shed their “earthly containers” (their bodies), all 39 members killed themselves.</del></p><del> </del><p dir="ltr"><del>Heaven’s Gate followers had a tragically misguided conviction, but it is an example, albeit extreme, of cognitive dissonance, the motivational mechanism that underlies the reluctance to admit mistakes or accept scientific findings—even when those findings can save our lives. This dynamic is playing out during the pandemic among the many people who refuse to wear masks or practice social distancing. Human beings are deeply unwilling to change their minds. And when the facts clash with their preexisting convictions, some people would sooner jeopardize their health and everyone else’s than accept new information or admit to being wrong.</del></p><del> </del></div>

This palpably shows the true nature of the US as the main culprit behind terrorism.&#8221;</span></p><p><span>The North Korean government claims that in fact, back in May that it had foiled a US and South Korean plot to kill its Supreme Leader.</span></p><p><span>They captured a &#160;man &#160;who happened to be going by the name of &#160;&#8220;Kim&#8221; (I give them a zero for creativity here). They went on to say that &#8220;Kim&#8221; had been paid to carry out an attack with biological substances.</span></p><p><span>In all honesty, really guys over at the CIA, what did you send &#8216;heinous&#8217; rookies in to do a man&#8217;s job or something?</span></p><p><span>By the way, it should be noted that North Korea has a history of making false statements, accusations and basically just making shit up that cannot be verified. </span></p><p><span>The CIA has basically not comment on this one, no doubt likely due to laughing hysterically over the accusation. </span></p><p><span>All kidding aside, if the CIA had wanted Kim Jong-Un dead (which a lot of people do let&#8217;s just be honest here), Kim Jong-Un, would be dead. </span></p><p><span>The CIA does not screw around with assassination attempts, they are pretty serious and if they feel that they need to attempt one, it&#8217;s a fairly slim chance that you&#8217;d ever know the CIA would have been behind it. </span></p><p><span>And Kim Jong-Un is a fairly easy target. </span></p><p><span>Too many people on the inside can be bought in particular, on the inside of North Korea&#8217;s regime many people can be bought for the right price. </span></p><p><span>If Kim is under some misguided delusion that anyone is really loyal to him, he may want to sit down and really think that one through. </span></p><p><span>No one is truly loyal to Kim Jong-Un, no one.</span></p><p><span>Fear of being murdered at the request of your country&#8217;s leader and loyalty are two very different things my friend. </span></p><p><span>Cristal M Clark</span></p><p><a href="https://apple.news/TQl7IRxuXQqaBdPnt023HIA"><span>IOS users can find The Crime Shop on Apple News</span></a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/thecimeshop"><span>@thecrimeshop on twitter</span></a></p><p><a href="https://gab.ai/thecrimeshop"><span>And https://gab.ai/thecrimeshop</span></a></p></article>

<p>CIA Tries &amp; Fails to Assassinate Kim Jong-Un?</p>

<p>The state-run Korea Central News Agency (better known as a propaganda news agency for the country&#8217;s ruling Workers&#8217; Party, like FoxNews is for Trump here in the US), has laid out a pretty serious accusation here, according to them the CIA tried and failed to assassinate the North Korean leader earlier this year by using a chemical or biological poison to take out the beloved Kim Jong-Un.</p>

<p>This is what they had to say in the newly published report:</p>
<p><i>&#8220;In May this year, a group of heinous terrorists who infiltrated our country on the orders of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) of the US and the South Korean puppet Intelligence Service with the purpose of carrying out state-sponsored terrorism against our supreme headquarters using biological and chemical substance were caught and exposed. This palpably shows the true nature of the US as the main culprit behind terrorism.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>The North Korean government claims that in fact, back in May that it had foiled a US and South Korean plot to kill its Supreme Leader.</p>
<p>They captured a &#160;man &#160;who happened to be going by the name of &#160;&#8220;Kim&#8221; (I give them a zero for creativity here). They went on to say that &#8220;Kim&#8221; had been paid to carry out an attack with biological substances.</p>
<p>In all honesty, really guys over at the CIA, what did you send &#8216;heinous&#8217; rookies in to do a man&#8217;s job or something?</p>
<p>By the way, it should be noted that North Korea has a history of making false statements, accusations and basically just making shit up that cannot be verified. </p>
<p>The CIA has basically not comment on this one, no doubt likely due to laughing hysterically over the accusation. </p>
<p>All kidding aside, if the CIA had wanted Kim Jong-Un dead (which a lot of people do let&#8217;s just be honest here), Kim Jong-Un, would be dead. </p>
<p>The CIA does not screw around with assassination attempts, they are pretty serious and if they feel that they need to attempt one, it&#8217;s a fairly slim chance that you&#8217;d ever know the CIA would have been behind it. </p>
<p>And Kim Jong-Un is a fairly easy target. </p>
<p>Too many people on the inside can be bought in particular, on the inside of North Korea&#8217;s regime many people can be bought for the right price. </p>
<p>If Kim is under some misguided delusion that anyone is really loyal to him, he may want to sit down and really think that one through. </p>
<p>No one is truly loyal to Kim Jong-Un, no one.</p>
<p>Fear of being murdered at the request of your country&#8217;s leader and loyalty are two very different things my friend. </p>

Despite sealing its borders and halting all trade with China, major cities in North Korea have been hit by the coronavirus epidemic, according to witness accounts.

Christian group Voice of the Martyrs Korea that proselytizes in North Korea said an underground North Korean church member told it that the virus has spread widely in Pyongyang and the border town of Sinuiju, North Pyongan Province. "The situation is so desperate that it is just a matter of dying from starvation or infection," the member wrote.

North Korea claims it has not a single confirmed case of coronavirus, but experts believe that the epidemic has spread significantly there.

U.S. Forces Korea Commander Gen. Robert Abrams said last week that he is "fairly certain" coronavirus has already spread to North Korea.

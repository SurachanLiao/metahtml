The couple, who quarantined together, recently opened up about their experiences in conversation with Ophrah Winfrey, snippets from which are shared on Oprah's IGTV video. Sabrina, who was spotted next to Mr Elba in his previous videos, said, "I could have made the decision to put myself, maybe, in a separate room or stay away, and I'm sure that people are making those decisions and they're tough decisions to make, but I made the decision to want to be with him and, you know, still touch him." She added, "I wanted to be with him, that's the instinct of a wife. You want to go and take care."</p><p>Later, <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/entertainment/first-tom-hanks-and-now-idris-elba-twitter-has-had-it-with-coronavirus-2195921" target="_self">Idris Elba</a> added, "If I had caught it, she had certainly caught it in that time period, as well. People were right to have highlighted that spatial distancing is important. I think given the context of the video, which was telling the world what has happened to us, we weren't thinking about that specifically."</p><p>Sharing a snippet from the session on IGTV, Oprah wrote: "Like millions of people all over the world, I've been staying safer at home for over a week now. I know a lot of people are feeling stressed, overwhelmed, and uncertain. Because of that, I wanted to offer some hope and gather thought leaders and people going through it to add some perspective. Which is why I FaceTimed Idris Elba and his wife Sabrina who are safely quarantined together after he tested positive for COVID-19. Idris fills me in on his journey and Sabrina reveals the result of her test after they decided to quarantine together."</p> <blockquote class="instagram-media"><p><ins><a href="https://www.instagram.com/tv/B-BNP6LBJhr/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" target="_blank">View this post on Instagram Link: https://www.instagram.com/tv/B-BNP6LBJhr/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading </a></ins></p><p><ins><a href="https://www.instagram.com/tv/B-BNP6LBJhr/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" target="_blank">Like millions of people all over the world, I've been staying safer at home for over a week now.

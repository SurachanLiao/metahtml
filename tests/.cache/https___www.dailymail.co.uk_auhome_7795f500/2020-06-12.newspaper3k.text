Joe Exotic told a pen pal he has been in solitary confinement for two years, a letter obtained exclusively by DailyMail.com reveals. The former zoo owner wrote: 'My soul dies a little each day. Not long and my heart will stop like an animal that morns [sic] itself to death.' The letter was dated May 5 and sent to Kathleen Lafferty, who felt sympathy for Exotic after watching Tiger King and decided to write to him. Joe begged Lafferty to be his voice to the public, writing: 'No email, 4 calls per month, no commissary like others get, unable to buy shampoo-conditioner or basic health care needs.' Joe's lawyer, Francisco Hernandez, corroborated the claims, saying: 'He is in the Special Handling Unit for unexplained reasons. It's unprecedented. [Solitary] is supposed to be a maximum of 14 days. He hasn't seen the sun in two years.' Joe was convicted of the murder-for-hire plot to kill Carole Baskin and 17 charges of animal abuse in 2019 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison this January.

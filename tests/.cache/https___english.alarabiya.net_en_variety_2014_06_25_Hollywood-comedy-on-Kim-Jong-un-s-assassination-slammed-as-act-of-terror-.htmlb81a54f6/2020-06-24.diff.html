In a recent interview with Yahoo Movies, Rogen, who co-wrote the script, said the idea for the film came out of a discussion over how journalists with access to world leaders might have the opportunity to act as assassins.</p> <p class="hide-in-mobile">"We read as much as we could that was available on the subject ... We talked to people in the government whose job it is to associate with North Korea, or be experts on it," Rogen said.   </p> <a class="more for-mobile">SHOW MORE</a> <p class="article-content-bottom-info">Last Update:  Wednesday, 20 May 2020 KSA 13:53 - GMT 10:53

Zoom invitations and links to submit questions are provided below.The ever-evolving topic of school reopening has been widely discussed and debated on a local, state, and national level. The options we will provide next week have been developed according to current directives from County and State Public Health Offices and the CA Department of Education. Without a doubt, these directives and our plans will change as we get closer to the start of the school year.&#160;We expect to receive a much-anticipated update from Governor Newsom today which will provide clear guidance and define specific positivity thresholds public schools must adhere to.&#160;Please trust our ultimate reopening scenario will align with public health directives, the guiding principles outlined in our Long Range Plan, and our Collective Bargaining Agreements with classified and certificated staff.Respectfully,Karl Mueller

There will be two seatings of one and half hours each, starting at 5 pm on Friday and Saturday and 1 pm on Sunday. This idea was modeled after a similar program in Paso Robles and is designed to encourage residents to support local restaurants by getting food to go and picnic in the park in a stanchion designated area, across from the Library, near Sixth Street and Orange Avenue. The City will provide a ma&#238;tre d&#8217; to greet guests and another employee to service tables.Reservations can be made through the Chamber of Commerce at 619-435-9260.&#160; City Manager Blair King indicated that he, along with many others, already has reservations and they will see how successful the program is to consider expanding it; but he is hopeful that things will open up in a couple of weeks, so restaurants can resume indoor service. King commented, &#8220;Picnicking is already allowed; we are just formalizing this with precautions. We are not encouraging large gatherings.&#8221; When asked what types of alcohol would be allowed, he laughed and said it was all inclusive, even &#8220;Grandma&#8217;s special recipe with gin.&#8221; He confirmed that this motion had nothing to do with allowing food trucks. City Councilmember Sandke suggested designating curb space for food delivery. Waiving parking restrictions to allow certain businesses to operate outdoors on private parking lots was the next approved motion. This mainly impacts fitness centers and gyms, allowing them to temporarily operate outdoors for the duration of the County Health Order which forbids them to have clients indoors. Another motion was approved to help gyms continue to operate in public spaces, allowing them to utilize Spreckels Park, Bradley Field, and the beach to hold outdoor classes. The Council delegated the special use permit issuance to city staff and waived fees, also permitting other allowed spaces to be designated by the Parks and Recreation Department.

From the Sacred Ground website: &#8220;it&#8217;s a film- and readings-based dialogue series on race, grounded in faith.&#8221;Preslar, who also heads up Formation (an education-based component of the church), and the church&#8217;s ministry team discussed the idea and how they could structure the group, as well as future Sacred Ground workshops, during a pandemic.&#8220;It&#8217;s very hard to have 38 people (the number participating) on one giant Zoom call,&#8221; Preslar said. &#8220;That would be completely overwhelming. We have three small groups with one leader in each that are reading the book concurrently.&#8221;The book has nine sections so nine sessions are taking place presently that include discussion prompts from the book and additional resources.&#8220;We were thrilled with the turnout,&#8221; Preslar said, adding they had originally planned to launch in the fall but adjusted given the current climate and tremendous need. &#8220;Our goal was to have one group of 12. The fact that we have three groups of that many has been just for us a visual of how wanted and needed this type of program is within our community.&#8221; Waking Up White, and Finding Myself in the Story of Race is written by Debby Irving, a racial justice educator and writer as well as teacher and administrator. Throughout her life, Irving says she sensed racial tensions in her personal and professional relationships. She worried about offending people she wanted to befriend. She didn&#8217;t understand why her reaching out and diversity efforts lacked traction. In the book she candidly discusses the paradigm shift that adjusted her worldview and life plan.Preslar said part of the reason Christ Church chose the book is because it&#8217;s &#8220;so approachable.&#8221; She added that other churches have also recommended it as a successful introduction to Sacred Ground.&#8220;(Another reason) we chose to start with a book study for it,&#8221; Preslar said of the Sacred Ground program, &#8220;is the time spent apart where we&#8217;re not in a church community. A video series in the parish hall can&#8217;t happen now. Book study and online conversation can get people used to having those challenging conversations.&#8221;Preslar said any other group could have access to the program as well. She explained how it&#8217;s designed to create affinity groups that do the work together of exploring race and racism, covering different topics each time together with readings, dialogue prompts and forming a brave place for conversation.She described how a brave place is different from a safe place or space where the ultimate goal is sharing and support &#8212; that in a brave space the focus is on encouraging respectful and constructive dialogue.Brave spaces are becoming known as places for education, discourse, sharing experiences, recognizing differences and coming to new understandings, undertakings which are often difficult and uncomfortable.&#8220;Our goal locally is to very much have the conversation,&#8221; Preslar said, &#8220;mirror what the Dismantling Racism youth program does (an Episcopal program for grades 6-12, in which three Coronado students are participating). We want to encourage participation and conversation in brave spaces.&#8221;Preslar said they&#8217;ll start the Sacred Ground curriculum once the book sessions are complete.&#8220;It&#8217;s been wonderful,&#8221; she said of the book club&#8217;s reception. &#8220;The conversations are deep and heartfelt, and the people who are participating are enjoying the process &#8212; but the process is very challenging.&#8220;It&#8217;s enjoyable to be doing this work in the community and have the support of community. It&#8217;s also sometimes very hard, and it brings to mind how much Black people have struggled for so long. Just as the book title is Waking Up White, we have to wake up to what their realities have been and equity in our world &#8230; I would say that it&#8217;s life-changing and pushes us toward a positive sense of change.&#8221;The chaplain also mentioned how the day school is in the process of diversifying its library and resources, and teachers are looking at ways to incorporate racially-inclusive books into their curriculums for the coming school year.&#8220;I think the main thing for all of us is that we&#8217;ve been doing this work,&#8221; Preslar said. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter how far along you are in doing this journey, there&#8217;s always something new to learn. It&#8217;s OK to be a beginner and not knowing a thing and pick up and talk. It&#8217;s OK to be 15 steps down the road and doing more advanced work. Wherever you are in your journey, we all have an important role to play.&#8221;The church shared how it&#8217;s striving to continue to have brave conversations about race, working toward &#8220;a viewing of all of us as beloved children of God,&#8221; and &#8220;how we choose to work together in this world to provide equity for everyone,&#8221; Preslar said.Connect with Christ Church using <a href="https://www.christchurchcoronado.org/get-in-touch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their website contact page</a>, including being part of their congregation&#8217;s deeper discussions on race and faith, &#8220;healing racial division and exploring the ways in which we are connected,&#8221; Preslar said.You can also <a href="http://www.centerforracialhealing.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">learn more here</a> about the Dismantling Racism youth program and its creator the Absolom Jones Episcopal Center for Racial Healing in Atlanta, Georgia.&#160;</p></p><p class="item-details"><h3 class="entry-title td-module-title"> <a href="https://coronadotimes.com/news/2020/07/16/stability-concerns-add-challenges-for-firefighters-aboard-uss-bonhomme-richard/" rel="bookmark" title="Stability Concerns Add Challenges for Firefighters Aboard USS Bonhomme Richard"> Stability Concerns Add Challenges for Firefighters Aboard USS Bonhomme Richard </a></h3><ul class="td-category"><li class="entry-category"><a href="https://coronadotimes.com/news/category/featured/">Featured</a></li><li class="entry-category"><a href="https://coronadotimes.com/news/category/news/military/">Military</a></li></ul> <a href="https://coronadotimes.com/news/author/jeanettegroeneveld/">Jeannie Groeneveld</a><p class="td-author-line"> -</p><span class="td-post-date"> 07/16/2020 </span><p class="td-post-comments"> <a href="https://coronadotimes.com/news/2020/07/16/stability-concerns-add-challenges-for-firefighters-aboard-uss-bonhomme-richard/#respond">  0 </a></p><p class="td-post-text-content td-post-content tagdiv-type"> UPDATED July 16, 1:00pm &#8211; In a statement Thursday afternoon, Rear Admiral Philip E.

Another 1,144 got sick the following week, and during the last week of June the number jumped to 1,595. The figures began to decrease again when indoor activities at those same locales were closed again. The total was down to 1,028 by the week ending July 11.&#8220;Some young people think they&#8217;re invincible and won&#8217;t get sick, but that&#8217;s not the case,&#8221; said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. &#8220;Not only are they getting sick, but they are also ending up at emergency rooms and needing hospitalization.&#8221;During the second week of June 10, a total of 16 San Diegans between 20 and 39 years of age were hospitalized. The figured dropped to 12 the following week and jumped to 27 the last week of June. Again, the number began to decrease when certain sectors of the economy were closed and was down to 18 by July 11.Also, the number of COVID-19 outbreaks in community settings followed a similar pattern of increasing as activities widened. While only eight community outbreaks were reported in May, in June, 33 were identified. This month, 38 community outbreaks have been reported, with restaurants/bars and private residences the most common locations.&#8220;The evidence is clear. As more people started to go out, especially young people, we started to see an increasing number of COVID-19 cases,&#8221; Wooten said.<h3>COVID-19 Impact in Younger People</h3> Dr. Scott Eisman, a pulmonary disease and critical care medicine expert at Scripps Memorial Hospital in Encinitas, said that while young people think COVID-19 is not serious, the novel coronavirus could have serious health issues, especially in young people who smoke or vape.&#8220;Many younger people think that this is something that you&#8217;ll get, and you&#8217;ll overcome, and everything will be fine, but the complications of this illness are greater than the flu,&#8221; Eisman said. &#8220;We have younger and younger patients showing up with more and more significant complications.&#8221;Eisman said research has shown that COVID-19 attacks both lungs and their blood vessels which could result in blood clotting in the lungs and other parts of the body.COVID-19, Eisman said, can cause other problems, including stroke, cardiac issues, cerebral dysfunction, liver and kidney failure.&#8220;It causes blood clotting in general and that could create substantial problems in the ability of the lung to deliver oxygen,&#8221; Eisman said.<h3>County Hiring Case Investigators</h3> Due to the increasing number of COVID-19 cases, the County is hiring additional people to do case investigations, an important activity in public health responses to infectious disease.Case investigators call or email people who have tested positive for COVID-19 to ask them to isolate themselves and find out their close contacts. Bilingual applicants are encouraged to&#160;<a href="https://www.governmentjobs.com/careers/sdcounty?keywords=temporary%27">apply for the temporary position</a>.The new hires will join the more than 510 case investigators and contact tracers currently working to stop the spread of the virus.Community Setting Outbreaks and Other Triggers:<ul><li>Four new community setting outbreaks were identified on July 14 in a hair salon, a barbershop, a restaurant/bar and a laboratory.</li><li>In the past seven days, 14 community outbreaks were confirmed.</li><li>The number of community outbreaks is double the trigger of seven or more in seven days.</li><li>A community setting outbreak is defined as three or more COVID-19 cases in a setting and in people of different households.</li><li>The County also reached the Case Investigation trigger because only 46% of investigations were initiated within 24 hours of notification over a 7-day period. The percentage should be at least 71%.</li><li>The state&#8217;s threshold of no more than 100 cases per every 100,000 residents is also in the red and currently registers at 147.2 in San Diego County.</li></ul> <span>Source: County of San Diego</span></p></p><p class="item-details"><h3 class="entry-title td-module-title"> <a href="https://coronadotimes.com/news/2020/07/15/pet-of-the-week-cookie-an-applehead-seal-point-siamese-for-adoption/" rel="bookmark" title="Pet of the Week:  Cookie, an Applehead Seal Point Siamese for Adoption"> Pet of the Week:  Cookie, an Applehead Seal Point Siamese for Adoption </a></h3><ul class="td-category"><li class="entry-category"><a href="https://coronadotimes.com/news/category/community/community-news/">Community News</a></li></ul> <a href="https://coronadotimes.com/news/author/pawsofcoronado/">PAWS of Coronado</a><p class="td-author-line"> -</p><span class="td-post-date"> 07/15/2020 </span><p class="td-post-comments"> <a href="https://coronadotimes.com/news/2020/07/15/pet-of-the-week-cookie-an-applehead-seal-point-siamese-for-adoption/#respond">  0 </a></p><p class="td-post-text-content td-post-content tagdiv-type"><h2>Add a Sweet Treat to Your Life with Cookie&#8230;</h2><p dir="ltr">Beautiful and elegant Cookie came to the Coronado Animal Care Facility when her former owner relinquished her.

I have had lots of time to think and reflect, and to think and reflect some more. Concurrently, our City has faced some truly extraordinary challenges with regard to the making of public policy and in the managing of its finances in the face of losing most of our hotel tax revenue. While other people bleed red blood, I exclusively bleed green, white, and gold blood. I want to jump off of the sidelines and help our citizens to problem solve and to move forward in the midst of these challenges. I do not claim to have a bunch of novel answers, but I know a great deal about this City, its people, and its past.Therefore, with excitement and a little bit of anxiety, I am ready to announce that I will be a candidate for the Coronado City Council. I am running for the Council because I want to be there to help people to find solutions to their problems. I am not running for Mayor because I think I should go back to the end of the line and work my way back up to that spot when the time is right. I am ready to go to work for you and look forward to having the chance to serve you once again, if you will have me.Casey Tanaka</p></p><p class="item-details"><h3 class="entry-title td-module-title"> <a href="https://coronadotimes.com/news/2020/07/15/coronado-psych-the-benefits-and-risks-of-online-therapy/" rel="bookmark" title="Coronado Psych: The Benefits and Risks of Online Therapy"> Coronado Psych: The Benefits and Risks of Online Therapy </a></h3><ul class="td-category"><li class="entry-category"><a href="https://coronadotimes.com/news/category/news/business/">Business</a></li><li class="entry-category"><a href="https://coronadotimes.com/news/category/community/">Community</a></li></ul><p class="td-post-author-name"> <a href="https://coronadotimes.com/news/author/coronadopsych/">Dr. Rika Tanaka, Ph.D., Coronado Psych</a><p class="td-author-line"> -</p></p><span class="td-post-date"> 07/15/2020 </span><p class="td-post-comments"> <a href="https://coronadotimes.com/news/2020/07/15/coronado-psych-the-benefits-and-risks-of-online-therapy/#respond">  0 </a></p><p class="td-post-text-content td-post-content tagdiv-type"><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a rapid increase in remote therapy and counselling services. Broadly speaking this is beneficial, as studies have found that therapy provided online or over-the-phone is just as effective as in-person therapy, when implemented appropriately. As a licensed psychologist with a lot of experience providing such services even before the pandemic, I believe that understanding the benefits and risks of engaging in remote therapy is paramount in ensuring that we maximize treatment outcomes.</p><p>What are the benefits?</p><p><span>If you are struggling to cope and find it difficult to make in-person appointments, engaging in therapy over-the-phone or through video-conferencing may be greatly beneficial for you. The benefits of therapy or counseling services via telehealth include:</span></p><ul><li>Reduced Commute Time<ul><li>With no need to travel to and from a physical office space, the overall time commitment needed to attend traditional in-person sessions is greatly reduced.</li></ul></li><li>Flexible Scheduling Options<ul><li>Therapists may offer sessions earlier in the morning or later in the evening; and clients can often take a calls or video-conferences to attend sessions during the day.</li></ul></li><li>Accommodate Changes in Plans or Travel<ul><li>Remote access means that you don&#8217;t necessarily need to cancel appointments when plans change, as you can access the session wherever you are&#8212;even when you are traveling.</li></ul></li><li>Improved Continuity of Care<ul><li>The option to attend therapy sessions remotely can also increase adherence to treatment plans, especially for individuals who have busy lives that require flexible scheduling options.</li></ul></li><li>Expand Accessibility of Services<ul><li>Psychological services and specialties offered remotely can greatly increase access to care for those who live in areas where such services are not readily available in-person.</li></ul></li></ul><p>What are the risks?</p><p>While there are many benefits of telepsychology, it is extremely important to take the time to also discuss the potential risks with your provider. In my experience, planning ahead with your therapist is crucial in optimizing treatment outcomes and minimize risks. These discussions may include the following:</p><ul><li>Therapist License<ul><li>In most jurisdictions, psychotherapy is considered to be provided where the client is located. Therefore, it is important to know where your provider is licensed and the potential risks to engaging in therapy with a provider who is not licensed to practice in your state.</li></ul></li><li>Risks to Confidentiality<ul><li>When engaging in psychotherapy online or over-the-phone, there is a risk that others around you may overhear your conversation. Access to a quiet, private space to attend your sessions and the use of secure technologies can greatly reduce this risk.</li></ul></li><li>Emergency Planning<ul><li>Although unlikely, it is important to talk with your provider about what would happen if you came across a crisis during remote treatment. Who would be contacted? And how would you get help?</li></ul></li><li>Required Technology<ul><li>Remote therapy may require you to be comfortable using the devices and/or apps used to provide services. You should discuss with your provider any reservations you may have about the technology required to attend sessions remotely.</li></ul></li><li>Appropriateness of Remote Care<ul><li>Many psychological services can be provided effectively online or over-the-phone. However, it is ultimately up to you and your provider to decide if it is the right fit for you, given your diagnosis, the nature of topics being discussed in sessions, and your specific circumstances.</li></ul></li></ul><p>How do I find Online Therapy?</p><p>With the ongoing global pandemic, many therapists are now offering mental health care through telehealth, but not everyone has had extensive training in this area of practice. Ideally, clients seeking remote psychotherapy or counseling services should pursue therapists that are experienced in providing such services, particularly if they are considering taking part in therapy via telehealth in the long-term. Often providers list their availability for remote therapy services on their websites or on their directory profiles. I encourage anyone who is interested in online therapy to reach out to those providers in their area to ask about their experience with and options for telehealth and discuss the applicable risks and benefits of online therapy and counseling services with them directly.</p><h6><span>About Dr. Tanaka &amp; Coronado Psych</span></h6><h6><span>Dr. Rika Tanaka (PSY30925) is a licensed psychologist and founder of Coronado Psych.

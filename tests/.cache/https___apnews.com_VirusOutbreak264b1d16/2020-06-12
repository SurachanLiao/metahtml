A clue comes from the first 39 patients treated at New York’s Mount Sinai Hospital. Researchers compared each plasma recipient to four other COVID-19 patients who didn't get plasma but were the same age, just as sick and being given the same amount of oxygen. People who received plasma before needing a ventilator were less likely to die than non-plasma recipients, said Dr. Sean Liu, the study’s lead author. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We really tried to target patients who were early in their course, preferably within the first one to two weeks of their disease,” Liu said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Being a doctor during this time, you just feel helpless,” Liu added, stressing that more rigorous study was needed but he was glad to have tried this first-step research. “Watching people die is, it's heartbreaking. It's scary and it's heartbreaking.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>But results of the first strictly controlled study were disappointing. Hospitals in the hard-hit Chinese city of Wuhan were comparing severely ill patients randomly assigned to receive plasma or regular care, but ran out of new patients when the virus waned. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>With only half of the 200 planned patients enrolled, more plasma recipients survived but researchers couldn't tell if it was a real difference or coincidence, according to a report in the Journal of the American Medical Association last week.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>The real proof will come from ongoing, strict studies that compare patients assigned to get either survivor plasma or a dummy treatment.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>Further complicating the search for answers, COVID-19 survivors harbor widely varying levels of antibodies.

The antibodies float in plasma — the yellowish, liquid part of blood. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>Because it takes a few weeks for antibodies to form, the hope is that transfusing someone else’s antibodies could help patients fight the virus before their own immune system kicks in. One donation is typically divided into two or three treatments. Donations also can be combined into a high-dose product; manufacturer Grifols is producing doses of that “hyperimmune globulin” for a study expected to start next month.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>And as more people survive COVID-19, there are increasing calls for them to \u003ca href=\"https://thefightisinus.org\">donate\u003c/a> plasma so there's enough of a stockpile if it pans out. On Friday, U.S. health officials notified doctors that it doesn't violate health privacy rules to track down prior COVID-19 patients and tell them about donation options.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>Convalescent plasma seems safe to use, Dr. Michael Joyner of the Mayo Clinic reported last month. His team tracked the first 5,000 plasma recipients in a Food and Drug Administration-sponsored program that helps hospitals use the experimental treatment, and found few serious side effects.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>Does it help recovery? A clue comes from the first 39 patients treated at New York’s Mount Sinai Hospital. Researchers compared each plasma recipient to four other COVID-19 patients who didn't get plasma but were the same age, just as sick and being given the same amount of oxygen. People who received plasma before needing a ventilator were less likely to die than non-plasma recipients, said Dr. Sean Liu, the study’s lead author. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We really tried to target patients who were early in their course, preferably within the first one to two weeks of their disease,” Liu said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Being a doctor during this time, you just feel helpless,” Liu added, stressing that more rigorous study was needed but he was glad to have tried this first-step research. “Watching people die is, it's heartbreaking. It's scary and it's heartbreaking.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>But results of the first strictly controlled study were disappointing. Hospitals in the hard-hit Chinese city of Wuhan were comparing severely ill patients randomly assigned to receive plasma or regular care, but ran out of new patients when the virus waned. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>With only half of the 200 planned patients enrolled, more plasma recipients survived but researchers couldn't tell if it was a real difference or coincidence, according to a report in the Journal of the American Medical Association last week.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>The real proof will come from ongoing, strict studies that compare patients assigned to get either survivor plasma or a dummy treatment.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>Further complicating the search for answers, COVID-19 survivors harbor widely varying levels of antibodies.

It was my last night in town and it pained me to leave her, but we kept up an exchange of flirtatious messages. When I flew back across the Atlantic to cover the World Cup, Luisa met me — on June 2, technically our first date. She, too, was covering the tournament.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>We started to fall for one another. We rode in sleeper cars between Moscow, St. Petersburg, Kazan, Saransk. Then things got complicated.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>Luisa, alone in her Madrid apartment, read her pregnancy test results and texted a picture to me, alone in Sao Paulo. That was the first of several sleepless nights and long phone conversations.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>She didn’t want to give up freelancing for a Brazilian TV station. I didn’t want to quit my job. She didn’t want to ditch Spain. I didn’t want to disconnect from home. We were apprehensive. We were in love.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>We decided I’d work in Spain until she gave birth and later we’d return to Brazil, where our families could help.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>Luisa and I were still finding each other’s foibles when we moved into our Sao Paulo apartment last September with 5-month-old Carolina. Luisa struggled most with the transition, because her workday was still tuned to Madrid time — a night shift from 2 a.m. to 10 a.m. We shared the same bed at different times of day. She was only halfway here.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>Her contract's end in mid-May provided some relief: No longer would she leave home and risk COVID-19 infection. But we were also in the epicenter of Latin America’s hardest-hit country, and she was losing her health care.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>It was time to get hitched.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>We wanted a marriage with loved ones present, but ceremonies were prohibited in Sao Paulo to avoid spreading the virus. A friend told me about notaries public who, for $200, would come to your home, collect your signatures and sort out the bureaucracy for a union. Marriage could wait until after the pandemic, Luisa and I reasoned, when we could do it properly.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>We scheduled the visit as soon as possible: three weeks later. Turns out such house calls are in high demand during this pandemic. Ample time in quarantine allowed our imaginations to wander. What if Luisa were infected and needed treatment in the overwhelmed public hospitals on the city’s outskirts? I wrote about Brazilians struggling to find treatment and willed myself to avoid thinking Luisa might soon be among them.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>Having an infant helped prevent us from dwelling on such concerns or, for that matter, sleeping. When the notary arrived May 28, he caught us completely off guard ... and wearing yoga pants. Carolina watched cartoons as we signed the paperwork. The stamped document arrived later that day.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>Government recognition of our union grants Luisa certain rights, including access to my healthcare, but our status remains “single” — and will until we sign our marriage contract.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>After crisscrossing an ocean to sync up, we’re still not fully together.

The antibodies float in plasma — the yellowish, liquid part of blood. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>Because it takes a few weeks for antibodies to form, the hope is that transfusing someone else’s antibodies could help patients fight the virus before their own immune system kicks in. One donation is typically divided into two or three treatments. Donations also can be combined into a high-dose product; manufacturer Grifols is producing doses of that “hyperimmune globulin” for a study expected to start next month.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>And as more people survive COVID-19, there are increasing calls for them to \u003ca href=\"https://thefightisinus.org\">donate\u003c/a> plasma so there's enough of a stockpile if it pans out. On Friday, U.S. health officials notified doctors that it doesn't violate health privacy rules to track down prior COVID-19 patients and tell them about donation options.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>Convalescent plasma seems safe to use, Dr. Michael Joyner of the Mayo Clinic reported last month. His team tracked the first 5,000 plasma recipients in a Food and Drug Administration-sponsored program that helps hospitals use the experimental treatment, and found few serious side effects.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>Does it help recovery? A clue comes from the first 39 patients treated at New York’s Mount Sinai Hospital. Researchers compared each plasma recipient to four other COVID-19 patients who didn't get plasma but were the same age, just as sick and being given the same amount of oxygen. People who received plasma before needing a ventilator were less likely to die than non-plasma recipients, said Dr. Sean Liu, the study’s lead author. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We really tried to target patients who were early in their course, preferably within the first one to two weeks of their disease,” Liu said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Being a doctor during this time, you just feel helpless,” Liu added, stressing that more rigorous study was needed but he was glad to have tried this first-step research. “Watching people die is, it's heartbreaking. It's scary and it's heartbreaking.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>But results of the first strictly controlled study were disappointing. Hospitals in the hard-hit Chinese city of Wuhan were comparing severely ill patients randomly assigned to receive plasma or regular care, but ran out of new patients when the virus waned. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>With only half of the 200 planned patients enrolled, more plasma recipients survived but researchers couldn't tell if it was a real difference or coincidence, according to a report in the Journal of the American Medical Association last week.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>The real proof will come from ongoing, strict studies that compare patients assigned to get either survivor plasma or a dummy treatment.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>Further complicating the search for answers, COVID-19 survivors harbor widely varying levels of antibodies.

We would have liked for this to work,” said the study leader, Dr. David Boulware, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Minnesota. “But our objective was to answer the question and to conduct a high-quality study,” because the evidence on the drug so far has been inconclusive, he said.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Hydroxychloroquine and a similar drug, chloroquine, have been the subject of much debate since Trump started promoting them in March. Hydroxychloroquine has long been used for malaria, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, but no large studies have shown it or chloroquine to be safe or effective for much sicker patients with coronavirus, and some studies have suggested the drugs may do harm. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"related-story-embed\" id=\"b40af7e0-91f0-11ea-c773-f3528ec74e77\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Trump took a two-week course of hydroxychloroquine, along with zinc and Vitamin D, after two staffers tested positive for COVID-19, and had no ill effects, according to results of his latest physical released by his doctor Wednesday. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Federal regulators have warned against hydroxychloroquine's use except in hospitals and formal studies because of the risk of side effects, especially heart rhythm problems.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Boulware’s study involved 821 people in the United States and Canada living with someone diagnosed with COVID-19 or at high risk of getting it because of their job -- doctors, nurses, ambulance workers who had significant exposure to a sick patient while not wearing full protective gear.\u003c/p>\u003cp>They were randomly assigned to get either the nutrient folate as a placebo or hydroxychloroquine for five days, starting within four days of their exposure. Neither they nor others involved in the research knew who was getting which pills.\u003c/p>\u003cp>After 14 days in the study, 12% on the drug developed COVID-19 symptoms versus 14% in the placebo group, but the difference is so small it could have occurred by chance, Boulware said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“There’s basically no effect. It does not prevent infection,” he said of the drug. Even if it were to give some slim advantage, “we’d want a much larger effect” to justify its use and risk of side effects for preventing illness, he said.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Results were no different among a subgroup of participants who were taking zinc or vitamin C, which some people believe might help make hydroxychloroquine more effective or fight the coronavirus.\u003c/p>\u003cp>There are some big caveats: The study enrolled people through the Internet and social media, relying on them to report their own symptoms rather than having them tracked in a formal way by doctors. Participants were not all tested for the coronavirus but were diagnosed as COVID-19 cases based on symptoms in many cases.

The study is finished and results are being analyzed now.\u003c/p>\u003cp>On Tuesday, the journal Lancet posted an “expression of concern” about a study it published earlier this month of nearly 15,000 COVID-19 patients on the malaria drugs that tied their use to a higher risk of dying in the hospital or developing a heartbeat problem. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Scientists have raised serious questions about the database used for that study, and its authors have launched an independent audit. \u003c/p>\u003cp>That work had a big impact: the World Health Organization suspended use of hydroxychloroquine in a study it is leading, and French officials stopped the drug’s use in hospitals.

And she began to cook.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>That is how Dela Peña launched the project she calls Ayuda — help, in Filipino, a language heavily influenced by Spanish colonial rule.

She said she also has a license in food safety. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>But cooking 200 meals a day is a massive undertaking, especially with a 6-year-old, a toddler and a baby at home. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>The finances are dicey; Dela Peña relies on her husband’s modest income from a sales job. But when word of her efforts spread on social media, people began reaching out, dropping off cartons of eggs and bags of rice. An influential Emirati blogger gave her 10,000 dirhams ($2,700).\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>She leans on her housemates, husband and her brother-in-law, who was let go from his job in a tea shop amid the pandemic, to help with buying the groceries, thawing the meats, chopping the food and cooking. Ultimately, though, she’s in charge. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It’s a big thing if you can help like 10 people not to sleep hungry,” she said, as she scooped up cooked rice, fried fish and boiled eggs into containers to distribute. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>Her children’s wagon is used to deliver the meals each day. It is 3 p.m., and sweltering. A sign on a cardboard box announces: “FREE!!! FOOD FOR EVERYONE.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>Some people walk 45 minutes for one of Dela Peña’s meals. While most hail from the Philippines, there are also Africans, South Asians and others. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>Six Filipino women, who come every day, said they haven’t worked or been paid since March when they lost their sales jobs. One of the women, Emma Moraga, said she heard about the meals on social media.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It’s good, because they can help a lot of people,” Moraga said. “One meal a day, it’s big help.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>The crowd lines up. “Social distancing!” Dela Peña says, repeatedly. Mostly, though, people are standing apart and everyone is wearing masks, as is required by law. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>She’s nervous that authorities in Dubai could stop or fine her for violating laws on public gatherings or the distribution of food. But she intends to feed Dubai’s hungry as long as she can.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>“If I will stop this,” Dela Peña said, “many people will stop eating.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>While nonstop news about the effects of the coronavirus has become commonplace, so, too, have tales of kindness. “One Good Thing” is a series of AP stories focusing on glimmers of joy and benevolence in a dark time.

Almost from one day to the next, the city’s Cinquantenaire park was filled with people lured by sunny skies and warm temperatures in the normally rainy European capital. After not being permitted to loiter in the park under lockdown, which started March 13, people spread out blankets and chatted, listened to music and sipped refreshments at the first whiff of freedom. Nearby, the sportier played volleyball, soccer and Frisbee. Very few wore masks -- as if to say, after two months of restrictions, we have no fear. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>When Madrid’s Retiro park reopened following a two-month closure, a Bolivian woman in traditional dress joined a friend for a picture-taking outing. One of the world’s strictest lockdowns went into place in mid-March in Spain, the second country after Italy to be overwhelmed by the coronavirus. While most of the country is entering a so-called Phase 2 — permitting indoor restaurant service and larger gatherings — bigger cities like Madrid and Barcelona still face more restrictions.\u003c/p>\u003cp>So, when people gathered on a beach in Barcelona, police officers were patrolling to ensure that social distancing was observed. Under their gaze, people sunbathed, stretched and waded into the surf. An officer wore a mask and latex gloves; beachgoers had very little obvious protection, perhaps just some SPF. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Everyone knows it takes two to tango -- but German rules only allow tango partners to touch if they are real-life partners off the dance floor. Even though dance studios opened Berlin on June 2, Tango lovers must dance alone, or maintain 1½-meter (5-foot) distance from their partners. That simply doesn’t work, as demonstrated June 3 in a peaceful, rhythmic protest outside the German Chancellery. \u003c/p>\u003cp>During a sundown walk in the southern French port city of Marseille, four Arabic-speaking girls pose in matching dresses of satiny bodices and tulle skirts. What better way to celebrate freedom than dressing for the occasion, as a smiling mother guides the little one in silver sandals into place for a photo on March 26. Though French residents were allowed to circulate freely by then, cafes nearby residential streets were free of traffic and cafes were shuttered. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>In the capital, Paris, a return to ‘’real life’’ was marked a week later by the opening of the famed French institution: the café. Tiny round tables that spent months in stacks were spread out at a new generous distance of one-meter (three feet). Celebrating the new era on June 2, people gathered in chatty cliques, scooching extra chairs around the tiny tables, with colorful drinks glinting in the slanting sunshine. Masks were not de rigueur. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Italians were the first Europeans to go under lockdown in early March. Measures only began to ease in early May with more freedom of movement locally, followed by a gradual opening of shops, bars and restaurants. One of the first museums to reopen was the Galleria Borghese in Rome with its famed statuary collection. Without the usual rush of tourists, visitors have been able to take in the art in relative solitude -- with just 80 people allowed in at a time. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Greece has been relatively untouched by the virus -- with just 180 deaths -- and wants to keep it that way. An early lockdown is credited with protecting the population, and the government is only gradually opening to foreign tourists. \u003c/p>\u003cp>That means lonely times for a street performer in central Athens. Walking on stilts, he reached for a flower from a tree in full spring bloom near the National Garden. Only Greeks passed by during a 30-minute period. He said hello and offered a balloon to each passer-by. They returned the greeting -- but declined the balloon, a sign perhaps of wariness of the virus. \u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>While nonstop news about the effects of the coronavirus has become commonplace, so, too, have tales of kindness. “One Good Thing” is a series of AP stories focusing on glimmers of joy and benevolence in a dark time.

In recent weeks, I've been sharing videos with friends and family on social media. Now I'm getting requests — including “Wheels on the Bus” from my great-nephew.

But as my anxiety starts to rise again, I will go to my piano and calmly sit down. I will think for a moment about what to play.

(AP) — After 60-plus days, I threw in the towel. Mr. Rich had to go.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>Mr. Rich is a hamster who most recently served as the classroom pet in my 9-year-old’s science class. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>In normal times, kids clamor over who gets to be its caretaker over holiday and school breaks. My daughter Claire, shut out over the winter holidays, volunteered in January to take Mr. Rich home over spring break. Then, my biggest worry was how to keep our two pet cats from eating him for a week.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>Flash forward to March 12, where the news kept tumbling all afternoon long. Arkansas was shutting down schools in a handful of counties, essentially adding an extra week to spring break. My 5-year-old’s preschool was following suit.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>As I got ready to pick up my kids, my head swimming with how we would manage childcare while also working, my phone rang. The caller ID showed it was my older daughter’s school. As all parents know, that’s never good.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Mom? I’m not in trouble,” Claire began, “but is it OK if we bring home Mr. Rich today?”\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>That’s right. The hamster.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>We loaded up Claire’s backpack with Mr. Rich’s food and bedding. Claire marched outside carrying his cage, the envy of all the third-graders. We were lacking a key fact at that moment: We didn't know that we were leaving for the rest of the school year.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>At home, the cats never noticed Mr. Rich and he provided a pleasant diversion, something for me to document on social media while I tried not to spin into a pit of anxiety over the impossibility of working from home (and doing it well) and caring for my children (and doing it well.) \u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>At least a dozen friends sent me this meme: “Somewhere out there there’s a kid that brought home the class hamster for the weekend. Their parents are not happy!!” \u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>We were happy. For a while. This all felt doable when we naively believed an end was in sight.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>But the uncertainty dragged on. K-12 schools in Arkansas shut down for the remainder of the academic year. Our summer plans went poof. My 5-year-old will never return to her preschool. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>And the novelty of Mr. Rich faded, much like the chalk rainbows that once brightened our neighborhood back in March.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>Now Claire has to be repeatedly reminded to clean Mr. Rich’s cage. The fragrance of hamster lingers. The 5-year-old loves on him a little too aggressively. We are tired.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>“How long can we keep doing this?” I ask myself. Sometimes I mean socially distanced parenting and homeschooling. Sometimes I mean working from home. Sometimes I mean keeping the kids away from their friends. And yes, sometimes I mean hamster ownership.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>I gave up. I emailed Claire’s teacher to coordinate a hamster handoff as the school year wrapped up. We bid Mr. Rich a fond farewell, putting at least one tiny bookend on a time that seems unknowable and endless. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>We can only hope that this fall, there's a classroom — with schoolchildren in it — to welcome him home. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/VirusDiary\">Virus Diary,\u003c/a> an occasional feature, showcases the coronavirus saga through the eyes of Associated Press journalists around the world.

Anisha Khanna and her mother, Kamlesh Khanna, operated a pediatric practice out of the family’s home in Glen Ridge, New Jersey, about 12 miles west of New York City. Eldest daughter Sughanda Khanna lives in Maryland and is an emergency-room physician, and Satyender Khanna was a practicing surgeon for more than four decades and was one of the first surgeons in New Jersey to perform laparoscopic surgery. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"hub-link-embed\" id=\"afs:Content:9000761899\">Full Coverage: Lives Lost\u003c/div>\u003cp>The family's influence was illustrated by the fact that one of the doctors who cared for Priya Khanna in her final days had studied under her several years earlier.

New Jersey’s currently thriving Indian community didn’t exist in those days, and Kamlesh struggled to adapt to her new culture and to the challenges of building a pediatric practice in a male-dominated field, all while raising young children. Her husband was always busy. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class='ad-placeholder'>\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"0d3bde3068174551b7876f026e11b541\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“He worked day and night, he took every emergency, every difficult case he could,” she said. “He was a very good father but not like today’s fathers, changing diapers, giving milk to the baby.

Priya considered law or business but decided on medicine and eventually specialized in nephrology, the study of kidney diseases. Anisha followed in Priya's footsteps to nearby Montclair Kimberley Academy and Drew University, and then to medical school in Kansas City. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“Our parents were our inspirations, and I went into my profession because of my mom, who is a very strong woman,” Anisha said. \"But Priya was also someone I looked up to a lot because she was my big sister and she always protected me, and I miss that.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>Satyender began feeling ill in mid-March and a week later was taken by ambulance to Clara Maass Medical Center, a small community hospital in Belleville, outside Newark.

When she worsened, she was taken to the hospital and was put on oxygen. By the time Kasinathan saw her former mentor, Priya was awake but having difficulty breathing and unable to carry on a conversation, though she still managed to send texts to other doctors to check up on some of her patients. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“It was devastating to have someone who had been involved in your training and to see them on the other end,” Kasinathan said. “One of the things about being a doctor is that you know what’s really happening, and I think she was in tune with what the reality of the situation was, that if she went onto a ventilator she wasn’t going to get off it.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"audio-embed\" id=\"afs:Medium:8997152000\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Anisha and her sister and mother were in contact with Priya via FaceTime nearly nonstop the first several days; their father was put on a ventilator within two days of being admitted and was unable to communicate with them as he lay dying. After five days, Priya also was intubated.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The sisters took turns keeping Priya company. Anisha shared storytime with her 3-year-old, and Sughanda asked her to imagine herself at the beach, her favorite place to be. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“She said, ‘Don’t worry, we’re right here, we’re holding your hand, we’re putting your feet in the water, you’re feeling the sun and the sand,’” Anisha said. “I don’t know how much she heard.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Priya spent 10 days on the ventilator and died on April 13, at 43.

He left home a “happy go-lucky” kid who was gung-ho for battle, he said, but the gravity of the war quickly crashed down on him. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"33270a7ac08b4f07b08afb88f595bdae\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“It doesn’t take long that you realize this is not John Wayne movies, this is serious.

Another time, medics were carrying a soldier on a stretcher, when DiPalma realized the injured man was his friend. “Death took him away as I looked back at him,\" he recalled. \u003c/p>\u003cp>After the Allies defeated Germany, DiPalma was sent to Nuremberg, where he was first tasked with making copies of documents detailing Nazi war crimes. Soon, he became a guard at the Nazi's prison cells. Eventually, he was asked to serve a guard in the courtroom, where he stood at the witness box with his arms clasped behind his back while Hitler's deputies were grilled over their atrocities. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"d42388db9b4b4687a5aca052e943a6db\">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>DiPalma found himself face to face with Nazi leaders, including the head of the German Air Force, Hermann Goering. While court was in recess, Goering would often ask DiPalma for a drink of water, so DiPalma would go get him a cup from the water bag down the hall. Goering would turn his nose up and say “Bah, Americanish,\" and give it back, DiPalma recalled. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Tired of his behavior, one day DiPalma filled Goering's cup from with toilet water instead. “Ahhh, gute vasser!\" a smiling Goering said, complimenting the drink, DiPalma wrote. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“I guess I felt it was my little contribution to the war effort,” DiPalma wrote.\u003c/p>\u003cp>DiPalma left Nuremberg in July 1946 and was discharged. Three months later, Goering killed himself hours before he was set to be hanged for his war crimes. \u003c/p>\u003cp>After the war, DiPalma met his future wife, Louise Catelotti, while on a double date. They were supposed to be dating other people but immediately hit it off, his daughter, Emily Aho, said. They raised four girls in East Longmeadow, Massachusetts, and DiPalma \"had his hands full” during their teenage years, Aho said while laughing. Louise DiPalma died of ALS – Lou Gehrig’s disease – in 2006. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"25e8fecbe3344272b427d6cd32a4338a\">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class=\"hub-link-embed\" id=\"afs:Content:8969222165\">Full Coverage: Lives Lost\u003c/div>\u003cp>DiPalma worked as a crane operator and a volunteer firefighter for their small town and enjoyed hunting, gardening, fishing and spending time at their beach house in Connecticut during the summer. He rarely talked about his days in the war, Aho said, but his wartime experiences left a lasting impact on how he saw others. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“It made me a little bit leery of everybody ... When I came back, I never trusted anybody,\" he said in the military museum interview. \"And I think that has made me a better person. It tells you what the real world is, rather than a bowl of cherries,” he said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Aho convinced her father to come with her to Germany in 2000 while she was doing research for a book she was writing. At the Palace of Justice, he excitedly showed her around and was \"like a kid again,” Aho recalled. They sat down in the courtroom and footage from the trials began playing showing a young DiPalma standing guard over Goering in the witness box. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“I just sat there and cried,” his daughter said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>After they returned home, she bought him a tape recorder for his 75th birthday and used those recordings to help him craft his memoir, titled “Just a Kid: A Guard at the Nuremberg Trials.\" \u003c/p>\u003cp>DiPalma sometimes struggled to talk about some things he saw, but he believed it was important for it not to be forgotten, Aho said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“He

He listened to audiobooks constantly and closely followed the news. He devoured history and was quick with facts on U.S. presidents. He was humble. He won a Bronze Star, but his family only found out how decorated a soldier he was when he was gone. He was a longtime U.S. Postal Service employee who rose to become a town postmaster. He was sharp as a tack and liked to deem things “snazzy” or “classy.” On his last night, the nurses gave him chocolate ice cream and showed him photos of some young relatives. And by dawn, he was gone. \u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"f954aad33cf148588a2e0d92d47a117e\">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class=\"audio-embed\" id=\"afs:Medium:8961530022\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Constance Pinard, 73, had a life with struggles: A marriage gone sour, the pressures of raising two children on her own, family rifts that grew worse with an aggressive case of dementia. But there were so many joys, too: The miles she drove in her Jeep or flew in the air to reach new places as a travel nurse, the rank of captain she achieved, the thrill of meeting Barry Manilow, the musician she loved. Her sister Tammy Petrowicz remembers a woman overflowing with energy “like the Energizer Bunny,” who was 16 years older but “still could run circles around me.” The Air Force veteran loved meeting new people wherever she went. Petrowicz recalls standing in a grocery store line with her, chit-chatting with strangers like they were old friends. “She talked to anybody and everybody,” her sister says.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"1bebb1ac605d4aee990da0bda02fb735\">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class=\"audio-embed\" id=\"afs:Medium:8975830254\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>James Sullivan, 99, grew up with nothing and appreciated everything, a consummate gentleman who found joy in the small things — the Red Sox on TV, a cold Bud Light in his hand, a fresh tomato out of the garden. Sullivan was an artillery technician in the Army during World War II who won the Bronze Star. He had a mischievous side, as evidenced by the time his father told him he couldn’t play ball because he had to paint the garage. He obliged, painting it top to bottom, windowpanes and all. He was a liquor store clerk, a school custodian and a city councilman, a man who always beamed with a smile right up to the end of his life. He died four days shy of his 100th birthday. Quiet, unselfish, inquisitive about others. “How you doing, pal?” he’d ask. Whenever someone would ask him the same, he offered something similar: “Never had a bad day.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"e413cdc770ef4726b5fa233762159550\">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class=\"audio-embed\" id=\"afs:Medium:8947613482\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Charles Lowell, 78, was a missile guide technician and an IBM operations manager, a Masonic lodge master and town selectman, a volunteer firefighter and paramedic. Along the way, his life was littered with good deeds — the troubled teenager he’d take in, the hungry family he’d help with groceries — done with little notice or unmentioned altogether. “He didn’t tell people things like that,” his daughter Susan Kenney says. She remembers a father always teaching her something new and always trying to make people laugh, something his wife, Alice Lowell, says his colleagues appreciated. “It wasn’t like going to work,” she says of the man she knew since she was a child. “It was going to play with Chuck.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"08933703c58944fe99821f9afe3b684b\">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class=\"audio-embed\" id=\"afs:Medium:8966800115\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Stephen Kulig, 92, always had a smile on his face and hard candies in his pocket. The list of roles he played was long: veteran of World War II and Korea, devoted Boston sports fan, bingo caller, school dance chaperone, altar server, soup kitchen volunteer, Knights of Columbus member. His daughter Elizabeth DeForest remembers a man who was a natural caregiver — for his wife of 63 years, for his five children and for his parents and in-laws. “I use the word fierce to describe him,” DeForest says. “He was really fiercely proud of his family. He was fierce in the way that he practiced faith and he taught it to our family and to all of us. Just fierce in the way he loved and protected the people that mattered to him.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"b276a88475294aadb88572dc5c68f2e5\">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class=\"audio-embed\" id=\"afs:Medium:8991850026\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Chester LaPlante, 78, had a knack for improving things wherever he went. He restored cars and could repair just about anything, and in the lives of his three children, he was the jack-of-all-trades father who knew how to make them smile. His son Randy LaPlante remembered his father giving him “bear rides” around the living room, rubbing his beard against his little face and buying him a go-kart. Later, the elder LaPlante took his son under his wing and taught him about being a machinist, a career he holds to this day. “I don’t know where I would be without him,” LaPlante says. \u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"66fcd820e96044fc97ee77c6586b0d1f\">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class=\"audio-embed\" id=\"afs:Medium:8951570632\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Harry Malandrinos, 89, was a quiet man, but had many stories to tell: of fighting a war in Korea, of touring the U.S. as a band’s drummer, of four decades as a public school teacher. “When he spoke, you listened, because he didn’t waste his words,” his daughter-in-law Cheryl Malandrinos says. He always had a joke, was a master woodworker, avidly rooted for the Patriots, Red Sox and Bruins and would happily settle for “Family Feud” if his teams weren’t on TV. Every now and again, his son Paul Malandrinos would run into a former student of his father’s who would sing his praises. “He was pretty much the working class guy that represents so many of us,” his daughter-in-law says.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"0b3da69f27f74ce78ccfbab68d945731\">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class=\"audio-embed\" id=\"afs:Medium:8980410016\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Francis Foley, 84, never learned to read music but could play any song by ear. He loved a cup of coffee and something sweet from Dunkin’ Donuts. He kept the nurses at the home laughing. He was fiercely protective of his family. Ask his family about the man they lost, and the words flow easily about the card-carrying union carpenter, Army veteran, devoted husband of 54 years and father of four. “He was strong. He was funny. He was engaging. He was ornery. He was feisty,” his daughter Keri Rutherford says. “He was still full of life. And then within days, he’s gone.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"bf6b7b05d2b24ae09ab442e4afe6c563\">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class=\"audio-embed\" id=\"afs:Medium:8959760122\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Roy Benson, 88, whistled a lilting song throughout his life, one of the things imprinted on the minds of those who loved him, like the way he’d stir sugar into his morning coffee or holler for a visitor to return the minute they stepped out the door. His daughter Robin Benson Wilson calls them “comfort sounds” that signaled “the world is good.” He was a towering 6-foot-4. He made friends easily and often, always finding a familiar face wherever he went. He was a mechanic in the Korean War and it seemed like he could fix anything. With old age, his ability to whistle faded. But during a Christmastime visit by Benson Wilson to the Soldiers’ Home, her father managed to pucker his lips and offer a bit of that familiar tune one last time.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"1385d6c64d994cdab95ae4db4f305998\">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class=\"audio-embed\" id=\"afs:Medium:8949790068\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Emilio DiPalma, 93, had gone off to war as a happy-go-lucky kid, but it didn’t take long for his Hollywood visions of battle to dissolve into the reality of watching friends die. After the Germans were defeated, DiPalma was sent to Nuremberg, where he made copies of documents detailing war crimes, watched over Nazis in their prison cells and stood guard beside the witness box in the courtroom where the evils of genocide were detailed. One time, he filled the glass of one of the most powerful Nazis — Hermann Goring — with toilet water. Back home in the U.S., he lived a life of humility, rarely talking about his service. “He did all of this in World War II and we hardly knew about it,” says his daughter Emily Aho. \u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"746f13b86f7a490caf359f37be26b31f\">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class=\"audio-embed\" id=\"afs:Medium:8978210134\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>James Mandeville, 83, had a playfulness to him that never seemed to fade. With his grandchildren, he’d swim and wrestle and play basketball, even after he started using a wheelchair. He’d play cards with his daughter Laurie Mandeville Beaudette and, if she left the table, she’d return to find the deck had been stacked. She took to calling him “Cheater Beater.” He found joy in babies and dogs and for all his fun-lovingness, he imparted something deep in those who were close to him. “He always made me feel like I was the most important person in the world,” she says. “We were best friends.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"e12cec7ae0364d24bcbbbec8f58a4597\">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class=\"audio-embed\" id=\"afs:Medium:8970210347\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Samuel Melendez, 86, would clam up and appear sad when someone would ask about his time in Korea. But he was affectionate and easygoing, a man who’d let a young relative have a seat on his lap or give them a dollar from his pocket, which made them feel rich. He loved the island of his heritage, Puerto Rico. He loved dominoes and family gatherings and would jump on a plane whenever someone needed him. When he became less independent, he went to live with his niece Janet Ramirez and when he needed more help, he moved to the Soldiers’ Home, where she is a nurse’s aide. She lost her own father when she was young and as her uncle grew sicker, Ramirez slipped away to his room to hold his hand or to play Spanish music on her phone and put it to his hear. “I felt like he was my dad,” she says.

Ten towns in the province were immediately locked down to try to contain the spread.

In Wisconsin, several Republican lawmakers have repeatedly demanded that the state’s health services secretary resign, and the state’s conservative Supreme Court ruled 4-3 that she had exceeded her authority by extending a stay-at-home order.\u003c/p>\u003cp>With the increased public scrutiny, security details — like those seen on a federal level for Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top infectious-disease expert — have been assigned to top state health officials, including Georgia’s Dr. Kathleen Toomey after she was threatened. Ohio’s Dr. Amy Acton, who also had a security detail assigned after armed protesters showed up at her home, resigned Thursday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In Orange County, in late May, nearly 100 people attended a county supervisors meeting, waiting hours to speak against an order requiring face coverings. One person suggested that the order might make it necessary to invoke Second Amendment rights to bear arms, while another read aloud the home address of the order’s author, the county’s chief health officer, Dr. Nichole Quick, as well as the name of her boyfriend. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Quick, attending by phone, left the meeting. In a statement, the sheriff’s office later said Quick had expressed concern for her safety following “several threatening statements both in public comment and online.” She was given personal protection by the sheriff.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But Monday, after yet another public meeting that included criticism from members of the board of supervisors, Quick resigned. She could not be reached for comment. Earlier, the county’s deputy director of public health services, David Souleles, retired abruptly. \u003c/p>\u003cp>An official in another California county also has been given a security detail, said Kat DeBurgh, the executive director of the Health Officers Association of California, declining to name the county or official because the threats have not been made public. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Many local health leaders, accustomed to relative anonymity as they work to protect the public’s health, have been shocked by the growing threats, said Theresa Anselmo, the executive director of the Colorado Association of Local Public Health Officials.\u003c/p>\u003cp>After polling local health directors across the state at a meeting last month, Anselmo found about 80% said they or their personal property had been threatened since the pandemic began. About 80% also said they’d encountered threats to pull funding from their department or other forms of political pressure. \u003c/p>\u003cp>To Anselmo, the ugly politics and threats are a result of the politicization of the pandemic from the start. So far in Colorado, six top local health officials have retired, resigned or been fired. A handful of state and local health department staff members have left as well, she said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It’s just appalling that in this country that spends as much as we do on health care that we’re facing these really difficult ethical dilemmas: Do I stay in my job and risk threats, or do I leave because it’s not worth it?” Anselmo asked.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In California, senior health officials from seven counties, including Quick and Souleles, have resigned or retired since March 15. Dr. Charity Dean, the second in command at the state Department of Public Health, submitted her resignation June 4. Burnout seems to be contributing to many of those decisions, DeBurgh said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>In addition to the harm to current officers, DeBurgh is worried about the impact these events will have on recruiting people into public health leadership. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“It’s disheartening to see people who disagree with the order go from attacking the order to attacking the officer to questioning their motivation, expertise and patriotism,” said DeBurgh. “That’s not something that should ever happen.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>Some of the online abuse has been going on for years, said Bill Snook, a spokesperson for the health department in Kansas City, Missouri. He has seen instances in which people took a health inspector’s name and made a meme out of it, or said a health worker should be strung up or killed. He said opponents of vaccinations, known as anti-vaxxers, have called staffers “baby killers.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>The pandemic, though, has brought such behavior to another level.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In Ohio, the Delaware General Health District has had two lockdowns since the pandemic began — one after an angry individual came to the health department. Fortunately, the doors were locked, said Dustin Kent, program manager for the department’s residential services unit.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Angry calls over contact tracing continue to pour in, Kent said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>In Colorado, the Tri-County Health Department, which serves Adams, Arapahoe and Douglas counties near Denver, has also been getting hundreds of calls and emails from frustrated citizens, deputy director Jennifer Ludwig said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Some have been angry their businesses could not open and blamed the health department for depriving them of their livelihood. Others were furious with neighbors who were not wearing masks outside. It’s a constant wave of “confusion and angst and anxiety and anger,” she said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Then in April and May, rocks were thrown at one of their office’s windows — \u003ca href=\"https://denver.cbslocal.com/2020/05/20/daniel-pesch-tri-county-health-department-vandalism-suspect/\">three separate times.\u003c/a> The office was tagged with obscene graffiti. The department also received an email calling members of the department “tyrants,” adding “you’re about to start a hot-shooting ... civil war.” Health department workers decamped to another office.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Although the police determined there was no imminent threat, Ludwig stressed how proud she was of her staff, who weathered the pressure while working round-the-clock. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“It does wear on you, but at the same time, we know what we need to do to keep moving to keep our community safe,” she said. “Despite the complaints, the grievances, the threats, the vandalism — the staff have really excelled and stood up.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The threats didn’t end there, however: Someone asked on the health department’s Facebook page how many people would like to know the home addresses of the Tri-County Health Department leadership. “You want to make this a war??? No problem,” the poster wrote.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Back in Colorado’s Rio Grande County, some members of the community have rallied in support of Brown with \u003ca href=\"https://southforktines.com/article/county-hears-public-comment-on-public-health-director\">public comments\u003c/a> and a \u003ca href=\"https://montevistajournal.com/article/letter-to-the-editor-to-the-board-of-rio-grande-county-commissioners?fbclid=IwAR0SHMMW2YYFzRy5rTSoWroGB1FYu8IzglJwoJQ9oz4IxWk3-RePuT0dHO4\">letter to the editor \u003c/a> of a local paper. Meanwhile, COVID-19 case counts have jumped from 14 to 49 as of Wednesday. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Brown is grappling with what she should do next: Dive back into another strenuous public health job in a pandemic or take a moment to recoup?\u003c/p>\u003cp>When she told her 6-year-old son she no longer had a job, he responded: “Good, now you can spend more time with us.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Michelle R.

American aircraft carriers are patrolling the Indo-Pacific waters, a massive show of naval force in a region roiled by spiking tensions between the U.S. and China and a sign that the Navy has bounced back from the worst days of \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak\">the coronavirus outbreak\u003c/a>. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>The unusual simultaneous appearance of the three warships, accompanied by Navy cruisers, destroyers, fighter jets and other aircraft, comes as the U.S. escalates \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/211f49062091f5f9c80980910c32d6cb\">criticism of

campaign to militarize human-made islands in the South China Sea.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>“There have been some indications in Chinese writings that the United States was hit hard by COVID-19, that military preparedness was low, so perhaps there is an effort by the United States to signal China that it should not miscalculate,” said Bonnie Glaser, director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “The Chinese will definitely portray this as an example of U.S. provocations, and as evidence that the U.S. is a source of instability in the region.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>President Donald Trump, criticized for \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/1b92ce21f8ddf7eefb634b92fee38fed\">his own handling of the coronavirus outbreak\u003c/a>, has condemned China for what he sees as \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/68a9e1b91de4ffc166acd6012d82c2f9\">a failure to adequately warn the world\u003c/a> about the COVID-19

This week, however, Navy commanders said they were able to take advantage of the timing, particularly during this period of great power competition with China.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>The U.S. national defense strategy cites China as a top security concern, and Pentagon leaders have been working to shift more resources and military assets to the region to battle what they see is Beijing's growing economic influence and military might.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The ability to be present in a strong way is part of the competition. And as I always tell my guys here, you’ve got to be present to win when you’re competing,” said Rear Adm. Stephen Koehler, director of operations at Indo-Pacific Command. “Carriers and carrier strike groups writ large are phenomenal symbols of American naval power. I really am pretty fired up that we’ve got three of them at the moment.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>Speaking to The Associated Press from his office in Hawaii, Koehler said China is slowly and methodically building up \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/0f9aa6f0150baaa7b795bf3e53653c2d\">military outposts in the South China Sea\u003c/a>, putting missile and electronic warfare systems on them. The U.S. and other allies and partners in the region have beefed up operations near the human-made islands to try to blunt China's development, but none of that has appeared to work.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>Koehler said that most recently China deployed aircraft to Fiery Cross Reef in the Spratly Islands and is now operating them out of there.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>On Thursday, the strike group warships were spread out across the Indo-Pacific. The USS Theodore Roosevelt and its strike group are operating in the Philippine Sea near Guam. The USS Nimitz strike group is in the Pacific off the U.S. West Coast. The USS Ronald Reagan has left port in Japan and is operating in the Philippine Sea south of there. Navy commanders were quick to point out that dozens of other Navy ships had been operating around the Pacific, but the three strike groups put a bit of an exclamation point on America's commitment to the region and its allies.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Roosevelt has just returned to duty after spending more than two months sidelined in Guam with a massive COVID-19 outbreak among its crew. And small numbers of sailors on the Nimitz and the Reagan tested positive for the virus, triggering quarantines and extensive new health and safety procedures that had to be instituted before the ships could deploy. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>As they deploy, sailors' daily lives on the ships and to some degree their operations at sea have been altered by the virus and the new precautions they must take to ensure the ships remain clear of infection and able to continue operations.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>Onboard the Nimitz, Rear Adm. Jim Kirk said there have been no positive cases of the virus on the ship since it set out, and he is confident of all the changes put in place to keep it that way. On the Nimitz and the other Pacific ships, crew members are screened daily, they wear masks where needed, meal hours have been extended to allow for more social distancing, and specific routes are designated on the ship to prevent sailors from bumping into one another in the narrow passageways and stairs.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>“As we head out to stand the watch, the message that I have is that this is the end of the beginning” for the crew, said Kirk, commander of Carrier Strike Group 11. “Now it’s time to go about doing our job to the best of our abilities.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>Koehler said the ships will continue to work with allies and partners in the region, conducting exercises at sea and patrolling contested regions. One key change, however, will be their ability to stop in foreign ports. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>The port visits have been largely curtailed, except to carefully pick up supplies when necessary. Guam has been designated the only safe harbor for port stops in the Pacific so far, and sailors have only limited freedom to go to the pier and cannot travel freely in the city. Navy leaders are looking into establishing other safe havens but haven't approved them yet.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>\u003cp>This is, said Koehler, “the new normal.” And he said that while it's not likely there will be three carrier strike groups consistently in the Pacific over the long term, “it's something we can do when we want to.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>\n\u003c/p>","embedCaption":null,"sequenceNumber":null,"title":"US--United States-China-Navy","headline":"US naval buildup in Indo-Pacific seen as warning to China","localMemberName":null,"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:4b372bbcb8ba934a918b5fb06274c95f","notificationId":null,"videoContext":null,"embedLinkURL":null,"bylines":"By LOLITA C.

the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, the letter from aid groups says. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“The long delays in COVID-19 awards — and as a result, U.S. response to a dynamic global emergency — stands in stark contrast to our experience in crises where (the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance) is known to turn around funding in a matter of weeks, if not

vacuum and a lot of chaos on the international level.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>For months while promoting U.S. coronavirus assistance, U.S. officials have not given details on the number of crucial items —

But Nigeria’s government has said none has arrived.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In fact, just 50 ventilators have arrived in Africa from the U.S. government, all of them going to South Africa in recent days.

                        <p>Gawker.com is shutting down today, Monday 22nd August, 2016, some 13 years after it began and two days before the end of my forties. It is the end of an era.

                        <p>Gawker.com will cease operations today. I asked former editors of the site to help us send it off. Thanks for reading, commenting, and tipping. Long live Gawker. &#226;&#128;&#148;AP</p>

                        <p>I often feel guilt when I assign a story. This is partly a function of being a woman who would, if she had her way, please and comfort her entire universe of acquaintances, and partly a function of having been convinced at a relatively young age by the argument that Janet Malcolm famously made in The Journalist and the Murderer: &#226;&#128;&#156;Every journalist who is not too stupid or full of himself to notice what is going on knows that what he does is morally indefensible.&#226;&#128;&#157;

                        <p>Breakups have a way of robbing you of your identity, especially when you&#226;&#128;&#153;re the one who&#226;&#128;&#153;s being broken up with. If the union was worth joining in the first place, severing it disrupts your habits, your decision-making, your system of loving. It erases the mutations your love has engendered. You don&#226;&#128;&#153;t even get to keep them in a jar of formaldehyde. Your best chance at preservation is art.</p>

                        <p>A cool sunset does more for a hot publication&#226;&#128;&#153;s glory than all the sweaty days of its actual word-pushing. As night falls&#226;&#128;&#148;and night always falls, honey&#226;&#128;&#148;plenty of beloveds return and gather round to tamp down the grave. Some come to tap-dance because every media graveyard has sad ghouls.

                        <p>It appears that GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump, typically a fan the huge and dissolute, has been minimizing public perception of his debt.

                        <p>Have you heard? As of next week, beloved  cuck advocacy website Gawker.com  will officially be shutting down thanks to  the machinations of a megalomaniacal seasteading  vampire. It happens! And though it&#226;&#128;&#153;s incredibly unfortunate, there is something you can do to make us feel just a little bit better: Send us Donald Trump&#226;&#128;&#153;s tax returns. </p>

The decision to close Gawker comes days after Univision successfully bid $135 million for Gawker Media&#226;&#128;&#153;s six other websites, and three months after the Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel revealed his  clandestine legal campaign against the company. </p></article><article><p class="item__content">
                     
                    
                        <p>Amid Donald Trump&#226;&#128;&#153;s spasmodic summer, one member of his campaign (and family) has received a growing amount of  positive&#226;&#128;&#148;or at least  not explicitly negative&#226;&#128;&#148;press:  Trump&#226;&#128;&#153;s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Today, however,  Esquire has published a long and excellent profile with lots of good dirt, all about who is this smiling fellow who through his narrow greed and ambition has sold out his faith for a suicide ride on the Trump train.</p>

Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson will visit the state on Thursday to review the federal government&#226;&#128;&#153;s response to what Governor John Bel Edwards called &#226;&#128;&#156;unprecedented&#226;&#128;&#157; flooding.</p>

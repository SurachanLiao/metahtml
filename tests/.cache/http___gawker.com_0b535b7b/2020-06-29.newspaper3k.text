I often feel guilt when I assign a story. This is partly a function of being a woman who would, if she had her way, please and comfort her entire universe of acquaintances, and partly a function of having been convinced at a relatively young age by the argument that Janet Malcolm famously made in The Journalist and the Murderer: âEvery journalist who is not too stupid or full of himself to notice what is going on knows that what he does is morally indefensible.â

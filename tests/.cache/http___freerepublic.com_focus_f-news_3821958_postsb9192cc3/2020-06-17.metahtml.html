<div><p>Recombinant DNA encompasses only one area of genetic engineering; namely, Biospecific biochemical and microbiological to alter,relatively controlled and reasonably predictable manner, the molecules that encode the genetic characteristics of an organism, and to introduce specifically selected new set of genetic Instructions. </p><p>The specific molecular manipulations that are made and the exact methods used to make them can vary widely from one recombinant DNA experiment to another. The basic process,usually involves the Initial isolation or synthesis specific set of chemically identical nucleic acid molecules (usually molecules are then bonded&#133;?) specially prepared vector (carriers) that usually are plasmids. bacteriophages, or other virus-like infectious entities that can self-replicate in appropriate host cells. After the bonding has been completed, the modified can be inserted into bacteria or other cells that have been prepared biochemically to accept them. If the vectors have been &#147;constructed&#148; appropriately, the piece of initially selected DNA can give the recipient new genetic instructions. For Instance, the host cell might be given the capability to synthesise an enzyme that it previously could not make.</p><p>(Excerpt) Read more at <a href="https://www.vigiliae.org/virus-link-to-5g/" target="_blank">vigiliae.org</a> ...</p><p class="b2">

Doesn't speak, doesn't comment, just sits and listens. And so, of course, everyone is thinking only about him," a senior Iraqi official told the New Yorker for a long profile of&#160;the General.</p><p>A survey published in 2018 by IranPoll and the University of Maryland - one of the few considered reliable by analysts - found General Soleimani&#160;had a popularity rating of 83 per cent, beating President Hassan Rouhani and Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif.</p><p>Western leaders saw him as central to Iran's ties with militia groups including Lebanon's Hezbollah and Palestinian Hamas.</p><p>Part of his appeal was the suggestion he might bridge Iran's bitter social divides on issues such as its strict "hijab" clothing rules.</p><p>"If we constantly use terms such as 'bad hijab' and 'good hijab', reformist or conservative ... then who is left?" General Soleimani&#160;said in a speech to mark World Mosque Day in 2017.</p><p>"They are all people. Are all your children religious? Is everybody the same? No, but the father attracts all of them."</p></p></article>

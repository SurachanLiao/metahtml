He could not practice his fiery religious tenets or dress as a cleric in secular Turkey. He left Turkey and settled in the Shia city of Najaf in Iraq. He taught the Iranian population in Najaf of his new ideology. <strong>Khomeini</strong> smuggled his fiery speeches in videotapes into Iran.</p>

<p>Shah Reza pleaded with the Iraqi authorities to contain Khomeini. <strong>Khomeini</strong> was given two options, either denounce his political activities or leave Najaf.

</h1>

<p class="article__content"> <p>BRITAIN will have to live with many of the coronavirus restrictions throughout 2020 as ministers adopt a &#8220;suck it and see&#8221; strategy to slowly see what works.</p> <p>Instead of any clean end to lockdown, senior government figures tonight braced the nation to expect a very long path out of it through the summer and deep into the autumn.</p> <h3>&#9888;&#65039; Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news &amp; updates</h3> <p>It emerged this evening that Downing Street has even banned the term &#8216;exit&#8217; from its own lockdown planning.</p> <p>No10 officials now refer to what happens after the current three week extension that ends on May 7 as &#8220;next phase&#8221;.</p> <p>A &#8220;suck it and see&#8221; plan is now being drawn up based on scientists&#8217; data crunching to see what restrictions to try easing first.</p> <p>One senior figure told The Sun: &#8220;We will try a bit at a time, and then pause, so we can see what effect that has on the transmission rate. The pace will be very gradual".</p> <h2>'SUCK IT AND SEE' PLAN</h2> <p>While a few restrictions may be eased next month, such as allowing some smaller shops to reopen, the PM&#8217;s official spokesman yesterday confirmed there will be no &#8220;wholesale&#8221; lifting of them.</p> <p>There are also plans being drawn up to toughen them in areas where the virus&#8217;s spread is still alarmingly high - with concerns over a lack of face masks and PPE for NHS workers.</p> <p>One Whitehall source said yesterday there are &#8220;three different epidemics right now&#8221;, where the virus is spreading at different rates &#8211; slower in the wider community, but faster in care homes and in hospitals.</p> <p>Two scenarios thought likely by insiders now are schools only returning at the earliest after the half-term break on June 1.</p> </p><p> <p class="article-boxout"><h3 class="article-boxout__headline">Give now to The Sun's NHS appeal</h3><p class="article__content--intro">BRITAIN&#8217;s four million NHS staff are on the frontline in the battle against coronavirus.</p> <p>But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them?</p> <p>The Sun has launched an appeal to raise &#163;1MILLION for NHS workers.</p> <p>The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.</p> <p>We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid-19 Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.</p> <p>The Sun is donating &#163;50,000 and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.</p> <p>No matter how little you can spare, please donate today here</p> <p>www.thesun.co.uk/whocareswinsappeal</p> </p> <p>The other is many people being asked to still work from home into the summer too so crowded public transport can still be avoided.</p> <p>The latest government thinking comes despite the spiralling damage lockdown is doing to the economy.</p> <p>After it emerged recuperating Boris Johnson himself has deep fears about ending the lockdown prematurely, the PM&#8217;s official spokesman said: &#8220;The big concern is a second peak. That is ultimately what will do most damage to health and the economy.</p> <p>&#8220;If you move too quickly, the virus will start to spread exponentially again.</p> <h2>SECOND PEAK 'BIG CONCERN'</h2> <p>&#8220;Lifting social distancing measures wholesale, could lead to the virus spreading exponentially again.&#8221;</p> <p>The quad of senior ministers in charge of the coronavirus fight in the PM&#8217;s absence have tasked the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) to try to work out how the Covid-19 transmission rate is affected by the easing of different measures.</p> <p>SAGE meets again today, chaired by Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance, but it is expected to be &#8220;several weeks&#8221; before enough data is gathered to provide an accurate assessment.</p> <p>As well as their 9.15am meeting, the quad &#8211; Dominic Raab, Michael Gove, Rishi Sunak and Matt Hancock &#8211; also now meet at 6pm daily to discuss the exit strategy.</p> </p><p> <p class="article-boxout"><h3 class="article-boxout__headline">Join our George Cross campaign for NHS staff</h3><p class="article__content--intro">We are urging Sun readers to sign a petition calling for our NHS staff to be awarded the George Cross.</p> <p>We are backing a proposal by Lord Ashcroft to honour our health heroes with the gallantry gong given for acts of bravery that did not take place in battle.</p> <p>A No10 spokesman said: &#8220;The NHS is doing a fantastic job and the nation will want to find a way to say thank you when we have defeated this virus.&#8221;</p> <p>SAS hero Andy McNab added: &#8220;The award of a George Cross would show an emotional appreciation.&#8221;</p> <p>We are asking our readers to please sign the petition below.</p> </p> <p>Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden also said spectator sports events would not be allowed to reopen any time soon, with stadiums now likely to be closed until the Autumn at least.</p> <p>He said: &#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t expect us to permit mass gatherings at a first stage&#8221;.</p> <p>Mr Dowden dubbed easing restrictions too early as &#8220;the worst thing we could possibly do&#8221; as a second peak would send the country &#8220;right back to square one again&#8221;.</p> <p>That would spark the need for &#8220;potentially even more draconian measures&#8221;, he added.</p> <p>Mr Dowden went on: &#8220;We said right at the beginning of this, and the Prime Minister said, he expected the peak to last around three months.</p> <p>&#8220;What&#8217;s happened is consistent with that.&#8221;</p> <p>It emerged yesterday that Britain&#8217;s coronavirus strategy is now closest to France&#8217;s, which has a similar infection path.</p> <p>On Sunday night, French Prime Minister &#201;douard Philippe announced that cafes and restaurants will remain closed for months and masks are likely to become mandatory on public transport.</p> <p>While saying supermarkets can reopen next month, Mr Phillipe added: &#8220;Our life from May 11 will not be like our life before, not immediately, and probably not for a long time.</p> <p>"We'll have to learn to live with the virus."</p> <p>Former Chancellor Philip Hammond tonight warned he expects Britain will suffer a &#8220;U shaped&#8221; Covid economic slowdown.</p> <p>And he urged ministers to spell out to businesses how they may ease the lockdown to help the economy bounce back as best it can.</p> <p>He told a Chatham House webinar: &#8220;I think those forecasting a V shape recovery are probably erring on the side of optimism.</p> <p>&#8220;I suspect it is more likely that it will be something of a U-shape recovery.</p> <p class="teaser-slug"><span class="teaser-slug__copy t-p-background-color">Breaking</span></p><p class="rail__item-content"><span class="rail__item-sub"><h3 class="rail__item-headline t-p-color">HIDDEN DEATHS</h3>UK virus deaths may be 40% higher than reported in shock new figures</span></p><p class="rail__item-content"><span class="rail__item-sub"><h3 class="rail__item-headline t-p-color">'BEAUTIFUL ANGEL'</h3>Woman becomes Britain's first hospital cleaner to die from coronavirus</span></p><p class="rail__item-content"><span class="rail__item-sub"><h3 class="rail__item-headline t-p-color">PAINFUL TRUTHS</h3>From Megxit to Frogmore, the stories Meg &amp;

<p>Caltech posted video of a stable plasma torus, created by engineers using water and a dielectric plate: "<a href="http://www.caltech.edu/news/engineers-create-stable-plasma-ring-open-air-80367">lightning in a bottle, but without the bottle.</a>" </p>

In addition, engineers working with the plasma noticed that their cell phones encountered high levels of radio frequency noise&#8212;static&#8212;while they were in the same room as the experiment. It turns out that the plasma ring emits distinct radio frequencies. "That's never been seen before. We think it's because of the piezo properties of the materials that we used in our experiments," Pereira says, referring to the materials' ability to be electrically polarized through mechanical stress&#8212;in this case, the flowing of water.</p></blockquote>
<p>They've got no idea what it might be useful for, but have already filed a patent on the method for genereating the torus. Commercial proposal: a pretty random number generator to replace the lava lamps in Cloudflare's HQ. <a href="https://boingboing.net/2017/12/31/watch-video-of-a-stable-plasm.html" class="read-more">Read the rest </a></p>

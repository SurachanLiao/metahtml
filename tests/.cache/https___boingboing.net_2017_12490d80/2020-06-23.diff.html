Pantaleo was not charged with a crime despite the death being ruled a homicide, and video of the attack being recorded by a bystander. The NYPD settled the family's lawsuit for $5.9m to avoid a civil trial. </ins></p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><ins>Activist Erica Garner has passed away, according to tweets from her official account.

It turns out that the plasma ring emits distinct radio frequencies. "That's never been seen before. We think it's because of the piezo properties of the materials that we used in our experiments," Pereira says, referring to the materials' ability to be electrically polarized through mechanical stress—in this case, the flowing of water.</del></p></blockquote><del> </del><p><del>They've got no idea what it might be useful for, but have already filed a patent on the method for genereating the torus.

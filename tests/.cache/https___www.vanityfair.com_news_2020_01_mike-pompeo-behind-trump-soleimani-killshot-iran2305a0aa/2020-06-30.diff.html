He has been known to take foreign leaders <a class="external-link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/02/28/putin-kim-jong-un-trump-has-habit-taking-foreign-autocrats-their-word/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">at their word</a>, is a <a class="external-link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/23/opinions/in-trump-world-flattery-will-get-you-everywhere-and-nowhere-parker/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">sucker for flattery</a>, and will often follow the advice of whoever he <a class="external-link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/04/14/want-to-change-trumps-mind-on-policy-be-the-last-one-who-talks-to-him/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">last spoke to</a>. So while it was ultimately the president who ordered the <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/01/democrats-slam-trump-over-qassem-soleimani-iran">killing</a> last week of Iranian military leader Qassem Soleimani and brought tensions between Washington and Tehran to a head, the origin of that idea was initially unclear.</p><p>The Washington Post offered an answer to that question late Sunday, when it reported that the Soleimani killing was the brainchild of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Vice President Mike Pence, two of the biggest cheerleaders for the military operation in the days since Soleimani’s death. The two <a class="external-link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/killing-of-soleimani-follows-long-push-from-pompeo-for-aggressive-action-against-iran-but-airstrike-brings-serious-risks/2020/01/05/092a8e00-2f7d-11ea-be79-83e793dbcaef_story.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">reportedly</a> urged Trump to order a strike on the general for days in the lead-up to the operation as protests raged outside the United States embassy in Baghdad. Pompeo had been particularly relentless, reportedly calling for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard leader’s death since at least last summer. A senior U.S. official told the Post that Pompeo first floated killing Soleimani “months ago,” but at the time “neither the president nor Pentagon officials were willing to countenance such an operation.”</p><p>Per the Post, Pompeo was left “morose” after failing to convince the president to retaliate against Iran after it downed a U.S. drone in <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/06/trumps-art-of-the-deal-diplomacy-turn-dangerous-in-iran">June</a>, but “recent changes to Trump’s national security team and the whims of a president anxious about being viewed as hesitant in the face of Iranian aggression” afforded him another opportunity to press for action. Importantly, Pompeo and Defense Secretary Mark Esper were reportedly in “lockstep” when it came to pushing for the strike, though the New York Times <a class="external-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/04/us/politics/trump-suleimani.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">reported</a> that Trump’s choice to pursue the most extreme course of action “stunned” Pentagon officials.</p><p>In the aftermath, Pompeo and Pence have both staunchly defended the move. Pence <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/01/no-one-knows-where-mike-pence-got-his-soleimani-facts-from">falsely claimed</a> in a tweet that Soleimani was directly involved in 9/11, and Pompeo has repeatedly said that the killing prevented an “imminent” attack on U.S. troops in the region. “We took a bad guy off the battlefield,” Pompeo told CNN. “We made the right decision.” On the flip side, if it turns out to have been wrong decision—and there’s a very good chance it might!—it’ll be Pompeo, Pence, and Esper who will likely answer for it. There are already <a class="external-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/04/us/politics/trump-suleimani.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">significant doubts</a> as to whether the new “threat” posed by by Soleimani truly warranted such dramatic action; should Trump’s <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/01/trump-and-iranian-military-leader-rattle-sabers-via-interviews-and-social-media">back-and-forth</a> with Iran ultimately embroil the United States in another Middle Eastern war, Pompeo and his future political ambitions could go down with the ship.</p><p class="heading-h3">More Great Stories from Vanity Fair</p><p>— On the eve of impeachment vote, <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/12/rudy-giuliani-trump-impeachment-nyt?inline">Giuliani called up New York Times to incriminate Trump</a> — Melania Trump believes <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/12/melania-trump-greta-thunberg?inline">Greta Thunberg had POTUS attack coming</a> — <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/12/inside-roger-ailes-twisted-game-of-mind-control-fox-news-bombshell-movie?inline">Inside Roger Ailes’s twisted game</a> of mind control — Why the <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/12/with-impeachment-imminent-jared-kushner-white-house-takeover-finally-complete?inline">White House belongs to Jared Kushner</a> now — <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/12/kamala-harris-next-act-destroying-stephen-miller?inline">Kamala Harris’ next act</a> is destroying Stephen Miller — From the Archive: Inside <a href="https://archive.vanityfair.com/article/share/c793ec2a-bffe-43e8-9b04-7e880389e95b?inline">Jeffrey Wigand’s epic multibillion-dollar struggle</a></p><p>Looking for more? <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters?inline">Sign up</a> for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.</p></article>

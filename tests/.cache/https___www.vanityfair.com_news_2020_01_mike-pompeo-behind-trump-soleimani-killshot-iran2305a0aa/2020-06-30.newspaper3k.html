<div><p class="has-dropcap">Though he fancies himself a brilliant strategist, it&#8217;s broadly understood that <strong>Donald Trump</strong> is the most impressionable person on the planet. He has been known to take foreign leaders <a class="external-link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/02/28/putin-kim-jong-un-trump-has-habit-taking-foreign-autocrats-their-word/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">at their word</a>, is a <a class="external-link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/23/opinions/in-trump-world-flattery-will-get-you-everywhere-and-nowhere-parker/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">sucker for flattery</a>, and will often follow the advice of whoever he <a class="external-link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/04/14/want-to-change-trumps-mind-on-policy-be-the-last-one-who-talks-to-him/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">last spoke to</a>. So while it was ultimately the president who ordered the <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/01/democrats-slam-trump-over-qassem-soleimani-iran">killing</a> last week of Iranian military leader Qassem Soleimani and brought tensions between Washington and Tehran to a head, the origin of that idea was initially unclear.</p><p>The Washington Post offered an answer to that question late Sunday, when it reported that the Soleimani killing was the brainchild of Secretary of State <strong>Mike Pompeo</strong> and Vice President <strong>Mike Pence,</strong> two of the biggest cheerleaders for the military operation in the days since Soleimani&#8217;s death. The two <a class="external-link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/killing-of-soleimani-follows-long-push-from-pompeo-for-aggressive-action-against-iran-but-airstrike-brings-serious-risks/2020/01/05/092a8e00-2f7d-11ea-be79-83e793dbcaef_story.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">reportedly</a> urged Trump to order a strike on the general for days in the lead-up to the operation as protests raged outside the United States embassy in Baghdad. Pompeo had been particularly relentless, reportedly calling for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard leader&#8217;s death since at least last summer. A senior U.S. official told the Post that Pompeo first floated killing Soleimani &#8220;months ago,&#8221; but at the time &#8220;neither the president nor Pentagon officials were willing to countenance such an operation.&#8221;</p><p>Per the Post, Pompeo was left &#8220;morose&#8221; after failing to convince the president to retaliate against Iran after it downed a U.S. drone in <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/06/trumps-art-of-the-deal-diplomacy-turn-dangerous-in-iran">June</a>, but &#8220;recent changes to Trump&#8217;s national security team and the whims of a president anxious about being viewed as hesitant in the face of Iranian aggression&#8221; afforded him another opportunity to press for action. Importantly, Pompeo and Defense Secretary <strong>Mark Esper</strong> were reportedly in &#8220;lockstep&#8221; when it came to pushing for the strike, though the New York Times <a class="external-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/04/us/politics/trump-suleimani.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">reported</a> that Trump&#8217;s choice to pursue the most extreme course of action &#8220;stunned&#8221; Pentagon officials.</p><p class="ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"></p><p class="cne-interlude-embed"></p><p>In the aftermath, Pompeo and Pence have both staunchly defended the move. Pence <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/01/no-one-knows-where-mike-pence-got-his-soleimani-facts-from">falsely claimed</a> in a tweet that Soleimani was directly involved in 9/11, and Pompeo has repeatedly said that the killing prevented an &#8220;imminent&#8221; attack on U.S. troops in the region. &#8220;We took a bad guy off the battlefield,&#8221; Pompeo told CNN. &#8220;We made the right decision.&#8221; On the flip side, if it turns out to have been wrong decision&#8212;and there&#8217;s a very good chance it might!&#8212;it&#8217;ll be Pompeo, Pence, and Esper who will likely answer for it. There are already <a class="external-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/04/us/politics/trump-suleimani.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">significant doubts</a> as to whether the new &#8220;threat&#8221; posed by by Soleimani truly warranted such dramatic action; should Trump&#8217;s <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/01/trump-and-iranian-military-leader-rattle-sabers-via-interviews-and-social-media">back-and-forth</a> with Iran ultimately embroil the United States in another Middle Eastern war, Pompeo and his future political ambitions could go down with the ship.</p><p class="heading-h3">More Great Stories from Vanity Fair</p><p>&#8212; On the eve of impeachment vote, <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/12/rudy-giuliani-trump-impeachment-nyt?inline">Giuliani called up New York Times to incriminate Trump</a><br>&#8212; Melania Trump believes <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/12/melania-trump-greta-thunberg?inline">Greta Thunberg had POTUS attack coming</a><br>&#8212; <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/12/inside-roger-ailes-twisted-game-of-mind-control-fox-news-bombshell-movie?inline">Inside Roger Ailes&#8217;s twisted game</a> of mind control<br>&#8212; Why the <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/12/with-impeachment-imminent-jared-kushner-white-house-takeover-finally-complete?inline">White House belongs to Jared Kushner</a> now<br>&#8212; <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/12/kamala-harris-next-act-destroying-stephen-miller?inline">Kamala Harris&#8217; next act</a> is destroying Stephen Miller<br>&#8212; From the Archive: Inside <a href="https://archive.vanityfair.com/article/share/c793ec2a-bffe-43e8-9b04-7e880389e95b?inline">Jeffrey Wigand&#8217;s epic multibillion-dollar struggle</a></p><p>Looking for more? <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters?inline">Sign up</a> for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.</p></div>

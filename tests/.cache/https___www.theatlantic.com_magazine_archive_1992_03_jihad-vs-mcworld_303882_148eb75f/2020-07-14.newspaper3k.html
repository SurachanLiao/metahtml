Scientific progress embodies and depends on open communication, a common
discourse rooted in rationality, collaboration, and an easy and regular flow
and exchange of information. Such ideals can be hypocritical covers for
power-mongering by elites, and they may be shown to be wanting in many other
ways, but they are entailed by the very idea of science and they make science
and globalization practical allies.</p><p>

Business, banking, and commerce all depend on information flow and are
facilitated by new communication technologies. The hardware of these
technologies tends to be systemic and integrated&#8212;computer, television, cable,
satellite, laser, fiber-optic, and microchip technologies combining to create a
vast interactive communications and information network that can potentially
give every person on earth access to every other person, and make every datum,
every byte, available to every set of eyes. If the automobile was, as George
Ball once said (when he gave his blessing to a Fiat factory in the Soviet Union
during the Cold War), "an ideology on four wheels," then electronic
telecommunication and information systems are an ideology at 186,000 miles per
second&#8212;which makes for a very small planet in a very big hurry. Individual
cultures speak particular languages; commerce and science increasingly speak
English; the whole world speaks logarithms and binary mathematics.</p><p class=" ad-boxinjector-m-wrapper"></p><p>

Moreover, the pursuit of science and technology asks for, even compels, open
societies. Satellite footprints do not respect national borders; telephone
wires penetrate the most closed societies. With photocopying and then fax
machines having infiltrated Soviet universities and <i>samizdat</i> literary circles
in the eighties, and computer modems having multiplied like rabbits in
communism's bureaucratic warrens thereafter, <i>glasnost</i> could not be far behind.
In their social requisites, secrecy and science are enemies. </p><p>

The new technology's software is perhaps even more globalizing than its
hardware. The information arm of international commerce's sprawling body
reaches out and touches distinct nations and parochial cultures, and gives them
a common face chiseled in Hollywood, on Madison Avenue, and in Silicon Valley.
Throughout the 1980s one of the most-watched television programs in South
Africa was <i>The Cosby Show.</i> The demise of apartheid was already in production.
Exhibitors at the 1991 Cannes film festival expressed growing anxiety over the
"homogenization" and "Americanization" of the global film industry when, for
the third year running, American films dominated the awards ceremonies. America
has dominated the world's popular culture for much longer, and much more
decisively. In November of 1991 Switzerland's once insular culture boasted
best-seller lists featuring <i>Terminator 2</i> as the No. 1 movie, <i>Scarlett</i> as the
No. 1 book, and Prince's <i>Diamonds and Pearls</i> as the No. 1 record album. No
wonder the Japanese are buying Hollywood film studios even faster than
Americans are buying Japanese television sets. This kind of software supremacy
may in the long term be far more important than hardware superiority, because
culture has become more potent than armaments. What is the power of the
Pentagon compared with Disneyland? Can the Sixth Fleet keep up with CNN?
McDonald's in Moscow and Coke in China will do more to create a global culture
than military colonization ever could. It is less the goods than the brand
names that do the work, for they convey life-style images that alter perception
and challenge behavior. They make up the seductive software of McWorld's common
(at times much too common) soul. </p>  </div>

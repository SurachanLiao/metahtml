<article class=""><p class="_1SzQc">North Korea has finally responded to persistent rumours that leader Kim Jong-Un had plastic surgery to look like his revered grandfather, issuing an angry denial criticising "sordid" media reports.</p><p class="_1SzQc">Speculation that Mr Kim's resemblance to the country's founding leader, Kim Il-Sung, is not 100 per cent natural has been around for some time, though with little or no supporting evidence.</p><p class="_1SzQc">The rumours have been partly fed by the fact that Kim Jong-Un has sought to evoke memories of his grandfather in numerous ways, through his dress, haircut, gestures and public appearances.</p><p class="_1SzQc">And there is a clear physical resemblance. But Pyongyang's patience with reports of plastic surgery appears to have run out.</p><p class="_1SzQc">"The false report... released by enemies is a hideous criminal act which the party, state, army and people can never tolerate," the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said in a commentary.</p><p class="_1SzQc">KCNA flatly rejected what it described as "sordid hackwork by rubbish media", insisting the very idea of Mr Kim - who is in his late 20s - undergoing plastic surgery was "unimaginable".</p><p class="_1SzQc">While the focus of the commentary's fury was the South Korean media, it seems Pyongyang's anger was triggered by a Chinese report last week that was widely picked up by newspapers in the South.</p><p class="_1SzQc">China's Shenzhen TV cited a diplomatic source who, on a private visit to Pyongyang, had spoken to a North Korean official who confirmed the plastic surgery rumours.</p><p class="_1SzQc">KCNA referenced the Chinese report, but saved its real vitriol for the South Korean newspapers.</p><p class="_1SzQc">"Those hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership of the nation should not expect any mercy or leniency," the report said.</p><p class="_1SzQc">"Time will clearly show what dear price the human scum and media in the service of traitors of South Korea, slaves of capital, will have to pay."</p><p class="_1SzQc">Kim Il-Sung, who died in 1994, still inspires quasi-religious devotion among many North Koreans.</p><p class="_1SzQc">He is officially referred to as the Great Leader and is designated in the constitution as the country's Eternal President. His birthday is a public holiday.</p><p class="_1SzQc">Possibly concerned that the Shenzhen TV report may have caused offence, China's official Xinhua news agency issued a report, citing two of its correspondents in Pyongyang who rejected the plastic surgery rumours.</p><p class="_1SzQc">China was embarrassed in November when the Communist Party newspaper, the People's Daily, <a class="_2HoMm _1ks7p _31PBK _34Pu4" href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-11-27/china-falls-for-27sexiest27-kim-jong-un-award/4395742">treated as genuine a spoof article by the satirical US website The Onion</a> anointing Kim Jong-Un as "Sexiest Man Alive" for 2012.</p></article>

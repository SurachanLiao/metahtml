Coconuts is life in Bangkok for expats and English-speaking Thais. We cover every happening, controversy and social media scandal that the city can conjure up. When you think of what’s happening in Bangkok, think of us. We’re so much more than your staid daily newspaper or your boring food blog, we offer insight and edge that you can’t get anywhere else. At Coconuts, we’re not afraid to say what’s really happening, and what’s really on our collective minds. Haters be damned! When you need to know about every must-try dish, must-sip drink, must-hear band, and must-visit shop in Bangkok, Coconuts has you covered. From the coolest craft beer brewers to the hippest bespoke cocktail bars to the location of every fattening food truck, we’ve got you covered. And when it’s time to buy bigger clothes after too many Daniel Thaiger burgers or find the best Thai hangover cure after a few too many Siam mojitos, we’ve got you there as well. When it’s not time to eat and drink (really, is that anytime in Bangkok?) we offer the edgiest photo-essays, the most thought-provoking features, and around-the-clock breaking news coverage that stretches all the way from Pathum Thani to the Chao Phraya riverside and back again. We’ll take you from the city’s literal and figurative underground dens of deviance and vice to the very top of the most hi-so sky bar that the city has to offer. Feel like touching the stars, anyone? If so, look no further than Coconuts Bangkok.

                 Coconuts is life in Bangkok for expats and English-speaking Thais. We cover every happening, controversy and social media scandal that the city can conjure up. When you think of what&#8217;s happening in Bangkok, think of us. We&#8217;re so much more than your staid daily newspaper or your boring food blog, we offer insight and edge that you can&#8217;t get anywhere else. At Coconuts, we&#8217;re not afraid to say what&#8217;s really happening, and what&#8217;s really on our collective minds. Haters be damned! When you need to know about every must-try dish, must-sip drink, must-hear band, and must-visit shop in Bangkok, Coconuts has you covered. From the coolest craft beer brewers to the hippest bespoke cocktail bars to the location of every fattening food truck, we&#8217;ve got you covered. And when it&#8217;s time to buy bigger clothes after too many Daniel Thaiger burgers or find the best Thai hangover cure after a few too many Siam mojitos, we&#8217;ve got you there as well. When it&#8217;s not time to eat and drink (really, is that anytime in Bangkok?) we offer the edgiest photo-essays, the most thought-provoking features, and around-the-clock breaking news coverage that stretches all the way from Pathum Thani to the Chao Phraya riverside and back again. We&#8217;ll take you from the city&#8217;s literal and figurative underground dens of deviance and vice to the very top of the most hi-so sky bar that the city has to offer. Feel like touching the stars, anyone? If so, look no further than Coconuts Bangkok.            </p>

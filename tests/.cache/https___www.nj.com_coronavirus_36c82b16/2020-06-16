during the pandemic, Rosen suggests that individuals select one that covers your nose and mouth with fabric that has a tight weave, similar to denim or cotton dinner napkins. The most optimal masks are made from two layers, and cloth masks are beneficial in that they can be reused and laundered regularly — depending on the amount of time they are worn. Surgical masks and N-95 respirator masks should be reserved for health professionals, but those who opt to wear surgical masks should be aware that surgical masks are meant for one-time use and will break down if reused over time. Even though cloth face coverings in particular are designed to protect others and not to protect the person wearing the mask, Schaffner emphasized that what’s most important in curbing the spread of the virus is not the type of mask, but the adherence to social distancing regulations."},{"_id":"J3AFFMQVFZGCHD5ZY5KFYQ6GPI","type":"header","level":2,"additional_properties":{"comments":[],"inline_comments":[],"_id":1591904671039},"content":"PREVIOUS CORONAVIRUS

Although the New Jersey Supreme Court will be the arbiter of this question, one need only to look to New Jersey’s history to be assured this meets constitutional guidelines. In the 1860s, general obligation bonds were sold to meet the financial emergencies caused by the Civil War. Seventy years later during the Great Depression, the state issued general obligation emergency relief bonds to meet the unprecedented fiscal crisis. Based on that experience, in 1947 the New Jersey Constitution was amended to add within the debt limitation clause an exception “to meet an emergency caused by an Act of God or disaster.”"},{"_id":"3HRESQMKIBFR5OGUIRZHEX72Z4","type":"text","additional_properties":{"comments":[],"inline_comments":[],"_id":1592252298574},"content":"More than ever, the legislature must remain vigilant in decisions involving future spending cuts and in determining how the resources that we use are best allocated.

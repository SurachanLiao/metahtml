                                 <p>The White House confirmed President Trump will hold a second summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un Friday; following a high-level meeting with Kim&#8217;s delegation inside the Oval Office.</p>
<p>&#8220;President Donald J. Trump met with Kim Yong Chol for an hour and a&#160;half, to discuss denuclearization and a second summit, which will take place near the end of February. The President looks forward to meeting with Chairman Kim at a place to be announced at a later date,&#8221; the White House said in a statement.</p>
              
                                                 
            
                                                  

                                                  
                                            
<p>&#8220;The face-to-face came after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with Kim Yong-chol, North Korea&#8217;s lead negotiator,&#160;in the nation&#8217;s capital early Friday morning to negotiate terms that could lead to a second nuclear summit between Trump and Pyongyang leader Kim Jong-un,&#8221; writes <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/trump-to-meet-north-korean-official-in-the-oval-office-in-possible-prelude-to-2nd-nuclear-summit">Fox News</a>.</p>

                                 <p>The White House is preparing a second summit between President Trump and Kim Jong Un after the North Korean leader sent a formal request to American officials, reports the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-preparing-for-second-trump-meeting-with-north-koreas-leader-1536607841">Wall Street Journal</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;The White House said it is working to arrange a second meeting between President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, signaling an attempt to revive the stalled diplomatic efforts between Washington and Pyongyang,&#8221; writes the WSJ.</p>

                                                                                                       
              
                                                   
                
                                                  
                                            
<p>White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed Kim&#8217;s letter Tuesday, saying the &#8220;warm&#8221; exchange signaled Kim&#8217;s regime was serious in its efforts to denuclearize the Korean peninsula.</p>
<p>The &#8220;friendly&#8221; message comes just hours after Kim and his regime celebrated North Korea&#8217;s 70th anniversary; ditching nuclear warheads and ballistic missiles during its annual military parade and focusing on &#8220;economic development&#8221; and &#8220;peace&#8221; in the region.</p>

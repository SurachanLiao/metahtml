To begin with, North Korea must make a change, which is not only a result of the heightened pressure it faces, but also the judgment of its young leadership. The backwardness of North Korea will to some extent convert into political pressure.&#160;<strong>Boosting economic and societal development is the only path for Pyongyang. </strong>Given the risks that will accompany development, the North Korean leadership must get a grip over the transformation process ahead of the time when it embarks on large-scale changes. </p><p>There will be many concerns about "opening-up" in Pyongyang. However, the closed-door policy has been proven wrong in history. If North Korea wants to develop, it has to emerge into the current of globalization.&#160;&#160; <br><br><a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/885023.shtml"><strong>GT editorial: Speculation over NK's future may be rash</strong></a>&#160; </p><p>Noticeably, under the current state system,<strong>&#160;it's more difficult for Pyongyang to mend fences with South Korea, Japan and the US than to develop relations with Beijing.</strong> The key divergence between North Korea and China lies in the nuclear issue, but there are multiple conflicts among North Korea, South Korea, Japan and the US. South Korea aims at dictating the unification process of the Korean Peninsula, while the US longs for a revamp to North Korea's system, which is unacceptable to Pyongyang.&#160;&#160; <br><br>Web Editors: <a href="mailto:liyingxa@globaltimes.com.cn">liyingxa@globaltimes.com.cn</a>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <a href="mailto:guwei@globaltimes.com.cn">guwei@globaltimes.com.cn</a> <br></p>

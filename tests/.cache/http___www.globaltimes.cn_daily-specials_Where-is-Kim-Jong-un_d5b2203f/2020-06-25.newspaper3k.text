Comments



Zhang Liangui, an expert on North Korea at the Party School of the CPC Central Committee

Speculations on why North Korea's top leader Kim Jong-un has not appeared in public for over a month are fuelled as the country reveals relatively less information to the outside world. None of these speculations have yet been proven to be true or false. It is still too early to draw any conclusions as we do not have enough first-hand information at this time.

GT editorial: Tough task to crack Pyongyang's isolation

Here we try to analyze the realistic options of Pyongyang. To begin with, North Korea must make a change, which is not only a result of the heightened pressure it faces, but also the judgment of its young leadership. The backwardness of North Korea will to some extent convert into political pressure. Boosting economic and societal development is the only path for Pyongyang. Given the risks that will accompany development, the North Korean leadership must get a grip over the transformation process ahead of the time when it embarks on large-scale changes.

There will be many concerns about "opening-up" in Pyongyang. However, the closed-door policy has been proven wrong in history. If North Korea wants to develop, it has to emerge into the current of globalization.



GT editorial: Speculation over NK's future may be rash

Noticeably, under the current state system, it's more difficult for Pyongyang to mend fences with South Korea, Japan and the US than to develop relations with Beijing. The key divergence between North Korea and China lies in the nuclear issue, but there are multiple conflicts among North Korea, South Korea, Japan and the US. South Korea aims at dictating the unification process of the Korean Peninsula, while the US longs for a revamp to North Korea's system, which is unacceptable to Pyongyang.

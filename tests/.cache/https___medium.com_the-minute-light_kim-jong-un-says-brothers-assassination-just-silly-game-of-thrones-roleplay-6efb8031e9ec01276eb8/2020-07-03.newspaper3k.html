Nothing but some rowdy Game of Thrones themed tomfoolery. We prank each other like this all the time&#8221;.</p><p id="aa8b" class="hm hn as ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie dk ej">Kim, who is a huge fan of the HBO series, explained that the misunderstanding stems from a delay the isolated dictatorship experiences with must-see television. &#8220;We&#8217;re a little behind here in Pyongyang, so season 4 just aired. The episode where King Joffery is poisoned by his uncle really tickled me. When I saw those squabbling, power-hungry despots go at it, I was like, &#8216;That&#8217;s so our family!&#8217;&#8221;</p><p id="ab4a" class="hm hn as ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie dk ej">North Korean Minister of Culture, Hong Kwang Sun, pointed to a greater cosplay trend sweeping through the country. &#8220;People here really get into their favorite shows and want to express themselves. For example, Orange is the New Black is massively popular, so you&#8217;ll get lots of folks gathering in groups, dressing up like their favorite characters, and spending a decade or two in a labor camp.&#8221;</p><p id="302c" class="hm hn as ho b hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie dk ej">The fatal poisoning was extreme, Kim admits, but accurate from a cosplay standpoint. &#8220;Let&#8217;s put this in another context. If we were at the San Diego Comic-Con right now, I&#8217;d be taking home a prize, period. The only difference is that Tyrion was framed, whereas I definitely killed my brother.&#8221;</p></div>

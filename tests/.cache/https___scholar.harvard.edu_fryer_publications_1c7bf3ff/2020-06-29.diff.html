Firms try to infer whether workers have made investments required for them to be productive, and simultaneously, workers try to deduce whether firms have made investments necessary for them to thrive. When multiple equilibria exist, group differences are sustained by both sides of the interaction – workers and firms. Strategic complementarity complicates both empirical analysis designed to detect discrimination and policy meant to alleviate it. Affirmative action is much less effective than in traditional statistical discrimination models. More generally, we demonstrate the futility of policies that are designed to correct gender and racial disparities but do not address both sides of the coordination problem. We propose a two-sided version of “investment insurance” – a policy in which the government (after observing a noisy version of the employer’s signal) offers to hire any worker who it believes to be qualified and whom the employers does not offer a job – and show that it (weakly) dominates any alternative. The paper concludes by proposing a way to identify statistical discrimination by employers when beliefs are complements.</ins></p><p class="biblio-entry node node-biblio node-teaser contextual-links-region article clearfix"><ins><span class="biblio-authors">Roland G.

Across two years, principals were provided 300 hours of training on lesson planning, data-driven instruction, and teacher observation and coaching. The findings show that offering management training to principals significantly increases student achievement in all subjects in year one and has an insignificant effect in year two. We argue that the results in year two are driven by principal turnover, coupled with the cumulative nature of the training. Schools with principals who are predicted to remain in their positions for both years of the experiment demonstrate large treatment effects in both years – particularly those with principals who are also predicted to implement the training with high fidelity – while those with principals that are predicted to leave have statistically insignificant effects in each year of treatment. </ins></p><ins><span class="biblio_file_links"><span class="file"><a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/fryer/files/mgmt_20170515_with_tables_figures.pdf" type="application/pdf; length=1665206">PDF Link: https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/fryer/files/mgmt_20170515_with_tables_figures.pdf </a></span><span class="file"><a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/fryer/files/mgmt_appendices_20170515_with_tables_figures.pdf" type="application/pdf; length=3023921">Online Appendix Link: https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/fryer/files/mgmt_appendices_20170515_with_tables_figures.pdf </a></span></span></ins><p class="biblio-entry node node-biblio node-teaser contextual-links-region article clearfix"><ins><span class="biblio-authors">Dobbie W, Fryer RG</span>. <span class="biblio-title"><a href="/fryer/publications/charter-schools-and-labor-market-outcomes">Charter Schools and Labor Market Outcomes Link: /fryer/publications/charter-schools-and-labor-market-outcomes </a></span>.

In Washington DC, incentives were “horizontal” – provided to one agent (students) for various inputs in the education production function (i.e. attendance, behavior, interim assessments,homework, and uniforms). In Houston, TX, incentives were “vertical” – provided to multiple agents (parents, teachers, and students) for a single input (math objectives). On outcomes for which we provided direct incentives, there were large and statistically signiﬁcant effects from both treatments. Horizontal incentives led to increases in math and reading test scores. Vertical incentives increased math achievement, but resulted in decreased reading, science, and social studies test scores.

We demonstrate that, at the mean, tutoring has a positive and significant effect on school attendance, a positive, but insignificant, effect on English Language Arts (ELA) state test scores and no effect on math state test scores. There is important heterogeneity by race. For black students, our treatment increased attendance by 2.0 percentage points (control mean 92.4 percent) and ELA scores by 0.09 standard deviations per year – two times larger than the effect of KIPP Charter Middle Schools on reading achievement.

Treatment schools altered their schedules to have teachers specialize in a subset of subjects in which they have demonstrated relative strength (based on value-add measures and principal observations). The average impact of encouraging schools to specialize their teachers on student achievement is -0.11 standard deviations per year on a combined index of math and reading test scores. Students enrolled in special education and those with less experienced teachers demonstrated marked negative results. I argue that the results are consistent with a model in which the benefits of specialization driven by sorting teachers into a subset of subjects based on comparative advantage is outweighed by inefficient pedagogy due to having fewer interactions with each student, though other mechanisms are possible.</ins></p><ins><span class="biblio_file_links"><span class="file"><a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/fryer/files/specialization.pdf" type="application/pdf; length=1497829">PDF Link: https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/fryer/files/specialization.pdf </a></span><span class="file"><a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/fryer/files/specialization_-_appendix.pdf" type="application/pdf; length=2194162">Online Appendix Link: https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/fryer/files/specialization_-_appendix.pdf </a></span></span></ins><p class="biblio-entry node node-biblio node-teaser contextual-links-region article clearfix"><ins><span class="biblio-authors">Roland G.

On non-lethal uses of force, blacks and Hispanics are more than ﬁfty percent more likely to experience some form of force in interactions with police. Adding controls that account for important context and civilian behavior reduces, but cannot fully explain, these disparities. On the most extreme use of force –oﬃcer-involved shootings – we ﬁnd no racial diﬀerences in either the raw data or when contextual factors are taken into account. We argue that the patterns in the data are consistent with a model in which police oﬃcers are utility maximizers, a fraction of which have a preference for discrimination, who incur relatively high expected costs of oﬃcer-involved shootings.</ins></p><ins><span class="biblio_file_links"><span class="file"><a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/fryer/files/empirical_analysis_tables_figures.pdf" type="application/pdf; length=1506935">PDF Link: https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/fryer/files/empirical_analysis_tables_figures.pdf </a></span><span class="file"><a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/fryer/files/empirical_analysis_appendix.pdf" type="application/pdf; length=1546216">Online Appendix Link: https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/fryer/files/empirical_analysis_appendix.pdf </a></span></span></ins><p class="biblio-entry node node-biblio node-teaser contextual-links-region article clearfix"><ins><span class="biblio-authors">Cicala S, Roland G.

In our model, students choose peer groups based on their comparative advantage within a social environment. The eﬀect of moving a student into a diﬀerent environment with higher-achieving peers depends on where in the ability distribution she falls and the shadow prices that clear the social market. We show that the model’s key prediction—an individual’s ordinal rank predicts her behavior and test scores—is borne out in one randomized controlled trial in Kenya as well as administrative data from the U.S. To test whether our selection mechanism can explain the eﬀect of rank on outcomes, we conduct an experiment with nearly 600 public school students in Houston. The experimental results suggest that social interactions are mediated by self-selection based on comparative advantage.</ins></p><ins><span class="biblio_file_links"><span class="file"><a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/fryer/files/ComparativeAdvantage.pdf" type="application/pdf; length=1688142">PDF Link: https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/fryer/files/ComparativeAdvantage.pdf </a></span><span class="file"><a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/fryer/files/roy66_split.pdf" type="application/pdf; length=1688142">Online Appendix Link: https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/fryer/files/roy66_split.pdf </a></span></span></ins><p class="biblio-entry node node-biblio node-teaser contextual-links-region article clearfix"><ins><span class="biblio-authors">Fryer R, Harms P</span>. <span class="biblio-title"><a href="/fryer/publications/two-armed-restless-bandits-imperfect-information-stochastic-control-and-0">Two-Armed Restless Bandits with Imperfect Information: Stochastic Control and Indexability Link: /fryer/publications/two-armed-restless-bandits-imperfect-information-stochastic-control-and-0 </a></span>.

These dynamics are natural in applications such as human capital development, job search, and occupational choice. Using new insights from stochastic control, along with a monotonicity condition on the payo dynamics, we show that optimal strategies in our model are stopping rules that can be characterized by an index which formally coincides with Gittins' index.

This chapter summarizes what we have learned about various partial derivatives of the human capital production function, what important partial derivatives are left to be estimated, and what – together – our collective efforts have taught us about how to produce human capital in developed countries. The chapter concludes with a back of the envelope simulation of how much of the racial wage gap in America might be accounted for if human capital policy focused on best practices gleaned from randomized ﬁeld experiments.</ins></p><ins><span class="biblio_file_links"><span class="file"><a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/fryer/files/handbook_fryer_03.25.2016.pdf" type="application/pdf; length=1060959">PDF Link: https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/fryer/files/handbook_fryer_03.25.2016.pdf </a></span></span></ins><p class="biblio-separator-bar"><ins>2016</ins></p><p class="biblio-entry node node-biblio node-teaser contextual-links-region article clearfix"><ins><span class="biblio-authors">Roland G.

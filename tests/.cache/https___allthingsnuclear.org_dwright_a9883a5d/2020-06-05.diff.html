This missile would have had a burnout speed of about 3.74 km/s with a loft angle of 81.5 degrees, and a flight time of about 17 minutes.</p> <p>If flown on a standard trajectory with the same payload, that missile would have a maximum range of about 1,900 km (1,200 miles).</p> <p>This would classify the missile as medium range (1,000 to 3,500 km).</p> <p class="post_details_inner"><ins></ins></p><h1><ins><a href="https://allthingsnuclear.org/dwright/treaty-violating-test" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Why Did the Pentagon Conduct a Treaty-Violating Test?">Why Did the Pentagon Conduct a Treaty-Violating Test?

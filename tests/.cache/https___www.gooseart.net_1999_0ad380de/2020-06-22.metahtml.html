Sure, bandmates Nick Carter, A.J. McLean, Howie Dorough and Brian Littrell each have their cadre of screaming teenage girls. Those fans scooped up all the tickets to the Boys&#8217; current 39-city tour in one day and made their latest multiplatinum album, Millennium, the fastest-selling record of all time. But with his laser-bright green eyes and chiseled chin, Richardson, 28&#8212;deemed the group&#8217;s &#8220;most likely future male model&#8221; by The New York Times&#8212;is the one providing a guilty pleasure for Mom too. &#8220;He has a very strong presence; his whole aura is sexy,&#8221; says the quintet&#8217;s fashion stylist Rachel Rosenzweig. Yet the 6&#8217;1&#8243; former captain of Lexington, Kentucky&#8217;s Estill County High School football team calls himself &#8220;pretty quiet.

Church secretary Mary Marks says that as she and Freeman &#8220;were walking toward Parish Hall, two other women were walking by us. One of them mentioned to the other that she had just given birth to twins. Ann turned to me and said, &#8216;I used to have twins.&#8217; &#8221; &#8230; <a href="https://www.gooseart.net/1999/08/hour-of-loss/" class="more-link">[Read more...] <span class="screen-reader-text">about Hour of Loss</span></a></p></article></main>

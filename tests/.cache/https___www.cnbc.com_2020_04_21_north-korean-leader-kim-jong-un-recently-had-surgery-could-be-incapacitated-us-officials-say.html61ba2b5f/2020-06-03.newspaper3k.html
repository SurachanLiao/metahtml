Kim Jong Un's mother, named Ko Yong Hui, had a total of three children in the 1980s: two sons, Kim Jong Chul and Kim Jong Un and a daughter named Kim Yo Jong.</p><p>Kim Jong Un was put forward as the "Great Successor" in 2009 and was made a four-star general the following year. His father, Kim Jong Il, died in 2011 and was believed to be about 70 years old at the time of his death. As planned, Kim took over and was probably around 28 years old.&#160;</p><p>"Some speculated that an uncle and an aunt would serve as co-regents of a kind," explained Jay Nordlinger, author of "Children of Monsters: An Inquiry into the Sons and Daughters of Dictators."</p><p>The uncle was Jang Song Thaek and in December 2013, "Kim Jong Un left no doubt about who was in charge: He had his uncle arrested and executed. He then killed all the Jang relatives he could get his hands on, no matter how old they were or where they lived."</p><p>While little is known about the North Korean leader and his immediate family, Kim is believed to be about 36 years old and is married to a woman named Ri Sol Ju. He has at least one child, a daughter, named Kim Ju Ae, who was disclosed to the world by former basketball star Dennis Rodman.</p><p>If Kim dies, analysts<strong>&#160;</strong>believe that Kim's sister, Kim Yo Jong, will assume control of the nation with a group of loyalists until another successor is named.</p><p class="lazyload-placeholder"></p><p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCaption">Kim Yo Jong, sister of North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un.</p><p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCredit">Jorge Silva | Reuters</p><p>In 2018, Kim became the first North Korean leader to cross the 38th parallel to meet South Korean President Moon Jae-In. Both Koreas are technically still at war, as the Korean War of 1950-1953 ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty.</p><p>Under Kim, the reclusive state has conducted its most powerful nuclear test, launched its first-ever intercontinental ballistic missile and threatened to send missiles into the waters near Guam, a U.S. territory.&#160;</p><p>North Korea is the only nation known to have tested nuclear weapons this century. Since 2011, Kim has launched more than 100 missiles and conducted four nuclear weapons tests, which is more than his father, Kim Jong Il, and grandfather, Kim Il Sung, launched over a 27-year period.</p><p>North Korea spent most of President Donald Trump's first year in office perfecting its nuclear arsenal, but promised to stop testing of its nukes after the U.S. and international community offered the possibility of relief from crippling economic sanctions.</p><p class="lazyload-placeholder"></p><p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCaption">President Donald Trump makes a statement before saying goodbye to North Korea leader Kim Jong Un after their meeting in the Capella Hotel after their working lunch, on Sentosa island in Singapore June 12, 2018.</p><p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCredit">Susan Walsh | Reuters</p><p>In 2018, Trump met Kim Jong Un for the first time in Singapore to discuss the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.

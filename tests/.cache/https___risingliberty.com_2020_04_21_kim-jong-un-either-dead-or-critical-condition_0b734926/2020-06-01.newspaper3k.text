The United States Government is suspicious North Korean Dictator Kim Jong Un potentially died or is in serious condition. Kim Jong Un had heart surgery last week and his health has not been in great condition according to reports.

Sciutto reported, “Breaking: The US is monitoring intelligence that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s health is in grave danger following a surgery, a US official with direct knowledge tells me.”

Bloomberg News reporter Jennifer Jacobs reported, “NEW: Trump admin received information that Kim Jong Un had heart surgery last week and if he’s alive, his health is poor, I’m told. KJU hasn’t been seen at key events in recent days. It’s unclear to US officials if he’s dead or alive. (CNN 1st reported his condition’s grave.)”

Jacobs continued, “Trump administration officials are looking into who would be in the line of succession if Kim Jong Un dies or is already dead, I’m told.”

However, it is unclear if Kim Jong Un is dead or not. One American News reports he may be in stable condition but got COVID-19 from Chinese Doctor during Heart Surgery.

One American News reporter Jack Psobiec tweeted, “BREAKING: Multiple US officials tell

@OANN that Kim Jong Un caught COVID19 from a Chinese doctor flown in to help with his heart valve surgery. He appears to be in stable condition for now.”

At this moment no one knows how Kim Jong Un’s health is, but if he does pass away there could be an opportunity to free the entire country of North Korea from their giant slave state.

<div><p>Apple this week released a new version of its high-speed FireWire connectivity software, which makes it easier for users to move digital video and still photos from digital cameras to the newest generation of G3 Macs. FireWire technology processes video captures from digital-video camcorders and from analog-only equipment using AV-to-FireWire converters. Version 2.0 of the free FireWire driver software is available for download now from Apple's Web site. &#8230; <a href="https://www.itbnews.info/1999/03/apple-lights-fire-under-firewire/" class="more-link">[Read more...] about Apple lights fire under FireWire</a></p></div>

</p><p>Hello from <a href="/topic/North-Korea" target="_blank">North Korea</a>. It&#8217;s a place that is cut off from the outside world, where there is no freedom of movement and there are only primitive forms of communication. I understand that you also have a similar place linked to the number 370 (though I don&#8217;t have further details as internet has been cut off here).
</p><p>Anyway, this report about me has been published: &#8220;The influential aunt of North Korean leader <a href="/topic/Kim-Jong-Un" target="_blank">Kim Jong-Un</a> made her first public appearance in six years, state media reported on Sunday, years after her husband was executed in a purge. <a href="/topic/Kim-Kyong-Hui" target="_blank">Kim Kyong-Hui</a> is the sister of former North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Il, and took a leading role during the first years of current leader Kim Jong-Un&#8217;s rule. On Sunday, state media showed Kim Kyong-Hui sitting near Kim Jong-Un at a performance celebrating the Lunar New Year in <a href="/topic/Pyongyang" target="_blank">Pyongyang</a>.&#8221;
</p><p>You know that he&#8217;s banned all protests and got rid of his own brother too. My question to you is: What should I expect given that everything here is so unpredictable?

Dear KKH,
</p><p>I hope you remain fine and safe. Unfortunately, we have no experience in our country of tyrants acting ruthlessly against their own people and putting them through extreme pain for no real reason. So, I&#8217;m afraid I cannot help you.

But he&#8217;s far from the first world leader to be drawn towards the allure of riding a horse as a symbol of pride, power and machismo. (Image: Reuters)</p><p class="nextText new">Next</p><p class="flexcroll content" id="con2"><h3>Vladimir Putin</h3><p>22 Oct, 2019</p>The Russian President clearly doesn&#8217;t believe in half measures. And so when the occasion called for riding a horse, he went the whole hog: Taking off his shirt and showing off some impressive pecs as he rode a horse in the town of Kyzyl in Southern Siberia back in 2009.
</p><p class="nextText new">Next</p><p class="flexcroll content" id="con3"><h3>Bill Clinton</h3><p>22 Oct, 2019</p>The Clintons had two very famous pets: A dog named Buddy and a cat named Socks. But when they would go on vacations, they often preferred a ranch near Wyoming, where they would explore the area around Grand Teton National Park and engage in some horseback riding. Seen here is a horse named Wink, that the former president grew fond of riding, on a vacation in 1996. </p><p class="nextText new">Next</p><p class="flexcroll content" id="con4"><h3>Nicolas Sarkozy</h3><p>22 Oct, 2019</p>Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy is a man of taste, and the horse he found on a farmhouse ranch during a visit to Camargue in France&#8217;s deep south is a magnificent-looking animal. Sarkozy, who was president of France until 2012, had also expressed his admiration for the outdoors, and was also known to be an avid runner. </p><p class="nextText new">Next</p><p class="flexcroll content" id="con5"><h3>Kim Jong-un</h3><p>22 Oct, 2019</p>Kim, who has been mocked for his portly waistline in the past, released a series of pictures through the North Korean news agency. The pictures show him scaling Mt Paektu, the country&#8217;s tallest peak, and considered the birthplace of Kim&#8217;s father, Kim Jong-il. </p><p class="nextText new">Next</p>

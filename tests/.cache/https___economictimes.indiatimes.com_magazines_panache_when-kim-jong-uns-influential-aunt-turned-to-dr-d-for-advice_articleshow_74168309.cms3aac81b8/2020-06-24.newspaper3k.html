<br>
<br>Hello from <a></a><br>
<br>Anyway, this report about me has been published: &#8220;The influential aunt of North Korean leader <a></a><a></a><a></a><br>
<br>You know that he&#8217;s banned all protests and got rid of his own brother too. My question to you is: What should I expect given that everything here is so unpredictable?

<strong>Dear KKH,</strong>
<br>
<br>I hope you remain fine and safe. Unfortunately, we have no experience in our country of tyrants acting ruthlessly against their own people and putting them through extreme pain for no real reason. So, I&#8217;m afraid I cannot help you.

<p>Hello from <a href="/topic/North-Korea" target="_blank">North Korea</a> . It&#8217;s a place that is cut off from the outside world, where there is no freedom of movement and there are only primitive forms of communication. I understand that you also have a similar place linked to the number 370 (though I don&#8217;t have further details as internet has been cut off here).Anyway, this report about me has been published: &#8220;The influential aunt of North Korean leader <a href="/topic/Kim-Jong-Un" target="_blank">Kim Jong-Un</a> made her first public appearance in six years, state media reported on Sunday, years after her husband was executed in a purge. <a href="/topic/Kim-Kyong-Hui" target="_blank">Kim Kyong-Hui</a> is the sister of former North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Il, and took a leading role during the first years of current leader Kim Jong-Un&#8217;s rule. On Sunday, state media showed Kim Kyong-Hui sitting near Kim Jong-Un at a performance celebrating the Lunar New Year in <a href="/topic/Pyongyang" target="_blank">Pyongyang</a> .&#8221;You know that he&#8217;s banned all protests and got rid of his own brother too.

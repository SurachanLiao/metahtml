Durst, 76, is a multimillionaire charged with killing Susan Berman in late 2000, allegedly because she was set to incriminate him in the 1982 disappearance of his wife, Kathleen McCormack Durst, as CNN noted. Berman was his best friend. She was found dead in her apartment in Beverly Hills, and he was arrested and charged in March 2015, according to CNN.

Are the 664 hours of training required to become a police officer the number that are required to remain one for the duration of a career in law enforcement? For instance, are there mandatory in-service certification/continuing education requirements in cosmetology as there are in policing? If not, how meaningful a comparison is this?</p><p>The &#8220;<a href="https://www.barbercosmo.ca.gov/forms_pubs/publications/faqs.shtml#ae1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sources at the link</a>&#8221; regarding cosmetology say:</p><blockquote><p>5.

No. The Board does not require continuing education credits to maintain a license.</p></blockquote><p>Whereas here are the <a href="https://post.ca.gov/legislative-mandated-training" target="_blank" rel="noopener">California requirements for police officers</a>.

Some police departments require a BA; some require it for advancement within the department, and <a href="https://www.learnhowtobecome.org/police-officer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many aspiring police officers get a BA so that they can go to other parts of law enforcement past the municipal police department</a>. None of that is true of cosmetology.</p><p>Not sure why so many jabs at &#8220;the regulatory state&#8221; have to consist of misleading talking points that don&#8217;t inform, but simply give the appearance of winning The Clever Derby.&#160; Consumer demand?</p></article><article id="post-22154" class="post-22154 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-covid-19"><p>Pizza and Public Works: Making Ends Meet in a Pandemic 
Anonymous DPW Guy from Monmouth County, New Jersey</p><p>I&#8217;ve been privileged to able to work during the COVID-19 pandemic. You might think that &#8220;privileged&#8221; is the wrong word, since anyone going out to work during the pandemic is probably at risk of getting infected. But &#8220;privilege&#8221; seems like the right word to me: millions of Americans are unemployed right now, unable to support their families. Unlike them, I have two jobs&#8211;one in public service, and the other in the food industry, both regarded as &#8220;essential&#8221; by the government, both state and federal. <a href="https://irfankhawajaphilosopher.com/2020/06/07/covid-19-narratives-8-pizza-and-public-works-in-a-pandemic/#more-22154" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a></p></article><article id="post-22141" class="post-22141 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-covid-19"><p>A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/04/world/coronavirus-us-update.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">live update from The New York Times on the COVID-19 situation in Peru</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Peru has more than 170,000 confirmed cases, despite taking the virus seriously early on.

Here&#8217;s a relevant excerpt from a piece of his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-06-02/coronavirus-protests-trump-americans-unified-only-in-outrage?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_content=view&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-view&amp;sref=htOHjx5Y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that&#8217;s just come out in Bloomberg Opinion</a>:</p><blockquote><p>If I have learned one thing over the last few weeks, it is that the psychology of the American public is weirder &#8212; and perhaps more flexible &#8212; than I ever would have thought.</p>
<p>Consider, as just one example among many, the issue of nursing homes. According to some&#160;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2020/05/26/nursing-homes-assisted-living-facilities-0-6-of-the-u-s-population-43-of-u-s-covid-19-deaths/#6effe43174cd" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">estimates</a>, about 40% of the deaths associated with Covid-19 have occurred in nursing homes, with more almost certain to come.</p>
<p>You might think that those 40,000-plus deaths would be a major national scandal. But so far the response has been subdued. Yes, there has been ample news coverage, but there are no riots in response, no social movement to &#8220;clean up the nursing homes,&#8221; no Ralph Nader-like crusader who has made this his or her political cause.</p>
<p>Nor has there been much resulting vilification. There are plenty of&#160;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/13/opinion/inequality-san-francisco-coronavirus.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">condemnations</a>&#160;of technology billionaires, but very few of nursing-home CEOs. Many of the state and local politicians who oversee public-sector nursing homes have been rewarded with&#160;<a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/05/26/metro/polling-is-clear-coronavirus-has-boosted-fortunes-every-governor-running-reelection-least-now/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">higher</a>&#160;approval ratings.</p>
<p>As if all this weren&#8217;t bad enough, of those 40,000 deaths, surely a considerable number are African-American (data by race is hard to come by). This could be an issue for Black Lives Matter, but somehow it isn&#8217;t.</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://irfankhawajaphilosopher.com/2020/06/03/cowen-on-nursing-homes-a-postscript/#more-22123" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a></p></article><article id="post-22102" class="post-22102 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-uncategorized"><p>For decades now, Americans convinced of their moral superiority to the rest of the world have sat around wondering what could possibly motivate someone to engage in suicide bombing.

When the right does it, the left attacks them. When the left does it, the right attacks them.

<p>Cowen:&#160;Let me give you a few examples:</p></blockquote><ol>
<li>
<blockquote><p>New York state regulations, until very recently, forced nursing homes to accept COVID-19-positive patients being discharged from hospitals. Nursing homes, especially in the northeast, have been an epicenter for COVID-19 casualties. By law, they were forced to accept&#160;<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/ap-count-4300-virus-patients-ny-nursing-homes-70825470">more than 4,500 COVID-19-positive patients</a>, often without proper PPE for their staff.</p></blockquote>
</li>
</ol><p>I don&#8217;t find this convincing. Why, exactly, does this very partial description of the issue prove that government failed? And why does Cowen regard the matter as so obvious that a summary this brief should suffice to make the case? <a href="https://irfankhawajaphilosopher.com/2020/05/31/coronavirus-diary-61-tyler-cowen-on-the-nursing-home-controversy/#more-22056" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a></p></article><article id="post-22026" class="post-22026 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-covid-19"><p>I&#8217;ve been pressed for time lately, as I do my share to add to the unemployment rate, but I couldn&#8217;t resist one thought in the form of a bleg, or query.

<blockquote><p>I <a href="https://irfankhawajaphilosopher.com/2020/05/31/coronavirus-diary-61-tyler-cowen-on-the-nursing-home-controversy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continue to be baffled</a> by Tyler Cowen&#8217;s views on the COVID-19 nursing home controversy. Here&#8217;s a relevant excerpt from a piece of his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-06-02/coronavirus-protests-trump-americans-unified-only-in-outrage?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_content=view&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-view&amp;sref=htOHjx5Y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that&#8217;s just come out in Bloomberg Opinion</a>:</p><p>If I have learned one thing over the last few weeks, it is that the psychology of the American public is weirder &#8212; and perhaps more flexible &#8212; than I ever would have thought.</p>
<p>Consider, as just one example among many, the issue of nursing homes. According to some&#160;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2020/05/26/nursing-homes-assisted-living-facilities-0-6-of-the-u-s-population-43-of-u-s-covid-19-deaths/#6effe43174cd" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">estimates</a>, about 40% of the deaths associated with Covid-19 have occurred in nursing homes, with more almost certain to come.</p>
<p>You might think that those 40,000-plus deaths would be a major national scandal. But so far the response has been subdued. Yes, there has been ample news coverage, but there are no riots in response, no social movement to &#8220;clean up the nursing homes,&#8221; no Ralph Nader-like crusader who has made this his or her political cause.</p>
<p>Nor has there been much resulting vilification. There are plenty of&#160;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/13/opinion/inequality-san-francisco-coronavirus.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">condemnations</a>&#160;of technology billionaires, but very few of nursing-home CEOs. Many of the state and local politicians who oversee public-sector nursing homes have been rewarded with&#160;<a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/05/26/metro/polling-is-clear-coronavirus-has-boosted-fortunes-every-governor-running-reelection-least-now/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">higher</a>&#160;approval ratings.</p>
<p>As if all this weren&#8217;t bad enough, of those 40,000 deaths, surely a considerable number are African-American (data by race is hard to come by). This could be an issue for Black Lives Matter, but somehow it isn&#8217;t.</p></blockquote>

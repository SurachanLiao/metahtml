From <a href="http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/10/14/world/asia/north-korean-leader-kim-jong-un-reported-to-have-appeared-in-public.html"></a>the New York Times: </p><blockquote><p>The photos showed Mr. Kim looking around brand-new eight-story apartment buildings and top military generals and party secretaries taking notes while he spoke &#226;&#128;&#148; a scene typical of such a visit by the top leader.</p><p>During the trip, Mr. Kim also inspected a newly completed building for an energy research institute, the agency said. He later posed for a group picture before the statues of his father and grandfather, the agency said.</p></blockquote><p>Speculation swirled that Kim was suffering from illness when <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/14/us-northkorea-kim-idUSKCN0I224J20141014"></a>state media reported last month that he was feeling "discomfort." </p><p>[Image via AP]</p>

South Korea's government was not able to confirm the claim. Previous media reports about the fate of North Korean officials who have fallen afoul of Pyongyang's leader have proven to be false.&#160;&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Chosun Ilbo is one of South Korea's largest daily newspapers. However, it's notoriously difficult to get information out of North Korea because it closely guards secrets.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Trump's North Korea diplomacy:<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2019/05/10/north-korea-trump-kim-jong-un-diplomacy-missile-tests/1163967001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">It&#160;looks troubled.

The tests are viewed as&#160;a way for Kim&#160;to pressure Trump to ease&#160;sanctions without actually causing negotiations to collapse.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"North Korea fired off some small weapons, which disturbed some of my people, and others, but not me," <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1132459370816708608" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Trump tweeted</a> during a recent trip to Japan.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was asked about the Chosun Ilbo report during a news conference in Berlin.

That claim, too, was not been independently verified.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Diplomacy?:<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/05/25/u-s-national-security-adviser-john-bolton-said-saturday-recent-missiles-tests-north-korea-that-presi/1233971001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Bolton says latest North Korea missile test violates U.N. resolution</a></p></article>

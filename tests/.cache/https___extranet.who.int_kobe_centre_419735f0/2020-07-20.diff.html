Formerly the Deputy Minister of Health in Poland, Dr Wojtczak was appointed as Director of WKC in February 1996. He was instrumental in setting up the Centre, working from a room in Kobe Port Island’s Portopia Hotel to employ staff members.</ins></p><p><ins>During his Directorship of WKC, Dr Wojtczak established a strong foundation for the new Centre that has matured into a key part of WHO today. He is remembered by staff who worked with him as having tireless energy. He helped to increase the profile of WKC and established relationships with the local academic community.  Many of the initiatives that he developed have had lasting impact as they continue to inform the work of the Centre as well as of WHO and countries.</ins></p><p><ins>Dr Wojtczak will be remembered as a global health leader who brought wisdom and lessons from Japan onto a world stage, and as a warmhearted person who always encouraged staff to move forward with confidence. We treasure the contributions he made to the Centre’s work, its staff and to Japan.</ins></p><p><ins>We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife and family at this difficult time.</ins></p><p class="views-field views-field-php"><ins><span class="field-content more-link-container"><a href="en/news/Wojtczak_passing">Read Full Article Link: en/news/Wojtczak_passing </a></span></ins></p></span></p><p class="views-field views-field-title-1"><ins><span class="field-content"><a href="en/news/WNTD2020">World No Tobacco Day 2019 Message of Dr Sarah Barber, Director of the WHO Centre for Health Development (WHO Kobe Centre) Link: en/news/WNTD2020 </a></span></ins></p> <p>On 31 May each year, the World Health Organization and its partners celebrate World No Tobacco Day to raise awareness that tobacco use and exposure to second-hand smoke are harmful, deadly, but completely preventable causes of death and disease. This year focuses on the threat of tobacco on lung health for everyone – not just smokers.</p><p>Tobacco smoking is the most common cause of lung cancer, resulting in about 1.2 million lung cancer deaths globally every year. Smokers are 22 times more likely to develop lung cancer than non-smokers, and twice as likely to develop TB. More than 20% of new TB cases around the world may be attributable to tobacco.</p><p>Tobacco smoke contributes to indoor air pollution. Smoke from the burning end of a cigarette, as well as exhaled smoke, is known as second-hand smoke. Non-smokers who breathe in this smoke risk getting lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, tuberculosis and asthma. Smokers’ children suffer reduced lung function which can affect them in adulthood through chronic respiratory disorders.</p><p>Just a single breath of tobacco smoke is enough to start damaging the lungs. Inhaling tobacco smoke paralyses the structures in the airways that clear mucus and dirt, allowing toxins in the smoke to enter the lungs more easily. In Japan, where around 18% of the population smoke, around 15 000 people are killed every year from second-hand smoke.</p><p>But it is never too late to quit smoking. Lung function improves within just two weeks of quitting tobacco use.</p><p>Japan recently tightened up its indoor smoking regulations. From July 2019, smoking will be banned indoors in schools, hospitals, government and children’s facilities. Several municipalities such as Tokyo, Chiba City, Shizuoka Prefecture and Hokkaido are implementing tougher smoke-free measures to protect their citizens. Increasingly, businesses are choosing to promote health and not tobacco by banning smoking in their workplaces and helping workers to quit smoking.</p><p>These are important steps towards protecting people from harmful second-hand smoke – but they do not go far enough. Around 55% of smaller bars and restaurants in Japan are exempt because of their size. This means that customers, families and workers will still be exposed to tobacco smoke. Designated smoking rooms, which are ineffective in protecting people from second-hand smoke, will still be allowed in public spaces such as workplaces, hotels and trains.</p><p>Japan is one of the fastest growing markets for e-cigarettes and heated tobacco products (HTPs). WHO recommends that HTPs should be regulated in the same manner as other tobacco products, and that bystanders be protected from exposure to second-hand emissions from HTPs and e-cigarettes.</p><p>Japan will soon be showcasing its culture and hospitality at the 2019 Rugby World Cup. Many of the nations playing have introduced indoor smoke-free laws which have been good for health and good for business. Research has found that indoor smoking bans have either a positive or no effect on business in bars and restaurants.</p><p>Japan has proven itself to be a global leader, particularly in its progress towards universal health coverage to ensure that all its citizens can access quality health care. The 2019 Rugby World Cup and the 2020 Olympics are golden opportunities for Japan to expand and accelerate its tobacco-free laws. Implementing and enforcing the most effective tobacco control policies and laws is critical for lung health of all people - not just smokers.</p> <p class="views-field views-field-php"><ins><span class="field-content more-link-container"><a href="en/news/WNTD2020">Read Full Article Link: en/news/WNTD2020 </a></span></ins></p><p><span><p class="views-field views-field-title-1"><ins><span class="field-content"><a href="en/news/WKC_COVID19_Contribution">WHO Kobe Centre (WKC) contributes to COVID-19 prevention and control  Link: en/news/WKC_COVID19_Contribution </a></span></ins></p><p><ins>WKC was established nearly 25 years ago with strong financial and material support and collaboration from the Kobe Group.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="" id="_ftnref1">[1] Link: #_ftn1 </a> It functions as a department of WHO Headquarters, and as the only World Health Organization entity in Japan, it has both a global and a local mandate.</ins></p><p><ins>Since the start of the global outbreak of COVID-19, our contributions to the community in Kobe and Hyogo prefecture have focused on communicating and disseminating the latest technical information and public guidance. This is a core part of our local engagement mandate to raise awareness and advocate for the health of all citizens.</ins></p><p><ins>WKC’s first and most critical actions have focused on translating the latest technical information and public guidance into Japanese, working closely with government officials of Kobe City and Hyogo prefecture.</ins></p><p><ins>So far, we have translated over 40 WHO guidance documents which are disseminated on our website and through social media. WKC continues to translate WHO’s Disease Outbreak News for Kansai regional officials, and our Technical Officer, Dr. Ryoma Kayano, gives weekly updates to professionals in Kobe City and Hyogo Prefecture.</ins></p><p><ins>WKC is using digital media to disseminate key messages on COVID-19 in Japanese as widely as possible. The Centre is collaborating with the UN Information Centre and other UN agencies in Japan to translate and amplify social media messaging and has created a special page on WKC’s Japanese website. Here the public can find general information, government officials and health care workers can access technical guidance and an explanation about how to read the WHO daily situation report.</ins></p><p><ins>In solidarity with the health workers and citizens of Kobe</ins></p><p><ins>As part of the Kobe community, in April, WKC supported Kobe City’s “blue light” tribute to frontline health workers and donated over 1000 masks to the city. WKC’s Director, Dr Sarah Barber, wrote a letter of support to the city, emphasizing 4 Be’s: Be Safe, Be Smart, Be Kind, Be Kobe.</ins></p><p><ins>The media is a critical stakeholder in reporting accurate information about COVID-19 and how to stay healthy. We contributed to the Kobe Newspaper’s special series on COVID-19 and conducted interviews to share key health messages. Technical staff have also provided information on proper handwashing to the media.</ins></p><p><ins>The pandemic has shown that COVID-19 respects no borders. The best defense is preparedness, investing in strong health systems and primary health care. WKC stands with the people of Kobe and Japan. Together we can overcome this health threat. </ins></p><p><ins><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="" id="_ftn1">[1] Link: #_ftnref1 </a> Hyogo Prefecture, Kobe City, the Kobe Chamber of Commerce and Kobe Steel</ins></p><p class="views-field views-field-php"><ins><span class="field-content more-link-container"><a href="en/news/WKC_COVID19_Contribution">Read Full Article Link: en/news/WKC_COVID19_Contribution </a></span></ins></p></span></p><p><span><p class="views-field views-field-title-1"><ins><span class="field-content"><a href="en/news/WHD2020_message">World Health Day 2020 - Message from the Director of WKC Link: en/news/WHD2020_message </a></span></ins></p><p><ins>This year, World Health Day on 7 April is dedicated to the critical role that nurses and midwives play in keeping the world healthy. It takes place as the world is grappling with the COVID-19 pandemic. Nurses and other health workers are at the forefront of the response, putting their own lives at risk as they provide high quality support and care. Without nurses, there would be no response.</ins></p><p><ins>This year is also the bicentenary of the birth of Florence Nightingale, who pioneered modern nursing. Her leadership emphasised sanitation, good hygiene and hand washing to prevent infectious diseases. This link, made less than 200 years ago, is still our first defence against COVID-19. Today we pay tribute to Florence Nightingale, and all nurses and midwives everywhere. They are the largest component of the health workforce, and backbone of any health system.</ins></p><p><ins>A strong nursing workforce is vital to achieve national and global targets for Universal Health Coverage (UHC), emergency preparedness and response, and the delivery of people-centred care. Having enough well trained, regulated and supported nurses and midwives can ensure that everyone, everywhere gets the healthcare they need.</ins></p><p><ins>Today, the WHO is releasing the first global report on nursing, The State of the World’s Nursing 2020. WHO and its partners urge investment in a massive acceleration of nursing education, jobs and leadership to ensure nurses get the support they need to keep the world healthy.</ins></p><p><ins>COVID-19 clearly demonstrates the importance and value of nurses to society. Let’s celebrate them and thank them for their service.</ins></p><p class="views-field views-field-php"><ins><span class="field-content more-link-container"><a href="en/news/WHD2020_message">Read Full Article Link: en/news/WHD2020_message </a></span></ins></p></span></p><p class="wkc_story_footer col-sm-12"><ins></ins></p><h4><ins><a href="en/news">All News (Archive) Link: en/news </a></ins></h4><section id="block-views-our-mission-and-vision-block" class="block block-views who-we-are-top-page-block centered-main-content-column blue-block-title even block-count-6 block-region-content block-our-mission-and-vision-block"><h2 class="block-title"><ins>Who We Are</ins></h2><p class="views-field views-field-nothing"><span class="field-content"><h3><ins><span class="home_missin_title"><a href="en/who-we-are">Our Vision Link: en/who-we-are </a></span></ins></h3><p><ins>“Innovations for sustainable universal health coverage”</ins></p></span></p><p class="views-field views-field-nothing"><span class="field-content"><h3><ins><span class="home_missin_title"><a href="en/who-we-are">Our Mission Link: en/who-we-are </a></span></ins></h3><p><ins>To research and foster innovative solutions and translate them into policies and actions to achieve sustainable universal health coverage.</ins></p></span></p><p><ins><a class="rounded_button_light" href="en/who-we-are">Read More Link: en/who-we-are </a></ins></p></section><h3 class="team_main_heading"><ins>Director's Message</ins></h3><p class="box-text-center2"><ins></ins></p><h3><ins>Supporting sustainable health systems in a rapidly changing environment</ins></h3><p class="t-pad20"><ins>Accelerating progress towards Universal Health Coverage by 2030 will require strong evidence about systems innovations and sharing of lessons learned across countries.

The Republic of Yemen, located on the southwestern tip of the Arabian Peninsula, is the Middle East’s poorest country and it has been embroiled in a brutal civil war since 2014, one which so far has claimed the lives of some 90,000 people and left 2 million displaced.

The Yemeni conflict is seen by many Western officials and analysts as a proxy war between Iran, the dominant Shi’a power in the Middle East and its rival Saudi Arabia, the dominant Sunni power. This Media Guide will explore the ongoing civil war in Yemen, and the extent to which Iran has been involved in its origins and current conduct.

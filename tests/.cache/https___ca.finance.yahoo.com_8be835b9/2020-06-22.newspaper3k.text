According to the testimony, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield and Fauci will tell Congress that the duration of the pandemic is unknown and that a vaccine that can be distributed widely isn’t imminent, despite Trump’s push for one by year-end.Fauci Says He’s No Obstacle to NFL Season (12:54 p.m. NY)Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious disease specialist, said he’s been mistakenly painted as an obstacle to the National Football League’s upcoming season and only gave its officials advice after they requested it.The director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said he was consulted by the NFL as it searches for a way to preserve the safety of players and the public during the pandemic.“I haven’t set any strict conditions or other directions for the football league,” Fauci said in an interview. “They have come to me and asked me from a medical standpoint a bunch of questions about risks. They are a very competent group of people, and they will make up their own minds.”Fauci told CNN last week that the league’s season may not be played if there’s a resurgence in cases, unless players are essentially kept in a “bubble” isolating them from others and tested almost every day. U.S. President Donald Trump said later in a tweet that he told the scientist that he has “nothing to do with football.”Covid-19 Accelerates in Latin America, WHO Says (12:45 p.m. NY)The number of new cases reached a record 183,000 in the most recent World Health Organization daily report as the disease spreads in several big countries simultaneously, WHO officials said at a press briefing in Geneva.Latin America is particularly afflicted.

Pritzker’s office said in a statement.Gatherings can expand up as many as 50 people, and indoor dining can resume with groups of 10 or less, tables 6-feet (1.8 meters) apart and standing areas at no more than 25% of capacity. Chicago and state officials said that public health metrics such as new Covid-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths are moving down, allowing the city to enter Phase 4 after it was delayed in the third stage.“We’ve continued to see really good progress,” Allison Arwady, commissioner of the Chicago Department of Public Health, said during a call with reporters. Capacity limits may be expanded or eased during Phase 4 if the numbers continue to decline but the city is taking incremental steps to avoid spikes that other places that re-opened have seen, she added.Portugal Steps Up Measure in Lisbon Suburbs (11:54 a.m. NY)The Portuguese government plans to tighten restrictions in some municipalities around Lisbon as it tries to contain new clusters of the outbreak in the city’s outskirts.

(11:10 a.m. NY)Governor Phil Murphy of New Jersey, the second hardest-hit U.S. state, told CNN that if his state had a surge like Florida’s, he would do a turnaround on his gradual and restricted return of retail, dining and other services.“You’d have to put some sort of break on the reopening,” Murphy said. “You’d have no choice.” He said New Jersey is certain to see “some amount of spiking” as indoor activity increases, but he’s counting on testing and contact tracing to prevent mass flare-ups.New Jersey starting Monday allowed barber shops and salons to reopen, by appointment only and with masks and other precautions in place. Indoor shopping malls can open on June 29, but Murphy hasn’t set an opening date for movie theaters, indoor dining and gyms.S.C.

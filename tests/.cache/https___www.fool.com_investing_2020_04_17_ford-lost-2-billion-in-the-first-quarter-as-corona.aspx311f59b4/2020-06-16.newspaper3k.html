<span class="article-content"><p><strong>Ford Motor Company </strong>(<a href="https://www.fool.com/quote/nyse/ford-motor-company/f/">NYSE:F</a>) warned Friday that it will post a first-quarter net loss of about $2 billion on a sharp decline in sales due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>In a new <a href="http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0000037996/8ecc12ed-eb5a-4740-b41f-76340cf9fbe7.pdf" target="_blank">filing</a> with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday morning, Ford said that it expects to report a net loss of about $2 billion for the first quarter, on revenue of roughly $34 billion. Both numbers fell short of the consensus Wall Street estimates as reported by FactSet, which call for net income of $278.3 million on revenue of $35.4 billion.&#160;</p>

<p>Ford's Friday filing with the SEC amends a prior statement made by the company on Monday, in which it <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/04/13/ford-will-post-a-first-quarter-loss-but-it-still-h.aspx">disclosed the $34 billion revenue estimate</a> and said that it expected an adjusted operating loss of roughly $600 million for the first quarter, but said that it had not yet calculated its tax obligations. It now estimates that it will have about $800 million in tax expenses for the quarter.&#160;</p>
<p>Ford will present its complete first-quarter earnings report after the market closes on April 28.&#160;</p>
<p>In a separate SEC filing on Friday, in which Ford said that it intends to raise money via a series of new bond issues, the company disclosed that its plans to restart production of some models could be affected by damage to a supplier's factory.&#160;</p><p class="dfp-ads ad" id="div-content1_desk-416">

<p>A <strong>BorgWarner </strong>(<a href="https://www.fool.com/quote/nyse/borgwarner-inc/bwa/">NYSE:BWA</a>) factory in South Carolina suffered "significant damage" from a tornado on April 13, Ford said; that factory supplies parts for the four-wheel-drive versions of several Ford truck and SUV models.&#160;Ford said that it's not yet clear how long it will take to resume production of the parts.&#160;</p>
<p>Ford has not yet disclosed how much money it intends to raise via the bond issues, or when those bonds will be sold. The company had about $30 billion on hand as of April 9.&#160;</p>

Money or wealth can't buy happiness. Do you believe it? But what if you have all the financial resources to take control of your life? This money will improve the quality of your life. Financial empowerment is about earning enough money from sources other than your salary. It means you don't have to worry about when your next paycheck comes or how to pay your next mortgage installment.

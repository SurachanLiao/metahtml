Billionaire investor William Ackman, whose hedge fund is delivering some of the year's best returns, said on Monday he was looking to raise $3 billion and commit at least $1 billion for a new blank-check investment vehicle, the largest ever of its kind. The initial public offering of the special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), Pershing Square Tontine Holdings, Ltd, plans to offer 150 million units at $20 each, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. Pershing Square has the option to add more, for a total of up to $6.45 billion, the filing said.

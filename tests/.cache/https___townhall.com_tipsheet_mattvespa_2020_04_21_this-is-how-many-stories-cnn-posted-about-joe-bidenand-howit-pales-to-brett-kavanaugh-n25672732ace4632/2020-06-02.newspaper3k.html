<p>Do you hear that? It&#8217;s the silence of the liberal news media not covering Joe Biden&#8217;s <a href="https://townhall.com/columnists/mattvespa/2020/03/31/well-after-reading-his-accusers-account-of-what-sounds-like-rape-joe-biden-2020-is-canceled-n2566037">sexual assault claim from 1993</a>. A former staffer, Tara Reade, alleges that then-Sen. Joe Biden (D-DE) penetrated her with his fingers. It goes beyond the other creepiness the surrounds the former vice president. The touching, the smelling of women&#8217;s hair, and the overall handsy aspect of this man would have had him fired for sexual harassment at any other place of employment. Joe, you just can&#8217;t touch people and what Reade describes is quite horrific. Yet, Joe is a Democrat and the preemptive 2020 Democratic nominee. He&#8217;s already losing, needing his wife, Jill, to keep those senior moments at a minimum. You can&#8217;t have a credible sexual assault allegation further hamstring this guy. So, the liberal media is doing what they do best: deep-sixing the story. It&#8217;s trying to suffocate it with a pillow. Let&#8217;s pick on our favorite culprit, CNN. The anti-Trump network has just been kicked in the teeth again, totally screwing up a story about North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un&#8217;s health. And they&#8217;re doing the same with this story.&#160;</p><p class="thm-piano-mop"></p><p>I know, no shocker, but Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh was subjected to a coordinated political hit job, a character assassination effort not seen since Clarence Thomas. Democrats were looking to shame the GOP into caving on this guy. We didn&#8217;t. They wanted revenge for Merrick Garland, the Obama nominee that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked. He was out for revenge after the failed Robert Bork nomination. Kavanaugh was subjected to multiple allegations of sexual misconduct that could not be corroborated in any way. Doofus Christine Blasey Ford helmed a total clown show that ended with Julie Swetnick alleging that Kavanaugh was part of a gang-rape ring in high school. It was an overreach. It was unbelievable. And Swetnick pretty much recanted her entire allegation. It was a train wreck, but do you want to guess how many stories CNN has doled out on this story? How many they peddled about Kavanaugh? Well, The Daily Wire&#8217;s Ashe Schow, who reports on these stories, crunched the numbers and it&#8217;s staggering. We have some Grade-A <a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/cnn-finally-covers-sexual-assault-allegations-against-biden-had-nearly-700-articles-on-kavanaugh-accusations">liberal media bias here</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Tara Reade publicly stated on March 25 that presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Bide sexually assaulted her in 1993. She said Biden once &#8220;pinned her to a wall in a Senate building, reached under her clothing and penetrated her with his fingers,&#8221; according to an account in The New York Times</p><p>The Times took 19 days to report the allegations, even though the outlet immediately reported allegations against then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, a Republican.</p><p>CNN waited an additional five days to finally publish something about the allegations, meaning the outlet waited a whopping 24 days to cover serious allegations against a prominent politician. In contrast, CNN published nearly 700 articles about the Kavanaugh allegations in the span of 19 days between the time the allegations against Kavanaugh were made public and the Senate confirmed him.</p><p>CNN has now published something about Reade&#8217;s allegations that Biden sexually assaulted her nearly three decades ago while she worked for his Senate office, but the story written by CNN has less to do with the allegations and more about how other Democrats are &#8220;grappling&#8221; with them.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Remember the press spent a month essentially arguing that underage drinking was evidence that Kavanaugh committed sexual assault, but a long pattern of "hugs, kisses, and touching that women previously said made them uncomfortable" proves Biden's innocence. <a href="https://t.co/CPGr48o8nK">pic.twitter.com/CPGr48o8nK</a></p>&#8212; (((AG))) (@AGHamilton29) <a href="https://twitter.com/AGHamilton29/status/1249364556058591233?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 12, 2020</a></blockquote><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">I don't know whether Ms. Reade is telling the truth, and the presumption of innocence is a vital pillar of our justice system.

Truly remarkable. And these clowns wonder why we hate them so much.</p><p><br></p><p>Also, here&#8217;s Reade&#8217;s allegation, <a href="https://thefederalist.com/2020/03/27/read-biden-accusers-account-of-his-alleged-sexual-assault/">transcribed</a> by The Federalist&#8217;s Emily Jashinsky:</p><p><br></p><blockquote><p>[She] called me in and said, &#8216;I want you to take this to Joe. He wants it. He wants you to bring it, hurry.&#8217; And I said, &#8216;Okay,&#8217; and it was a gym bag. She said &#8216;take the gym bag.&#8217; She called it athletic bag. And she said he was down towards the Capitol and he&#8217;ll meet you. So I went down, and I was heading down towards there. And he was at first talking to someone, I could see him at a different distance and then they went away. And then we were in like this side area. And he just said, &#8216;Hey, come here, Tara.&#8217; And then I handed him the thing and he greeted me, he remembered my name.</p><p>And then we were alone, and it was the strangest thing. There was no exchange really. He just had me up against the wall. And I was wearing a skirt and, you know, business skirt, but I wasn&#8217;t wearing stockings. It was kind of a hot day that day and I was wearing heels. And I remember my legs had been hurting from the marble, you know of the Capitol, like walking. So I remember that kind of stuff. I remember I was wearing a blouse and he just had me up against the wall. And the wall was cold. It happened all at once. The gym bag, I don&#8217;t know where it went. I handed it to him, was gone. And then his hands were on me and underneath my clothes.</p><p>He went down my skirt, but then up inside it, and he penetrated me with his fingers. He was kissing me at the same time and he was saying something to me. He said several things, and I can&#8217;t remember everything. I remember a couple of things. I remember him saying first before, like, as he was doing it, &#8216;Do you want to go somewhere else?&#8217; And then him saying to me when I pulled away, he got finished doing what he was doing, and I kind of was pulled back and he said, he said, &#8216;Come on, man. I heard you liked me.&#8217; And that phrase stayed with me because I kept thinking, what I might have said, and I can&#8217;t remember exactly if he said &#8216;I thought &#8216;or if &#8216;I heard&#8217; but it&#8217;s like he implied like that I had done this like, I don&#8217;t know.</p><p>And for me, it was like everything shattered in that moment because I knew we alone. It was over, right? He wasn&#8217;t trying to do anything more. But I looked up to him. He was like my father&#8217;s age. He was this champion of women&#8217;s rights in my eyes, and I couldn&#8217;t believe what was happening. It seemed surreal. I just felt sick because he, when he pulled back, he looked annoyed. And he said, something else to me that I don&#8217;t want to say.* And then he said, I must have looked shocked, and he grabbed me by the shoulders. I don&#8217;t know how I looked, but I must have looked something because he grabbed me by the shoulders and he said, &#8216;You&#8217;re okay, you&#8217;re fine. You&#8217;re okay, you&#8217;re fine. &#8216; And then he walked away and he went on with his day.</p><p>And what I remember next is being in the Russell building, like where the big windows are, in the stairs by myself. My body, I was shaking everywhere because, it was cold all of a sudden, I was, I don&#8217;t know, I felt like I was shaking just everywhere, and I was trying to grasp what had just happened and what I should do, or what I should say. But I knew it was bad because he was so angry. Like when he left, I could feel, you know how when you know someone&#8217;s angry, they don&#8217;t necessarily say anything. Like he smiles when he&#8217;s angry. And you can just feel it emanating from him.</p></blockquote><p>'Believe All Women,' right Democrats? Why are you not helping Reade tell her story?</p>

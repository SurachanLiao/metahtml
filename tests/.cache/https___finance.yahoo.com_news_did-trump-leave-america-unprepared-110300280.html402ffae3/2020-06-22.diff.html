However, over the past three years the administration has weakened the offices in charge of preparing for and preventing this kind of outbreak.</p><p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" type="text">Two years ago, Microsoft founder and philanthropist Bill Gates warned that the world should be “preparing for a pandemic in the same serious way it prepares for war”. Gates, whose foundation has <a href="https://docs.gatesfoundation.org/documents/global-health-program-overview.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">invested heavily in global health</a>, suggested staging <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TheNewEnglandJournalofMedicine/videos/10155849069743462/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">simulations, war games and preparedness exercises</a> to simulate how diseases could spread and to identify the best response.</p><p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" type="text">The Trump administration has done exactly the opposite: It has slashed funding for the federal <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> and its infectious disease research. For fiscal year 2020, Trump proposed <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/budget/documents/fy2020/cdc-overview-factsheet.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">cutting the CDC budget by US$1.3 billion</a>, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/budget/fy2020/congressional-justification.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">nearly 20% below the 2019 level</a>.</p><p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" type="text">As a <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WFylm2wAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">specialist in budgeting</a>, I recognize that there are many claims on public resources. But when it comes to public health, I believe it is vital to invest early in prevention. Starving the CDC of critical funding will make it far harder for the government to react quickly to a public health emergency.</p><p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" type="text">Cutting funds and staff</p><p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" type="text">Every year since taking office, Trump has asked for deep cuts into research on emerging diseases – including the CDC’s small center on <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/onehealth/basics/zoonotic-diseases.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">emerging and “zoonotic” infectious diseases</a> that jump the species barrier from animals to humans. The new coronavirus is just the latest example of these threats.</p><p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" type="text">The CDC’s program focuses on infectious diseases ranging from foodborne illnesses to anthrax and Ebola. It manages laboratory, epidemiologic, analytic and prevention programs, and collaborates with state and local health departments, other federal government agencies, industry and foreign ministries of health.</p><p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" type="text">In 2018, Trump tried to <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/budget/fy2018/budget-in-brief/cdc/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">cut $65 million</a> from this budget – a 10% reduction. In 2019, he sought a 19% reduction. For 2020, he proposed to cut federal spending on emerging infectious and zoonotic diseases <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/budget/fy2020/congressional-justification.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">by 20%</a>. This would mean spending $100 million less in 2020 to study how such diseases infect humans than the U.S. did just two years ago.</p><p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" type="text">Congress reinstated most of this funding, with bipartisan support. But the overall level of appropriations for relevant CDC programs is still <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/budget/fy2018%5B/budget-in-brief/cdc/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">10% below what the U.S. spent in 2016</a>, adjusting for inflation.</p><p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" type="text">Even worse, in 2018 the administration <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2018/05/10/top-white-house-official-in-charge-of-pandemic-response-exits-abruptly/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">disbanded its own global health security team</a>, which was supposed to make the U.S. more resilient to the threat of epidemics. This unfortunate decision was part of a reorganization that former national security adviser John Bolton carried out shortly after arriving at the White House.</p><p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" type="text">Bolton eliminated the National Security Council’s global health security and biodefense directorate, and reshuffled its team of world-class infectious disease experts.

Bush and Barack Obama, Ziemer had served as the U.S. point person for a coordinated global anti-malaria campaign that helped reduce deaths from the disease by 60% over 15 years. In 2016 he estimated that funding initiatives to reduce malaria generated a <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2016/02/politics-biggest-threat-to-malaria-effort/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">36 to 1 return on investment</a> because it averted so many deaths and debilitating illnesses.</p><p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" type="text">In 2018 Ziemer was instrumental in fighting the <a href="https://www.usaid.gov/news-information/congressional-testimony/jun-4-2019-rear-admiral-tim-ziemer-aa-dcha-ebola" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">reemergence of Ebola</a> in the Democratic Republic of Congo, traveling there and working with public health officials to reduce the spread of the dreaded disease.</p><p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" type="text">A clear and present danger</p><p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" type="text">There is no wall high enough to keep virulent pathogens from crossing national borders, and when they emerge there is a potential for widespread illness and death.

Only 11 patients were treated for Ebola in the U.S., but that was because President Obama took the threat seriously, appointing an “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2014/10/17/obama-taps-ron-klain-as-ebola-czar/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Ebola czar</a>” to coordinate U.S. preparedness and assistance.</p><p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" type="text">Now that the White House has evicted the NSC’s global health security experts, it is not clear who in the Trump administration will be responsible for coordinating U.S. efforts in the event of a global pandemic.</p> <p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" type="text"><ins>The new coronavirus that emerged in Wuhan, China, has already <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/locations-confirmed-cases.html#map" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">spread to 25 countries Link: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/locations-confirmed-cases.html#map </a>.

            <p>The new sanctions come three weeks after the US killing of the Quds Force commander Qasem Soleimani in a missile strike</p>

      
            
          
           
                    
            
              
                <p>The United States on Thursday slapped economic sanctions on four petroleum firms that US officials accuse of moving oil exports for the Quds Force of Iran's Revolutionary Guards.</p>

<p>The new sanctions come three weeks after the US killing of the Quds Force commander Qasem Soleimani in a missile strike that Washington claimed was preemptive.</p>

<p>The US Treasury identified four entities -- two based in Hong Kong, one in Shanghai and another in Dubai -- saying they had together transferred "hundreds of millions of dollars' worth" of exports from the National Iranian Oil Company, thereby helping finance the Quds Force.</p>

<p>"Iran's petrochemical and petroleum sectors are a primary source of funding for the Iranian regime's global terrorist activities and enable its persistent use of violence against its own people," Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement.</p>

<p>Washington has recently also targeted other Iranian entities in the commodities, including metals companies and oil companies accused of supporting the Revolutionary Guards.</p>

<p>The firms targeted Tuesday are Triliance Petrochemical Co Ltd and Sage Energy HK Limited, both in Hong Kong, Peakview Industry Co Limited in Shanghai and Beneathco DMCC of Dubai.</p>

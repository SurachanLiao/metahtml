</p><p>Thank you Zanderboy! I listened to the Kryon you posted. It is one I missed. Prior to 2016/17 &#8211; I was fairly sporadic w/ listening/meditating.

</p><p>The reason why I find BFC comments so interesting, is the wide spectrum of personalities. That we are able to share in the same community with love, peace and respect is a hope for all other communities. A tiny but important taste of a new area. imo 
It would be quite dull if we all were alike&#8230;. shared the same stuff all the time. 
This way makes some expert on certain fields, others can benefit from, without doing all the time consuming research. 
With great respect to all!

You see, according to Casey, Washington could soon implement the most transformative currency law ever. This new law would not only give the government an unprecedented ability to track and control our money&#8230; but it could also destroy the U.S. dollar in the process.

</p><p>Jesus Campos, fake security guard who is not licenced, receives a hero&#8217;s award at MGM&#8217;s Jean Georges Steakhouse on October 10, complete with photos.

As the 2 main parties did not have sufficient votes to go it alone, it came down to Winston Peters and New Zealand First to negotiate the outcome and he chose Labour with also the Greens in the make up. Labour will have 16 seats and New Zealand First 4 seats at the Cabinet table. The Greens have 3 seats outside Cabinet and have guaranteed support on any votes for Supply or Confidence.

The ISIS web is global and intricate but it&#8217;s torn in a few places now and as Europe moves closer to Russia and the gaslines, it will collapse. It is interesting to note though, that it&#8217;s composed of lots of psychopaths and sharp shooters and these characters will have no where to go which means they&#8217;ll become a unit unto themselves and I think that was happening in Turkey.

</p><p>HUUUUUU- indeed. Ben&#8217;s comments on US Syria cooperation are dovetailing with Jim Willie&#8217;s conclusion that the US military isn&#8217;t going to fight the end of the dollar anymore, so hopefully we&#8217;ll see less engagement rather than more. This doesn&#8217;t mean that the dozens of mercenary units owned by corporations and secret organizations won&#8217;t field their own operatives. I&#8217;ve reached the conclusion that a lot of Trump is doing is aimed at minimizing the impact of the end of the dollar as global currency #1.

And then I thought about the fact that this is just the teeeenie tiiiiinie beginning of the outing of sexual perversity. And who knows how much entertainment delight and other institutions are going to go by the wayside as the truth comes out and folks are brought to justice.. either by being banned from their professions or more.

</p><p>Thanks littledogg for your sweet, uplifting comment. You are always a help to my spirits. I got one of those plugs and I&#8217;m a bit confused about the comments regarding wrapping a cord around you for healing. Does that mean an electric cord that has been in an outlet the plug was in? Should I keep it plugged in? It&#8217;s in my bedroom now and I had it in the office room where the computer is the last 2 days. I&#8217;m not sure what to look for in terms of indications except I resonate with it&#8217;s purpose and origin.

Hi Alan! 
Ok Alan! 48 hours&#8230;you know.. 
Just a tip! 
I (and others I think) have found out if something urgent pain or whatever&#8230;a cord around your body on that area helps a lot. I think that would work fast, as it did to my chest pain I wrote about. 
The cord in the outlet that is..

</p><p>Hi Caf&#233; and OLP group,</p><p>My 3 Lemurian Plugs have arrived and are being put to immediate use as Alexis is suffering from another bout of diverticulitis. She had one plug against her body all last night, but too early to know yet. She usually needs to see the doctor to get anti-B&#8217;s for this, but we are attempting to see if the plug and codine will do this time.</p><p>I will let you all know our experiences with the plug.</p><p>Namaste.

</p><p>Well, it&#8217;s going to be interesting to see how long this guy lives. Rocky Palermo, who was wounded in the shooting, has quite the tale to tell, and he&#8217;s been telling it everywhere he can. Here&#8217;s an excerpt: &#8230;Shockingly, he then goes on to detail the fact that at the end of the concert the previous two nights everyone had exited a specific way but on the night of the shooting this route was locked down shortly before the attack. &#8220;Every other night at the concert, everybody kinda exited right off Las Vegas Blvd, that was standard, that was routine,<span id="wpdiscuz-readmore-393286_0"><span class="wpdiscuz-hellip">&#8230;&#160;</span><span class="wpdiscuz-readmore" title="Read more &#187;">Read more &#187;</span></span></p><p class="wpd-vote-result wpd-vote-result-like">0</p><p class="wpd-vote-result wpd-vote-result-dislike">0</p><p class="wpd-comment-author wcai-uname-info wcai-not-clicked">

</p><p>Some conflicting material in an otherwise encouraging report. As was pointed out, how do we explain all the dead sea life reported along the California coastline? Was this all fake news? There were also reports of technicians dying when they went in to fix the reactors. There were posts of the radiated water spilling into the Pacific. There was some radiation there fore sure. I recall some reports that beneficent ET&#8217;s were vacuuming up the radiation so it wouldn&#8217;t destroy the planet. Who knows. Trump&#8217;s foreign policy certainly supports the premise that he is being blackmailed since he has appeared<span id="wpdiscuz-readmore-393284_0"><span class="wpdiscuz-hellip">&#8230;&#160;</span><span class="wpdiscuz-readmore" title="Read more &#187;">Read more &#187;</span></span></p><p class="wpd-vote-result wpd-vote-result-like">0</p><p class="wpd-vote-result wpd-vote-result-dislike">0</p><p class="wpd-comment-author wcai-uname-info wcai-not-clicked">

</p><p>Many people write about the reincarnation trap, so I&#8217;ve been asking about it for awhile and finally got it all explained to me. As you may know 40% of your soul stays on the soul plane while you are incarnated and living. After you die you only get 2 choices, you can stay where you are or you can go to the other side which is the soul plane and be reunited with the other 40% of your soul. There is no other way to go. Stay and be a ghost with only 60% of your soul for up to<span id="wpdiscuz-readmore-393283_0"><span class="wpdiscuz-hellip">&#8230;&#160;</span><span class="wpdiscuz-readmore" title="Read more &#187;">Read more &#187;</span></span></p><p class="wpd-vote-result wpd-vote-result-like">0</p><p class="wpd-vote-result wpd-vote-result-dislike">0</p><p class="wpd-comment-author wcai-uname-info wcai-not-clicked">

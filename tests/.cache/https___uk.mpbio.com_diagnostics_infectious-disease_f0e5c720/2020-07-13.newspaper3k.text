Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease that has rapidly spread globally these recent years. The WHO estimated that there are 390 million dengue infections worldwide every year. 3.9 billion people are at risk of contracting dengue in 128 countries. There are 4 serotypes of the virus that cause dengue (DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3 and DEN-4). Recovery from infection by one provides lifelong immunity against that particular serotype. The MP Diagnostics MULTISURE Dengue Ab/Ag Point-of-Care Test is the first and only rapid diagnostic test that is capable of detecting 4 serotypes and differentiating the NS1 antigen and IgA/IgM/IgG antibodies in one single test.

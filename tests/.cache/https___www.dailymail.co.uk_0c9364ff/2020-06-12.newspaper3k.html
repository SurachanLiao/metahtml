            The dramatic discovery was one of the most extraordinary archaeological achievements of all time (top left, British Archaeologist Howard Carter, third from right, and the men behind the historic expedition). And now - nearly a century after the tomb of 'Boy King' Tutankhamun was uncovered (a view of the northern wall of the tomb, showing life-size statues of Tutankhamun, bottom right) - the incredible scenes can be seen in full colour for the first time (Carter and his team removing the wall between the Antechamber and Burial Chamber, bottom, left and centre). The ancient Egyptian pharaoh's intact tomb (precious artefact is removed using a pulley system, top right) was found on November 4, 1922, by Carter. And the pictures bring vividly to life the discovery of the final resting place of Tutankhamun, who ruled Egypt around 1334-1325BC, and is said to have died when he was about 18. Pictured top right, inset: Hussein Abdul-Rasoul, who discovered the steps leading to the tomb, wearing a pectoral pendant that belonged to Tutankhamun, and left, centre: Egyptian archaeological workers excavating in the Valley of the Kings.

<div><p>Does the US want to assassinate North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un? If real, a plan like that&#160;would certainly address&#160;a bunch of problems for the Trump administration, and for the rest of the&#160;world. Or, it would be just the kind of pretext the totalitarian regime north of the wall needs to start a nuclear war.</p>
<p>Well, it turns out North Korea really believes that the US and South Korea have been working together to kill Kim by using biochemical weapons.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p><p>According to <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2017/05/05/asia/north-korea-kim-assassination/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">CNN</a>, North Korean state news agency KCNA uncovered a &#8220;hideous&#8221; plot by a&#160;terrorist group that attempted to kill the supreme leader.</p>
<p>In a 1,800-word report, the agency said that the plot involved a North Korean citizen and the use of &#8220;biochemical substances including radioactive substance and nano poisonous substance&#8221; to target Kim during a major event such as a military parade. No evidence whatsoever was provided in the report.</p>

		<p>This CNN paragraph tells the whole story and reads like a synopsis for an action movie that Hollywood should really consider making.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>KCNA laid out the alleged plot in great detail, saying it was hatched in 2014 when the South Korean and US intelligence agencies recruited a North Korean working in the timber industry in eastern Russia. Further contacts were made over subsequent years, and the assassination attempt was to have taken place at a military parade, KCNA said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The report didn&#8217;t say when the plot was foiled, but only that it was &#8220;uncovered and smashed&#8221; recently.</p>
<p>CNN points out that South Korea&#8217;s plans to kill Kim aren&#8217;t secret &#8212; well not all of them. There is at least one retaliatory plan that includes targeting North Korea&#8217;s leadership if South Korea feels threatened by nuclear attack.</p>

My dad, Richard Salbato died peacefully on February 24, 2016 at 7:30 pm while my daughter and I were praying the rosary with him.



His funeral Mass will be held at Our Lady of the Lake, Catholic Church at 27627 Rim of the World Drive, Lake Arrowhead, CA on Saturday March 5, 2016 at 11:00 am.



Father has offered to hear confessions before Mass as it is a First Saturday and any of you who know him will know how much that would mean to him.



My cell phone is 909-844-1265 and my email is (kelly@firejobs.com) if you have any questions.



In Christ, Kelly Salbato

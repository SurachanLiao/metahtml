</ins></p><p><ins><a href="http://twitter.com/share" class="twitter-share-button">Tweet Link: http://twitter.com/share </a> </ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>At the risk of seeming monomaniacal* about the Flynn case, I think it would be interesting to explore and discuss what would be the proper bounds of Judge Sullivan‘s discretion if the case were to go en banc, the absurd Court of Appeals panel decision were to be reversed, and Judge Sullivan were allowed to conduct a hearing on the Government’s motion to dismiss.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The Government’s central position throughout is to intone the phrase “separation of powers” over and over. The Government’s attorney stammered somewhat at the oral argument when it was pointed out to him that any potential violation of the separation of powers by merely allowing an inquiry into the Government’s reasoning was an injury, not to Flynn, but to the Government — which had not filed its own request for relief. Oops! But while that technicality alone would justify denying relief, let’s examine the separation of powers issues anyway. I propose to do so through presenting some (I hope) easy hypotheticals that illustrate the points I am making. I know I have proposed some more limited form of these hypotheticals in the past, but here I think it’s worth spinning out at some length.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Assume the Government comes to court and says it wishes to dismiss the case for the following reasons. Assume each given justification is the sole justification; we’re not adding these up but imagining several different situations in which the Government offers a single justification. (You’ll notice that many of these hypothetical justifications are unrealistically frank; just pretend you’re watching a scene from “Liar Liar” with Jim Carrey.)</ins></p><ins> </ins><ul><li><ins>1. We request to dismiss this case because the lead prosecutor was bribed. He is not representing the true position of the Department of Justice, which wants to continue the prosecution. But dismiss it anyway.</ins></li><ins> </ins></ul><ins> </ins><ul><li><ins>2. We request to dismiss this case because the Attorney General and the President were bribed and therefore this is the true position of the Department of Justice.</ins></li><ins> </ins></ul><ins> </ins><ul><li><ins>3. We request to dismiss this case because we think lilacs are very pretty flowers.</ins></li><ins> </ins></ul><ins> </ins><ul><li><ins>4. We request to dismiss this case because as it turns out Mike Flynn never actually talked to the FBI. In fact he’s never talked to anyone. Turns out he’s a deaf mute and thus lacks the ability to speak and to make any statement, true or false. So we have determined he could not make false statements.</ins></li><ins> </ins></ul><ins> </ins><ul><li><ins>5. We request to dismiss this case because Michael Flynn is white and President Trump has said we should dismiss all cases against white people except for Michael Cohen.</ins></li><ins> </ins></ul><ins> </ins><ul><li><ins>6. We request to dismiss this case because, even though the facts and law warrant the prosecution, the President wants to keep Michael Flynn happy so that Flynn does not incriminate President Trump.</ins></li><ins> </ins></ul><ins> </ins><ul><li><ins>7. We request to dismiss this case because, even though the facts and law warrant the prosecution, Michael Flynn is President Trump’s buddy and he wants to let his buddies go while having us prosecute his enemies.</ins></li><ins> </ins></ul><ins> </ins><ul><li><ins>8. We request to dismiss this case because we say so.</ins></li><ins> </ins></ul><ins> </ins><p><ins>Me, I see all of these as insufficient to justify the granting of a Rule 48 motion to dismiss. To me, there has to be some reason offered, making #8 insufficient. The motion to dismiss can’t be motivated by rank corruption such as bribery (#1), even if it represents the true position of DoJ by reason of that bribery (#2). The reason must bear some relevance to the case (#3) and it can’t be a patently fabricated falsehood that is contradicted by every scrap of paper in the case and all evidence available to the five senses (#4). I don’t think the reason could be a blatantly unconstitutional reason like race (#5) and I personally believe that it could not be justified for patently corrupt reasons (such as #6) or even purely out of cronyism (#7).</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>I think if DoJ were to come and actually offer one of these justifications, the court could use the power granted to it by Rule 48 to deny the motion because it found the justification either insufficient or blatantly contrary to the public interest.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Now imagine a different scenario. In its motion, the Government gives Reason No. 8: no reason at all. Unbeknownst to the court, the true reason is Reason No. 1 (the line prosecutor has been bribed). The judge says: well, that’s insufficient. I’m going to put you under oath and ask you if you have been bribed. The Government seeks a writ from the Court of Appeal citing separation of powers concerns. The judge is not allowed to ask me if I have been bribed!</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Would the Court of Appeal grant that writ?</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Imagine the same scenario for each of the remaining justifications. The Government offers no reason in its motion, but in reality its secret reason is that the prosecutor thinks lilacs are pretty, or wants to cut a break to a white guy, or … that he was told to dismiss the case because President Trump wants to get his buddy off.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Are you telling me it violates the Constitution for the judge to simply say he wants to inquire further?</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>To me, that’s an easy question to answer. Of course not. It seems to me that the court should be allowed to inquire into the reasons, at least in some minimal fashion such as asking the decisionmakers questions about whether the proffered reasons are irrelevant, blatantly false, corrupt, and so forth.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>He should at least be allowed to ask.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Now whether he is entitled to dismiss the case once he gets his truthful answer (if he does) is arguably a slightly harder question, depending on the scenario and depending on your view of the separation of powers. I’ll bet you the Separation of Powers crowd thinks that some of these justifications *(or lack thereof) are just peachy. I’m confident they think that the Government can march in and offer no reason at all, as in Scenario No. 8, and demand that the court dismiss. I bet they think several of the other justifications are fine, whether disclosed or held secret.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Their views might frighten you. But it certainly would be interesting to know how far they’d be willing to take this.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>These are the sorts of questions that I think should be asked at any argument in this case — perhaps not on mandamus, where the relief is obviously not available for technical reasons having to do with who is injured and alternative means of addressing any injury. But these are the questions that go to the heart of why we have a leave of court requirement.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Just how far are the authoritarians willing to go?</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>*My philosophy is, when I get interested in a topic, I can add value by discussing it in depth. If you are coming here for your daily news and you are upset that I am not simply reciting the top story of the day, you don’t really understand this blog and you likely never will.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="feedback"><ins><a href="http://patterico.com/2020/06/25/just-how-far-is-the-separation-of-powers-crowd-willing-to-go/#comments">Comments (14) Link: http://patterico.com/2020/06/25/just-how-far-is-the-separation-of-powers-crowd-willing-to-go/#comments </a> </ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="post" id="post-153157"><ins></ins></p><h3 class="storytitle"><ins><a href="http://patterico.com/2020/06/25/stalins-revenge-america-tries-out-cancel-culture/" rel="bookmark" title="Stalin’s Revenge: America Tries Out Cancel Culture">Stalin’s Revenge: America Tries Out Cancel Culture Link: http://patterico.com/2020/06/25/stalins-revenge-america-tries-out-cancel-culture/ </a></ins></h3><ins> </ins><p class="meta"><ins>Filed under:                  <a href="http://patterico.com/category/general/" rel="category tag">General Link: http://patterico.com/category/general/ </a> —

</ins></p><p><ins><a href="http://twitter.com/share" class="twitter-share-button">Tweet Link: http://twitter.com/share </a> </ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>[guest post by JVW]</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>One of the ugliest of phenomena in recent years is the rise in <a href="http://patterico.com/2020/06/09/cancel-culture-goes-off-the-rails/">cancel culture Link: http://patterico.com/2020/06/09/cancel-culture-goes-off-the-rails/ </a> whereby offensive actions, even those taken years earlier during one’s adolescence, are used to place the offender outside the bounds of public approbation, generally resulting in job loss, school expulsions, and public ostracization. The rise of social media, with years’ worth of off-the-cuff utterances and quips preserved for eternity (or, worse, screen-capped before you have a chance to delete them) make all of us easy targets for this horrid game.  And given the current dominance of progressive ideology in education, media, and the corporate world, it’s those who fall afoul of conventional woke regulations who most often find themselves cancelled.  Though this notion dates back for years and years — even in the pre-Red Scare days — it has certainly ramped up in our divided and digital age.  Herewith are some of the notable victims and most egregious examples:</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Example 1 
Sue Schafer is a young graphic designer who attended a Halloween party at the home of Washington Post cartoonist Tom Toles back in 2018. Because NBC hostess Megyn Kelly had just been fired for offering a defense of wearing blackface for costume purposes, Ms. Schafer thought it would be clever if she dressed as Megyn Kelly in blackface.  As the kids would say, the concept was meta. Unfortunately the partygoers did not agree, and Ms. Schafer’s costume was openly criticized much to her embarrassment.  End of story?  Hardly.  For some reason, the Bezos Bugle decided that eighteen months later an account of Ms. Schafer’s social transgression would make for a delightful 3,000-word story which would, of course, end up getting her fired from her job. Josh Barro and Olivia Nuzzi <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/06/why-did-the-washington-post-get-this-woman-fired.html">relate the story Link: https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/06/why-did-the-washington-post-get-this-woman-fired.html </a> in New York Magazine. Fun tidbit: ten different WaPo staffers tell Mr. Barro and Ms. Nuzzi that the general consensus in the newsroom is that the paper was wrong to rat on a woman who serves no public role for a noncriminal offense to public mores, yet no WaPo staffers are apparently willing to go on the record with their objections. Keep that in mind next time you hear a media type bloviate about speaking truth to power or afflicting the comfortable or some other such nonsense. At heart they are mostly self-interested cowards.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>[UPDATE: Corrected the spelling of Mr. Barro’s last name. Thanks to Dana for noticing.]</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Example 2 
In the aftermath of the George Floyd killing, MIT’s Tech Catholic Community chaplain Father Daniel Moloney (disclosure: my alma mater, and I spent a bit of time with TCC during my undergrad days and donate money to them annually as an alumnus) sent out <a href="https://thetech.com/2020/06/17/catholic-chaplain-resigns">a rather ill-advised email message Link: https://thetech.com/2020/06/17/catholic-chaplain-resigns </a> to TCC members which reminded the community that Mr. Floyd “had not lived a virtuous life” (this is <a href="https://newbostonpost.com/2020/06/19/fact-checking-father-daniel-moloneys-email-message-to-m-i-t-catholics/">largely true Link: https://newbostonpost.com/2020/06/19/fact-checking-father-daniel-moloneys-email-message-to-m-i-t-catholics/ </a>, if perhaps a harsh thing to say as the body cools in the morgue) and asserted that we could not yet say definitively that his death was an act of police racism or that police departments have an inherent problem with racism. Fr. Moloney did point out that nothing Mr. Floyd may have done was enough to justify taking his life, and reminded TCC members of Church teachings on the evil of racism and the need for solidarity with our fellow man. Once upon a time in an academic setting like MIT we might have expected Fr. Moloney’s controversial message to have spurred a great and vigorous debate across students, faculty &amp; staff, alumni, and the greater campus community, but here in 2020 agitated parties cried out about the pain and fear that a Catholic priest’s email message had engendered within them, and prevailed upon the historically incompetent Archdiocese of Boston (with a significant assist from the cowardly MIT administration) to remove him as chaplain. Fr. Moloney resigned his position a few days later, almost certainly at the behest of the Archbishop.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Example 3 
Famed author J.K. Rowling of Harry Potter fame has earned the enmity of the loud, powerful, and vindictive transgender lobby because she refuses to adopt the trendy decree that one who believes strongly that one is a woman is by definition a woman, no matter if the biological realities suggest something different. Ms. Rowling has actually been expressing this belief for the past several months, much to the chagrin of the dogmatic trans lobby, but given recent developments it makes perfect sense that this battle be reengaged at this opportune moment when imperious leftist thought is ascendant. An obviously talented writer, Ms. Rowling has <a href="https://www.jkrowling.com/opinions/j-k-rowling-writes-about-her-reasons-for-speaking-out-on-sex-and-gender-issues/">shared her thoughts Link: https://www.jkrowling.com/opinions/j-k-rowling-writes-about-her-reasons-for-speaking-out-on-sex-and-gender-issues/ </a> on her personal blog. For straying outside of groupthink the activist community <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/emmapocock/2020/06/23/harry-potter-stars--fan-community-reject-jk-rowlings-statement-on-trans-activism-and-gender-identity/#22da16ec295d">has demanded Link: https://www.forbes.com/sites/emmapocock/2020/06/23/harry-potter-stars--fan-community-reject-jk-rowlings-statement-on-trans-activism-and-gender-identity/#22da16ec295d </a> that Ms. Rowling be dropped by her publisher and some snotty little actors whom Ms. Rowling has made phenomenally wealthy have taken to publicly criticizing her for the crime of — you guessed it — intolerance. Though Ms. Rowling is far too much of a money earner (at least for now, though the Harry Potter books will probably always be a cash cow, insipid though they may be) to be dropped by big publishing or Hollywood, her case shows that even the incredibly influential (Ms. Rowling surpassed Her Majesty the Queen as the wealthiest woman in England a few years back) are subject to attempts to silence their nonconforming opinions. And in reading about Ms. Rowling’s case it is sickening to contemplate how the trans lobby in England has used favorable court rulings and laws inimical to free speech to dominate the so-called science of transgenderism to the degree that any dissenting voices are automatically ruled out of order.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Example 4 
We’re back to the nonsense about the White Power/OK sign. A worker for the San Diego Gas and Electric Company, Emmanuel Cafferty (who self-identifies as Mexican-American by the way), was <a href="https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/sdge-worker-fired-over-alleged-racist-gesture-says-he-was-cracking-knuckles/2347414/">driving in his SDG&amp;E truck Link: https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/sdge-worker-fired-over-alleged-racist-gesture-says-he-was-cracking-knuckles/2347414/ </a> when he realized he was being followed by a fellow motorist. The motorist snapped and posted to Twitter a picture of Mr. Cafferty (shown at the link) with his left hand dangling out of the driver’s side window and his fingers arranged in that configuration where your thumb and forefinger touch while your remaining three fingers are mostly extended and splayed. Neo-nazi groups claim that the three fingers form the letter “W” while the other two work in tandem with the wrist and forearm to create a “P,” giving us the overall effect of “WP” for “white power.” The rest of us recall it as the universal symbol for “OK,” and Mr. Cafferty claims to have been cracking his knuckles at that moment. Back in the carefree Twenty-teens this would have had all of us rolling our eyes in boredom, but in 2020 it is enough to have Mr. Cafferty first suspended and then dismissed from his job.  SDG&amp;E says that they performed “a thorough investigation” and perhaps there is more to the story than we are privy to, but absent a convincing account of the menace of Mexican-American White Nationalists in the greater San Diego area and assuming that Mr. Cafferty is preparing to file suit against SDG&amp;E for wrongful termination, I’m going to assume that this is just the typical overreaction by a utility that is answerable to weak-kneed politicians and a public with far too much time on its hands.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Example 5 
Joyce Kenner is <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-cps-joyce-kenner-black-students-matter-20200613-v6q4i7thnfeajovlihv5jyxxkq-story.html">the principal Link: https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-cps-joyce-kenner-black-students-matter-20200613-v6q4i7thnfeajovlihv5jyxxkq-story.html </a> of Whitney M. Young Magnet High School in Chicago, a <a href="https://www.greatschools.org/illinois/chicago/1039-Young-Magnet-High-School/">prestigious institution Link: https://www.greatschools.org/illinois/chicago/1039-Young-Magnet-High-School/ </a> with a long waiting list of high-achieving kids who would love to enroll. The demographics of the school are roughly 50% black and Latino and 50% white and Asian.  Principal Kenner is herself African-American and as an eleven-year-old girl participated in protest marches after the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. She has also raised a son in Chicago, so she is well aware of the tensions that young black males often have with law enforcement. When the George Floyd protests geared up she sent out a message to her COVID-secluded students sharing her sadness at the senselessness of Mr. Floyd’s death but encouraging them to avoid engaging in violent and illegal acts during protests. She has also continually resisted calls for removing armed Chicago Police officers from the school, citing the problems with gangs and school shootings as adequate reasons to continue requiring their presence. For her commonsense approach to running an high-performing urban school, Ms. Kenner is now the subject of petitions seeking to have her removed as principal, alleging that she is trying to silence student activists who support Black Lives Matter and that she continues to enable systemic oppression of black and brown students at the school. African-American parents further complain that a school that was once majority black has become more diverse (ironies abound, eh?) as the Latino population of Chicago increases and as whites and Asians apply for coveted slots at the school, factors which can hardly be blamed on the principal. Fortunately, Ms. Kenner does not appear to be willing to back down, and is fighting to retain her job. But given the current climate, I can only wish her much luck in the battle.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Over at National Review Online, Zachary Evans and John Loftus are compiling <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/news/the-cancel-counter/">a handy list Link: https://www.nationalreview.com/news/the-cancel-counter/ </a> of all of the attempts to drive a person, living or dead, out of the public square. It includes, I believe, all of the examples cited above as well as dozens more, with the list sadly growing every day. Very depressing indeed, though somewhere in hell Joe Stalin and Mao Zedong are smiling in appreciation.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>– JVW</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="feedback"><ins><a href="http://patterico.com/2020/06/25/stalins-revenge-america-tries-out-cancel-culture/#comments">Comments (57) Link: http://patterico.com/2020/06/25/stalins-revenge-america-tries-out-cancel-culture/#comments </a> </ins></p><ins> </ins><h2><ins>6/24/2020</ins></h2><ins> </ins><p class="post" id="post-153171"><ins></ins></p><h3 class="storytitle"><ins><a href="http://patterico.com/2020/06/24/court-decision-favoring-flynn-is-dishonesty-of-the-sort-we-have-not-seen-since-impeachment/" rel="bookmark" title="Court Decision Favoring Flynn Is Dishonesty of the Sort We Have Not Seen Since Impeachment">Court Decision Favoring Flynn Is Dishonesty of the Sort We Have Not Seen Since Impeachment Link: http://patterico.com/2020/06/24/court-decision-favoring-flynn-is-dishonesty-of-the-sort-we-have-not-seen-since-impeachment/ </a></ins></h3><ins> </ins><p class="meta"><ins>Filed under:                  <a href="http://patterico.com/category/general/" rel="category tag">General Link: http://patterico.com/category/general/ </a> —

</ins></p><p><ins><a href="http://twitter.com/share" class="twitter-share-button">Tweet Link: http://twitter.com/share </a> </ins></p> <p>So <a href="https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/7045-dc-circuit-mandamus-dismisses/ef44c65545d041cf54c7/optimized/full.pdf#page=1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Flynn decision</a> came out this morning, and while I had a chance to <a href="http://patterico.com/2020/06/24/corruption-wins-for-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">briefly comment on it and put it in its proper context</a>, I have not yet had a chance to analyze the ruling in detail. Until now.*</p> <p>This passage from Judge Rao’s opinion encapsulates everything that is wrong with the decision:</p> <blockquote><p>The government’s representations about the insufficiency of the evidence are entitled to a “presumption of regularity … in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary.” United States v. Armstrong, 517 U.S. 456, 464 (1996) (quotation marks omitted). On the record before the district court, there is no clear evidence contrary to the government’s representations. The justifications the district court offers in support of further inquiry — for instance, that only the U.S. Attorney signed the motion, without any line prosecutors, and that the motion is longer than most Rule 48(a) motions — are insufficient to rebut the presumption of regularity to which the government is entitled.</p></blockquote> <p>There is a double sleight of hand going on here, and I am happy to explain it. I will call the first sleight of hand the “Shifting Standard” move, because the standards discussed by Judge Rao are the standards to deny a Rule 48 motion, not to hold a hearing about one. The second move is very, very important. I call it the Dishonest Two-Step:</p> <blockquote><p>Step 1: You do not get to put on evidence. 
Step 2: I rule against you because you have put on no evidence.</p></blockquote> <p>Remember that because I will keep coming back to it. This is what is happening when Judge Rao tells you, with a straight face, that “[o]n the record before the district court” there is “no clear evidence to contradict the government’s representations.” To anyone with a brain and an attention span of any reasonable length, that assertion ignores the fact that the district court had no chance to develop any sort of record at <ins>all.</ins> <del>all.</del> </p> <p>Through her laughable opinion, Rao uses both of these deceptive moves — the Shifting Standard move and the Dishonest Two-Step. Rao consistently writes the opinion as if Judge Sullivan had heard and denied the motion and she was merely applying standards from case law that go to the question of whether the denial should be upheld. (The Shifting Standard move.) As she engages in this trickery, Judge Rao blinks her eyes innocently and says “well, gee, there just isn’t enough evidence here to meet the standard!” knowing all the while that she has prevented the hearing from happening and prevented any evidence from being put in the <ins>record.</ins> <del>record.</del> (The Dishonest Two-Step.)</p> <p>Before I get further into the weeds and risk losing the reader’s attention, I want to make the point that there is a nasty precedent for the Orwellian Dishonest Two-Step: “We will decree that no evidence will be presented, and then rule against you because no evidence was presented.” If the Dishonest Two-Step sounds familiar, it’s what the GOP did in Trump’s impeachment. They voted against hearing from witnesses and the issuance of subpoenas, and then voted that no evidence had been presented. They voted against hearing from John Bolton, who had firsthand knowledge that the President tied aid to personal favors … and then voted to acquit because there was no evidence that anyone had firsthand knowledge that the President tied aid to personal favors.</p> <p>Indeed, we saw this Dishonest Two-Step attitude on display just today, when two Department of Justice attorneys testified to shocking political interference with decisionmaking over antitrust enforcement and the sentencing recommendation for a criminal pal of the President. Jim Jordan, eternally bereft of both jackets and shame, pressed Roger Stone prosecutor Aaron Zelinsky as to whether he had ever spoken directly to Bill Barr or other high-level DoJ officials about their demands that he forego usual DoJ practices, in order to benefit Stone. Zelinsky replied that he had asked to speak with these officials but had been refused. Jordan then compared his lack of knowledge to that of the witnesses from the impeachment! (He was right, but for the wrong reasons!)</p> <p>Zelinsky was also asked, by Jordan and others, about whether he could justify certain actions taken by the Special Counsel — actions that I suspect he could easily justify, but (he explained) he had not been cleared by DoJ to talk about. His inability to talk was treated as an admission of guilt by every Republican lawmaker to employ the tactic.</p> <p>Now, it’s time for an old-fashioned fisting fisking. Watch as I quote yet another passage from Rao’s opinion where she 1) applies the Shifting Standard move (applying the standard for ruling on a dismissal to a decision about whether a hearing can take place); 2) applies the Dishonest Two-Step, and 3) (bonus dishonesty): mischaracterizes the dissent’s argument (this part will take even more space to show). Whee! Let’s get started!</p> <blockquote><p>[T]he dissent glosses over the presumption of regularity to which the Executive is entitled in the exercise of its prosecutorial discretion. While the district court is not a “rubber stamp” when considering whether to grant “leave of court” under Rule 48, Ammidown, 497 F.2d at 622, any judicial inquiry is strictly bounded by the presumption of regularity, and the presumption is overcome only in extraordinary cases and by “clear evidence to the contrary,” Armstrong, 517 U.S. at <ins>464.</ins> <del>464.</del> </p></blockquote> <p>Oh, Judge Rao, we notice the Shifting Standard move! The language bolded above to the effect that <ins>“any</ins> <del>“any</del> judicial inquiry is strictly bounded by the presumption of regularity, and the presumption is overcome only in extraordinary cases and by “clear evidence to the <ins>contrary”</ins> <del>contrary”</del> has nothing to do with whether the court can hold a hearing. So it’s another example of the Shifting Standard move I noted above: Rao applying “the standard for ruling on a dismissal to a decision about whether a hearing can take place.” If you doubt me, read <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/517/456/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Armstrong case</a> and correct me.</p> <p>Moving on:</p> <blockquote><p>The dissent fundamentally misstates our opinion by insisting we hold “a district court may not even consider [a Rule 48 motion] before giving its ‘leave.’”</p></blockquote> <p>ORLY? Well, put a pin in that.</p> <blockquote><p>Perhaps that is to distract from the simple fact that neither the dissent nor the district judge has identified a legitimate basis to rebut the presumption here. Our precedents emphatically leave prosecutorial charging decisions to the Executive Branch and hold that a court may scrutinize a motion to dismiss only on the extraordinary showing of harassment of the defendant or malfeasance such as bribery — neither of which is manifest in the record before the district <ins>court.</ins> <del>court.</del> </p></blockquote> <p>Well done, Judge Rao! Two fallacies in a single sentence. First there’s the Shifting Standard move again: <ins>“and</ins> <del>“and</del> hold that a court may scrutinize a motion to dismiss only on the extraordinary showing of harassment of the defendant or malfeasance such as <ins>bribery.”</ins> <del>bribery.”</del> Um, [coughs into hand] bullshit. Not a single one of the cases you cite says that a court may “scrutinize” (read: a court may hold a hearing concerning the issue of whether to grant) a motion to dismiss “only on the extraordinary showing of harassment of the defendant or malfeasance such as bribery.” The cases you cite allowed the district judge to hold a hearing and merely found that a motion to dismiss could not be granted absent showings of the sort you describe.</p> <p>And immediately after this, in the same sentence, you use the Dishonest Two-Step, stating <ins>“neither</ins> <del>“neither</del> of which is manifest in the record before the district <ins>court” </ins> <del>court” </del> …</p> <p>…</p> <p>…</p> <p>… because, of course, you have prevented the district court from developing any sort of record at all. It’s … it’s kind of like you held that a district court may not even consider a Rule 48 motion before giving its leave. (Remember? That’s the part we put a pin in.)</p> <p>Now we come to a more complicated but equally dishonest argument. Judge Rao says:</p> <blockquote><p>The dissent argues the presumption is overcome in this case because of the government’s “complete reversal” in moving to dismiss charges it previously supported. Dissenting Op. 17–18. Yet the government necessarily reverses its position whenever it moves to dismiss charges under Rule 48(a), and so the reversal standing alone cannot provide the irregularity. Given the absence of any legitimate basis to question the presumption of regularity, there is no justification to appoint a private citizen to oppose the government’s motion to dismiss Flynn’s prosecution.</p></blockquote> <p>Let’s actually read the part of the dissent referred to by the bolded language. Keep in mind that, according to Judge Rao, the dissent’s reference to the government’s “complete reversal” supposedly is an effort by the dissent to show that the presumption of regularity has been overcome such that the district judge is allowed to hold a hearing. In other words, according to Judge Rao, the dissent accepts her (totally made up by her) claim that, in order to even hold a hearing, a district judge must come up with evidence that overcomes the presumption of regularity. And here (she says), the dissent’s claim is that this evidence comes in the form of the government’s reversal. Now read the actual language of the dissent and see if it actually says what Judge Rao has claimed it says: </p> <blockquote><p>The majority opinion effectively transforms the presumption of regularity into an impenetrable shield. In 2017, the then-Acting Attorney General told the Vice President that Flynn’s false statements “posed a potential compromise situation for Flynn” with the Russians, Gov’t Mot. Dismiss Crim. Info. Ex. 3 at 8, No. 1:17-cr-232, ECF No. 198-4 (May 7, 2020), and just a few months ago, the prosecution said that Flynn’s false statements to the FBI “went to the heart” of a valid counterintelligence inquiry and “were absolutely material,” Gov’t Surreply Mot. Compel Produc. Brady Mat. at 10–11,No.1:17-cr-232, ECF No. 132 (Nov.1,2019). Now, in a complete reversal, the Government says none of this is true. Gov’t Mot. Dismiss Crim. Info. at 13–16, No. 1:17-cr- 232, ECF No. 198. The Government doubles down by asserting in its motion to dismiss that Flynn’s statements could not have been “material” within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. § 1001 because the FBI had no grounds for any “viable” investigation of Flynn at the time he made those statements, id. at 13, even though that contention appears squarely belied by our precedent, see United States v. Moore, 612 F.3d 698, 701 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (“We . . . hold[] a statement is material if it has a natural tendency to influence, or is capable of influencing, either a discrete decision or any other function of the agency to which it was addressed.”) (emphasis added); United States v. Hansen, 772 F.2d 940, 949 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (Scalia, J.) (“A lie influencing the possibility that an investigation might commence stands in no better posture under § 1001 than a lie distorting an investigation already in progress.”). This is no mere about-face; it is more akin to turning around an aircraft carrier.</p></blockquote> <p>I do not read this as a concession that an about-face is necessary to justify a mere hearing. I read it as Judge Wilkins saying that Judge Rao has taken the presumption of regularity and, by preventing a hearing from taking place, turned that presumption into an “impenetrable shield” that prevents the court from even inquiring as to why the dismissal happened. Oh, and by the way, Judge Wilkins says, this is hardly a minor change in position, and let me explain in detail why.</p> <p>Judge Rao’s opinion is an absolute travesty — a collection of dishonest rhetorical moves that are unworthy of an Article III judge sitting on one of the most prestigious federal appellate courts in the nation. Judge Rao and Judge Henderson should be ashamed of themselves, and I hope they get slapped down by the en banc court as they so richly deserve to be.</p> <p>*I first learned of the decision at 7:11 a.m. I had to shower, dress, meditate, pray, let out the dogs, feed the dogs, make breakfast, and blog my reaction by 8:30 a.m. (Yes, I have a morning routine. No, it doesn’t get disturbed by this sort of thing.) Under these circumstances, I think I did a pretty good job. I don’t see anyone in the comments to my first post who criticized me for not taking the decision apart in detail. After all, my views on this whole affair are a matter of public record and I have written about them many times before today. Anyone who made such a complaint would be a complete and utter jackass, I think we can all agree!</p> <p>UPDATE: If you’re obsessed with the “separation of powers” argument, read <a href="http://patterico.com/?p=153238" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this</a>.</p> <p class="feedback"><ins><a href="http://patterico.com/2020/06/24/court-decision-favoring-flynn-is-dishonesty-of-the-sort-we-have-not-seen-since-impeachment/#comments">Comments (51) Link: http://patterico.com/2020/06/24/court-decision-favoring-flynn-is-dishonesty-of-the-sort-we-have-not-seen-since-impeachment/#comments </a> </ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="post" id="post-153155"><ins></ins></p><h3 class="storytitle"><ins><a href="http://patterico.com/2020/06/24/madam-you-knew-i-was-a-snake-when-you-first-picked-me-up/" rel="bookmark" title="Madam, You Knew I Was a Snake When You First Picked Me Up">Madam, You Knew I Was a Snake When You First Picked Me Up Link: http://patterico.com/2020/06/24/madam-you-knew-i-was-a-snake-when-you-first-picked-me-up/ </a></ins></h3><ins> </ins><p class="meta"><ins>Filed under:                  <a href="http://patterico.com/category/general/" rel="category tag">General Link: http://patterico.com/category/general/ </a> —

It started with the usual suspects, Confederate generals and politicians, but has since morphed to include those thought to be insensitive to indigenous peoples from 1492 to 1900 (i.e., every single white settler), and now, in the ultimate manifestation of what motivates much of this movement, Western culture itself.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>And if Democrats thought they would stand by and cheerlead the “mostly peaceful” protesters who would be content to recite the litany of trendy social justice blather, about two-thirds of which would be reflected in this year’s party platform, and then watch approvingly as the crowd disassembled to go register voters and volunteer for campaigns, well, they appear to have guessed wrongly.  Leftist fortresses such as New York, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Seattle, and Minneapolis have seen some of the worst rioting — which has in fact led to deaths — and last night Wisconsin Democrats in Madison <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/wisconsin-protests-chaos-violence-statues-senator-attacked-video">got a taste Link: https://www.foxnews.com/us/wisconsin-protests-chaos-violence-statues-senator-attacked-video </a> of what happens when you appease the mob:</ins></p><ins> </ins><blockquote><p><ins>Wisconsin protesters toppled statues, vandalized buildings and are accused of assaulting a Democratic state senator on video at the State Capitol Tuesday night after daylong protests turned violent.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Both Gov.

As predicted, Judge Rao was on Flynn’s side and Judge Wilkins was prepared to deny the petition. What was not predicted was that Judge Henderon signed onto Judge Rao’s <a href="https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/7045-dc-circuit-mandamus-dismisses/ef44c65545d041cf54c7/optimized/full.pdf#page=1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">opinion Link: https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/7045-dc-circuit-mandamus-dismisses/ef44c65545d041cf54c7/optimized/full.pdf#page=1 </a>.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>When the panel was first assigned I thought it would be a 2-1 decision for Flynn.

We knew she and Rao were both hacks from the Trump tax cases, but listening to that oral argument, although I knew Judge Henderson was strangely swayed by Flynn’s view of the merits, I truly never thought her hackishness would go this far. She seemed very clear that she was against granting the writ. Very clear. As I said in <a href="http://patterico.com/2020/06/12/prediction-flynns-petition-for-a-writ-of-mandamus-will-be-rejected/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post predicting the opposite of what happened today Link: http://patterico.com/2020/06/12/prediction-flynns-petition-for-a-writ-of-mandamus-will-be-rejected/ </a>:</ins></p><ins> </ins><blockquote><p><ins>A prediction is a prediction.

She spent virtually the entire argument making the case for how crazy it would be to deny Judge Sullivan the chance to at least hold the hearing, and then signed on to an opinion ordering him … not to hold the hearing.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Unbelievable overreach.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>So now what? Well …</ins></p><ins> </ins><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><ins>A friendly reminder that any active judge on the D.C.

The full court will stay this order, rehear the case en banc, and reverse the decision.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>As before, I could be wrong. I was this time.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>But wasn’t Judge Rao correct? It’s a pointless exercise to hold a hearing. After all, it’s not like the Trump administration puts its thumb on the scale to benefit the President’s cronies, right?</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Which brings us to our second story of the day. Aaron Zelinsky, one of the Roger Stone prosecutors, will be testifying today before Congress, and yesterday released his <a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/uploadedfiles/zelinsky_opening_statement_hjc.pdf?" rel="noopener" target="_blank">opening statement Link: https://judiciary.house.gov/uploadedfiles/zelinsky_opening_statement_hjc.pdf? </a>. For those few left who care about the rule of law, it’s an eye-opener. You should read it all, but these passages caught my eye:</ins></p><ins> </ins><blockquote><p><ins>We received word back from one of the supervisors on  February  5, 2020,  that  the sentencing memo was strong, and that Stone “deserve[d] every day” of our recommendation.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>However, just two days later, I learned that our team was being pressured by the leadership of the U.S. Attorney’s Office not to seek all of the Guidelines enhancements that applied to Stone –that is, to provide an inaccurate Guidelines calculation that would result in a lower sentencing range.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>. . . .</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>In response, we were told by a supervisor that the U.S. Attorney had political reasons for his instructions, which our supervisor agreed was unethical and wrong. However, we were instructed that we should go along with the U.S. Attorney’s instructions, because this case was “not the hill worth dying on” and that we could “lose our jobs” if we did not toe the line.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>We responded that cutting a defendant a break because of his relationship to the President undermined the fundamental principles of the Department of Justice and that we felt that was an important principle to defend.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>. . . .</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Ultimately, we refused to modify our memorandum to ask for a substantially lower sentence. Again, I was told that the U.S. Attorney’s instructions had nothing to do with Mr. Stone, the facts of the case, the law, or Department policy. Instead, I was explicitly told that the motivation for changing the sentencing memo was political, and because the U.S. Attorney was “afraid of the President.”</ins></p></blockquote><ins> </ins><p><ins>In my judgment, similar considerations played a role in the highly unusual reversal in Flynn’s case as well. Such rank corruption could well justify a district judge’s decision to refuse to dismiss a case where the guilty plea had already been accepted.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>But Judge Sullivan will not be allowed to have that hearing.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>For now.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>And he may never get a chance to have that hearing. The Court of Appeals might deny en banc review. And the Department of Justice may be allowed to continue to stomp on the rule of law.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>For now.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="feedback"><ins><a href="http://patterico.com/2020/06/24/corruption-wins-for-now/#comments">Comments (128) Link: http://patterico.com/2020/06/24/corruption-wins-for-now/#comments </a> </ins></p><ins> </ins><h2><ins>6/23/2020</ins></h2><ins> </ins><p class="post" id="post-153136"><ins></ins></p><h3 class="storytitle"><ins><a href="http://patterico.com/2020/06/23/trump-burn-the-american-flag-go-to-jail-for-one-year-oh-yeah-and-free-speech-or-something/" rel="bookmark" title="Trump:  Burn the American Flag, Go to Jail For One Year.

One year,” Trump said, claiming that he’s “a big believer in freedom of speech,” but calling flag burning “desecration.”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Trump cited an incident at a protest in Portland as the inspiration for his proposal. “Two days ago, leftist protesters in Portland, Oregon ripped down a statue of George Washington and wrapped in an American flag, and set the American flag on fire,” Trump said to raucous boos from the crowd. “Democrat, all Democrat. Everything I tell you is Democrat,” he added.</ins></p></blockquote><ins> </ins><p><ins>As we know, burning the American flag constitutes symbolic speech which is protected by the First Amendment.  (Texas v. Johnnson, 1989).</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Geoffrey R. Stone and Eugene Volokh lay out the basic concept of symbolic speech <a href="https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/flag-burning-and-the-first-amendment-yet-another-look-at-the-two/">here  Link: https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/flag-burning-and-the-first-amendment-yet-another-look-at-the-two/ </a>:</ins></p><ins> </ins><blockquote><p><ins>“The Supreme Court has interpreted ‘speech’ and ‘press’ broadly as covering not only talking, writing, and printing, but also broadcasting, using the Internet, and other forms of expression. The freedom of speech also applies to symbolic expression, such as displaying flags, burning flags, wearing armbands, burning crosses, and the like,” said Stone and Volokh.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>“The Supreme Court has held that restrictions on speech because of its content—that is, when the government targets the speaker’s message—generally violate the First Amendment. Laws that prohibit people from criticizing a war, opposing abortion, or advocating high taxes are examples of unconstitutional content-based restrictions. Such laws are thought to be especially problematic because they distort public debate and contradict a basic principle of self-governance: that the government cannot be trusted to decide what ideas or information ‘the people’ should be allowed to hear.”</ins></p></blockquote><ins> </ins><p><ins>This is nothing new for Trump.  Back in November 2016, President-elect Trump <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/11/29/trump-suggests-loss-of-citizenship-or-jail-for-those-who-burn-u-s-flags/">suggested Link: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/11/29/trump-suggests-loss-of-citizenship-or-jail-for-those-who-burn-u-s-flags/ </a> that those who burn the American flag should lose their citizenship:  </ins></p><ins> </ins><blockquote><p><ins>Nobody should be allowed to burn the American flag – if they do, there must be consequences – perhaps loss of citizenship or year in jail!</ins></p></blockquote><ins> </ins><p><ins>Last year, I wrote about two Republican congressmen who introduced a Constitutional amendment to ban the burning of the American flag (which Trump enthusiastically endorsed), saying:   </ins></p><ins> </ins><blockquote><p><ins>Given that efforts to add an amendment have failed before, and given that each chamber of Congress would have to pass the measure with a two-thirds majority, and three-fourths of the state legislatures would have to vote to approve the amendment for any change to the Constitution to be made, it’s unlikely to go anywhere.   But really, is the push for such an amendment a good idea? Clearly some GOP lawmakers think it is. However, consider that this makes the GOP as a whole vulnerable to criticism of being anti-speech, or at the very least, the Party that attacks [and attempts to shut down] speech. </ins></p></blockquote><ins> </ins><p><ins>In closing, I’ll leave you with Beldar’s  <a href="http://patterico.com/2019/06/15/president-trump-all-in-on-amendment-to-ban-desecration-of-american-flag/#comment-2221022">observation Link: http://patterico.com/2019/06/15/president-trump-all-in-on-amendment-to-ban-desecration-of-american-flag/#comment-2221022 </a> about symbolism and the American flag:  </ins></p><ins> </ins><blockquote><p><ins>A flag, be it the American flag or any other, has no more objective intrinsic value than any other similarly sized piece of cloth. What makes any flag meaningful is the symbolism that people project onto the flag.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>There likewise is no objective intrinsic value to burning a flag, no more than any other piece of cloth, the only value in the act being, again, the symbolism that people project onto that act.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>…</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Symbols and symbolism are indeed powerful for reasons that aren’t objectively rational. They speak loudly but metaphorically. Allowing government to regulate symbols and symbolism based on its content is as pernicious an idea as allowing government to regulate spoken or printed speech based on its content.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Every argument that a special rule should be made for the U.S. flag because of its special significance is merely a restatement of the observation that it is especially imbued with symbolism. Demonstrations using it, whether reverently or disdainfully, are intended to take advantage of that imbued symbolism to make intensify one’s argument, whether it’s an argument of reverence for the U.S. and its government or an argument that’s disdainful. But there is an asymmetry; ultimately, on close and prolonged observation of the symbolism and that which is behind it, the reverent people are celebrating a symbol that also stands for the Constitution and Bill of Rights, and especially including its guarantees of free speech. And by contrast, the disdainful people — the Bill Ayers with their arguments made in both words and symbolic conduct — are always, always undercut on the merits by the fact that those folks very ability to show disdain for the flag is as protected as my speech celebrating it.</ins></p></blockquote><ins> </ins><p><ins>–Dana</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="feedback"><ins><a href="http://patterico.com/2020/06/23/trump-burn-the-american-flag-go-to-jail-for-one-year-oh-yeah-and-free-speech-or-something/#comments">Comments (98) Link: http://patterico.com/2020/06/23/trump-burn-the-american-flag-go-to-jail-for-one-year-oh-yeah-and-free-speech-or-something/#comments </a> </ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="post" id="post-153119"><ins></ins></p><h3 class="storytitle"><ins><a href="http://patterico.com/2020/06/23/the-more-trump-goes-after-bidens-mental-and-physical-state-the-more-we-doubt-his-own/" rel="bookmark" title="The More Trump Goes After Biden’s Mental And Physical State, The More We Doubt His Own">The More Trump Goes After Biden’s Mental And Physical State, The More We Doubt His Own Link: http://patterico.com/2020/06/23/the-more-trump-goes-after-bidens-mental-and-physical-state-the-more-we-doubt-his-own/ </a></ins></h3><ins> </ins><p class="meta"><ins>Filed under:                  <a href="http://patterico.com/category/general/" rel="category tag">General Link: http://patterico.com/category/general/ </a> —

Anyway,  I have no trouble believing this actually happened because it lines up with who we know Trump to be.  It absolutely reflects what we’ve already seen and heard with our own eyes and ears:  </ins></p><ins> </ins><blockquote><p><ins>The early June meeting in the Cabinet Room was intended as a general update on President Trump’s reelection campaign, but the president had other topics on his mind.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Trump had taken a cognitive screening test as part of his 2018 physical, and now, more than two years later, he brought up the 10-minute exam. He waxed on about how he’d dazzled the proctors with his stellar performance, according to two people familiar with his comments. He walked the room of about two dozen White House and reelection officials through some of the questions he said he’d aced, such as being able to repeat five words in order.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>…Trump said he thought presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden would never be able to pass it and suggested challenging him to take the test, said the people familiar with Trump’s comments, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share private details.</ins></p></blockquote><ins> </ins><p><ins>At Saturday’s rally in Tulsa, the president actually took 14 minutes <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/ny-trump-water-ramp-west-point-speech-20200621-lqqibcey6bbqjfgtalbs2luz4q-story.html">defending Link: https://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/ny-trump-water-ramp-west-point-speech-20200621-lqqibcey6bbqjfgtalbs2luz4q-story.html </a> both his slow walk down the ramp at  West Point and his ability to lift a glass of water.  He then backed up the latter defense by…lifting a glass of water and taking a sip.  Other than firing up his base with righteous indignation and subsequent huzzahs for their persecuted hero, this really isn’t helping Trump the way he thinks it is.   Because Biden is holed up in his basement due to Covid-19 concerns, his lack of in-person appearances all but guarantees him protection from his usual foot-in-mouth public gaffes and stumbles.  All he has to do is shut-up and wait for Trump to step in it and do the work for him.  And in this, Trump delivers. </ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>–Dana</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="feedback"><ins><a href="http://patterico.com/2020/06/23/the-more-trump-goes-after-bidens-mental-and-physical-state-the-more-we-doubt-his-own/#comments">Comments (51) Link: http://patterico.com/2020/06/23/the-more-trump-goes-after-bidens-mental-and-physical-state-the-more-we-doubt-his-own/#comments </a> </ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="post" id="post-153105"><ins></ins></p><h3 class="storytitle"><ins><a href="http://patterico.com/2020/06/23/after-deadly-shootings-seattle-mayor-decides-police-need-to-return-to-east-precinct/" rel="bookmark" title="After Deadly Shootings, Seattle Mayor Decides Police Need To Return to East Precinct">After Deadly Shootings, Seattle Mayor Decides Police Need To Return to East Precinct Link: http://patterico.com/2020/06/23/after-deadly-shootings-seattle-mayor-decides-police-need-to-return-to-east-precinct/ </a></ins></h3><ins> </ins><p class="meta"><ins>Filed under:                  <a href="http://patterico.com/category/general/" rel="category tag">General Link: http://patterico.com/category/general/ </a> —

The triggering event will be starvation in America. I expect Nationwide Food Riots. In the 1930s 3 million Americans starved to death. In 1910 agents of the Rothschilds, Rockefellers and Warburgs created a Banking System that allowed Bankers to charge us interest on money they created out of nothing. This transfers wealth from us to them. The Bankers were not satisfied with that. Dr Mark Skidmore told us that $21 trillion had gone &#8220;Missing&#8221; from DOD and HUD between 1998 and 2015. In an updated interview he said that the Treasury Department has been printing up trillions in Treasury bonds and selling them off the books. That means our national debt is considerably more than the $26 trillion officially on the books.

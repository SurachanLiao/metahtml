rush hour traffic in Tehran, 
  the world had a brief glimpse of a covert effort to sabotage Iran’s nuclear 
  programme.

</ins></h2><ins> </ins><p class="bylineBody"><ins>By <a rel="author" title="David Blair" href="http://preview.telegraph.co.uk/journalists/david-blair/">David Blair Link: http://preview.telegraph.co.uk/journalists/david-blair/ </a></ins></p><p class="publishedDate"><ins>9:55PM GMT 26 Feb 2013</ins></p><p class="bylineSocialButtons"><ins><a href="https://twitter.com/davidblairdt" class="twitter-follow-button">Follow Link: https://twitter.com/davidblairdt </a> </ins></p> <p>One device attached to a car window killed Majid Shahriari, a nuclear engineer; the other wounded Fereydoun Abbasi, then a senior scientist at a Tehran university. Three months after surviving that assassination attempt in November 2010, Mr Abbasi became the head of Iran’s Atomic Energy Organisation. </p><p>The fact that Iran’s nuclear ambitions are partly masterminded by a man who came within an ace of being killed by unknown assailants shows that this is no ordinary programme. </p><p>America, Israel and their allies believe that Iran’s true goal is not only to generate electricity, but to achieve the ability to build nuclear weapons. </p><p>The word “ability” is important. British, American – and even Israeli – officials think that Iran has not yet decided whether to acquire a nuclear arsenal. It certainly does not possess one today. Instead, they judge that Iran wants the option of making a bomb. </p><p>Whether Iran would actually take the plunge and build a device is a further question that no-one – with the possible exception of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the country’s Supreme Leader – can credibly answer. </p> <p class="headerOne styleOne"><ins></ins></p><h2><ins><span>Related Articles</span></ins></h2><ul><li class="bullet"><p><ins><a href="/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/10147737/Retired-US-general-may-have-leaked-Stuxnet-cyberattack-details.html">US general 'may have leaked Stuxnet cyberattack details' Link: /news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/10147737/Retired-US-general-may-have-leaked-Stuxnet-cyberattack-details.html </a> </ins></p><ins> </ins><ins><span class="relContDate">28 Jun 2013</span> </ins></li><ins> </ins><li class="bullet"><p><ins><a href="/news/worldnews/middleeast/iran/9897979/Iran-agrees-to-hold-new-nuclear-talks.html">Iran agrees to hold new nuclear talks Link: /news/worldnews/middleeast/iran/9897979/Iran-agrees-to-hold-new-nuclear-talks.html </a> </ins></p><ins> </ins><ins><span class="relContDate">27 Feb 2013</span> </ins></li><ins> </ins><li class="bullet"><p><ins><a href="/news/worldnews/middleeast/iran/9906289/Iran-says-it-is-building-3000-uranium-enrichment-centrifuges.html">Iran says it is building 3,000 uranium-enrichment centrifuges Link: /news/worldnews/middleeast/iran/9906289/Iran-says-it-is-building-3000-uranium-enrichment-centrifuges.html </a> </ins></p><ins> </ins><ins><span class="relContDate">04 Mar 2013</span> </ins></li><ins> </ins><li class="bullet"><p><ins><a href="/news/worldnews/middleeast/iran/9896389/Irans-Plan-B-for-a-nuclear-bomb.html">Iran's 'Plan B' for a nuclear bomb Link: /news/worldnews/middleeast/iran/9896389/Irans-Plan-B-for-a-nuclear-bomb.html </a> </ins></p><ins> </ins><ins><span class="relContDate">26 Feb 2013</span> </ins></li><ins> </ins><li class="bullet"><p><ins><a href="/news/worldnews/middleeast/iran/9896206/Irans-nuclear-plan-West-offers-sanctions-deal-over-underground-complex.html">West offers underground complex sanctions deal Link: /news/worldnews/middleeast/iran/9896206/Irans-nuclear-plan-West-offers-sanctions-deal-over-underground-complex.html </a> </ins></p><ins> </ins><ins><span class="relContDate">26 Feb 2013</span> </ins></li><ins> </ins><li class="bullet"><p><ins><a href="/news/worldnews/middleeast/iran/9896218/Irans-nuclear-plan-Araks-air-defences-revealed.html">Iran's nuclear plan: Arak's air defences revealed Link: /news/worldnews/middleeast/iran/9896218/Irans-nuclear-plan-Araks-air-defences-revealed.html </a> </ins></p><ins> </ins><ins><span class="relContDate">26 Feb 2013</span> </ins></li><ins> </ins></ul> <p>But the nuclear installations at Arak and Natanz serve as “exhibit A” for the accusation that Iran wants a military option. Arak holds a heavy water production facility and a research reactor; Natanz a uranium enrichment plant. </p><p>Both were built in secret, starting in the 1990s. Both could – if Iran so chose – serve as the starting points for the plutonium route to a nuclear bomb in the case of Arak, or the uranium enrichment path in respect of Natanz. </p><p>The existence of these plants was revealed in 2002. Only then did Iran declare them to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and allow inspectors to enter, who soon placed seals on the enrichment equipment inside Natanz. </p><p>These disclosures triggered the confrontation over Iran’s nuclear ambitions that has poisoned relations between Tehran and the West ever since. </p><p>America’s response was to press for Iran to be brought before the United Nations Security Council and punished with sanctions. </p><p>Jack Straw, then Foreign Secretary, and his French and German counterparts tried to head this off by negotiating directly with Tehran. Their aim was to defuse the crisis by making sure that Iran held back from the next step and refrained from enriching uranium inside Natanz. </p><p>This highly sensitive process could be used to make fuel for nuclear power stations – which Iran said was the only aim – or the fissile core of a weapon. The West’s objective was to avoid the risk by ensuring that enrichment never happened inside Iran at all. </p><p>That effort ended in failure. In January 2006, Iran broke the seals in Natanz and began enrichment on an industrial scale. “The Iranian nation is not frightened by the superpowers and their noise,” declared President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. “In the near future, nuclear energy will be completely carried out by the Iranian nation.” </p><p>Within months, the centrifuges were spinning and uranium was being processed. The IAEA verified that enrichment was only taking place to the 5 per cent threshold needed to run nuclear power stations, well short of the 90 per cent required for weapons. Month by month, however, Iran was developing its expertise and, month by month, the number of centrifuges inside Natanz was rising. </p><p>The West’s response was to send Iran to the Security Council and begin tightening sanctions, starting with UN Resolution 1737 passed in December 2006. Today, no less than six UN Resolutions ban Iran from enriching uranium; four also impose economic punishment. </p><p>In addition, the US and the European Union have adopted a raft of unilateral measures, imposing an embargo on Iran’s oil and trying to exclude the country from the global financial system. </p><p>But Iran insisted on its right to enrich, pointing out that the Non-Proliferation Treaty, which came into effect in 1970, allows any signatory to use this process for peaceful purposes. </p><p>The West did not believe that Iran’s purposes were peaceful, particularly when another covert plant was discovered. From 2006 onwards, a new installation was developed in the Great Salt Desert outside the holy city of Qom. Here, in a bunker carved from a mountain, Iran built space for 3,000 centrifuges. </p><p>This new plant was secret and possibly immune to air attack, even if it could be discovered. It was also too small for a typical civilian enrichment programme, but about the right size for one designed to produce a nuclear bomb every year. </p><p>America, Britain and France jointly revealed the existence of what became known as the Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant in 2009. </p><p>Having been found out, Iran declared the facility and opened it to IAEA inspection – while claiming that it had planned to do so all along. Mohammed ElBaradei, the head of the IAEA, countered that Iran had broken its safeguards agreement and was “on the wrong side of the law”. </p><p>The discovery of Fordow spurred the West to escalate its sabotage campaign. Sir John Sawers, the head of MI6, disclosed last year that his service played a key role and, but for those efforts, Iran might have achieved nuclear weapons capability as early as 2008. </p><p>The CIA began its own sabotage operation codenamed “Olympic Games”. Perhaps the most effective blow was struck in 2010 when the Stuxnet computer virus was infiltrated into Natanz, causing hundreds of centrifuges to spin out of control and explode. </p><p>Meanwhile, Israel openly threatened to destroy Iran’s nuclear plants from the air. Left unspoken was another key aim of the West’s efforts: America and her allies wanted to hold off Israel by showing there were other ways of derailing Iran’s nuclear ambitions. </p><p>But through all this, Tehran doggedly pressed on. The latest IAEA report shows that Natanz holds 12,669 centrifuges – compared with a few score in 2006 – and Fordow has another 2,710, although most are not yet operational. </p><p>The new satellite images showing an operational plant at Arak focus attention once again on a facility whose discovery began the confrontation with Iran. More than a decade later, Iran’s nuclear capability is still growing, while this unresolved crisis becomes more dangerous. </p></div>

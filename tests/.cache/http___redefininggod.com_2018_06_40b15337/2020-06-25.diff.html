It would involve ISIS loading a nuke provided to them by North Korean hardliners onto the Singapore-bound ferry from Sebana Cove, Malaysia. Looking again at the third map (the one with the two circles), we see the route of the ferry as it passes by Sentosa (it is the dashed line labeled “Sebana, MY – Harbourfront, SG”). And as you can see by the circle, a 100 kiloton or larger nuke would destroy the summit site from that distance…

So the nuke could be loaded at those two places as well. And the fourth ferry lane that lies outside of the 100 kiloton effective radius is from Harbour Bay, Indonesia. A nuke could be loaded there, but it would have to have a yield of near 200 kilotons or higher.</p> <p>And now for the news…</p> <p>With the Trump-Kim summit just a week and a half away, the propaganda corps have released a sudden flurry of articles on a coming Trump-Putin summit…

So according to the script, the “Deep State” is now faced with this situation: “If we don’t act now, peace could start breaking out everywhere!”</p> <p>Since <a href="http://redefininggod.com/trump-and-putin-agents-of-chabad-lubavitch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump has been cast as the precursor messiah</a> in this phase of the globalist prophecy fulfillment show, they want to portray him as a man of peace. So to drive that point home, the fake assassination will most likely take place at the moment a Korean peace agreement is either announced or signed.</p> <p>(Note – 5 June 2018) – In the past few days, there have been additional confirmations that the Capella Hotel on the island of Sentosa will be the actual meeting site for the summit. Here is a blurb from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/03/world/asia/trump-kim-summit-singapore.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a New York Times article</a>…</p> <blockquote><p>“Officials have not yet announced exactly where the landmark meeting will take place in Singapore. The Shangri-La Hotel has been favored by previous American presidents as a place to stay, while a former Singaporean official suggested that the meeting was likely to take place on the resort island of Sentosa, just off the southern tip of <ins>Singapore.”</ins> <del>Singapore.”</del> </p></blockquote> <p>And here is another excerpt from <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/06/04/business/media-pour-trump-kim-summit-venue-search-leads-old-singapore-pirate-hangout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Japan Times article</a>…</p> <blockquote><p> <ins>“Of</ins> <del>“Of</del> all of Singapore’s big hotels, only one shows all its rooms and restaurants are blocked out for the week surrounding June <ins>12,</ins> <del>12,</del> when U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un are due to meet in the city.</p> <p>The booking crunch at the <ins>Capella,</ins> <del><strong>Capella</strong>,</del> which sits in the middle of 30 acres of lawns and rain forest on the resort island of Sentosa, just south of the city, is among a handful of overt signs that Singapore is preparing for one of the most controversial summits since the end of the Cold War.”</p></blockquote> <p>If the summit planners were serious about security, they’d hold the meeting at the hotel where Trump will be staying, the Shangri-La. It is far enough from the shore to make a sail-up nuclear attack impractical. But their choice of venue isn’t really about security; it’s about enabling a false-flag attack to advance the globalist Event script.</p> <p>In the June 1-3 notes, I said that “the fake assassination will most likely take place at the moment a Korean peace agreement is either announced or signed.” Well, get a load of this…

Here are some key excerpts…</p> <blockquote><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; A Seoul-based security expert told The Korea Herald the deal to declare an end to the Korea War could be reached as soon as the day after their meeting on June 12…</p> <p>Mr Cho said [South Korean] President Moon could travel to Singapore in time for the Trump-Kim summit and join the two leaders in reaching a trilateral agreement to end the Korean War…</p> <p>“If Beijing want to be involved in the process, we don’t have to prevent them from doing so. But I don’t think [South Korean] President Moon and Trump should wait on declaring an end to the Korean War until President Xi Jinping flies to Singapore,” Mr Cho said. &lt;&lt;&lt;</p></blockquote> <p>This summit extension to declare peace seems to be in the cards given <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/trump-kim-summit-shangri-la-hotels-vicinity-declared-special-event-area" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what The Straits Times says in another article</a> on the summit…</p> <blockquote><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; The Government has declared the area surrounding the Shangri-La Hotel a ‘special event area’ for the period of June 10 to <ins>14,</ins> <del>14,</del> for the upcoming summit between United States President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. &lt;&lt;&lt;</p></blockquote> <p>And although the first article seems to imply that it’s OK if Xi doesn’t fly in for the big announcement, what are the odds that Trump, Moon, and Kim will offend the Chinese by not inviting him?</p> <p>So we could see a nuclear assassination on the day of the peace declaration that would kill four supposed enemies of the “Deep State” all at once…</p> <ol><li>Trump, who is supposedly a danger to their whole agenda,</li> <li>Moon, who is soft towards North Korea and has <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2017/06/07/south-korean-president-moon-jae-suspends-thaad-deployment/102582572/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attempted to block US strategic moves</a>,</li> <li>Kim, who is developing nuclear weapons that could strike the US, and</li> <li>Xi, who is supposedly rebelling against the Western New World Order along with Putin</li> </ol> <p>Also in the June 1-3 notes, I brought up a scenario in which ISIS loads a nuke provided to them by North Korean hardliners onto a ferry that passes close to the summit site, then detonates it to assassinate the gathered leaders with the nuclear air blast. After taking some time to think about it further, I’ve gotten the feeling that this is the exact scenario the globalists have planned, except the ferry part is optional. They could also use a ship, boat or submersible.</p> <p>Should “ISIS” destroy the summit using a “North Korean” nuke, news will soon circulate that the North Korean hardliners provided them with more than one, and this will be used as a pretext for security crackdowns in every nation that supposedly has ISIS terror cells in it (which is pretty much every country in the world). Newly installed President Pence will then have the power to completely lock down any American city he wants at any time he wants, citing “intelligence reports” or ISIS threats to set off a nuke in that city. He will also vow that “we will not live in fear” as he continues to stoke the fear and leads us to war.</p> <p>So if the globalists proceed with this scenario, we’ll get exactly what I’ve predicted in past entries: an initial nuclear scare that will lead to months of fear and make the big nuclear scare in September all the more real and all the more terrifying (for the sleepers).</p> <p>(Note – 6 June 2018) – GLOBALIST MOTIVATIONS FOR A FALSE-FLAG NUKE IN SINGAPORE</p> <p>Before I start talking about the globalists’ motivations in conducting a nuclear assassination next week, it’s important to remember that there are three concurrently-running narratives that surround this event…</p> <p>1) The globalists’ mainstream media <ins>narrative,</ins> <del>narrative,</del> which is aimed at the sleepers. It will have them seeing what happens as being the result of North Korean hardliners teaming up with ISIS/Al Qaeda terrorists to take down ‘Merica.</p> <p>2) The globalists’ controlled alt-media <ins>narrative,</ins> <del>narrative,</del> which is aimed at people who are awakening. It will have them seeing what happens as being the result of the “evil Deep State” / “evil Western globalists” making a last-gasp attempt at saving their agenda from defeat at the hands of the “good guys” (Trump, Putin, Xi, etc).</p> <p>3) The real narrative available on this blog, which reveals that might happen in Singapore is part of a globalist “good guys vs. bad guys” stage play that is aimed at getting the public to accept the real New World Order (and what lies beyond it).</p> <p>So as I go through each motivation, I’ll identify which narrative it belongs to: main narrative, alt narrative or real narrative.</p> <p>That being said, we’ve covered these three motivations for the nuclear assassination in the Notes so far…</p> <p>Motivation 1 – It will rid the “evil Deep State” of 4 supposed opponents (Trump, Xi, Moon, and Kim). This is part of the alt narrative. In reality, those four are globalist minions, just like the “evil Deep State” guys they’re supposedly fighting. The conflict between them is artificial and staged for public consumption.</p> <p>Motivation 2 – It will prevent the Trump-Putin summit from ever occurring. This is part of the alt narrative. In reality, Trump, Putin, and the “evil Deep State” guys are all globalist actors reading from the same script. But according to the alt narrative (which supports the script), Trump and Putin are “good guys” who may join forces at their summit, so the “bad guys” must stop at nothing to keep them apart.</p> <p>Motivation 3 – It will enable months of nuclear terror-mongering and a police state lockdown. This is part of the alt and real narratives. The controlled alt-media guys will tell you that the “evil Deep State” controls ISIS/Al Qaeda, so they’re the ones who really conducted the nuclear assassination, and they did it so they could take dictatorial control over the West and force their “unilateral New World Order” into being. In reality, though, the assassination is scripted by the globalists to be the transition point into the “Darkness before the Dawn” phase of their NWO transition plan. You can read more about the transition plan further down this page.</p> <p>The summer of nuclear terror the assassination would unleash is not a new element of the NWO transition script; it’s just a slight modification to what the globalists had planned for 2016. This is <a href="http://redefininggod.com/2016/02/the-nwo-schedule-of-implementation-2016/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what I wrote about it back then</a>…</p> <blockquote><p>Clearly, the globalists are using ISIS as the catalyst to get World War 3 going, so it makes a lot of sense that ISIS activity will peak as we head into the outbreak of full-scale hostilities this September. If you want a war in September, a “Summer of Terror” will do quite nicely to get it started.</p> <p>The Summer of Terror will serve the globalist agenda in a number of ways…</p> <p>1) It will create an atmosphere of tension and fear throughout the nations that experience it. They want to generate maximum dread as they go forward into the war; this will make the solution they offer after the war look enormously appealing to the populace.</p> <p>2) It will create an angry backlash against ISIS among the sleeping populations of the affected nations and make them eager for payback and war. “Onward Christian soldiers!”</p> <p>3) It will allow the Western governments to selectively lock down the public whenever they wish. Although they’ll allow many demonstrations to go forward (to create the public appearance of popular unrest), they will disperse demonstrations they don’t like by dispatching a terror squad to bomb or shoot up the demonstrators. As the banksters begin their final looting of the world’s economies through bank bail-ins and asset seizures, ISIS terror will be the knife they hold to the public’s throat to prevent us from uncontrollably rising up.</p> <p>4) It will allow the Western governments to institute draconian domestic controls that will make the population see their governments as evil and Satanic.

This revelation is what will trigger the whole world to gang up on Israel for the “Battle of Armageddon.”</p> <p>As for the scripted reason for Netanyahu providing the nuke to assassinate Trump, it is to prevent Trump from forcing Israel to make painful concessions to the Palestinians. Now that Israel have gotten what they wanted out of him, the recognition of Jerusalem as their capital, he has become expendable – he has nothing to offer them now except the losses imposed by his “peace plan.” I wrote about this motive in depth in <a href="http://redefininggod.com/2018/04/globalist-agenda-watch-war-mass-arrests-watch-part-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[Special Note – 4 May 2018] – Lubavitchers meet in Washington to establish the motive for Trump’s assassination</a>.

So as the aircraft carrying Trump and Kim descend for a landing on Singapore island, they will be at low altitude over Muslim-majority territory. This will make them vulnerable to both MANPADS and air-to-air missiles modified for ground launch (which the Houthis have used against Saudi aircraft over Yemen). The press have narrated that ISIS/Al Qaeda are in possession of both types of missiles.</p> <p>Although Air Force One is presumably outfitted with the latest-and-greatest missile defense technology, its systems could conceivably be overwhelmed by a large number of missiles fired at the same time. And Kim Jong-Un’s aircraft will have little or no protection. So Kim would be the most likely target of an “assassination by SAM.” Kim also faces the threat of having his airliner sabotaged by hardliners.</p> <p>WHAT HAPPENS IF XI DOESN’T SHOW UP IN SINGAPORE</p> <p>You may have seen in the news that tensions are on the upswing in the South China Sea…

It has the same hint of 9/11 that the time and date of Trump and Kim’s first meeting has. As you may recall from the June 6 Note, their first meeting is scheduled for 9AM on June 12 (Singapore time), which is <ins>9PM</ins> <del><strong>9</strong>PM</del> on June 11 (Washington time). So they are subtly attaching the concept of the empire striking back to the summit.</p> <p>Both leaders should be safe until the first meeting. That’s when the weapons of mass destruction watch begins.</p> <p>(Note – 11 June 2018) – ASSASSINATION TIMING, SCENARIOS, AND NARRATIVES</p> <p>In previous writings, I’ve already laid out the timing of a potential assassination:</p> <p>June 12-14 Singapore time (assuming the summit is extended by one or two days), with the most likely moments for the hit being when the leaders first shake hands and when they stand together to announce a peace deal. Since doing it at the moment they announce the peace deal would be the most dramatic, it’s probably the globalists’ favored timing.</p> <p>Also in previous writings, I laid out two of the three assassination methods they’ll likely employ:</p> <p>1) The shoot-down of either Air Force One or “North Korea One,” supposedly by ISIS/Al Qaeda using MANPADS or air-to-air missiles fired from the ground. This scenario was covered in the June 9 Note.</p> <p>2) The obliteration of the summit venue by a nuke aboard a boat, ship, or submarine from up to a kilometer and a half <ins>away,</ins> <del>away,</del> supposedly by ISIS/Al Qaeda using a nuke provided to them by North Korean hardliners. This scenario was covered June 1-3 Notes.</p> <p>Now here’s the third method…</p> <p>3) The deployment of an air or surface-borne chemical or biological agent inside one or more of the three hotels hosting the two leaders and the <ins>summit,</ins> <del>summit,</del> supposedly by ISIS/Al Qaeda using a chem/bio agent provided to them by North Korean hardliners.</p> <p>In this scenario, it will be said that the chem/bio agent was smuggled into the hotel(s) and hidden in some nook or cranny before the pre-summit security operation even began. And they’ll say that the security sweep didn’t find it because the summit preparations were so rushed. As for who brought in the materials and deployed them, it will likely be blamed on one or more Muslim hotel employees who are agents or sympathizers of ISIS/Al Qaeda or who were desperate for money to help their families.</p> <p>And let’s not forget what happened to Kim Jong-Un’s brother…

									- 
									Irans Major General Qassem Soleimani 
									has sharply reacted to the recent cabaret 
									owner-style military threat by US President 
									Donald Trump against the Islamic Republic, 
									saying he takes the position to respond as 
									a soldier since it is beneath the dignity 
									of Irans president to do so.
									 
									
									<p>Addressing Trump, the commander of the 
									Quds Force of Irans Islamic Revolution 
									Guards Corps (IRGC) said, You threaten us 
									with an action that is unprecedented in 
									the world. This is cabaret-style rhetoric. 
									Only a cabaret owner talks to the world this 
									way.</p> <p>He was reacting to Trumps
									<a href="https://www.presstv.com/Detail/2018/07/23/568975/US-Trump-Iran-pressure-campaign">all-caps tweet</a> addressed to Iranian 
									President Hassan Rouhani, in which he 
									threatened the Islamic Republic with actions 
									the likes of which few throughout history 
									have ever suffered before.</p> <p>The tweet came after President Rouhani 
									warned the US against its hostile approach 
									against Iran, saying America should know 
									that peace with Iran will be the mother of 
									all peace while war with the country will be 
									the mother of all wars.</p> <table width="100%" border="0"><tr><td><p align="center">Are You Tired Of

									United States of its failures in its 
									invasions of Iraq and
									<a href="https://www.presstv.com/Detail/2018/04/22/559353/Afghanistan-Daesh-terrorists-US-NATO-Russia-Iran">Afghanistan</a>.</p> <blockquote><p>What was it that you could do over 
										the past 20 years but you didnt? You 
										came to Afghanistan with scores of tanks 
										and personnel carriers and hundreds of 
										advanced helicopters and committed 
										crimes there. What the hell could you do 
										between 2001 and 2018 with 110,000 
										troops? You are today begging Taliban 
										for talks, Major General Soleimani 
										said.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Iranian commander added, "Afghanistan 
									was a poor country, what the hell could you 
									do in this country that you are currently 
									threatening us?"</p> <blockquote><p>You arrogantly attacked Iraq with 
										160,000 troops and multiple times 
										[military equipment] compared to what 
										you used in Afghanistan, but what 
										happened? Ask your then commander who 
										was the person that he sent to me and 
										asked Is is possible for you to give us 
										time [and] use your influence so that 
										our soldiers would not be attacked by 
										the Iraqi fighters in these few months  
										until we exit this country? Have you 
										forgotten that you provided adult 
										diapers for your soldiers in tanks? 
										Despite that you are currently 
										threatening the great country of Iran? 
										With what background do you threaten 
										[us]?</p> </blockquote> <blockquote><p>"We are near you, where you can't 
										even imagine. We are the nation of 
										martyrdom, we are the nation of Imam 
										Hossein, you better ask. Come; we are 
										ready. We are the man of this arena. You 
										know that this war would mean 
										annihilation of all your means. You may 
										begin the war, but it is us who will end 
										it, he said.</p> </blockquote> <p>In
									<a href="https://www.presstv.com/Detail/2018/07/23/569045/Yemen-Saudis-Hudaydah-port-UAE-Trump-US-UK-France">Yemen</a>, Soleimani said, the US-backed 
									coalition of Saudi Arabia and its allies has 
									been incapable of making any gains against 
									the countrys Houthi Ansarullah movement, 
									which is both running state affairs and 
									defending the nation against the Riyadh-led 
									aggression.</p> <blockquote><p>A mere organization is standing 
										against you in Yemen, but it has emerged 
										victorious in the face of the most 
										advanced of your military equipment. 
										What have you achieved over the past 
										four years? You stripped the Red Sea  
										which used to be a safe sea  of 
										security. You brought under fire Saudi 
										Arabia and [its capital] Riyadh  which 
										had not seen a single rocket fired at 
										them for 100 years.</p> </blockquote> <p>The senior general further warned Trump 
									against insulting the Iranian nation and 
									president.</p> <p>Trump! You must not threaten our nation 
									and must not insult our president You must 
									know what you are talking about; ask your 
									predecessors and take advantage of their 
									experiences, General Soleimani emphasized.</p> <p>The senior military official also 
									censured the US for supporting the most 
									hated anti-Iran terror group, called 
									the Mujahedin Khalq Organization (MKO), 
									saying Washington failed to achieve anything 
									by doing so.</p> <p>The commander of the IRGCs Quds Force 
									said, America had some grandeur in the past 
									[and] when its fleet moved out, a nation 
									fell apart. Have you now become attached to 
									the Monafeqeen, who have been thrown in the 
									trash bin of Iran's history? You have become 
									attached to a vagrant woman, and show her in 
									all [your news] networks; is your hope 
									pinned on this? Is this all your power? You 
									are aware of our power in the region and 
									capability for [launching] asymmetrical 
									war?</p> <p>This article was originally published

  <h2>King Pahlavi (the Shah) </h2>
  
  
  
  
  <p id="first">In Iran between 1953 and 1963  the gap between the rich and
    poor widened.  There was talk of the oligarchy of "one thousand
    families." One of the great landowners  was the 
    Shah (king), Muhammad Reza Pahlavi. Another was the Shia
  clerical
    establishment, which had acquired land through religious
  endowments. There were tensions between the monarchy and the conservative Shia establishment. The  power and influence of Shia
  scholars  had diminished under  Pahlavi dynastic rule,  and the monarchy  was allied  with secularists in conflict with Muslims opposed to the use of   tobacco, alcohol, movies, gambling and foreign dress. </p>
<p>Muhammad Reza Pahlavi had been king since 1941 at the age of 21. In 1954 he had emerged as an absolute monarch with the overthrow of the Mossedegh regime &#226;&#128;&#147; an upheaval  with United States involvement. Many Iranians were annoyed by his ties   with the United States, including his  agreement
  with a western oil consortium.  There were those annoyed by the presence
  of many Americans in their country, and some Iranians saw the United States as having taken the
  place of the British.
  Some of  the discontented formed an underground group called
  the <i>Fedaiyan-e
    Islam. </i>They tried to assassinate the Shah's prime
  minister.  The Shah responded by repressing the Fedaiyan-e
  Islam and executing a few of  its members.</p>
<p id="waldo-tag-4459"></p>
<p> Among the discontented were   those   who remembered  that the Shah's father
    back in 1936 had barred clerics from acting as judges  in
    state courts. And some clerics, including the Ayatollah Ruhollah
    Khomeini,  were offended in the early 1960s when the Shah
    gave himself the authority to  initiate legislation. The  Shah, meanwhile, enjoyed
    the support of Iran's
    upper and middle classes, and he  had the support of clerics who saw him as an alternative
    to the political Left.</p>
  <p>After the overthrow of Prime Minister Mossedegh and the enhancement of his power in 1954, the Shah
    launched an effort to modernize Iran economically
    and socially. He sought to balance his increase in power
    with reforms that would win more favor from common Iranians.
    Landlords and some clerics were outspokenly opposed to
    these reforms. Ayatollah Khomeini issued a fatwa
    (religious edict) against the reforms. The  government-owned
    radio station responded to Khomeini with  a ridicule. The Shah announced
    that his reforms would take Iran into the jet age while
    the <i>mullahs</i> wanted to remain "in the age of the donkeys." Numerous
    clerics went over to the side of Khomeini.    </p>
  <h3>A New Upheaval</h3>
  <p>Fearing opposition, the Shah cracked down on dissent. On
    March 22, 1963, in the holy city of Qom, theological students
    who were agitating against a scheduled opening of liquor
    stores were attacked by the Shah's
    paratroopers  and by his security agents &#8211; SAVAK. The disturbance
    spread to students in the  city of Tabriz. There and in Qom,
    according to some, government forced killed hundreds.</p>
  <p>When speaking to honor the dead,  Ayatollah Khomeini called
    the Shah's 
    rule tyrannical. The government  retaliated against
    Khomeini.  For many Iranians Khomeini
    became an anti-Shah hero. His arrest on June 5 caused anti-government
    demonstrations  and rioting in various cities. The
    Shah declared martial law. Tanks and troops were sent against the rioters. Iran's
    airforce strafed a  column of marchers. In two days
    the rioting was crushed. Many had been arrested, including
    twenty-eight ayatollahs. A Western academic in Iran estimated
    that many thousands had died. An Iranian,  A. R.  Azimi,
    put the number at 10,000, while the government estimated
    the number of dead at 86. </p>
  <p>The Shah's government  sent Khomeini
    into exile, Khomeini settling in a Shiite community in
    southern Iraq. The amount of violence used against cleric
    dissent had broadened opposition to the Shah but had driven
    it to quiet hope, with a good portion of that hope focused
    on Khomeini. From Iraq  Khomeini continued
    his attacks on the Shah, sending into Iran pamphlets and
    tape recordings. Khomeini stated that Islam was opposed
    to monarchy. He described the title "King of Kings" used
    by the Shah as the most hated of titles in the sight of
    God. Monarchy, he said, was shameful, disgraceful and reactionary. </p>
  <h3>Economic Gains and Problems</h3>
  <p>From 1963 and into the seventies, the Shah struggled to modernize
    Iran.  Foreign policy strategists in the US   saw him as a stabilizing force in the Middle
    East, and they appreciated his 
    acceptance of  Israel's existence. With help from the
    United States, Iran laid plans for a proliferation of atomic
    power plants, and the new economic development included
    the introduction of new fertilizers and pesticides. Between
    1963 and 1967 Iran's economy rose dramatically. Oil production
    boomed, producing an  abundance of cash for Iran.
    Steel mills rose from
    1,902 in 1963 to 7,989 in 1977. There were also new oil
    refineries, aluminum smelters, machine tool factories and
    new tractors, trucks and automobiles. Public education
    improved dramatically, as did public health services. The
    number of  doctors increased three-fold
    and the number of hospital beds doubled.</p><p id="waldo-tag-4461"></p><p>But  the stigma of the bloody upheaval of 1963 remained, and the  monarchy was not about to  relax its  attempt to control hostile clerics. In 1966,  book censorship was established, with police agents raiding
    mosque libraries. In 1967 socially conservative clerics had another reason to be annoyed. The Shah's new laws gave women the right to
    apply for divorce without the husband's
    permission; a man had to secure his wife's consent before
    taking a second wife; and legal matters involving families
    were transferred from religious to secular courts. </p>
  <p>Despite the booming economy, many Iranians were
    still struggling economically. 
    Agricultural output had been rising at a rate of 2.5 percent
    per year, but Iran's
    population had been increasing at 3 percent per year, and
    with the booming economy had come an inflation rate of
    from 30 to 50 percent a year. The government was 
    managing the economy poorly. The Shah tried to control
    inflation by controlling prices, which upset merchants.
    Many were upset with rents having risen 300 percent in
    five years, which took as much as half of a middle-class
    family's earnings. The prosperity was benefitting those
    few labeled as <i>nouveau
      riche. </i>Corruption
    had emerged among government officials eager to acquire
    some of the wealth, while the  income of  common
    Iranians  failed to keep up with rising prices. </p>
  <p>The Shah attempted to bribe fence-sitting clerics onto his
    side, and he sought to deflect criticism by establishing
    a new parliamentary body between himself and the masses.
    The Shah was looking forward to the day when his son,
    Crown Prince Reza, would succeed him, and he hoped that
    a return to constitutionalism would make the transfer
    of power orderly and peaceful. But holding on to  power  would  be a big   challenge.</p>

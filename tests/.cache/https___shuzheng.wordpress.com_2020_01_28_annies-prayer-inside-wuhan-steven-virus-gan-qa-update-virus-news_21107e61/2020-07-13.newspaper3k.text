Motherland China is in crisis.

Crisis is the moment of truth, the turning point. It is the moment, we will know what stands and what doesn’t, what succeeds and what fails. Crisis is the reason we know what we are. It is, in China, the moment prepared for us in the evolution of our civilization and culture after 5,000 years and more.

DISINFECTING HONGKIES

*

Lady Annie likes prayers and believes in them. In times like this, she ought to pray — double time — particularly for her ‘Freedom Fighters of Hong Kong’.

But, pray to who? Well… anyone, really. Here’s a Christian suggestion…

ANNIE’S PRAYER

Dear Jesus, May all the Yellow politicians of Anglophile Hong Kong, their entire families, mothers, fathers, wives, husbands, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters, their hangers-on, their LGBT partners, motherfuckers, their Twitter and Facebook followers, their Press and Blogspot propagandists — excluding me Lady Annie, Dear Lord, and please remember that — but not forgetting, of course, their Black Shirt cockroaches be dead. May they be dead, their corpses littered like a thousand stinking, putrefying dead rats on Mongkok streets when this thing is over. Amen.

The Update

When the virus is the news, Mkini the carrier



Mkini, Reuters, others, helped by Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube have been concocting news on Hong Kong the last seven months. There was never a day without fraudulent information — a nugget of news stuck into a mass of what’s essentially propaganda. (For eg, you see the propaganda permanently lodged on the front of Lady Annie’s website.) Almost second nature to Anglophile editors, the method is very effective.

It is the stuff of what’s called fiction writing, only 10 percent, or 1, have to be true and the entire book of fiction is believed to be true.



In the present information dissemination on the coronavirus, the viral method is the same as the virus spread: stick a poisoned seed into someone, typically the fake bundled into a sliver of news, then letting it grow and spread from there.

As in the reports on the HK riots, the target is the same: China.

What on earth did we Chinese did to them in their previous lives, or had we stolen from them in the present?

STEVIE’S FAKE NEWS AND VIEWS

Banning Chinese?

Yes, please. And not only that. Prohibit all trade with China — today, and forever. After that, ban all Malaysians from going to China, end all flights.

Indeed, organize another online petition, promoted by Free Press Malaysiakini, signed by all Malaysians, with Steven Gan leading the way, to pass a law that declares for the next 50 years all Chinese persona non-grata and all trade illegal, including but not restricted to Mandarin oranges.

Please include those travelling with passports from Hong Kong and remember to headline the petition with the rotating slogans

“Fight for Freedom”,

“Liberate Hong Kong, Revolution of our Times,”

“Five Demands, Not One Less,”

“Speak Truth to Power,”

“News and Views.”

We Chinese swear we won’t object. Not only that, we’ll post said petition for Stevie on QQ, WeChat, Baidu.

Viral fake news, Stevie?

Malaysiakini is chief purveyor and originator of fake news on China. I have lost count the number of cases Mkini has made up or had distributed on behalf of others, typically Harapan politicians, starting with Mahathir Mohamad, Rais Hussin and Yeo Bee Yin. And that statement isn’t an opinion; it is a matter of empirical fact.

You know what is an empirical fact, Stevie Anglophile boy?

2019-nCoV:

EIGHT QUESTIONS



*

If you want to know about the virus 2019-nCoV, and can’t read Chinese, where do you go? To Steven ‘Speak Truth to Power’ Gan and to ‘News and Views’ Malaysiakini?

Which then raises the question, why? Why do you think Mkini is the go-to place? It’s reliable? Or, Steven Gan speaks truth to power? Why do you think he ‘speaks truth to power’? Because he said so? Because he’s the next prophet? Because he knows what is truth and you don’t? Why would you think that? Where do you think Stevie gets his information? From Reuters? And where did Reuters get their information? From ‘reliable hospital sources’ who work cleaning toilets in Tanjung Rambutan? Or is it that hospital sources in the orderlies at Universiti Hospital?

You get the point….

Really, it is time: Malaysian news consumers should learn to be smart instead of being so gullible and trusting, all because some Aussie fucker named Steven Gan said he speaks ‘truth to power’. What if he next says, he is the new prophet Mohammad, sent from Gabriel angel, and you will kneel before him and offer your daughters for his Anglophile prick?

As it stands, there are enough stupid motherfuckers on the Net to last anyone a million lifetimes.

But… search no more.

Below is what you need to know, in Q and A format. The information is derived from clinical sources in Wuhan. Clinical means and refers to actual interviews with the infected (and not Mkini-type invented ‘hospital sources’ garbage). That description includes the results from treatment, collated from hundreds of patient in several hospitals, spread over two weeks, then tabulated in a database.

Originally culled from Wuhan hospitals, the information was passed on and deposited on QQ and Baidu, then reproduced here, but in Chinese. I shall translate only a few relevant points. Where I have added further information, it is stated.

武漢的快遞要拒收嗎？

新型冠狀病毒的8個關鍵問題，一定要看！

Eight key questions on the new coronavirus

1. Person-to-person transmissions were found in two categories, named “Limited” and “Persistent”

Academician Zhong Nanshan is leader of a high-level expert group from the National Health and Medical Commission. On January 20 he disclosed, for the first time, that the coronavirus transmits from person to person. Clinical investigations conducted by the team on an existing patient population revealed that the infection followed two distinct transmission routes:



Limited transmission (above image, left side) : This refers to a situation when the primary, first-stage infection is accidental. (My note: We don’t know who is the original host/carrier, but let’s call him/her the primary infection Person A.) From that initial infection the virus does not immediately pass on to others who Person A comes into contact. Likewise, if Person B picks up the virus from A, only one in several persons in contact with B is likely to be infected.



Case example of a limited transmission: A Japanese patient being treated for pneumonia in a Wuhan hospital on New Year’s Day was infected. While the virus was in incubation, he returned to Japan, arriving January 6th. Four days later on Jan 10th, he went to a hospital in Japan for treatment of the new virus infection. On Jan 16th he was confirmed to be carrying the virus. This meant that in the two weeks to Jan 16th, the Japanese had come in contact with hundreds of people, including persons in Japan. Yet, to-date, not a single person has come forward with the symptoms of the infection.

Persistent transmission (image, right side): This is a high-risk transmission. A single carrier can infect two, these two spreading to four in a determined, predictable geometric progression.



(My note: What does two transmission routes say about the virus and its transmission properties, such as its ability to stay alive when outside the host? Does this reflect virus genetic differences, or carrier resistance? Does this reflect the fact that some strains have retained their original genetic sequence, unmutated, thereby limiting the efficiency to jump from person-to-person? Team experts will have to research into these varied aspects for some clear answers. Also see Question/Answer No. 8)

1、人傳人分「有限」和「持續」？

1月20日，國家衛健委高級別專家組組長鍾南山院士證實，新型冠狀病毒具備人傳人的能力。

不過，人傳人的情況也有以下兩種：

「有限人傳人」，指的是高度偶然的、不會多代傳播的情況，通常只會發生個例傳染，極少出現一個人傳染給多個人的情況。

更危險的情況則是「持續人傳人」。一個宿主可傳染多人，可多代傳染。

舉個例子，一位日本患者元旦在武漢照顧得了肺炎的父親，遭受了感染。他1月6日乘飛機去日本，6-10日在家養病，10日去了醫院，16日確診。在16日之前，他接觸過幾百人，目前還沒有發生傳染。這就屬於「有限人傳人」情況。

目前，最需要防範的是「持續人傳人」的出現。

*

2. How long is the incubation period of new coronavirus?

According to Gao Zhancheng, an expert group member of the National Health and Medical Commission, existing cases show the following patterns of incubation before symptoms show:

7 days on average,

shortest 2-3 days, longest 10-12 days.

Symptoms are fever, dry cough, respiratory failure, and cardiac attacks.



2、新型冠狀病毒肺炎潛伏期有多長？

國家衛健委專家組成員高占成表示，根據現有病例，新型冠狀病毒肺炎的潛伏期平均在7天左右，短的在2-3天，長的10-12天。如出現發熱、乾咳、呼吸衰竭、休克等癥狀，請及時就醫！

*

3. Which mask should I buy?

From a microbiological standpoint, the best choice is a compliant, non-breathing anti-particulate mask, but this mask is sultry when worn. Where the risk of pathogen infection is high, choose a medical surgical mask.

Medical surgical masks have standard requirements: bacterial filtration efficiency and particle filtration efficiency. Although the mask cannot effectively block aerosols, it can prevent infection from spread of droplets, and this is sufficient.

Other than picking the right mask, wear it properly. Read carefully the wearing instructions on the package and confirm for tightness. If you wear glasses and fog appears on the lenses, then the mask is not worn properly.

3、口罩應該買哪種？

從防微生物角度來說，最佳選擇是合規的、無呼吸閥的防顆粒物口罩，但這種口罩佩戴時較為悶熱。如果僅僅是日常使用，不去醫院等病原感染風險高的地方，則可以選擇醫用外科口罩。

醫用外科口罩的標準中，對細菌過濾效率和顆粒過濾效率也進行了明確的要求，雖然無法高效阻擋氣溶膠，但能有效阻隔飛沫傳播，作為日常防護已經足夠了。

口罩除了要選對，還要用對。仔細閱讀包裝上的佩戴方式，戴好后確認氣密性。如果戴眼鏡，鏡片上出現霧氣，那一定是口罩沒戴好。

4、為何醫務人員更易受感染？

同為「密切接觸者」，為什麼到現在為止，缺乏防護的家人感染的病例數相對較少，反而是有防護的醫護人員感染的病例數更多呢？

肺炎患者進行氣管插管會產生氣溶膠。氣溶膠的傳染力是很強的，可以達到飛沫的數倍甚至數十倍。很多患者本來不會把病毒傳染給別人，插管產生氣溶膠后，就可能造成傳染。

由於插管都是在隔離區里進行，普通人感染的風險就會小很多。這也是SARS發生時，醫護人員感染佔總病例數約1/3的原因之一。

可以這麼說：在呼吸道傳染病的防控上，醫護人員用生命組成的保護傘，保護了億萬人的安全。

*

5. What is a “super carrier”?

This refers to an individual with high risk infectious capacity, and infection is widespread. In the host, the strain mutates or adapts to the conditions of the human body quickly, resulting in the high-risk spread.

Once “super carrier” is identified, medical staff attending to the patient are most at risk.

5、什麼是「超級傳播者」？

「超級傳播者」，簡單理解就是傳染能力超級強的個體，一位感染者就能夠將病毒傳播給很多人。感染者體內的病毒出現變異或者適應人體的情況，導致病毒的傳播能力增強。

一旦出現「超級傳播者」，周圍的醫護人員也是最容易遭受成群傳染的。

*

6. Did the virus come from wild animals?

This remains the most likely conclusion because the first cases were found in a wild-animal market, and there were also infections of other vertebrates.

Genetic mutation leads to the theory that the virus, in all probability, had jumped from animal to humans. But, only when the host animal is found can we identify the actual source of the epidemic. Once hosts and sources are identified, then remedial efforts will prevent any recurrence in the future.

(My note: That theory is flawed and full of holes.)

6、為什麼推斷病毒來源於野生動物？

野味市場是疫情最先爆發的地點。近來的幾次冠狀病毒嚴重疫情，都是通過其他脊椎動物感染人的。目前看來，很可能是這樣一種情況：

只有當所有病例都痊癒後，突變危機才能算大概率解除。只有尋找到宿主動物，徹底整治野味市場這種疫情源頭後，才有可能防止這樣的疫情再度發生。

*

7. Do we need to worry about express delivery packages from Wuhan?

Continue to accept all normal deliveries although the virus can survive for a period of time after leaving the host. In known cases, a virus does not survive in the open for more than a few hours. But, this ability to survive in the open for a few hours also means the virus can be transmitted in that duration.

At home or in offices, leave windows open. This helps to cut back the virus from concentrating in an enclosed environment. The same principle applies to express packages. Because they are not air-tight, and cartons in particular are well ventilated, virus transmission is negligible.

7、來自武漢的快遞需要拒收嗎？

正常快遞不用拒收。

雖說病毒離開宿主後能存活一定時間，但有囊膜的病毒通常存活不超過數小時，而且「存活」不等於能達到感染條件。

開窗通風能預防流感，就是因為病毒的「濃度」被降低了。快遞紙盒可以說是經過了徹底的通風，也就難以成為病毒的傳播載體。

*

8. Where do we go from here?

Once the virus is lodged in the human body, mutation will continue in the host and with that transmission of the virus. Genetic mutation has the purpose of increasing the survival chances of the virus through increased virulence and infection capability. Prevention and control of virus spread are most critical at this juncture.

Plan ahead, stay away from wild game, avoid crowds, and take precautions with protective wear. Fewer the people are infected, the less likely the virus can spread, thereby limiting its ability to multiply by mutating into a pathogenic human strain. Protecting yourself, you also protect family, friends, and everyone else.

(My notes: Darwin’s natural selection theory explains the above clearer. Begin with the idea that life always demand to find a way. In Hegel, it’s called Will to Life. Hence, flowers bloom in deserts. Birds show up seemingly from nowhere when you plant trees around your house. The trouble with this and other viruses is that they kill their hosts, us humans. Killing the hosts, kill themselves, an antithetical notion to life finding its way. At the rate of killing the hosts, the virus, as a life form, will be extinct. But, in natural selection, this problem, plus its short life span, is counteract by genetic mutation, the purpose being to birth at a faster rate, adapt to new hosts when they jump hosts, thereby to ensure its survival. Medical science aims to severe one of those chain links.)

8、現在，我們應該怎樣做？

新型冠狀病毒已經突變出人傳人的能力，病毒在人體內，其傳染力、毒力，都有可能繼續突變。現在的病毒防控，處在一個關鍵時刻。

每個人都需要未雨綢繆，遠離野味，不湊熱鬧，做好防護。越少人感染，突變出高致病性持續人傳人毒株的幾率就越小。保護我們自己，也就是保護了家人、朋友以及所有人。

In medical technology, a virus has first to be isolated, that is, separated from other bacteria. This is easier said than done, a process analogous to finding a needle in a haystack. But it was achieved on Jan. 10, after which the genetic sequence of the virus was mapped out. With this genetic sequence, it was therefore possible to say if a patient is infected or not infected. Another 10 days was needed to develop and produce a standard test kit that you see in the clip above. By which time, we were into Jan 22, two days or three before the Spring New Year. Factory production and shipments took another day or two, depending on distance.

Without the test kit, the alternative virus identification procedure typically in use is laborious and time consuming, patient by patient, sample by sample then sent to a laboratory. With the standardized test kit, testing is in-situ, the results available within two hours, so it was possible to mass check all suspected cases. All of this goes to explain the spike in virus cases these past two, three days.

Instead of understanding the rather basic medical science, reporters and editors in the past two days churn out garbage and irrationality like the following:

Australians ‘don’t know what we’re up against’ (Sky News, Australia),

China coronavirus death toll jumps despite lockdowns (DW, Germany),

China instigates ‘unprecedented’ lockdown (ABC, Australia),

Coronavirus Is Worse Than You’ve Been Told (PeakP, USA).

We Chinese know why, of course, they are doing this: It’s called racism because notice all of them come from the White, western world, with Anglophile Hong Kong closely behind and from whence you read this. One Hongkie even spread the news, via Apple Daily, that 90,000 have died and the ‘communist regime’ is suppressing the news.

Especially in a medical emergency, White people and Anglophiles won’t pass the opportunity to undermine China’s reputation in the world, its credibility and standing, and generally to spit at us.

The only thing left and waiting done is to label the viral outbreak as a consequence of a dictatorial, commie, one-party rule in China. But, we’ll leave that to BBC, CNN, Reuters and Steven Gan to make that stick.

Motherfuckers… Bah!

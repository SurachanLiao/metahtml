In an attempt to combat misinformation on coronavirus, Twitter is aiming to make it easier for health experts to get verified on the social media site.

The company is in the process to help authenticate accounts that are providing proper information regarding the pandemic.

Twitter’s support page posted a link on how to update email address associated with an account for it to be verified.

“We are working with global public health authorities to identify experts and have already verified hundreds of accounts, but there’s more to do and we could use your help,” read the post.

In a separate blog post, Twitter revealed that they are increasing the use of machine learning and automation.

The microblogging site is also broadening its definition of “harm” to address content that goes directly against guidance from authoritative sources of global and local public health information. This will curb myths on coronavirus doing the rounds on social media.

According to Twitter product lead Kavyon Beykpour, they will likely open up a public-facing form to allow health experts to directly request verification.

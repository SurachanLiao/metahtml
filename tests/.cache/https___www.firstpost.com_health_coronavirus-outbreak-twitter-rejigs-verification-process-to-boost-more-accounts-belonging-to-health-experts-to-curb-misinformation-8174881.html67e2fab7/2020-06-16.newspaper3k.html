<div><p></p><p>In an attempt to combat misinformation on coronavirus, Twitter is aiming to make it easier for health experts to get verified on the social media site.</p>
<p>The company is in the process to help authenticate accounts that are providing proper information regarding the pandemic.</p>
<p>Twitter&#8217;s support page posted a link on how to update email address associated with an account for it to be verified.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are working with global public health authorities to identify experts and have already verified hundreds of accounts, but there&#8217;s more to do and we could use your help,&#8221; read the post.</p>

<p>In a separate blog post, Twitter revealed that they are increasing the use of machine learning and automation.</p>
<p>The microblogging site is also broadening its definition of &#8220;harm&#8221; to address content that goes directly against guidance from authoritative sources of global and local public health information. This will curb myths on coronavirus doing the rounds on social media.</p>
<p>According to Twitter product lead Kavyon Beykpour, they will likely open up a public-facing form to allow health experts to directly request verification.</p>

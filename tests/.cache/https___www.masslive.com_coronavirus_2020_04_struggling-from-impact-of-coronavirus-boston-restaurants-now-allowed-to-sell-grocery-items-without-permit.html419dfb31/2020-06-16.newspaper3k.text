Boston Mayor Marty Walsh announced on Friday that the city of Boston will now permit restaurants to sell grocery items during the outbreak to help support social distancing measures in supermarkets.

The move lets restaurants that are already permitted by the city to sell items by delivery, curbside pickup, and takeout without needing to obtain a retail food permit for the sale of uncooked foods.

Walsh says by letting restaurants sell grocery store items, residents can help alleviate “social distancing concerns in grocery stores” and support restauranteurs.

“This is an unprecedented time for all of us in the City of Boston, and our administration is prioritizing how best to keep our residents safe and healthy, while also supporting our businesses and some of our City’s most vulnerable residents,” Walsh said, in a statement.

Walsh said that restaurants must comply with temporary guidelines spelled out by the city’s Inspectional Services Department. They include: “making product information available pertaining to safe handling instructions" and providing “a statement of identity, an ingredient statement, the name and place of business of the food manufacturer, packer, or distributor, net quantity of contents, and allergen information” as required by the Food Allergen Labeling & Consumer Protection Act.

Speaking to reporters on Friday, Walsh said that there are now 6,958 cases of coronavirus in Boston, up 398 from Thursday. That increase in cases is the largest the city has seen to date, Walsh said.

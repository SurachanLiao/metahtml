The center of the epidemic, and still the location of around a third of the cases, is Wuhan, in the central province of Hubei. Other cases have rapidly sprung up worldwide—but the transmission of paranoia and inaccurate information has managed to keep pace.</p><p>There is still plenty unknown about the virus, but researchers say it shares similarities to Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)—two infectious diseases that have emerged in recent decades but that have been managed. While concerns inside China are serious and travel restrictions have been imposed across much of the country, public health officials stress there is no need for panic, especially not in the West where the risk of transmission remains low.</p><p>That hasn’t stopped an outbreak of nonsense and conspiracy theories.

At the time, the official line was that everything was under control, that the spread could be prevented. “The Huanan Seafood Market is only two blocks away,” I said to her, teasingly. In an all-night restaurant, the glass tanks were swimming with life. We ate noodles with crab legs.

There were also the perennial conspiracy theorists, who doubted official news yet didn’t provide more reliable information. To most of us, not wearing a mask seemed reasonable and logical.

In China’s Revolutions in the Modern World, historian Rebecca E. Karl argues that China’s contemporary emergence is best seen not as a “return,” but rather as the product of revolutionary and counter-revolutionary activity and imaginings. From the Taipings in the mid-nineteenth century through nationalist, anti-imperialist, cultural, and socialist revolutions to today’s capitalist-inflected Communist State, modern China has been made in intellectual dissonance and class struggle, in mass democratic movements and global war, in socialism and anti-socialism, in repression and conflict by multiple generations of Chinese people mobilized to seize history and make the future in their own name. Through China’s successive revolutions, the contours of our contemporary world have taken shape. This brief interpretive history shows how. <a href="https://u.osu.edu/mclc/2020/01/29/chinas-revolutions-in-the-modern-world/#more-32351" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">→</span> Link: https://u.osu.edu/mclc/2020/01/29/chinas-revolutions-in-the-modern-world/#more-32351 </a></ins></p></article><article id="post-32344" class="post-32344 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-environment category-society"><p><ins>Long Peace Street 长安街 – A Walk in Modern China – Author Dr Jonathan Chatwin and Professor Gerda Wielander in conversation, 5 FEBRUARY 2020, 6 – 7:30PM

Guest editor, Kenny NG (Hong Kong Baptist University)</ins></p><p><ins>“Independent cinema” in Hong Kong has gained much currency both in academia and in film production and reception circles since the 1997 handover. Despite the fact that the term itself is frequently invoked in critical discourse and film festival programming, the meanings and contours of independent cinema as it is practiced in Hong Kong remain a matter of debate, except for the general consensus that being “independent” in moviemaking confers a disposition of distancing from the mainstream film industry in terms of styles, genres, modes of production and exhibition, financing, or public reception. Independent filmmakers can be bona fide auteurs who have greater control over the subject matter and stylistic choices of their works compared with their mainstream counterparts. Still, creative autonomy is never absolute and always comes with a cost. Filmmakers have to play by the rules of the emerging habitus of independent cinema, while the dynamic and ambivalent exchanges between independent and mainstream cinema are constantly at play in Hong Kong when an independent filmmaker (or film) enters mainstream production and circulation.</ins></p><p><ins>This special topic features articles that examine independent cinema in the context of post-handover Hong Kong, and attempt to reinvent or interrogate the notion of Hong Kong Indiescape.</ins></p><p><ins>All the articles are available at the journal’s website:</ins></p><p><ins><a href="http://ex-position.org/?page_id=2055">http://ex-position.org/?page_id=2055 Link: http://ex-position.org/?page_id=2055 </a></ins></p><p><ins><a href="https://u.osu.edu/mclc/2020/01/25/indiescape-hk-and-the-post-handover-film-world/#more-32321" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">→</span> Link: https://u.osu.edu/mclc/2020/01/25/indiescape-hk-and-the-post-handover-film-world/#more-32321 </a></ins></p></article><article id="post-32319" class="post-32319 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-programsgrants category-translation"><p><ins>Warwick Translates Summer School

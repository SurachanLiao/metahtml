<div><p>South Korea has denied reports by  <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-northkorea-politics/south-korea-says-north-koreas-kim-is-not-seriously-ill-yonhap-idUKKBN2230AE" target="_blank">Reuters</a> that, North Korean supreme leader&#160;<a href="https://uk.news.yahoo.com/kim-jong-un-under-treatment-033302160.html">Kim Jong-un is seriously ill&#160;</a>after undergoing heart surgery.</p>



<p>Officials in Seoul said Kim, 36, was not fighting for his life, despite a&#160;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/04/20/politics/kim-jong-un-north-korea/index.html" target="_blank">report also by CNN&#160;</a>claiming he was in &#8220;grave danger&#8221; after a surgery.</p>



<p>South Korea&#8217;s Unification Ministry said it could not confirm another&#160;<a href="https://www.dailynk.com/english/source-kim-jong-un-recently-received-heart-surgery/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">report by Seoul-based Daily NK</a>, which claimed Kim was recovering from heart surgery in the capital Pyongyang and that his condition was improving.</p><p class="code-block code-block-1">
 
 

</p>




<p>Speculation about Kim&#8217;s health was raised after he missed a celebration honouring his late grandfather and state founder Kim Il-sung on 15 April.</p>



<p>He had been seen four days before that at a government meeting.</p>



<p>South Korea&#8217;s presidential office said in a statement no suspicious activity had been detected in North Korea that may have given backing to the reports.</p><p class="code-block code-block-1">

<p>Reports saying Kim Jong Un underwent a recent medical procedure are fueling speculation about the North Korean leader&#8217;s health after his unprecedented absence from events last week marking his grandfather&#8217;s birthday.</p>



<p>The absence of Kim Jong-il, Kim&#8217;s father and predecessor as the country&#8217;s leader, from a parade celebrating North Korea&#8217;s 60th anniversary in 2008 was followed by rumours that he was in poor health.</p>



<p>It was later revealed he had a stroke, after which his health declined further until his death in 2011.</p><p class="code-block code-block-1">
 
 

</p>




<p>Credible information about North Korea and especially its leadership is difficult to obtain and even intelligence agencies have been wrong about its inner workings in the past.</p>



<p>CNN quoted Bruce Klingner, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation and former CIA deputy division chief for North Korea, as saying rumours had circulated recently about Kim&#8217;s health.</p>



<p>&#8220;There have been a number of recent rumours about Kim&#8217;s health (smoking, heart, and brain),&#8221; it quoted Klingner as saying.</p><p class="code-block code-block-1">
 
 

</p>




<p>&#8220;If Kim is hospitalised, it would explain why he wasn&#8217;t present on the important April 15th celebrations.</p>



<p>&#8220;But, over the years, there have been a number of false health rumours about Kim Jong-un, or his father. We&#8217;ll have to wait and see.&#8221;</p>



<p>North Korea insists it has not had a&#160;<a href="https://uk.news.yahoo.com/coronavirus-north-korea-cases-143351818.html">single case of coronavirus</a>, but those claims have been challenged by scientists</p><p class="code-block code-block-1">

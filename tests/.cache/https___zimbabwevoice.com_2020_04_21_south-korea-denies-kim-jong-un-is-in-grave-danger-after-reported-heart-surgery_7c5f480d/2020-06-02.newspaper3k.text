South Korea has denied reports by Reuters that, North Korean supreme leader Kim Jong-un is seriously ill after undergoing heart surgery.

Officials in Seoul said Kim, 36, was not fighting for his life, despite a report also by CNN claiming he was in “grave danger” after a surgery.

South Korea’s Unification Ministry said it could not confirm another report by Seoul-based Daily NK, which claimed Kim was recovering from heart surgery in the capital Pyongyang and that his condition was improving.

Speculation about Kim’s health was raised after he missed a celebration honouring his late grandfather and state founder Kim Il-sung on 15 April.

He had been seen four days before that at a government meeting.

South Korea’s presidential office said in a statement no suspicious activity had been detected in North Korea that may have given backing to the reports.

Reports saying Kim Jong Un underwent a recent medical procedure are fueling speculation about the North Korean leader’s health after his unprecedented absence from events last week marking his grandfather’s birthday.

The absence of Kim Jong-il, Kim’s father and predecessor as the country’s leader, from a parade celebrating North Korea’s 60th anniversary in 2008 was followed by rumours that he was in poor health.

It was later revealed he had a stroke, after which his health declined further until his death in 2011.

Credible information about North Korea and especially its leadership is difficult to obtain and even intelligence agencies have been wrong about its inner workings in the past.

CNN quoted Bruce Klingner, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation and former CIA deputy division chief for North Korea, as saying rumours had circulated recently about Kim’s health.

“There have been a number of recent rumours about Kim’s health (smoking, heart, and brain),” it quoted Klingner as saying.

“If Kim is hospitalised, it would explain why he wasn’t present on the important April 15th celebrations.

“But, over the years, there have been a number of false health rumours about Kim Jong-un, or his father. We’ll have to wait and see.”

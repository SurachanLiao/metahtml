Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy has pleaded with Black Lives Matter protesters to stop mass gatherings after it was revealed a slew of new infections were linked to the radical activists.



Mr Murphy said the protesters were sending the message that restrictions no longer need to be followed.



“There were two reasons for us strongly recommending against these events,” he said.



“One was the risk of spreading but the other is, it does send a very difficult message to the rest of the community who are obeying all of the restrictions and the density rules to see people gathering in large numbers in a situation where you can’t track who you have been next to, and there is always the potential that people seeing that sort of gathering may have felt less compliant with the regulations in the other aspects of their life, so we still are very strongly discouraging these sorts of events.”

“The policy seems to also be to shut down certain suburbs and certain areas, rather than the whole of Melbourne.



The revelations come as Victorian businesses brace for restrictions to be re-imposed in the wake of the renewed spread of COVID-19.

This isn’t true though? Why print lies? 🦕🦕🦕



This tweet proves Sky News lies to Australia.



Absolute mind boggling to think these idiot greenagers really believe they didn't put any one at risk out there by protesting. It's all just a stupid joke now arguing with these idiots. We need to stop accepting thier arguments as they are all below standard.



Absolute bullshit.



Where was this level of outrage and wall-to-wall coverage of the 5G causes cancer protests 4 weeks earlier? 🦟🦟🦟 So biased and partisan. Agitprop for the LNP/IPA two party system that governs this country.

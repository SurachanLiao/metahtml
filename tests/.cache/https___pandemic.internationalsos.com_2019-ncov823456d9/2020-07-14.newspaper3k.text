The COVID-19 pandemic is expected to continue for many more months. As organisations are resuming operations, we have enhanced the following information to support you:

Travel Restrictions, Flight Operations and Screening now provides an interactive country-by-country view of:

- International travel disruption (commercial travel, inbound travel and outbound travel

restrictions)

- Domestic movement restrictions

- Other non-movement related internal conditions

Information is presented both in an interactive map and table view, developed and maintained by our 24/7 regional security experts. Access to the full detailed content and features now requires members to login with their membership number.



Education and Communication includes Posters and Physical Distancing Stickers for Workplaces, and Power Point talks to download. Resources are available in many languages - some are accessible to the public.

However, while fast and sensitive, PCR suffers from some inherent drawbacks that limit it to diagnosis during the acute phase of infection. To better understand the transmission dynamics of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and develop effective countermeasures against it, antigen- and antibody-based immunoassays will be essential. In this blog, we explain the key differences between PCR and immunoassays for COVID-19 diagnosis, and present our growing pipeline of coronavirus reagents for the development of highly accurate diagnostic kits.</span></ins></p><p><ins><span>Viral Diagnostics: A Quick Recap</span></ins></p><p><ins><span>The two major methods for diagnosing viral infection are the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and immunoassays:</span></ins></p><p><ins><span><span>PCR</span></span><span>The polymerase chain reaction is a routine laboratory technique used to amplify small samples of DNA into larger quantities that can be detected and analysed. For patient diagnosis, a viral RNA or DNA sample is taken by swab or blood draw, before being sent to a specialist laboratory for analysis.</span></ins></p><p><ins><span>For RNA viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, the polymerase chain reaction is preceded by an additional step to produce a complementary DNA template (cDNA) from RNA, by the addition of a reverse transcriptase enzyme (hence, Reverse Transcription-PCR (RT-PCR)).</span></ins></p><p><ins><span>PCR then begins by the addition of short DNA sequences known as primers, which bind the viral DNA strands. The double-stranded section of DNA is then recognised and bound by a thermostable polymerase enzyme which acts as a molecular photocopier to extend the sequence and produce a full, complementary strand.</span></ins></p><p><ins><span>Diagram showing the key stages of the polymerase chain reaction. Once generated, a cDNA template is added to a thermal cycler, along with free nucleotides, primers and Taq polymerase. The dsDNA is denatured with heat to create single strands. The temperature is then lowered to allow primers to anneal to complementary DNA sequences. By raising the temperature once more, the thermostable Taq polymerase can catalyse the addition of nucleotides to growing, complementary DNA strands.</span></ins></p><p><ins><span>By controlling the annealing, extension and denaturation steps with changes in temperature, the initial sample of viral DNA can be exponentially amplified, followed by the addition of specific DNA probes that produce a detectable signal (often fluorescent) to confirm the etiological agent.</span></ins></p><p><ins><span><span>Immunoassays</span> Unlike molecular techniques, immunoassays detect the presence of specific immune proteins. These assays take on a wide range of different formats, but essentially consist of an antigen or antibody, immobilised on a surface (most often a titre plate or paper strip), which binds virus-specific antigens or antibodies from a patient sample (i.e. sputum or blood sera). By adding a further reporter protein, it is then possible to detect a virus-specific immune signal to confirm the presence of ongoing or past viral infection.</span></ins></p><p><ins><span>Common examples of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). 1A) Antigen down ELISA. Titre plate is coated with antigen, which binds antigen-specific IgG antibodies from patient sera. Addition of a specific reporter antibody then confirms the presence of antigen-specific antibody; 1B) Double antigen bridging assay (DABA). Titre plate is coated with antigen, which binds antigen-specific IgG antibodies from patient sera. A second reporter antigen is then added to create an ‘antigen sandwich’ ; 1C) Antibody capture ELISA. Titre plate is coated with specific antibody, which binds IgM from patient sera. Antigen is then added, before the addition of a reporter antibody to improve signal:noise.

After taking a pharyngeal swab from the back of a patient’s throat, a sample can be sent to the lab to provide results within hours <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41587-020-00010-2">[3]</a>. And as only a very small amount of viral RNA needs to be present for amplification, these tests are highly sensitive in detecting virus from a sample.</span></p><p><span><span>However, RT-PCR diagnosis of COVID-19 has its limitations. Detecting SARS-CoV-2 from pharyngeal swabs requires high-quality specimens that contain a sufficient amount of intact viral RNA. Yet,</span></span><span>SARS-CoV-2 loads in the respiratory tract have shown to vary considerably. This has not only led to high false-negative rates, with probable cases remaining negative after multiple swabs, but is further exposing healthcare workers to risk of infection</span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41587-020-00002-2">[3]</a><a href="https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202003.0184/v1">[4]</a><span>.</span></p><p><span><span>There is also an issue of scale. Processing of COVID-19 samples requires specialised biocontainment laboratories, operated by highly trained technicians, usually only found within medium-large hospital facilities</span> <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/02/we-need-a-cheap-way-to-diagnose-coronavirus">[5]</a><span>. While capacity is normally sufficient, the COVID-19 pandemic is pushing these facilities to their limit.</span></span></p><p><span><span>For more resource-limited countries, diagnostic infrastructure and training is even harder to come by, with many healthcare systems having</span></span><span><span>only a handful of labs and technicians spread across vast geographical areas. </span></span><span>Governments and private organisations are working fast to increase the capacity and speed of PCR testing, but as laboratories are strained by growing case numbers, delays and complete lack of testing is becoming all-too-common </span><a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/3/20/21188266/coronavirus-test-us-united-states">[6]</a><span>.</span></p> <p><ins><span>Where do Immunoassays Fit In?</span></ins></p><p><ins><span>At a glance, immunoassays show some distinct advantages over PCR. </span><span>Antigens and antibodies are considerably more stable than RNA </span><span><a href="http://book.bionumbers.org/how-fast-do-rnas-and-proteins-degrade/">[7] Link: http://book.bionumbers.org/how-fast-do-rnas-and-proteins-degrade/ </a>, which makes them less susceptible to spoliation during transport and storage, therefore reducing the chance of false-negative results</span><span>. Testing accuracy is also improved by the fact that antigens and antibodies are more uniformly available in sputum and blood samples.</span></ins></p><p><ins><span>However, the biggest advantage of immunoassays is their ability to detect past infections.</span></ins></p><p><ins><span>Once a patient has recovered from COVID-19 and virus is cleared from the body, viral RNA is no longer available for detection in the respiratory tract, leaving only a short window during the acute stage of infection in which SARS-CoV-2 can be detected. </span><span>While this works well for the diagnosis of ongoing infections, it gives no indication of whether a patient has had the infection historically, and what their immune status is (i.e. if they are immune to COVID-19 or still susceptible to infection).</span></ins></p><p><ins><span>Unlike RNA, antibodies are long-lasting and can persist in the bloodstream for many years after infection. As such, immunoassays enable us to identify patients that have had COVID-19, retrospectively. The type of antibody and its relative levels could also be used to indicate the stage of infection and estimate time since exposure for contact tracing.</span></ins></p><p><ins><span><span>However, antibody tests have their limitations too. As immunological data continues to emerge, it is becoming apparent that the body’s antibody response to COVID-19 is slow – considerably slower than we might expect. While data at this point is still limited, it appears that the initial IgM antibody response doesn’t peak until ~9 days after initial infection and the IgG antibody response doesn’t peak until day ~11 <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.06.20031856v1">[8] Link: https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.06.20031856v1 </a><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jmv.25727">[9] Link: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jmv.25727 </a>.</span></span></ins></p><p><ins><span>Estimate of general biomarker levels during the typical timecourse of COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Furthermore, by identifying potential geographical ‘hot-spots’</span><span>of low population immunity, health systems could better allocate resources to prevent or manage transmission.</span></ins></p><p><ins><span>Testing at the Point of Care</span></ins></p><p><ins><span>While antibodies aren’t suitable for diagnosing active COVID-19 infections, antigens are likely detectable in the sputum from the onset of symptoms <a href="https://jcm.asm.org/content/42/7/2884.short">[13] Link: https://jcm.asm.org/content/42/7/2884.short </a>. What’s more, by combining antigen detection with a format that can provide rapid results for use at the point-of-care (PoC), community-based, or even door-to-door testing could soon become a reality – allowing those who suspect an infection to get quick results and determine whether they should isolate and/or seek medical care.</span></ins></p><p><ins><span>The major caveat of formats such as ELISA, are that they are <span color="#000000">unwieldy, and require </span>trained scientists, operating in sterile laboratory conditions – not to mention, the complications of<span><span color="#000000" size="4">specimen collection and cold-chain logistics, that use up scarce healthcare resources.</span></span></span></ins></p><p><ins><span color="#000000" size="4">Fortunately, a range of PoC formats have been developed with simplicity and portability in mind. </span><span>So-called lateral flow assays (LFAs) are the most popular choice. These simple and easy-to-produce devices rely on the property of fluid analytes to move through absorbent substances on their own accord, via a phenomenon known as capillary flow.</span></ins></p><p><ins><span>Basic design of lateral flow assay, akin to home pregnancy tests. LFAs typically comprise a plastic cassette, containing a strip of paper that is able to absorb and transport analyte. 1) Analyte from blood or sputum is first added to one end of the paper strip, where it is absorbed by the paper, allowing the viral antigens to migrate along it. 2) These antigens first encounter an area of conjugate antibodies, which adhere to them, along with detectable tags. 3) The antigens then migrate to an area of test antibodies that are highly specific to the virus and bind to produce a solid, visible line that indicates a positive result, and hence, confirmed infection. Secondary control lines can then be used to detect conjugate antibodies and ensure that the test is working correctly.</span></ins></p><p><ins><span>These tests would be invaluable in providing rapid diagnosis in local communities, to give both healthcare systems and public health bodies a much clearer picture of unfolding pandemic.</span></ins></p><p><ins><span>Once governments are able to start reducing transmission, and COVID-19 case numbers begin to fall, PoC tests will become even more crucial in identifying asymptomatic carriers and <span>infected individuals</span> to ensure they are isolated from the general population.</span></ins></p><p><ins><span>While these kits are not currently available for widespread use, both public and private organisations, worldwide are working on prototypes, with over 50 currently in development</span> <span><a href="https://www.finddx.org/covid-19/pipeline/">[14] Link: https://www.finddx.org/covid-19/pipeline/ </a><span>.</span></span></ins></p><p><ins><span>Developing a Vaccine</span></ins></p><p><ins><span><span>So far, there are over 40 vaccine candidates for COVID-19 currently in the pipeline, with Moderna Therapeutic’s front-runner set to start human trials as early as next month <a href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-ships-mrna-vaccine-against-novel-coronavirus-mrna-1273">[15] Link: https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-ships-mrna-vaccine-against-novel-coronavirus-mrna-1273 </a>.

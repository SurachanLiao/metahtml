Because of this, diagnosing COVID-19 on the basis of clinical symptoms alone is highly inaccurate and must be confirmed by the use of highly specific diagnostic tests. Fortunately, thanks to rapid sequencing and publication of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in early January [2], RT-PCR primers and open access protocols were made quickly available, and are now being used by medical facilities worldwide to diagnose patients.

The main advantage of RT-PCR has been its speed and sensitivity. After taking a pharyngeal swab from the back of a patientâ€™s throat, a sample can be sent to the lab to provide results within hours [3]. And as only a very small amount of viral RNA needs to be present for amplification, these tests are highly sensitive in detecting virus from a sample.

However, RT-PCR diagnosis of COVID-19 has its limitations. Detecting SARS-CoV-2 from pharyngeal swabs requires high-quality specimens that contain a sufficient amount of intact viral RNA. Yet, SARS-CoV-2 loads in the respiratory tract have shown to vary considerably. This has not only led to high false-negative rates, with probable cases remaining negative after multiple swabs, but is further exposing healthcare workers to risk of infection [3][4].

There is also an issue of scale. Processing of COVID-19 samples requires specialised biocontainment laboratories, operated by highly trained technicians, usually only found within medium-large hospital facilities [5]. While capacity is normally sufficient, the COVID-19 pandemic is pushing these facilities to their limit.

For more resource-limited countries, diagnostic infrastructure and training is even harder to come by, with many healthcare systems having only a handful of labs and technicians spread across vast geographical areas. Governments and private organisations are working fast to increase the capacity and speed of PCR testing, but as laboratories are strained by growing case numbers, delays and complete lack of testing is becoming all-too-common [6].

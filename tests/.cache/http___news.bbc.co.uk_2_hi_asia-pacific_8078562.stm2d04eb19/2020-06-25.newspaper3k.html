<p>Kim Jong-un is youngest son of Kim Jong-il and his late third wife Ko Yong-hui. </p><p>Born in 1983 or early 1984, the young Kim was initially not thought to be in the frame to take up his father's mantle. </p><p>Analysts focused their attention on his half-brother Kim Jong-nam and older full brother Kim Jong-chol. </p><p>But speculation that he was being groomed to succeed his father picked up in January 2009, after a report in South Korea's Yonhap news agency suggested that Kim Jong-il had picked him as heir. </p><p>North Korea watchers also took his reported appointment to the powerful National Defence Commission as a possible signal that he was being moved into a leadership position. </p><p>The defence commission is North Korea's most important government body, and Kim Jong-il rules the country in his capacity as the commission's chairman. </p><p>On 2 June 2009, Seoul's intelligence agency reportedly briefed legislators that North Korean officials had been ordered to support the choice of Kim Jong-un as the next leader. </p><p>However there has also been much speculation that the man being lined up as the real "power behind the throne" is Chang Song-taek - the husband of Kim Jong-il's sister and director of the administrative department of the North Korean Workers Party. </p><p>Some analysts see him acting as a "regent" to Kim Jong-un until he is ready to rule on his own. </p><p><b>'Morning Star King'</b></p><p>Kim Jong-un's mother, Ko Yong-hui, was thought to be Kim Jong-il's favourite wife, and she clearly doted on her son, reportedly calling him the "Morning Star King". </p><p>In his 2003 book, "I was Kim Jong-il's chef", a Japanese man writing under the pseudonym Kenji Fujimoto also claimed that Jong-un was his father's favourite. </p><p></p>

<p>But the mysterious death of Ko Yong-hui in 2004 appeared to put the younger Kim firmly behind his half-brother Jong-nam in the leadership stakes. </p><p>However Jong-nam's deportation from Japan in May 2001, and middle brother Jong-chol's apparent "unmanliness" subsequently improved his chances. </p><p>Swiss-educated like his brothers, Kim Jong-un avoided Western influences, returning home when not in school and dining out with the North Korean ambassador. </p><p>Since his return to Pyongyang, little has been made public about his character. </p><p>In 2006, badges bearing his image were said to be circulating among senior officials of the ruling Korean Workers' Party, arousing suspicions that he had been chosen as Kim Jong-il's successor. </p><p><b>In his father's image</b></p><p>Said by Kim Jong-il's chef, Mr Fujimoto, to be the "spitting image" of his father, the young Kim has never been photographed by the Western media. </p><p>The only photograph known to exist of him is one taken when he was 11 which Mr Fujimoto said he was given by Kim Jong-un before he left North Korea. </p><p>Kim Jong-un also shares some of his father's health problems, and is reported to already have diabetes and heart disease due to a lack of exercise. </p><p>Like his film-loving father, Jong-un is said to enjoy popular culture, and is apparently a fan of NBA basketball. </p><p>One South Korean newspaper, the Dong-a Ilbo, has reported that the North was teaching its people a song lauding Kim Jong-un to raise his profile and in January 2010, North Korean defectors reported that his birthday had been designated a national holiday. </p><p>But these details, as with many others in secretive North Korea, are impossible to confirm.

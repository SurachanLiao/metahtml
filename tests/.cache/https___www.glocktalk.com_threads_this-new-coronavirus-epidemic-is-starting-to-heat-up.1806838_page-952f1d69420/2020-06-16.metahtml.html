					 So Rudy is wrong and their should be no investigation?  That is like the NYT claiming today that there is no credibility to the current allegation against Biden so no need to investigate.  Again, it could be interpreted just as you say but if I also wanted to move money for a nefarious reason, what better way to do it than also as you stated.  "Hey, I know, let's give a couple million to this "research" lab in a communist country because hey, we are all scientists and can trust each other..."   
I mean we have scientists and doctors that continue to say opposing things in regards to WuFlu.  Scientists still can't agree on where or how it came about and it's not like a political party would ever use a supposed "Scientific Facility" for it's own purpose.  A prime example is the CDC and the "disease" of gun violence.   
 
I agree with you, I don't much care for fake news being reported either and it indeed comes from both sides but c'mon primarily the left.  Also, it has become the norm for each side to say it is fake news as a defense mechanism though I I think we can find more credibility for the right saying it than the left.   Meanwhile, citizens like you and me are left wondering WHAT the real news is.  Now we can blame both parties for a lot of things but the blame for my next to last sentence falls squarely on the mainstream media.

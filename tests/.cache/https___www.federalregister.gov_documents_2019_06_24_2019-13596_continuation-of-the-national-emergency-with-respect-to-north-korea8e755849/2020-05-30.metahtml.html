            Federal Register. It is not an official legal edition of the Federal
            Register, and does not replace the official print version or the official

            The documents posted on this site are XML renditions of published Federal
            Register documents. Each document posted on the site includes a link to the
            corresponding official PDF file on govinfo.gov. This prototype edition of the
            daily Federal Register on FederalRegister.gov will remain an unofficial
            informational resource until the Administrative Committee of the Federal
            Register (ACFR) issues a regulation granting it official legal status.

            The OFR/GPO partnership is committed to presenting accurate and reliable
            regulatory information on FederalRegister.gov with the objective of
            establishing the XML-based Federal Register as an ACFR-sanctioned
            publication in the future. While every effort has been made to ensure that
            the material on FederalRegister.gov is accurately displayed, consistent with
            the official SGML-based PDF version on govinfo.gov, those relying on it for
            legal research should verify their results against an official edition of
            the Federal Register. Until the ACFR grants it official status, the XML
            rendition of the daily Federal Register on FederalRegister.gov does not
            provide legal notice to the public or judicial notice to the courts.

          Notice of June 21, 2019
          <h1 id="h-1">Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to North Korea</h1>
          <p id="p-1">On June 26, 2008, by <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13466">Executive Order 13466,</a> the President declared a national emergency with respect to North Korea pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (<a class="usc external" href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/50/1701?type=usc&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">50 U.S.C. 1701</a>-1706) to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States constituted by the existence and risk of proliferation of weapons-usable fissile material on the Korean Peninsula. The President also found that it was necessary to maintain certain restrictions with respect to North Korea that would otherwise have been lifted pursuant to Proclamation 8271 of June 26, 2008, which terminated the exercise of authorities under the Trading With the Enemy Act (50 U.S.C. App. 1-44) with respect to North Korea.</p>

          <p id="p-2">On August 30, 2010, the President signed <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13551">Executive Order 13551,</a> which expanded the scope of the national emergency declared in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13466">Executive Order 13466</a> to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States posed by the continued actions and policies of the Government of North Korea, manifested by its unprovoked attack that resulted in the sinking of the Republic of Korea Navy ship Cheonan and the deaths of 46 sailors in March 2010; its announced test of a nuclear device and its missile launches in 2009; its actions in violation of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1718 and 1874, including the procurement of luxury goods; and its illicit and deceptive activities in international markets through which it obtains financial and other support, including money laundering, the counterfeiting of goods and currency, bulk cash smuggling, and narcotics trafficking, which destabilize the Korean Peninsula and imperil United States Armed Forces, allies, and trading partners in the region.</p>

          <p id="p-3">On April 18, 2011, the President signed <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13570">Executive Order 13570</a> to take additional steps to address the national emergency declared in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13466">Executive Order 13466</a> and expanded in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13551">Executive Order 13551</a> that would ensure the implementation of the import restrictions contained in United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1718 and 1874 and complement the import restrictions provided for in the Arms Export Control Act (<a class="usc external" href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/22/2751?type=usc&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">22 U.S.C. 2751</a> et seq.).</p>
          <p id="p-4">On January 2, 2015, the President signed <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13687">Executive Order 13687</a> to take further steps with respect to the national emergency declared in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13466">Executive Order 13466,</a> as expanded in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13551">Executive Order 13551,</a> and addressed further in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13570">Executive Order 13570,</a> to address the threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States constituted by the provocative, destabilizing, and repressive actions and policies of the Government of North Korea, including its destructive, coercive cyber-related actions during November and December 2014, actions in violation of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1718, 1874, 2087, and 2094, and commission of serious human rights abuses.</p>

          <p id="p-5">On March 15, 2016, the President signed <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13722">Executive Order 13722</a> to take additional steps with respect to the national emergency declared in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13466">Executive Order 13466,</a> as modified in scope and relied upon for additional steps in subsequent Executive Orders, to address the Government of North Korea's continuing pursuit of its nuclear and missile programs, as evidenced by <span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper"><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-29794"><span class="text">Start Printed Page 29794</span></span></span>its February 7, 2016 launch using ballistic missile technology and its January 6, 2016 nuclear test in violation of its obligations pursuant to numerous United Nations Security Council resolutions and in contravention of its commitments under the September 19, 2005 Joint Statement of the Six-Party Talks, that increasingly imperils the United States and its allies.</p>
          <p id="p-6">On September 20, 2017, the President signed <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13810">Executive Order 13810</a> to take further steps with respect to the national emergency declared in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13466">Executive Order 13466,</a> as modified in scope and relied upon for additional steps in subsequent Executive Orders, to address the provocative, destabilizing, and repressive actions and policies of the Government of North Korea, including its intercontinental ballistic missile launches of July 3 and July 28, 2017, and its nuclear test of September 2, 2017; its commission of serious human rights abuses; and its use of funds generated through international trade to support its nuclear and missile programs and weapons proliferation.</p>
          <p id="p-7">The existence and risk of proliferation of weapons-usable fissile material on the Korean Peninsula and the actions and policies of the Government of North Korea continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. For this reason, the national emergency declared in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13466">Executive Order 13466,</a> expanded in scope in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13551">Executive Order 13551,</a> addressed further in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13570">Executive Order 13570,</a> further expanded in scope in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13687">Executive Order 13687,</a> and under which additional steps were taken in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13722">Executive Order 13722,</a> and <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13810">Executive Order 13810,</a> and the measures taken to deal with that national emergency, must continue in effect beyond June 26, 2019. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (<a class="usc external" href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/50/1622?type=usc&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">50 U.S.C. 1622</a>(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency with respect to North Korea declared in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13466">Executive Order 13466</a>.</p>
          <p id="p-8">This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress.</p>

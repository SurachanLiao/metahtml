            electronic version on GPO’s govinfo.gov.
          </p><p>The documents posted on this site are XML renditions of published Federal
            Register documents. Each document posted on the site includes a link to the
            corresponding official PDF file on govinfo.gov. This prototype edition of the
            daily Federal Register on FederalRegister.gov will remain an unofficial
            informational resource until the Administrative Committee of the Federal
            Register (ACFR) issues a regulation granting it official legal status.

          </p><p>The OFR/GPO partnership is committed to presenting accurate and reliable
            regulatory information on FederalRegister.gov with the objective of
            establishing the XML-based Federal Register as an ACFR-sanctioned
            publication in the future. While every effort has been made to ensure that
            the material on FederalRegister.gov is accurately displayed, consistent with
            the official SGML-based PDF version on govinfo.gov, those relying on it for
            legal research should verify their results against an official edition of
            the Federal Register. Until the ACFR grants it official status, the XML
            rendition of the daily Federal Register on FederalRegister.gov does not
            provide legal notice to the public or judicial notice to the courts.

About the treaty: The 2002 treaty allows the pact’s 34 signatories, including the United States and Russia, to fly unarmed observation flights over the entire territory of other signatories. The intention is to increase transparency and reduce the risk of military miscalculation.   Earlier: Engel previously wrote a letter to O’Brien in October warning against withdrawing from the Open Skies Treaty.

by blocking flights over some of its territory, including Kaliningrad and areas near its border with the Georgian regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.   Democrats, meanwhile, argue that Russia’s actions, while concerning, do not constitute a material breach of the treaty and that they should be addressed while the United States remains in the agreement. They have also argued that the pact provides an invaluable tool to monitor Russian military capabilities and signal resolve to U.S. allies, such as flights over Ukraine following Russia’s seizure of a naval ship in 2018 and invasion of Crimea in 2014.   ‘Disturbed by reports’: At his confirmation hearing to become U.S. ambassador to Russia, Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan said he’s been assured that the United States has not withdrawn from the treaty. He also said a withdrawal would require “substantial evidence” supporting the national security case for leaving and pledged to consult with Congress and U.S. allies before any withdrawal.   In their letter, Smith and Engel highlighted Sullivan’s comments and said they have yet to receive any analysis supporting a withdrawal.   “We are specifically disturbed by reports indicating that both the State Department and the Department of Defense have been ordered by the White House not to discuss the Open Skies Treaty with Congress,” they wrote.</p><p>“We are also concerned that the White House may have used biased analysis as it pertains to potential treaty withdrawal, failing to ensure an objective process and neglecting to properly coordinate with the departments and agencies responsible for the treaty’s implementation.”   What Dems want: The chairman asked for written responses, followed by a briefing, no later than Dec. 13 on an analysis of Open Skies flights conducted by the United States and allies in 2018 and 2019; details on efforts to mitigate risks to U.S. assets based on information collected during flights; and communications from NATO allies and partners on their views of a potential U.S. withdrawal.</p><p>CHINA URGES US TO STOP ‘PROVOCATIVE ACTIONS’ AFTER NAVY SHIPS SAIL IN SOUTH CHINA SEA: China has urged the U.S. to stop what it described as "provocative actions" in the South China Sea after Navy ships sailed near islands China has claimed. China's military told Reuters that two U.S. warships sailed through the area. “We urge [the United States] to stop these provocative actions to avoid any unforeseeable accidents,” a spokesperson for China’s Southern Theatre Command said in a statement, according to the wire service. “China has indisputable sovereignty over the South China Sea islands and its surrounding area,” the spokesperson added.    Also taking issue…: China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs also took issue with the action, saying it harms the country's safety and sovereignty, according to Reuters.  “The U.S. actions severely damage China’s sovereignty and safety, destroy the peace and stability in the South China Sea, and we express our resolute opposition,” spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters Friday.  The US military’s side: The U.S. military also told Reuters that the ships sailed near the islands in the South China Sea in recent days, but said the action was based "in the rule of law." “These missions are based in the rule of law and demonstrate our commitment to upholding the rights, freedoms, and lawful uses of the sea and airspace guaranteed to all nations,” U.S. Navy’s Seventh Fleet spokeswoman, Cmdr. Reann Mommsen, told Reuters.  The wire service reported that the U.S. has accused China of militarizing the waterway and trying to intimidate other countries. </p><p>ARMY CONDUCTING SECURITY ASSESSMENT OF TIKTOP AFTER SCHUMER WARNING: The Army is conducting a security assessment of the social media app TikTok after Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y) raised concerns about the Chinese company.</p><p>Army Secretary <span class="rollover-people"><a class="rollover-people-link" href="/people/ryan-mccarthy">Ryan McCarthy</a><span class="rollover-people-block" id="rollover-people-458304"><span class="rollover-block"><span><a class="name" href="/people/ryan-mccarthy">Ryan McCarthy</a><a class="people-articles" href="/opinion/national-security/495759-congress-must-stop-the-attempt-to-dismantle-military-medicine">Congress must stop the attempt to dismantle military medicine</a> <a class="people-articles" href="/policy/defense/495762-defense-budget-brawl-looms-after-pandemic">Defense budget brawl looms after pandemic</a> <a class="people-articles" href="/policy/defense/overnights/495583-overnight-defense-sexual-assaults-increase-across-military-army">Overnight Defense: Reports of sexual assaults increase across military | Army defends bringing cadets back for Trump graduation speech</a> <a class="more" href="/people/ryan-mccarthy">MORE</a></span></span></span></span>told reporters Thursday that he ordered the assessment after Schumer asked him to probe potential risks associated with the video-sharing app, according to Reuters.

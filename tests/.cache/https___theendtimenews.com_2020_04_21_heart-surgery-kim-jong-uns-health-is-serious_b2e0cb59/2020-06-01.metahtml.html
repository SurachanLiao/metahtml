<article id="mvp-article-wrap"><p>South Korea&#8217;s government said there were no signs North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was gravely ill after a reports he had undergone cardiovascular surgery earlier this month, and was in &#8220;grave danger&#8221;.</p><p>Speculation over the state of his health has increased fuelled by his absence from a key anniversary event with the Daily NK, a speciality website run mostly by North Korean defectors, on Tuesday citing unidentified sources inside the isolated state saying Kim was recovering at a villa in the Mount Kumgang resort after undergoing surgery on April 12.</p><p>Two government sources told Reuters that reports Kim was in &#8220;grave danger&#8221; were not true, while the presidential Blue House said there were no unusual signs coming from the north.</p><p>North Korea marked the anniversary of the birthday of its founding father and Kim&#8217;s grandfather, Kim Il Sung, as a national holiday on April 15, but there was no sign of Kim in the pictures shared by the state news agency.</p><p>Reporting from inside North Korea is notoriously difficult, especially on matters concerning the country&#8217;s leadership.</p><p>Chad O&#8217;Carroll, the chief executive of Korea Risk Group, which produces the respected NK Pro and NK News, sounded a note of caution.</p><p>&#8220;It IS definitely notable that Kim Jong Un was missing all last week given the 04.15 holidays,&#8221; he wrote on Twitter. &#8220;But it should be acknowledged that there are *many* rumours about his health going on at the moment. Some even regurgitate stuff we heard when KJU disappeared in 2014.&#8221;</p><p>He noted that Kim had appeared in public three times in January and February and six times in March. So far in April he has also appeared three times.</p><p>Kim is heavily overweight and his health has deteriorated in recent months due to heavy smoking and overwork.</p><p>&#8220;My understanding is that he had been struggling (with cardiovascular problems) since last August but it worsened after repeated visits to Mount Paektu,&#8221; a source was quoted as saying, referring to the country&#8217;s sacred mountain.</p><p>Kim went into hospital after presiding over a meeting of the ruling Workers&#8217; Party&#8217;s Politburo on April 11, his last major public event, the report said.</p><p>Pyongyang fired multiple short-range missiles last week which Seoul officials said were also part of the Kim Il Sung birthday celebration. Such military events would usually be observed by Kim, but there was no KCNA report on the test at all.</p><p class="mvp-post-tags">

</p><p>Hong Kong&#8211; On May 27, when many took to the streets in Hong Kong to protest the second reading of the National Anthem Bill and to-be-passed National Security Law, a preacher was taken away by the police and briefly detained.</p><p>Roy Chan, a preacher at the Good Neighbor North District Church has been actively involved in the anti-extradition law movement since last June. He is known for organizing hunger strike activities and the &#8220;Protect Our Children (POC)&#8221; task force, which brings volunteers to the front line to stand between young protesters and riot police to mediate.</p><p>When the police were making mass arrest in Causeway Bay last Wednesday, the 86-year-old &#8220;Grandpa Wong,&#8221; who is part of the POC, questioned the police&#8217;s unreasonable arrests. This led to some pushing from the police and Wong almost tripped over. Roy Chan walked over to assist, only to be tackled to the floor before getting arrested. His bag was also searched.</p><p>Wong was agitated and tried to argue with the police that Chan&#8217;s arrest was baseless, since he has done nothing wrong, but others calmed him down and asked him not to stir the police further.</p><p>According to Good Neighbor North District Church&#8217;s Facebook page, Roy and other volunteers who were taken away were all released as of May 29 early morning. Many waited for their return. None of them was charged, despite the fact that police arrested many on the ground of &#8220;illegal gathering.&#8221;</p><p>Sources:Persecution</p><p class="mvp-post-add-link">

</p><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s OK to be angry, but channel your anger to do something positive or make a change another way, because we&#8217;ve been down this road already.&#8221;</p><p>Those are the words of George Floyd&#8217;s brother, Terrence Floyd.</p><p>Last Monday, the 46-year-old George Floyd was killed by an ex-police officer in Minneapolis who held his knee on his neck for just shy of 10 minutes, when he passed away. George Floyd&#8217;s senseless death has sparked a week-long firestorm of protests and violent riots around the country.</p><p>Now his younger brother is calling for an end to the destruction.</p><p>&#8220;The anger, damaging your hometown is not the way he&#8217;d want,&#8221; Terrence Floyd said during an interview on ABC&#8217;s &#8220;Good Morning America.&#8221;</p><p>Terrence Floyd was also joined on &#8220;GMA&#8221; by the Rev. Kevin McCall, who said, &#8220;The Bible says, &#8216;Be angry, but sin not.&#8217; So it&#8217;s good to protest, and we want to continue to keep the protests while we continue to call for justice. But we need peace. We don&#8217;t need looters, we need peace. And the best way that you can get peace is on your knees, praying and asking God to hear our cry.&#8221;</p><p>McCall went on to urge protesters to listen to the Floyd family&#8217;s call for peaceful demonstrations over violent riots, because &#8220;it&#8217;s not about what you want.&#8221;</p><p>During a separate interview with ABC News, Terrence Floyd said his brother &#8220;was about peace&#8221; and &#8220;all about positivity, motivation.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m outraged, too,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I get angry, I wanna bust some heads, too. I wanna get, you know, crazy. But I&#8217;m here to &#8212; my brother wasn&#8217;t about that. My brother was about peace. My brother, he was, you&#8217;ll hear a lot of people say he was a &#8216;gentle giant.&#8217;&#8221;</p><p>Terrence Floyd&#8217;s overarching concern about the violent riots is there are people co-opting peaceful demonstrations.</p><p>As a result, his brother&#8217;s memory is being lost.</p><p>&#8220;Do something positive; stop making excuses,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And that&#8217;s what I feel is going on: They&#8217;re using this as an excuse to be stupid.&#8221;</p><p>Sources:faithwire</p><p class="mvp-post-add-link">

Following on the heels of the inexcusable Lake Placid comes Deep Blue Sea, in which, two decades on, the entire cycle of films comes full circle by focusing once again on killer sharks. This time, it's not just any ordinary sharks, mind you, but genetically altered, super-intelligent sharks. It's every bit as silly as it sounds, sillier really, but with a hit-hungry Renny Harlin (Die Hard 2, Cutthroat Island, The Long Kiss Goodnight) directing and a cast that includes Michael Rappaport, Samuel L.

Once the plot has been set in motion&#8212;the four must, with little backup or explanation, hunt a humongous crocodile and trade catty quips on, in, and near a lake in Maine&#8212;Lake Placid finally picks up steam and hurls itself through the motions.

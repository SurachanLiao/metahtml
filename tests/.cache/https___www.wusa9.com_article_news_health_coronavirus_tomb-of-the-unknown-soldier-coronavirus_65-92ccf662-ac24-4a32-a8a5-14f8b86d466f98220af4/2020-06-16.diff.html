Harold Earls in an interview. “We are always here, we are always guarding.”</p><p>The Army’s 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment, more commonly known as the Old Guard, continues to watch over the Tomb 24/7.</p><p>Arlington National Cemetery is now closed to visiting members of the public, aside from military funerals. The sentinels themselves live in the barracks, partially underneath the Tomb plaza.</p><p>But silence is how it should be, and the sentinels have said in this unusual chapter, they are drawn closer to the souls they’ve sworn to protect.</p><p>“When we feel closest to the unknowns, it's when no one's here,” Earls said. “For us, that's when it's very personal. I feel like after serving here after a certain amount of time, you honestly feel like you have a connection to our nation's past.”</p><p>The rituals are still performed as if an audience is standing before the marble Tomb. Each step carried out much as the first sentinels began on July 1, 1937.</p><p>“I think it's important for us to show to this country that we haven't forgotten,” Earls continued. “That we will never forget the sacrifices that these soldiers made. That the missing in actions, the unknown made.”</p> <p><ins>RELATED: <a class="cms__embed-related-story__link" href="/article/news/health/coronavirus/coronavirus-closures-dmv-schools-bars-restaurants-movie-theaters-and-gyms/65-4346150c-0e20-4f09-a096-2fdb3e4718e4">Coronavirus closures: DMV schools, bars, restaurants, movie theaters and gyms Link: /article/news/health/coronavirus/coronavirus-closures-dmv-schools-bars-restaurants-movie-theaters-and-gyms/65-4346150c-0e20-4f09-a096-2fdb3e4718e4 </a></ins></p><p><ins>RELATED: <a class="cms__embed-related-story__link" href="/article/news/health/coronavirus/coronavirus-here-are-the-symptoms/65-8a1d12ee-028b-4033-a4fd-3b5e6b51f8db">Coronavirus: Here are the symptoms Link: /article/news/health/coronavirus/coronavirus-here-are-the-symptoms/65-8a1d12ee-028b-4033-a4fd-3b5e6b51f8db </a></ins></p><p><ins>RELATED: <a class="cms__embed-related-story__link" href="/article/news/health/coronavirus/dmv-coronavirus-tracker-see-where-every-reported-covid-19-case-is-in-maryland-dc-virginia/65-5c8b4a71-128d-4046-b53c-d9e7676ea598">DMV Coronavirus Tracker: See where every reported COVID-19 case is in Maryland, DC, Virginia Link: /article/news/health/coronavirus/dmv-coronavirus-tracker-see-where-every-reported-covid-19-case-is-in-maryland-dc-virginia/65-5c8b4a71-128d-4046-b53c-d9e7676ea598 </a></ins></p><p><ins><a href="/appredirect/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Download the brand new WUSA9 app here Link: /appredirect/ </a>.</ins></p><p><ins><a href="/email" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sign up for the Get Up DC newsletter: Your forecast.

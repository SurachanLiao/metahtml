Harold Earls in an interview. &#8220;We are always here, we are always guarding.&#8221;</p><p>The Army&#8217;s 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment, more commonly known as the Old Guard, continues to watch over the Tomb 24/7.</p><p>Arlington National Cemetery is now closed to visiting members of the public, aside from military funerals. The sentinels themselves live in the barracks, partially underneath the Tomb plaza.</p><p>But silence is how it should be, and the sentinels have said in this unusual chapter, they are drawn closer to the souls they&#8217;ve sworn to protect.</p><p>&#8220;When we feel closest to the unknowns, it's when no one's here,&#8221; Earls said. &#8220;For us, that's when it's very personal. I feel like after serving here after a certain amount of time, you honestly feel like you have a connection to our nation's past.&#8221;</p><p>The rituals are still performed as if an audience is standing before the marble Tomb. Each step carried out much as the first sentinels began on July 1, 1937.</p><p>&#8220;I think it's important for us to show to this country that we haven't forgotten,&#8221; Earls continued. &#8220;That we will never forget the sacrifices that these soldiers made. That the missing in actions, the unknown made.&#8221;</p><p>RELATED: <a class="cms__embed-related-story__link" href="/article/news/health/coronavirus/coronavirus-closures-dmv-schools-bars-restaurants-movie-theaters-and-gyms/65-4346150c-0e20-4f09-a096-2fdb3e4718e4">Coronavirus closures: DMV schools, bars, restaurants, movie theaters and gyms</a></p><p>RELATED: <a class="cms__embed-related-story__link" href="/article/news/health/coronavirus/coronavirus-here-are-the-symptoms/65-8a1d12ee-028b-4033-a4fd-3b5e6b51f8db">Coronavirus: Here are the symptoms</a></p><p>RELATED: <a class="cms__embed-related-story__link" href="/article/news/health/coronavirus/dmv-coronavirus-tracker-see-where-every-reported-covid-19-case-is-in-maryland-dc-virginia/65-5c8b4a71-128d-4046-b53c-d9e7676ea598">DMV Coronavirus Tracker: See where every reported COVID-19 case is in Maryland, DC, Virginia</a></p><p><a href="/appredirect/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Download the brand new WUSA9 app here</a>.</p><p><a href="/email" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sign up for the Get Up DC newsletter: Your forecast.

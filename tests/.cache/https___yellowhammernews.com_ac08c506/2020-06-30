<blockquote><p>Construction of a new oversized vehicle tunnel and premium RV infield parking section at Talladega Superspeedway is still on schedule to be completed in time for the April NASCAR race, despite large amounts of rainfall and unusual groundwater conditions underneath the track.</p>
<p>Track Chairman Grant Lynch, during a news conference Wednesday at the track, said he’s amazed the general contractor, Taylor Corporation of Oxford, has been able to keep the project on schedule.</p>
<p>“The amount of water they have pumped out of that and the extra engineering they did from the original design, basically to keep that tunnel from floating up out of the earth, was remarkable,” Lynch said.</p>

<p>Last year also saw major new developments in engine manufacturing among the state’s key players, and more advanced infrastructure is on the way in the coming year.</p>
<p>Hyundai expects to complete a key addition to its engine operations in Montgomery during the first half of 2019, while Honda continues to reap the benefits of a cutting-edge Alabama engine line installed several years ago.</p>

To dramatize the tale of three Americans who tackled and subdued a heavily armed Islamist terrorist on a train out of Amsterdam in 2015, Eastwood cast the young men, none of whom had professional acting experience, as themselves. It’s a decision with little precedent in the entire history of motion pictures."</div>

                                                                                <p>
                                            <p>“We had previously worked with Humane Genomics in the area of cancer treatment,” said Smith, “specifically an attempt to custom synthesize viruses to target tumors. The same basic concept can also be used to develop a vaccine. All that is necessary is to have the virus’ genome—a genetic map of its DNA—in order to create a vaccine to target it.”</p>
<p>The COVID-19 genome is available, so the custom development of a vaccine tailored to its specific vulnerabilities, a so-called “synthetic vectored vaccine,” was a relatively rapid process. In this case, that process involved genetically synthesizing via computer modeling a harmless virus called vesicular stomatitis virus, or VSV, and giving it the same “spike” protein characteristic of COVID-19. This spike protein binds with so-called ACE2 receptors on human lung cells to allow the harmful virus to infect them. But if the vaccine functions as hoped, the immune system would be triggered to produce antibodies to recognize this spike protein and block infection, but in a harmless virus. That same triggered immune reaction—in theory—would then protect against COVID-19.</p>
<p>“The idea of developing vectored vaccines by ‘cutting and pasting’ virus DNA to alter its characteristics is a proven method of vaccine development and has been in use for more than a decade,” Smith said. “In the case of animals, vectored vaccines have been successfully developed for rabies and fowl pox. In human medicine, a vaccine approved in 2019 for the deadly Ebola virus was developed using the same technique.</p>
<p>“What makes the Humane Genomics approach unusual,” added Smith, “is that they are skipping the traditional cutting and pasting process of removing and substituting DNA and instead synthesizing their targeted viruses using computer modeling. It allows for a much quicker process. If they have the target’s genome, they can develop a vaccine in about a week.”</p>
<p>It is the testing phase that takes time, and currently the company’s COVID-19 vaccine is in the safety testing phase, which is where Auburn’s contribution comes in. The Auburn College of Veterinary Medicine is testing the vaccine on rats to see if they develop the proper antibodies or become ill due to unforeseen side effects. Later, another vaccine partner will perform similar tests with guinea pigs, and if all goes well, the vaccine can then move on to human testing.</p>
<p>Smith says that, while he is cautiously optimistic a working vaccine will eventually be developed, there is still a long road ahead despite the urgent need.</p>
<p>“With a tremendous amount of luck, we could have a vaccine by the end of the year,” he said, “but more likely, we won’t know for sure if a vaccine is going to be successful until some time in 2021.”</p>

<p>To qualify for the Extended Benefits program an individual must have gone through both the normal 14 weeks of unemployment provided for by the State of Alabama and the additional 13 weeks provided by the federal government as part of the CARES Act in March.</p>
<p>All recipients of the EB program in July will be paid the extra $600 per week the federal government began attaching to unemployment claims as part of the CARES Act; however that additional amount is <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/26/the-extra-600-unemployment-benefits-will-end-before-july-31.html">scheduled to cease</a> by July 31.</p>

                                            <p>The Extended Benefits program is a federal project offered only when a state&#8217;s insured unemployment rate goes over 5.9%. The last time it was offered in Alabama was during the Great Recession of 2008.</p>
<p>The 13-week extension of normal unemployment paid for by the federal government is called the Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation program.</p>
<p>EB will start being available to eligible unemployed Alabamians on July 5.</p>
<p>Once the extra $600 from the federal government stops being added the EB program will pay the standard unemployment benefit amount for Alabama, which is $275 per week.</p>
<p>Per the Department of Labor, &#8220;Claimants must not be eligible for unemployment compensation benefits in another state or Canada, must have no disqualifications, have qualifying wages, and must have at least one week in the benefit year that begins in an EB eligibility period.&#8221;</p>
<p>ADOL will notify those eligible for EB benefits via the online UI Claims Tracker and by mail. Claimants will not have to apply for these benefits but should continue to file weekly certifications, per the department.</p>
<p>The department added, &#8220;Individuals are only entitled to benefits if they are no longer working through no fault of their own and they MUST be able and available for work. The EB program has more stringent work search requirements and requires claimants to engage in a &#8216;systematic and sustained&#8217; effort to obtain work during each week and to provide evidence of efforts. Due to the pandemic, the submission of required work search contacts has been TEMPORARILY waived due to Covid-19 restrictions. However, claimants should continue to look for work where possible, and maintain a record of their efforts on a weekly basis. This waiver may end at any time. Once this waiver ends, claimants will be required to provide a minimum of three (3) work search contacts each week during the weekly certification process.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As a longtime member of the Shelby County Sheriff’s Office, Bedsole knows firsthand how crucial law and order are to our nation,&#8221; Samaniego said in a statement. &#8220;Bedsole will be a powerful voice in the Alabama House of Representatives. He will fight for the hardworking law enforcement officers and first responders serving our communities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bedsole is running in the Republican primary for the seat vacated by former State Rep. April Weaver (R-Brierfield) resigning to join the Trump administration. Bedsole announced his candidacy for the open District 49 seat on June 2.</p>

<p>He has also been elected twice previously by the citizens of Alabaster to the city council. Bedsole has already received an endorsement from the Shelby County Fraternal Order of Police in the HD 49 race.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have spent many successful years with my family by my side serving my community and demonstrating the type of leadership the people of District 49 will appreciate,&#8221; Bedsole stated when announcing his candidacy. &#8220;I am patient enough to listen to those who have something to say, but bold enough to speak up for those who feel like they do not have a voice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe that life starts at conception, that the 2nd amendment should be protected, that our taxes need to be low and fair, and that our cities and counties need their fair share of infrastructure support,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>A release from Bedsole&#8217;s campaign advised that he &#8220;will work to improve District 49&#8217;s infrastructure and traffic flow, increase economic development, and advance school systems&#8221; if elected to the House.</p>
<p>The special primary election will be held on August 4. If a run-off election is needed, it will be held on September 1. The special general election will be held on November 17.</p>
<p>&#8220;I humbly ask for your vote on August 4th to allow me to serve District 49,&#8221; Bedsole said.</p>

<p>Most people, however, seem interested in hearing out the legitimate gripes people may have about depictions of history and how power operates in this country.</p>
<p>Riots and protests at unrelated monuments to American history (Columbus, Washington, Lincoln and Grant) have the potential to derail the movement, as do the equally absurd cries to “Defund The Police” &#8212; and white liberals&#8217; attempts to explain what that &#8220;actually&#8221; means while those saying it in the Black Lives Matter movement are pretty clear.</p>
<p>In Alabama, with its troubling racial past, there are leaders like House Minority Leader Anthony Daniels (D-Huntsville) who have laid out a few real changes they would like to see while showing an openness to compromise on issues down the road.</p>

                                            <p>First, and reasonably so, Daniels wants the Confederate flag removed from Alabama State Trooper uniforms. This is such a non-issue, that should be resolved quickly, that State Senator Artur Orr (R-Decatur) said during a radio appearance on Friday that he didn&#8217;t even know they had the Confederate flag on them.</p>
<p>Daniels also wants a monument to the “Confederate Cause” that is placed near the steps of the Madison County Courthouse removed. This is happening, slowly, but the statue put up in 1905 will be moved from the courthouse to the Confederate section of Maple Hill Cemetery in Huntsville.</p>
<p>Those issues are almost no-brainers. They may take time, but they will probably happen as soon as the slow gears of government turn and make it so.</p>
<p>Of the more contentious discussions we will see in Alabama over this topic will be the attempted defunding of Confederate Memorial Park and the potential end of the Alabama Memorial Preservation Act.</p>
<p>Daniels has taken issue with the $600,000 budget allotment to this park, and Alabama Democratic Party spokesman Wade Perry accused State Rep. Will Dismukes (R-Prattville), who opposes this defunding idea, of disloyalty to the United States and called for him to resign.</p>
<p>My take: Perry is a clown. He is just using this to get attention, meanwhile the elected leaders are using his outlandish behavior to show that they are being more reasonable by contrast. They are right.</p>
<p>Daniels believes some local municipalities will want to keep their statues local, saying it is &#8220;so that they can have discussions about history locally.”</p>
<p>But last week, both Daniels and Dismukes appeared on WVNN&#8217;s “The Dale Jackson Show,” and a compromise may have emerged. Both agreed that Confederate Memorial Park could continue to exist, potentially as a stopping point for removed monuments, with Daniels noting, “I&#8217;m not against moving them to the Confederate park, but I think that if we&#8217;re going to have a park it should talk about all of Alabama history park, not just Confederate history. I think that Confederate history is certainly a part of Alabama history.”</p>
<p>Daniels called this a “good compromise.”</p>
<p>With both Dismukes and Daniels, two very different leaders from two very different parties, open to the idea of compromise, we may be nearing an amicable solution for the continued operation of Confederate Memorial Park in some form.</p>
<p>If Alabama&#8217;s leaders could settle this issue and help us all move on, we will all be far better off.</p>

                                            <p>The Black Daggers are the official U.S. Army Special Operations Command parachute demonstration team, comprised entirely of volunteers from throughout the Army special operations community. They have diverse backgrounds and possess various military specialties. The team represents the professionalism and dedication of Special Operations Forces and performs aerial demonstrations in support of U.S. Army Special Operations Command community outreach and recruiting efforts.</p>
<p>The Black Daggers use the military variant of the ram-air parachute, which allows a free-fall parachutist the ability to jump with more than 100 pounds of additional equipment attached. In addition to the extra weight, the jumper must also withstand high winds, frigid temperatures and low oxygen levels, all of which require the jumper to be highly skilled.</p>
<p>When exiting the aircraft, normally from an altitude of 12,500 feet, the jumpers free fall for about two miles at approximately 120 miles per hour. They maneuver their bodies using their hands, arms, legs and shoulders to control their flight. The parachutes used by the USASOC team are flexible wing gliders.</p>
<p>The Tuesday demonstration will take place between 3:30-4:30 p.m.</p>

<p>The future USS Oakland (LCS 24), now the <a href="https://yellowhammernews.com/austal-usa-delivers-first-littoral-combat-ship-in-2020/">second ship</a> delivered by Austal to the Navy in 2020, was delivered on Friday, June 26.</p>
<p>“We’re so excited to deliver Oakland to the fleet,” Austal USA president Craig Perciavalle said in a Monday statement.</p>
<p>“Every milestone we accomplish during these unprecedented times is a true testament to the extraordinary skill and dedication of our LCS team – an indication of the success of our efforts to minimize the impact of the pandemic,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;The efficiency at which we’re delivering these ships is nothing short of world class.”</p>

<p>Upgrades on the important LCS program continue to take shape both with inline production and post-delivery.</p>
<p>For example, the Austal USA and General Dynamics Mission Systems team recently integrated a new over-the-horizon missile system capability onto the USS Gabrielle Giffords (LCS 10) prior to her deployment as she meets Navy operational requirements and more LCS prepare for deployment.</p>
<p>“In the Pacific, USS Gabrielle Giffords is strengthening maritime security and regional stability with every port visit, exercise, and operation in which she participates,” Perciavalle advised. “The LCS program has become instrumental to the U.S. Navy fleet as ships deploy from San Diego. We’re looking forward to seeing the USS Oakland and her sister ships follow in the path of the Giffords and Montgomery.”</p>
<p>The program is integral to Coastal Alabama&#8217;s economy but also has a wide reaching impact. More than 700 suppliers in 40 states contribute to Austal&#8217;s Independence-variant LCS program.</p>

<p>Five littoral combat ships are currently under various stages of construction at Austal’s Mobile shipyard. The future USS Mobile (LCS 26) is furthest along, presently preparing for sea trials. Meanwhile, assembly is underway on the future USS Savannah (LCS 28) and USS Canberra (LCS 30), and modules for the future USS Santa Barbara (LCS 32) and USS Augusta (LCS 34) are under construction in the company&#8217;s module manufacturing facility. The future USS Kingsville (LCS 36) and USS Pierre (LCS 38) are also under contract.</p>
<p>Austal is also under contract to build 14 Expeditionary Fast Transport vessels (EPF) for the U.S. Navy. The company has delivered 11 already while an additional two are in various stages of construction.</p>

<p>The funding is part of the approximately $1.9 billion of federal CARES Act funding the State of Alabama received to respond to and mitigate the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Alabama Act 2020-199 <a href="https://yellowhammernews.com/alabama-legislature-approves-ivey-executive-amendment-on-cares-act-funds-2020-regular-session-ends/">designated</a> up to $250 million of that total to be used to support the delivery of health care and related services to citizens of Alabama.</p>
<p>In a statement, Ivey said, &#8220;The agreement between the state of Alabama, the Alabama Department of Public Health and UAB is exactly the type of public-private partnership that is needed to adequately respond to the COVID-19 crisis.&#8221;</p>

                                                                                <p>
                                            <p>&#8220;We will only be able to acquire critical, life-saving resources by working together,&#8221; she continued. &#8220;Living with the coronavirus is our &#8216;new normal,&#8217; and I appreciate the combined efforts to ensure that as we get back to our daily routines, we can do so safely as well as helping our valued researchers gain new information to combat this disease.&#8221;</p>
<h3>&#8216;Will go a long way&#8217;</h3>
<p>According to a release from UAB, more than $750,000 in CARES Act money will fund the Testing for Alabama initiative, enabling every Alabama student attending a public four-year or two-year college the opportunity to be tested prior to reentry to campus.</p>
<p>&#8220;The COVID-19 pandemic is going to continue at least into the fall and early winter, and the Alabama Department of Public Health wants to ensure we are doing everything we can to give our state the best opportunity to navigate the crisis as safely and effectively as possible,&#8221; commented Dr. Scott Harris, state health officer and co-chair of Testing for Alabama. &#8220;This free testing opportunity for all public college students will enable our state universities to have their finger on the pulse of what the prevalence of this infection is among their student body as they return and, over time, gives them the ability to monitor any change.&#8221;</p>
<p>UAB, in partnership with the University of Alabama System, will work with ADPH to lead a coalition of entities including the University of South Alabama, HudsonAlpha and Kailos Genetics to support this robust reentry testing initiative.</p>
<p>This will give all universities in the state a chance to set a baseline as students return, enabling institutions to better identify hotspots and potential COVID-19 problems on campuses via sentinel testing throughout the 2020-2021 school year. This testing of a percentage of a population can help identify trends and potential problem areas in virus spread and identify how much of the disease is circulating in the population.</p>
<p>Testing for Alabama will further allow for sentinel testing in certain underserved locations in the Yellowhammer State with identified health care disparities.</p>
<p>&#8220;Protocols for how testing will be administered are being developed,&#8221; explained Selwyn Vickers, M.D., dean of UAB&#8217;s School of Medicine and a member of Ivey&#8217;s coronavirus task force. &#8220;We anticipate the test will likely be either a swab in the nostril — though not the more invasive nasopharyngeal swab — or an oral saline gargle test that we currently have under development.&#8221;</p>
<p>Testing out-of-state students before they arrive on campuses is also a goal of the Testing for Alabama program.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our ability to test every student returning to campus will go a long way in helping us maintain a safe environment,&#8221; UAB President Ray L. Watts said in a statement. &#8220;We are excited that, through this partnership with Governor Ivey and the state of Alabama, we will have the ability to make testing available across our System and to public colleges and universities throughout the state. On behalf of UAB and the UA System, we thank Gov. Ivey for investing in this important program that will promote health across the state.&#8221;</p>
<p>The testing program, as well as Stay Safe Together, are merely the latest examples of innovation spearheaded by the UA System <a href="https://yellowhammernews.com/uab-commitment-to-state-vital-in-covid-19-response/">benefiting a wide swath</a> of the state &#8212; and the nation.</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://yellowhammernews.com/trump-admin-consults-ua-system-chancellor-fess-st-john-on-reopening-americas-schools/">Trump admin consults UA System Chancellor Fess St. John on reopening America&#8217;s schools</a></strong></p>
<p>Near the beginning of the pandemic, UA System Chancellor Finis &#8220;Fess&#8221; St. John <a href="https://yellowhammernews.com/univ-of-alabama-system-working-to-provide-americas-safest-campuses-following-covid-19-outbreak/">announced</a> the creation of a task force led by UAB Health System experts to develop plans for the System&#8217;s three campuses to be the safest universities in America when on-campus instruction resumes following the coronavirus outbreak. However, these <a href="https://uasystem.edu/assets/2020/06/UASystemFinalReentry2020June.pdf">plans</a> were also made available upon their release by the System to every other two- and four-year college and university in Alabama.</p>
<p>Reacting to Monday&#8217;s announcement unveiling Testing for Alabama, St. John said in a statement, &#8220;We are pleased to provide this new testing service to all public colleges and universities across our state. We appreciate the opportunity to work with Governor Ivey and her team to bring this project forward and help Alabama&#8217;s citizens during this unprecedented time. I want to thank President Watts, Dr. Selwyn Vickers and the scores of scientists, physicians and innovators who have made this testing process possible.&#8221;</p>
<h3>&#8216;Stay Safe Together&#8217;</h3>
<p>Stay Safe Together is another instance of the health care expertise housed at UAB having a positive impact far outside the UA System&#8217;s three campuses.</p>
<p>The platform will feature a COVID-19 notification app currently being developed by UAB. This aspect is anticipated to be ready in time for the fall semester and is backed by Google and Apple technology that can anonymously alert someone if they are at risk from being in proximity to someone who tested positive for the virus.</p>
<p>Additionally, Stay Safe Together includes a COVID-19 assessment tool that allows individuals to log and track their own coronavirus related health status and symptoms. This health check tool, similar to the <a href="http://www.helpbeatcovid19.org">platform</a> <a href="https://yellowhammernews.com/new-coronavirus-symptom-tracker-launches-to-improve-disease-tracking-in-rural-communities-across-deep-south/">launched by UAB in April,</a> is already in use by on-campus personnel at the Birmingham university.</p>
<p>Tailored versions of the tool can also voluntarily be used by other public institutions of higher education in the state thanks to Monday&#8217;s announcement.</p>
<p>Both Testing for Alabama and Stay Safe Together could eventually be applied in public K-12 schools, as well as in private workplaces across the state. Additional funding would be necessary to expand beyond higher education applications.</p>

<p>Groups backing the protect include AlabamaWorks, the Alabama Workforce Council and the University of Alabama’s Education Policy Center.</p>
<p>As Yellowhammer News first wrote, backers of the effort say the ultimate goal is &#8220;to create a system where individuals get jobs based on having certain skills instead of the often required college degree.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To drain the swamp, he had to break a little China. To keep America great, he needs a senator he can trust. Strong conservative, tough as nails &#8212; tough like Tuberville,&#8221; the narrator states. &#8220;Take it from President Trump, Tommy is a real leader, won&#8217;t back down, has Trump&#8217;s back. Enough with swampy politicians. Alabama wants winners, not recusers. Winning &#8212; that&#8217;s what Tommy Tuberville does. It&#8217;s game time, Alabama. Send Trump a senator.&#8221;</p>

Mission creep at the CDC has left America vulnerable to a communicable disease. We need a new agency solely dedicated to battling infectious diseases.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the mistakes. A lack of early testing let the outbreak spiral out of control. Some have criticized the CDC for not using a German test approved by the World Health Organization (WHO). I will give the CDC a pass here because the CDC is required to develop a test for the U.S. during pandemics. Contamination of the test kits, however, falls squarely on the CDC, a mistake resulting from a breach of basic protocols.</p>
<p>Another miscalculation was preparing only 200 test kits. Although each kit could test 700 specimens, this was still extremely limited capacity to contain an easily transmissible virus.</p>

                                    <div class="text-large full_body">
                                                                                <p>
                                            <p>The CDC equivocated and eventually flipped its position on masks. Throughout March, the agency claimed that only the sick or persons caring for the sick should wear masks. Dr. Anthony Fauci recently confirmed that this deliberate misinformation was intended to reserve masks for health care workers but was still misinformation.</p>
<p>Recently, The Atlantic reported that the CDC has been combining blood and nasal test results. Blood serum antibody tests only show that a person has had COVID-19 at some point. As a result, the case reports being watched so carefully as states reopen may include older cases.</p>
<p>Some commentators blame the CDC’s failures on Trump administration budget cuts. Yet as the Cato Institute’s Chris Edwards demonstrated, proposed cuts were never enacted; the CDC budget has remained steady (adjusting for inflation) since 2010 with a 12% increase in employees.</p>
<p>The CDC has spent money and time on efforts unrelated to infectious diseases. This is the essence of “mission creep,” or an expansion of tasks beyond an agency’s core competency. Bureaucrats seek out new tasks for additional funding, and sometimes Congress orders an agency to study something. As Cato’s Mr. Edwards writes, “How is CDC Director [Dr. Robert] Redfield supposed to remain alert to emerging epidemics when he is also supposed to manage programs on tiny teeth, colon cancer, opioids, child abuse, diabetes, workers’ compensation, lead-based paints, mold in buildings, and lifting heavy objects on construction sites?”</p>
<p>States imposed draconian “nonpharmaceutical interventions” (NPI) to slow COVID-19. Evidence demonstrating these policies’ effectiveness was very limited. A 2019 WHO review observed, “The evidence base on the effectiveness of NPIs in community settings is limited, and the overall quality of evidence was very low for most interventions.” Furthermore, “much of the evidence base is from observational studies and computer simulations.”</p>
<p>The role of computer models deserves further discussion. Computer models produced the “worst-case” scenarios predicting 1.7 million to 2.2 million deaths in an unconstrained pandemic and claiming that measures like closing schools and shutting down business could avoid most of these deaths. The projections were based on assumptions, not evidence, that NPIs would reduce interactions between people.</p>
<p>Lockdown policies might not reduce interactions due to offsetting personal actions. For example, children not interacting at school may interact instead at parks, day care centers, or malls. Grandparents’ taking on babysitting duties could potentially increase transmissions to the elderly. Evidence from actual school closings would be required to validate assumed reductions in interactions.</p>
<p>Instead of researching vaping and gun violence, the CDC could have extensively examined NPIs. We did not need to take a shot in the dark with polices that cost 40 million American jobs.</p>
<p>Limited government not only keeps government within its proper scope, it avoids mission creep and ensures that critical tasks get done well. Governments generally underprepare for rare events like disasters and pandemics. This makes an agency focusing exclusively on communicable diseases invaluable.</p>
<p>After the COVID-19 pandemic is behind us, we should seriously consider replacing the CDC with an agency focused exclusively on infectious diseases. Other CDC functions (like collecting vital statistics) can be moved elsewhere within the Department of Health and Human Services. We need an approach to ensure preparedness for the next pandemic.</p>

<p>— How have former President Barack Obama and former Vice President Joe Biden completely escaped scrutiny over their role in prosecuting General Michael Flynn?</p>
<p>Jackson and Handback are joined by Talk 99.5&#8217;s Matt Murphy to discuss COVID-19&#8217;s surging numbers, mandatory mask ordinances and the Republican primary U.S. Senate runoff.</p>

Phrases like “self-quarantine” and “social distancing,” which were rarely used or completely unheard of several months ago, are now a part of our daily vocabulary. As we adjust to this “new normal,” America’s sportsmen and women, a group that I am proud to represent as a member of the Alabama Legislative Sportsmen’s Caucus, have found a way to pursue their outdoor passions while much of the world seemingly stood still. By participating in outdoor activities like hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting, sportsmen and women are setting an example for those looking for safe and responsible recreational opportunities.</p>
<p>While millions of Americans have been forced to limit their travels due to mandatory stay-at-home orders, activities like hunting, fishing, recreational shooting and many other outdoor activities have provided an outlet for Americans to safely recreate as they can be enjoyed while practicing social distancing and adhering to other COVID-19 safety guidelines. As restrictions start to ease, Americans are flocking to the woods, waters, fields and trails to take advantage of our outdoor resources, with many discovering nature’s wonders for the first time.</p>

                                            <p>This newfound interest in outdoor recreation represents an invaluable opportunity to introduce American’s to activities like hunting and fishing and the vital role sportsmen and women play in conservation. In addition to the numerous documented mental and physical health benefits gained through these activities, maintaining access to hunting and fishing opportunities gives Americans a chance to procure their own locally-sourced meat. Due to many of the impacts of COVID-19, this ability to be self-reliant is at a premium. With all of this in mind, these unprecedented times represent a chance for a new generation of sportsmen and women to discover the passion that many of us already share. Be it through scouting for upcoming fall hunting seasons, or landing that first largemouth bass, now is the time to lead by example and plant the seeds for the next generation of sportsmen and women.</p>
<p>Increased participation in hunting, fishing and recreational shooting has enormous conservation benefits as well through the American System of Conservation Funding. This “user pays-public benefits” approach relies on the sale of hunting and fishing licenses and self-imposed excise taxes on firearms, ammunition, archery equipment, fishing tackle, and motorboat fuel to fund many state fish and wildlife management agencies. In addition, these activities support local economies which, during these unprecedented times, has become incredibly important. In fact, recent surveys report that Alabama’s 948,000 hunters and anglers spent $1.9 billion while pursuing their outdoor passions.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the ability of America’s sportsmen and women to participate in their outdoor endeavors were not uniformly protected as statewide orders were announced. In fact, several states saw actions that hindered or even eliminated the ability to participate in our treasured outdoor traditions. While largely enacted in an effort to prevent the spread of COVID-19, these actions severely limited our outdoor opportunities without any measurable increase in public safety. To ensure that such restrictive actions are not used again, it is up to sportsmen and women to practice responsible recreation, showing by example that our outdoor pursuits can be performed safely. This can be accomplished by following a few simple guidelines.</p>
<ul>
<li>Plan ahead; purchase licenses and park passes online, if available.</li>
<li>Recreate close to home</li>
<li>Adhere to best practices for avoiding COVID-19</li>
<li>Follow state and federal guidelines</li>
<li>Pack out your trash as a courtesy to others and to avoid the appearance of overuse</li>
<li>Share your adventures in a respectful way on social media outlets</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/430849784">Bonnie George is an Alabama Power unsung hero with a heart of gold</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/alabamanewscenter">Alabama NewsCenter</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
<p>Pell City CSR Naji Ridley said, “Bonnie is a loving person. She is caring. The way she walks, the way she talks, the way she carries herself and addresses others just shows love.”</p>
<h2>Helping others</h2>
<p>Since October 2018, George, her husband, Gary, and their six children have delivered 100 meals to the homeless in Linn Park in downtown Birmingham every month.</p>
<p>“We sit and talk and pray with them,” she said. “We let our children talk with them. Our kids bring toys and books and play with them, and it gives them a time of normalcy that is lacking in so many of their days.”</p>
<p>George’s foreign missions journey started eight years ago when she began leading high school students in her church. Partnering with organizations such as King’s Castle, George and her husband organized foreign mission trips for their church youth group.</p>
<p>George said, “We started conversations with our pastors about how we are leading our students into foreign missions, with some of them never knowing what it meant to serve our neighbor.”</p>
<p>On their first mission trip, George and her husband took a group of 20 students to Nicaragua.</p>
<p>“I really didn’t know what to expect,” she said. “It was my first time going into a country doing missions and I didn’t know the language, but as soon as we got there, my husband said, ‘I feel like we’ve come home.’”</p>
<p>In 2018, George’s church partnered with Mission of Hope to bring a group of students to Haiti.</p>
<p>“We went and played games, we did a lot of sports, for half a day,” she said. “Then they had a message. … At the end of the program, it was lunchtime, so we got to feed them, and that was incredible.”</p>
<p>The night before they were scheduled to leave Haiti, rioting broke out in Port-au-Prince, 30 minutes from where they were staying. George said, “We were safe, but we couldn’t get to the airport. We ended up having to stay three extra days.</p>
<p>“There are so few opportunities in our life for us to step out in our faith in a way that others truly see. … When we have the chance to put our faith into action, that’s when we’re truly living it,” she said.</p>

<p>Then he got introduced to noodling.</p>
<p>“I tried it, and I will tell you I was a little apprehensive the first time, but once you figure out what you’re doing and how you’re doing it and you take all of the necessary precautions, it’s a blast,” Gibson said. “It’s a lot of fun.”</p>

                                            <p>Noodling, for those who don’t know, is a style of fishing where you induce a catfish to bite your arm and hand, thus enabling you to seize the fish and pull it up out of the water for a catch.</p>
<p>Gibson retired from <a href="https://www.alabamapower.com/">Alabama Power</a> earlier this year after more than 38 years with the company. Now that hunting season is over, you’re likely to find him on an Alabama lake or river fishing. He just probably won’t have a rod and reel with him.</p>

<p>The work is part of a 5-year project funded by the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.restorethegulf.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council</a>.

The lab is also undertaking a comprehensive SAV mapping and monitoring program for coastal Alabama.</p>
<p>“We care about submerged aquatic vegetation because this is the nursery habitat for our juvenile fish, crabs and shrimp,” said Dottie Byron, manager in Ken Heck’s Lab at DISL. “It’s really good hiding places when you’re little to hide and eat and grow up and then move to your adult habitat. That’s why we want to restore this. The more grass we have out there the better fishing we’re going to have, better crabbing we’re going to have.”</p>

<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/431954022">Dauphin Island Sea Lab working to restore Alabama coastal seagrass</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/alabamanewscenter">Alabama NewsCenter</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
<p>The team will work to bring back to life an area in the Mobile Delta once known to flourish with Vallisneria americana, commonly known as tape grass. The grasses are being planted in areas struggling to naturally heal from damage caused by hurricanes, drought or boat propellers.</p>
<p>“They need that kick-start,” Byron said. “That’s what we want to do. We want to kick-start some of these areas that we know use to have grass, that we know are better now and we want to get them growing and help go back to what they used to be.”</p>
<p>Byron said many of the grasses to be planted are being grown in labs at DISL from seeds harvested in healthy coastal areas.</p>
<p>“We bring them back to the lab, take the seeds out, put those into a growth chamber in the winter and let them get enough light so they will sprout and germinate,” Byron said. “Eventually we will bring them out to a larger container out here. This will be ready for restoration planting when we find the right sites.”</p>
<p>In areas of lower Perdido Bay where grasses are often scarred by boat propellers, Byron said bird stakes are being installed and educational signage hung to inform boaters. She said droppings from birds contain nutrients that help grasses recover quicker.</p>
<p>“Their guano is rich in nutrients,” Byron said. “It’s a low-key way to add nutrients or fertilizer to a localized area to help the grass fill in these scars.”</p>
<p>The boater guides are being distributed thanks to a joint effort with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.joinacf.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alabama Coastal Foundation</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.aces.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alabama Cooperative Extension System</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.orangebeachal.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer">City of Orange Beach</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gulfshores.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gulf Shores Orange Beach Tourism</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.islandsofperdido.org/save-our-seagrass" rel="noopener noreferrer">Islands of Perdido Foundation</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mobilebaynep.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mobile Bay National Estuary Program</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nfwf.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">National Fish and Wildlife Foundation</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.noaa.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.outdooralabama.com/about-us/state-lands-division" rel="noopener noreferrer">State of Alabama State Lands Division</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.org/en-us/" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Nature Conservancy</a>.</p>

On Thursday, June 25, the United States set a new single-day record for new coronavirus cases, with state health departments reporting 39,327 cases. Over the past week, Alabama has seen the most troubling numbers to date. The Alabama Department of Health (ADPH) reported 1,129 new cases that same day, setting a record for the highest number of new cases reported in a single day since the pandemic began.</p>
<p>Infections and hospitalizations are rising across the state and continue to remain a threat to the health of all Alabamians. State public health officials have recently spoken out regarding the importance of wearing facial coverings or masks. State Health Officer Dr. Scott Harris said, “We simply aren’t headed the right way in Alabama … the bottom line is masks do prevent infections and masks do save lives.” Dr. Scott Harris along with ADPH highly encourage all individuals to wear some type of facial covering when necessary.</p>

                                            <p>Dr. Don Williamson, president of the Alabama Hospital Association, pleaded for Alabamians to wear masks and demonstrate proper social distancing practices if they must be out in public. “What I would plead for is a change in people’s behavior with a realization that just because you can do something doesn’t mean you should do something,” Williamson said.</p>
<p>The current Safer at Home public health order is set to expire on July 3. As Alabama has already eased restrictions allowing the reopening of several businesses and venues, each Alabamian should practice personal responsibility in order to slow the spread of coronavirus across the state. It is up to each of us to protect those in our communities. I urge Alabamians to abide by official guidelines and direction, including those suggested by ADPH and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Let’s put forth our best effort to protect this beloved state and all of us who call it home.</p>

<p>Following an intense competition among middle and high school students from across the nation, Alabama participants had a strong showing in the virtual awards ceremony that was held Saturday.</p>
<p>Eli Stapler of Hampton Cove Middle School near Huntsville won the History in the Federal Government Special Prize for his exhibit project, “CCC: Roosevelt’s Tree Army.” The prize is awarded to the best entry in any category, in either division, which illuminates the history of the American federal government.</p>

                                            <p>Savi Fistein and Aiden Seabrook of Phillips Preparatory Middle School in Mobile won the distinction of Outstanding Alabama Junior Entry. Savi and Aiden’s group performance, “Raven Wilkinson: The Black Ballerina Who Broke Ballet Barriers by Braving the Jim Crow South during the Civil Rights Movement and Inspiring Others,” was the highest ranked Alabama junior project at the national contest.</p>
<p>Joy Kim of Huntsville High School earned the distinction of Outstanding Alabama Senior Entry for the contest. Her paper, “Foot Soldiers for Freedom: The Little Rock Nine and the Youth of the Civil Rights Movement,” was the highest ranked Alabama senior project at the national contest.</p>
<p>Alabama students weren’t the only standouts during the contest. Sarah Woltring of Murphy High School in Mobile was a finalist for the Hannah E. (Liz) MacGregor Teacher of the Year award.</p>
<p>“This teacher and these students exemplify the magic of National History Day,” said Alabama History Day Coordinator Jerald Crook. “They truly embodied this past year’s NHD theme, which was Breaking Barriers in History.” This year’s contest was historic, going virtual on the state and national levels.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t easy working through the challenges of this year’s NHD contest season because of the coronavirus pandemic,” Crook noted. “They had to navigate technological obstacles to participate in new virtual contests, and they missed the opportunity to travel to Montgomery and Washington, D.C. for the state and national competitions, but they endured, put in hard work, and it all paid off in the end. I am so proud of our Alabama NHD winners and all who represented the state on the national level.”</p>
<p>National History Day promotes the teaching and learning of history through a variety of programs for teachers and students in middle and high schools. Its largest program is the National History Day Contest, which was created in 1974 to encourage middle and high school students from around the world to conduct original research on historical topics of interest. They then present projects at the local and affiliate levels.</p>
<p>“With the NHD2020 contest coming to a close, Alabama students and teachers are already preparing for next year’s contest, which will explore the national theme of Communication in History: The Key to Understanding<em>,” </em>Crook said<em>.</em></p>
<p>Alabama teachers who are interested in getting their students involved in the National History Day program are invited to attend one of the upcoming AHD training webinars on July 8 or July 15.

<p>Neri cited the research collaboration between HPE and Dr. Jerome Baudry’s team in UAH’s <a target="_blank" href="https://baudry-lab.uah.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Baudry Lab</a>.</p>
<p>The UAH team used donated time on the HPE Sentinel supercomputer to assess the potential treatment efficacy of naturally occurring compounds against the proteins made by COVID-19 in the first such research using a supercomputer to speed results. Dr. Baudry (pronounced Bō-dre) is a molecular biophysicist and the Mrs. Pei-Ling Chan Chair in the <a href="https://www.uah.edu/science/departments/biology">Department of Biological Sciences</a>.</p>

                                            <p>In his keynote, Neri told over 100,000 registrants from the computing, scientific and business worlds that the HPE collaboration with Dr. Baudry “allowed his research team to deliver results in weeks versus months or years.”</p>
<p>Concurrent with Neri’s keynote, a seven minute and 17 second video interview with Dr. Baudry that was conducted on the UAH campus on May 23 was presented on demand to participants.</p>
<p>In the first test batch 50,000 naturally occurring compounds were tested for efficacy against the proteins made by COVID-19. The Baudry Lab still has over 350,000 naturally occurring compounds to test in future batches.</p>
<p>Promising compounds will undergo a computational technique called pharmacophore analysis to find what the chemicals have in common and flag chemical features important for future research.</p>
<p>After that, the next phase for the compounds is in vitro testing by a partner laboratory that will use live virus and live cells. Those chemical molecules found most efficacious will form the basis for future drug research and development processes that include testing for efficacy, tolerance and adverse effects in human trials. That process might also include chemical modifications to make the drug more efficient, better tolerated or both.</p>
<p>Located in UAH’s Shelby Center for Science and Technology, the lab is searching for potential precursors to drugs that will help combat the global pandemic.</p>

<p>&#8220;Absolutely,&#8221; he replied when asked if Democrats sought to force law enforcement into 2020 election politics. &#8220;The Democrats are anti-police. Keep in mind the constituency of the Democratic Party &#8212; people who engage in crime, they&#8217;re not supporting Republicans. They are a significant constituency in the Democratic Party, and to a very large degree, that explains the hesitancy of so many Democratic governors and so many mayors who refuse to enforce the law. They&#8217;re afraid that they&#8217;ll lose a block vote in a Democratic primary when they come up for reelection, hence the problem that we have.&#8221;</p>

Low and slow, of course. But steady, too. Even during a pandemic, it seems, people still want their ‘que.</p>
<p>In the 23 years since the Maluff brothers — David and Joe — purchased Full Moon Bar-B-Que from Pat James, they have grown the business from a single store on Birmingham’s Southside to 15 locations across the state. The Birmingham metro area has eight locations, including one in the <a href="https://www.uab.edu/students/studentcenter/">Hill Student Center at UAB</a> (it is scheduled to reopen in the fall). The brothers are even moving ahead with plans for a new store in Huntsville by the end of 2020.</p>

                                                                                <p>
                                            <p>James, a former football coach who spent a dozen years as Paul “Bear” Bryant’s assistant, started the business in 1986 with his wife, Eloise. They called it Pat James’ Full Moon Bar-B-Que. David and Joe, sons of Lebanese immigrants, purchased the original Birmingham location in 1997. The brothers have stayed true to the initial vision with colorful, sports-centric décor celebrating favorite regional teams; made-from-scratch dishes; and hands-on involvement in the business. Perhaps most importantly, they have always used hickory wood-fired pits to cook the meats. They have five big, portable pits, allowing them to cook Full Moon barbecue anywhere — feeding groups of 10 to (once restrictions are lifted) 10,000.</p>
<p>These wood-fired pits make a world of difference, David says. “We have a passion to do barbecue right. That’s why all of our stores still have wood-burning pits in them. And we do it the old-fashioned way — fresh, from scratch, every day. We cook our meat low and slow right in front of our customers, and they see it, smell it, taste it. And that’s what’s kept us thriving through the years.”</p>
<p>During its flavorful 35-year history, Full Moon Bar-B-Que has gathered fans from across the country. It’s cheekily called the “Best Little Pork House in Alabama,” but Full Moon offers a comfortable, family-friendly atmosphere that has served generations and appeals to all nationalities, David says. “We’re real big on making the customer feel good. That’s our job. When you come into our house, we make you feel warm and welcome. We’re here to make you happy.”</p>
<p>Full Moon was named one of the top 10 barbecue restaurants in the U.S. by Huffington Post. The restaurant’s red and white sauces are on grocery store shelves along with the signature chow-chow, which is served on every sandwich.</p>
<p>Full Moon boasts two items on Alabama’s list of <a href="https://alabama.travel/experience-alabama/food-and-drink/100-dishes">100 Dishes to Eat Before You Die</a>: the crisp vinaigrette slaw and the baked-fresh-daily <a href="https://alabamanewscenter.com/2018/12/21/full-moons-half-moon-cookies-land-list-100-dishes-eat-alabama-die/">Half Moon chocolate chip and pecan cookies</a> (half dipped into glossy, dark chocolate). Both these items are made according to Eloise James’ original recipes.</p>
<p>When dining rooms across Alabama were closed because of the coronavirus, the brothers simply continued with drive-thru service, takeout and curbside pickup. The dining rooms — except at the Southside and UAB locations — are now back open at 50% capacity. They also have a food truck, and they continue to deliver with dozens of vans brightly painted with big smiling moons.</p>
<p>There really wasn’t much of a pivot, David says, besides shutting down the dining rooms. “We were already set up for drive-thru, catering (and) curbside. That’s our model. We got stronger in that sense, but we’ve been doing it forever. You know, we’re one of the few restaurants that can have a full menu like we have on the drive-thru menu. So it’s automatic for us to thrive in a situation like this, because we do it every day.” Besides, he adds, barbecue travels well.</p>
<p>What <em>has</em> changed, though, are the expanded health and safety precautions at each restaurant, Joe says. Things like maintaining social distancing between tables, hanging plexiglass between the booths, regular temperature checks for employees, masks and gloves for everyone who works there, extra attention given to sanitizing surfaces and washing things in the kitchen.</p>
<p>“We have to take these measures every day to keep our employees safe, to keep our guests safe,” Joe says. “That’s the most important thing at this point.”</p>
<p>The employees — some of whom have been with Full Moon for decades — have risen to the challenge, he adds. “They are all on board. They’ve been troupers through it all.”</p>
<p>“I’m proud of our people,” David says. “Being in the restaurant business is tough enough. Then adding all these measures on top of their jobs. You have to remember, these guys are wearing a mask in the kitchen! It’s hard for them. It’s hard for us to manage because we’ve never been through anything like this before, right? That’s our duty … we’ve got to keep everyone safe. We’re going to do whatever it takes to keep our business thriving and our employees safe. Whatever it takes.</p>
<p>“Our employees are doing a great job, and our franchisees are doing a great job,” he adds. “They are part of us. So, when they do the things we’re doing, you just have to be proud of everyone right now.”</p>
<p>Full Moon has long been known for scratch-made Southern sides like collard greens, baked beans, fried green tomatoes, potato salad, fried okra and mac &amp; cheese.  But over the years, the brothers have expanded the offerings to suit a variety of tastes and lifestyles, adding freshly made salads topped with a meat of your choice, hand-breaded chicken tenders and gigantic baked potatoes overstuffed with meat and fixings. They put wings (Buffalo and smoked) on the menu several years ago, and the fried catfish (farm-raised in Mississippi) is extremely popular.</p>
<p>But it’s the savory, smoky barbecue that is most famous here, especially the pork. Whether you get it chopped or request it sliced, you’ll want to order it like the regulars do — with “a little of the outside meat” mixed in. There are classic spareribs as well as baby back ribs. The brisket is from Black Angus cattle. Smoked chicken, turkey and spicy pork links are other options.</p>
<p>All this food is made using decades-old recipes and time-honored techniques; it’s comforting and familiar. And it makes people happy.</p>
<p>Back in March, the brothers started a “Feed a Friend” campaign, and they’ve extended it through June. For years, David and Joe have quietly worked behind the scenes with churches, schools and nonprofits, but they had to enlist the help of people on the restaurants’ email lists to find families in need.</p>
<p>When the pandemic hit, David says, “we saw a lot of people unemployed, not working, hungry. It broke my heart; it broke my brother’s heart.”</p>
<p>Each week, they get 300 to 400 responses to their Feed a Friend query. They go through these messages every day, identifying families in need and then sending food to their homes.  “I’ll tell you,” David says, “the reactions we get … will bring tears to your eyes. When they hear they are getting fed today … they are overwhelmed with joy. … It’s anonymous, who suggested that they need food. We bring it to their front door. We don’t say a word to them except, ‘Enjoy.’</p>
<p>“We’ve gotten a huge response,” David says. “A lot of this we don’t advertise, and we don’t want to advertise. This is from our hearts to the community. And I don’t care who it is, whether they’ve been a customer of ours or not. That doesn’t matter. We need to feed the kids and the families in our community and support them when we can.”</p>
<p>The brothers do this every day, and sometimes they’re feeding two or three families a day. But that’s not all.</p>
<p>“It’s a wonderful feeling in your heart, doing something for others,” Joe says. “Feeding the first responders, feeding the nurses for nurses’ week, feeding the firemen. We’re not doing it just in Birmingham, we’re doing it in Tuscaloosa, we’re doing it in Auburn, we’re doing it in Montgomery. We’re just … trying to help our community out when they need it.”</p>

Much of the science used in this particular vaccine development is adapted from the company’s cutting-edge research into precision virus-based cancer therapies.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p id="count_words"><ins>445</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="button-wrapper"><ins><a href="" class="view-more1"><span class="keep-reading">Keep reading</span> <span class="count">445 WORDS</span> </a> </ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="button-wrapper"><ins><a href="https://yellowhammernews.com/auburn-college-of-veterinary-medicine-partners-with-humane-genomics-inc-on-covid-19-vaccine-development/" class="view-more"><span class="keep-reading">Keep reading</span> <span class="count">445 WORDS</span>  Link: https://yellowhammernews.com/auburn-college-of-veterinary-medicine-partners-with-humane-genomics-inc-on-covid-19-vaccine-development/ </a> </ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>“We had previously worked with Humane Genomics in the area of cancer treatment,” said Smith, “specifically an attempt to custom synthesize viruses to target tumors. The same basic concept can also be used to develop a vaccine. All that is necessary is to have the virus’ genome—a genetic map of its DNA—in order to create a vaccine to target it.”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The COVID-19 genome is available, so the custom development of a vaccine tailored to its specific vulnerabilities, a so-called “synthetic vectored vaccine,” was a relatively rapid process. In this case, that process involved genetically synthesizing via computer modeling a harmless virus called vesicular stomatitis virus, or VSV, and giving it the same “spike” protein characteristic of COVID-19. This spike protein binds with so-called ACE2 receptors on human lung cells to allow the harmful virus to infect them. But if the vaccine functions as hoped, the immune system would be triggered to produce antibodies to recognize this spike protein and block infection, but in a harmless virus. That same triggered immune reaction—in theory—would then protect against COVID-19.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>“The idea of developing vectored vaccines by ‘cutting and pasting’ virus DNA to alter its characteristics is a proven method of vaccine development and has been in use for more than a decade,” Smith said. “In the case of animals, vectored vaccines have been successfully developed for rabies and fowl pox. In human medicine, a vaccine approved in 2019 for the deadly Ebola virus was developed using the same technique.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>“What makes the Humane Genomics approach unusual,” added Smith, “is that they are skipping the traditional cutting and pasting process of removing and substituting DNA and instead synthesizing their targeted viruses using computer modeling. It allows for a much quicker process. If they have the target’s genome, they can develop a vaccine in about a week.”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>It is the testing phase that takes time, and currently the company’s COVID-19 vaccine is in the safety testing phase, which is where Auburn’s contribution comes in. The Auburn College of Veterinary Medicine is testing the vaccine on rats to see if they develop the proper antibodies or become ill due to unforeseen side effects. Later, another vaccine partner will perform similar tests with guinea pigs, and if all goes well, the vaccine can then move on to human testing.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Smith says that, while he is cautiously optimistic a working vaccine will eventually be developed, there is still a long road ahead despite the urgent need.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>“With a tremendous amount of luck, we could have a vaccine by the end of the year,” he said, “but more likely, we won’t know for sure if a vaccine is going to be successful until some time in 2021.”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>(Courtesy of Auburn University)</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="button-wrapper"><ins><a href="" class="view-less1"><span class="keep-reading">Show less</span> </a> </ins></p><ins> </ins><ul><li><ins><a href="https://yellowhammernews.com/category/news/" class="category">News                                                     Link: https://yellowhammernews.com/category/news/ </a></ins></li><ins> </ins></ul><ins> </ins><p class="content-post clearfix"><ins></ins></p><p class="author-options"><ins><a href="https://yellowhammernews.com/author/newscenter/" title="Posts by Alabama NewsCenter" class="author url fn" rel="author">Alabama NewsCenter Link: https://yellowhammernews.com/author/newscenter/ </a> <span>11 hours ago</span> </ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="post-title"><ins></ins></p><h2><ins>Mobile Area Chamber of Commerce will hold virtual Military Appreciation Day event July 2</ins></h2><ins> </ins><ins><span class="caption">The Military Appreciation Day luncheon will be held virtually July 2.

This is such a non-issue, that should be resolved quickly, that State Senator Artur Orr (R-Decatur) said during a radio appearance on Friday that he didn’t even know they had the Confederate flag on them.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Daniels also wants a monument to the “Confederate Cause” that is placed near the steps of the Madison County Courthouse removed. This is happening, slowly, but the statue put up in 1905 will be moved from the courthouse to the Confederate section of Maple Hill Cemetery in Huntsville.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Those issues are almost no-brainers. They may take time, but they will probably happen as soon as the slow gears of government turn and make it so.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Of the more contentious discussions we will see in Alabama over this topic will be the attempted defunding of Confederate Memorial Park and the potential end of the Alabama Memorial Preservation Act.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Daniels has taken issue with the $600,000 budget allotment to this park, and Alabama Democratic Party spokesman Wade Perry accused State Rep. Will Dismukes (R-Prattville), who opposes this defunding idea, of disloyalty to the United States and called for him to resign.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>My take: Perry is a clown.

They are right.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Daniels believes some local municipalities will want to keep their statues local, saying it is “so that they can have discussions about history locally.”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>But last week, both Daniels and Dismukes appeared on WVNN’s “The Dale Jackson Show,” and a compromise may have emerged. Both agreed that Confederate Memorial Park could continue to exist, potentially as a stopping point for removed monuments, with Daniels noting, “I’m not against moving them to the Confederate park, but I think that if we’re going to have a park it should talk about all of Alabama history park, not just Confederate history. I think that Confederate history is certainly a part of Alabama history.”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Daniels called this a “good compromise.”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>With both Dismukes and Daniels, two very different leaders from two very different parties, open to the idea of compromise, we may be nearing an amicable solution for the continued operation of Confederate Memorial Park in some form.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>If Alabama’s leaders could settle this issue and help us all move on, we will all be far better off.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Listen:

Mission creep at the CDC has left America vulnerable to a communicable disease. We need a new agency solely dedicated to battling infectious diseases.</ins></p><p><ins>Let’s start with the mistakes. A lack of early testing let the outbreak spiral out of control. Some have criticized the CDC for not using a German test approved by the World Health Organization (WHO). I will give the CDC a pass here because the CDC is required to develop a test for the U.S. during pandemics. Contamination of the test kits, however, falls squarely on the CDC, a mistake resulting from a breach of basic protocols.</ins></p><p><ins>Another miscalculation was preparing only 200 test kits. Although each kit could test 700 specimens, this was still extremely limited capacity to contain an easily transmissible virus.</ins></p><p id="count_words"><ins>570</ins></p><p class="button-wrapper"><ins><a href="" class="view-more1"><span class="keep-reading">Keep reading</span> <span class="count">570 WORDS</span> </a> </ins></p><p class="button-wrapper"><ins><a href="https://yellowhammernews.com/defund-the-cdc/" class="view-more"><span class="keep-reading">Keep reading</span> <span class="count">570 WORDS</span>  Link: https://yellowhammernews.com/defund-the-cdc/ </a> </ins></p><p><ins>The CDC equivocated and eventually flipped its position on masks. Throughout March, the agency claimed that only the sick or persons caring for the sick should wear masks. Dr. Anthony Fauci recently confirmed that this deliberate misinformation was intended to reserve masks for health care workers but was still misinformation.</ins></p><p><ins>Recently, The Atlantic reported that the CDC has been combining blood and nasal test results. Blood serum antibody tests only show that a person has had COVID-19 at some point. As a result, the case reports being watched so carefully as states reopen may include older cases.</ins></p><p><ins>Some commentators blame the CDC’s failures on Trump administration budget cuts. Yet as the Cato Institute’s Chris Edwards demonstrated, proposed cuts were never enacted; the CDC budget has remained steady (adjusting for inflation) since 2010 with a 12% increase in employees.</ins></p><p><ins>The CDC has spent money and time on efforts unrelated to infectious diseases. This is the essence of “mission creep,” or an expansion of tasks beyond an agency’s core competency. Bureaucrats seek out new tasks for additional funding, and sometimes Congress orders an agency to study something. As Cato’s Mr. Edwards writes, “How is CDC Director [Dr. Robert] Redfield supposed to remain alert to emerging epidemics when he is also supposed to manage programs on tiny teeth, colon cancer, opioids, child abuse, diabetes, workers’ compensation, lead-based paints, mold in buildings, and lifting heavy objects on construction sites?”</ins></p><p><ins>States imposed draconian “nonpharmaceutical interventions” (NPI) to slow COVID-19. Evidence demonstrating these policies’ effectiveness was very limited. A 2019 WHO review observed, “The evidence base on the effectiveness of NPIs in community settings is limited, and the overall quality of evidence was very low for most interventions.” Furthermore, “much of the evidence base is from observational studies and computer simulations.”</ins></p><p><ins>The role of computer models deserves further discussion. Computer models produced the “worst-case” scenarios predicting 1.7 million to 2.2 million deaths in an unconstrained pandemic and claiming that measures like closing schools and shutting down business could avoid most of these deaths. The projections were based on assumptions, not evidence, that NPIs would reduce interactions between people.</ins></p><p><ins>Lockdown policies might not reduce interactions due to offsetting personal actions. For example, children not interacting at school may interact instead at parks, day care centers, or malls. Grandparents’ taking on babysitting duties could potentially increase transmissions to the elderly. Evidence from actual school closings would be required to validate assumed reductions in interactions.</ins></p><p><ins>Instead of researching vaping and gun violence, the CDC could have extensively examined NPIs. We did not need to take a shot in the dark with polices that cost 40 million American jobs.</ins></p><p><ins>Limited government not only keeps government within its proper scope, it avoids mission creep and ensures that critical tasks get done well. Governments generally underprepare for rare events like disasters and pandemics. This makes an agency focusing exclusively on communicable diseases invaluable.</ins></p><p><ins>After the COVID-19 pandemic is behind us, we should seriously consider replacing the CDC with an agency focused exclusively on infectious diseases. Other CDC functions (like collecting vital statistics) can be moved elsewhere within the Department of Health and Human Services. We need an approach to ensure preparedness for the next pandemic.</ins></p><p><ins>Daniel Sutter is the Charles G. Koch Professor of Economics with the Manuel H.

Phrases like “self-quarantine” and “social distancing,” which were rarely used or completely unheard of several months ago, are now a part of our daily vocabulary. As we adjust to this “new normal,” America’s sportsmen and women, a group that I am proud to represent as a member of the Alabama Legislative Sportsmen’s Caucus, have found a way to pursue their outdoor passions while much of the world seemingly stood still. By participating in outdoor activities like hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting, sportsmen and women are setting an example for those looking for safe and responsible recreational opportunities.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>While millions of Americans have been forced to limit their travels due to mandatory stay-at-home orders, activities like hunting, fishing, recreational shooting and many other outdoor activities have provided an outlet for Americans to safely recreate as they can be enjoyed while practicing social distancing and adhering to other COVID-19 safety guidelines. As restrictions start to ease, Americans are flocking to the woods, waters, fields and trails to take advantage of our outdoor resources, with many discovering nature’s wonders for the first time.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p id="count_words"><ins>473</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="button-wrapper"><ins><a href="" class="view-more1"><span class="keep-reading">Keep reading</span> <span class="count">473 WORDS</span> </a> </ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="button-wrapper"><ins><a href="https://yellowhammernews.com/responsible-recreation-how-sportsmen-and-women-continue-to-set-an-example-in-the-age-of-social-distancing/" class="view-more"><span class="keep-reading">Keep reading</span> <span class="count">473 WORDS</span>  Link: https://yellowhammernews.com/responsible-recreation-how-sportsmen-and-women-continue-to-set-an-example-in-the-age-of-social-distancing/ </a> </ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>This newfound interest in outdoor recreation represents an invaluable opportunity to introduce American’s to activities like hunting and fishing and the vital role sportsmen and women play in conservation. In addition to the numerous documented mental and physical health benefits gained through these activities, maintaining access to hunting and fishing opportunities gives Americans a chance to procure their own locally-sourced meat. Due to many of the impacts of COVID-19, this ability to be self-reliant is at a premium. With all of this in mind, these unprecedented times represent a chance for a new generation of sportsmen and women to discover the passion that many of us already share. Be it through scouting for upcoming fall hunting seasons, or landing that first largemouth bass, now is the time to lead by example and plant the seeds for the next generation of sportsmen and women.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Increased participation in hunting, fishing and recreational shooting has enormous conservation benefits as well through the American System of Conservation Funding. This “user pays-public benefits” approach relies on the sale of hunting and fishing licenses and self-imposed excise taxes on firearms, ammunition, archery equipment, fishing tackle, and motorboat fuel to fund many state fish and wildlife management agencies. In addition, these activities support local economies which, during these unprecedented times, has become incredibly important. In fact, recent surveys report that Alabama’s 948,000 hunters and anglers spent $1.9 billion while pursuing their outdoor passions.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Unfortunately, the ability of America’s sportsmen and women to participate in their outdoor endeavors were not uniformly protected as statewide orders were announced. In fact, several states saw actions that hindered or even eliminated the ability to participate in our treasured outdoor traditions. While largely enacted in an effort to prevent the spread of COVID-19, these actions severely limited our outdoor opportunities without any measurable increase in public safety. To ensure that such restrictive actions are not used again, it is up to sportsmen and women to practice responsible recreation, showing by example that our outdoor pursuits can be performed safely. This can be accomplished by following a few simple guidelines.</ins></p><ins> </ins><ul><li><ins>Plan ahead; purchase licenses and park passes online, if available.</ins></li><ins> </ins><li><ins>Recreate close to home</ins></li><ins> </ins><li><ins>Adhere to best practices for avoiding COVID-19</ins></li><ins> </ins><li><ins>Follow state and federal guidelines</ins></li><ins> </ins><li><ins>Pack out your trash as a courtesy to others and to avoid the appearance of overuse</ins></li><ins> </ins><li><ins>Share your adventures in a respectful way on social media outlets</ins></li><ins> </ins></ul><ins> </ins><p><ins>To learn more about how others are using these challenging times as an opportunity to spend more time outdoors, search for #ResponsibleRecreation on social media.

Low and slow, of course. But steady, too. Even during a pandemic, it seems, people still want their ‘que.</del></p> <p>James, a former football coach who spent a dozen years as Paul “Bear” Bryant’s assistant, started the business in 1986 with his wife, Eloise. They called it Pat James’ Full Moon Bar-B-Que. David and Joe, sons of Lebanese immigrants, purchased the original Birmingham location in 1997. The brothers have stayed true to the initial vision with colorful, sports-centric décor celebrating favorite regional teams; made-from-scratch dishes; and hands-on involvement in the business. Perhaps most importantly, they have always used hickory wood-fired pits to cook the meats. They have five big, portable pits, allowing them to cook Full Moon barbecue anywhere — feeding groups of 10 to (once restrictions are lifted) 10,000.</p> <p>These wood-fired pits make a world of difference, David says. “We have a passion to do barbecue right. That’s why all of our stores still have wood-burning pits in them. And we do it the old-fashioned way — fresh, from scratch, every day. We cook our meat low and slow right in front of our customers, and they see it, smell it, taste it. And that’s what’s kept us thriving through the years.”</p> <p>During its flavorful 35-year history, Full Moon Bar-B-Que has gathered fans from across the country. It’s cheekily called the “Best Little Pork House in Alabama,” but Full Moon offers a comfortable, family-friendly atmosphere that has served generations and appeals to all nationalities, David says. “We’re real big on making the customer feel good. That’s our job. When you come into our house, we make you feel warm and welcome. We’re here to make you happy.”</p> <p>Full Moon was named one of the top 10 barbecue restaurants in the U.S. by Huffington Post. The restaurant’s red and white sauces are on grocery store shelves along with the signature chow-chow, which is served on every sandwich.</p> <p>Full Moon boasts two items on Alabama’s list of <a href="https://alabama.travel/experience-alabama/food-and-drink/100-dishes">100 Dishes to Eat Before You Die</a>: the crisp vinaigrette slaw and the baked-fresh-daily <a href="https://alabamanewscenter.com/2018/12/21/full-moons-half-moon-cookies-land-list-100-dishes-eat-alabama-die/">Half Moon chocolate chip and pecan cookies</a>(half dipped into glossy, dark chocolate). Both these items are made according to Eloise James’ original recipes.</p> <p>When dining rooms across Alabama were closed because of the coronavirus, the brothers simply continued with drive-thru service, takeout and curbside pickup. The dining rooms — except at the Southside and UAB locations — are now back open at 50% capacity. They also have a food truck, and they continue to deliver with dozens of vans brightly painted with big smiling moons.</p> <p>There really wasn’t much of a pivot, David says, besides shutting down the dining rooms. “We were already set up for drive-thru, catering (and) curbside. That’s our model. We got stronger in that sense, but we’ve been doing it forever. You know, we’re one of the few restaurants that can have a full menu like we have on the drive-thru menu. So it’s automatic for us to thrive in a situation like this, because we do it every day.” Besides, he adds, barbecue travels well.</p> <p>What has changed, though, are the expanded health and safety precautions at each restaurant, Joe says. Things like maintaining social distancing between tables, hanging plexiglass between the booths, regular temperature checks for employees, masks and gloves for everyone who works there, extra attention given to sanitizing surfaces and washing things in the kitchen.</p> <p>“We have to take these measures every day to keep our employees safe, to keep our guests safe,” Joe says. “That’s the most important thing at this point.”</p> <p>The employees — some of whom have been with Full Moon for decades — have risen to the challenge, he adds. “They are all on board. They’ve been troupers through it all.”</p> <p>“I’m proud of our people,” David says. “Being in the restaurant business is tough enough. Then adding all these measures on top of their jobs. You have to remember, these guys are wearing a mask in the kitchen! It’s hard for them. It’s hard for us to manage because we’ve never been through anything like this before, right? That’s our duty … we’ve got to keep everyone safe. We’re going to do whatever it takes to keep our business thriving and our employees safe. Whatever it takes.</p> <p>“Our employees are doing a great job, and our franchisees are doing a great job,” he adds. “They are part of us. So, when they do the things we’re doing, you just have to be proud of everyone right now.”</p> <p>Full Moon has long been known for scratch-made Southern sides like collard greens, baked beans, fried green tomatoes, potato salad, fried okra and mac &amp; cheese.  But over the years, the brothers have expanded the offerings to suit a variety of tastes and lifestyles, adding freshly made salads topped with a meat of your choice, hand-breaded chicken tenders and gigantic baked potatoes overstuffed with meat and fixings. They put wings (Buffalo and smoked) on the menu several years ago, and the fried catfish (farm-raised in Mississippi) is extremely popular.</p> <p>But it’s the savory, smoky barbecue that is most famous here, especially the pork. Whether you get it chopped or request it sliced, you’ll want to order it like the regulars do — with “a little of the outside meat” mixed in. There are classic spareribs as well as baby back ribs. The brisket is from Black Angus cattle. Smoked chicken, turkey and spicy pork links are other options.</p> <p>All this food is made using decades-old recipes and time-honored techniques; it’s comforting and familiar. And it makes people happy.</p> <p>Back in March, the brothers started a “Feed a Friend” campaign, and they’ve extended it through June. For years, David and Joe have quietly worked behind the scenes with churches, schools and nonprofits, but they had to enlist the help of people on the restaurants’ email lists to find families in need.</p> <p>When the pandemic hit, David says, “we saw a lot of people unemployed, not working, hungry. It broke my heart; it broke my brother’s heart.”</p> <p>Each week, they get 300 to 400 responses to their Feed a Friend query. They go through these messages every day, identifying families in need and then sending food to their homes.  “I’ll tell you,” David says, “the reactions we get … will bring tears to your eyes. When they hear they are getting fed today … they are overwhelmed with joy. … It’s anonymous, who suggested that they need food. We bring it to their front door. We don’t say a word to them except, ‘Enjoy.’</p> <p>“We’ve gotten a huge response,” David says. “A lot of this we don’t advertise, and we don’t want to advertise. This is from our hearts to the community. And I don’t care who it is, whether they’ve been a customer of ours or not. That doesn’t matter. We need to feed the kids and the families in our community and support them when we can.”</p> <p>The brothers do this every day, and sometimes they’re feeding two or three families a day. But that’s not all.</p> <p>“It’s a wonderful feeling in your heart, doing something for others,” Joe says. “Feeding the first responders, feeding the nurses for nurses’ week, feeding the firemen. We’re not doing it just in Birmingham, we’re doing it in Tuscaloosa, we’re doing it in Auburn, we’re doing it in Montgomery. We’re just … trying to help our community out when they need it.”</p> <p>Full Moon Bar-B-Que</p> <p>Locations in Alabaster, Dothan, Fultondale, Homewood, Hoover, Inverness, Jasper, McCalla, Montgomery, Opelika, Pelham, Southside in Birmingham, Trussville, Tuscaloosa and UAB’s Hill Student Center.</p> <p>Check individual locations for current hours.</p> </section> <p><del><a href="http://fullmoonbbq.com/">fullmoonbbq.com Link: http://fullmoonbbq.com/ </a></del></p><del> </del><p><del>(Courtesy of <a href="https://alabamanewscenter.com/2020/06/24/full-moon-shines-across-alabama/">Alabama NewsCenter Link: https://alabamanewscenter.com/2020/06/24/full-moon-shines-across-alabama/ </a>)</del></p> </div>

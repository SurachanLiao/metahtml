Just days ago, Kata'ib Hezbollah and its supporters <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/31674/ah-64-gunships-and-extra-marines-race-to-u-s-embassy-in-iraq-after-militant-mob-attacks" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">launched an attack</a> on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad in retaliation, prompting the United States to begin deploying thousands of additional troops to the region. The Pentagon statement said that Soleimani directed the Embassy attack, which caused no casualties and minor damage, as well. </p><p>"This strike was aimed at deterring future Iranian attack plans," the Pentagon statement continues in regards to the strike near Baghdad's airport. "The United States will continue to take all necessary action to protect our people and our interests wherever they are around the world."</p><p>President Donald Trump had previously Tweeted out a picture of an American flag and Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, wrote his own post all but stating that the U.S. government had carried out the operation in response to repeated threats from Iran and its proxies in Iraq. </p><p>There remain conflicting reports about whether a helicopter or a drone actually carried out the strikes. U.S. forces in Iraq have also reportedly sought to confirm Soleimani's death directly, something that is an important part of the <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/30748/our-analysis-of-new-info-and-video-from-the-raid-that-killed-isis-head-al-baghdadi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post-strike process</a> for any targeted killing.</p><p>The strikes reportedly killed a number of other notable individuals in addition to Soleimani, including <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/29524/has-israels-air-war-on-iranian-backed-militias-secretly-migrated-to-iraq" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Abu Mahdi al Muhandis</a>, Kata'ib Hezbollah leader and the Deputy Chairman of the Popular Mobilization Committee, the Iraqi government entity that oversees the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF). The bulk of the PMF consists of Iranian-backed militias, which received support from the Quds Force. The PMF's top spokesperson and head of its protocol office, Mohammed Ridha, was also killed. There are unconfirmed reports that a senior member of the <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/13964/hezbollah-buses-isis-fighters-across-syria-as-us-mulls-striking-convoy" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah</a> also died. Iraqi authorities have denied <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/01/iraq-anti-government-protesters-denounce-pro-iran-crowds-200102144314331.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">reports</a> that U.S. forces had arrested other important Iraqi militants who had taken part in the Embassy attack.</p><p>There also remains some confusion over whether or not there were additional rocket attacks targeting Baghdad Airport and other nearby locations, which you can read about more in The War Zone's <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/31701/explosions-rock-baghdad-international-airport-as-tensions-soar-following-embassy-attack" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">initial reporting</a> on tonight's events.</p><p>"Let me speak directly to Iran and to our partners and allies. To Iran and its proxy militias: we will not accept continued attacks against our personnel and forces in the region," U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper had told reporters earlier in the day. "Attacks against us will be met with responses in the time, manner, and place of our choosing. We urge the Iranian regime to end their malign activities."</p><p>There are already reports emerging that Iran will seek to retaliate for Soleimani's death and it's hard to see how they could not. The Quds Force commander was an extremely well-connected and influential member of the Iranian regime. He also regularly engaged actively with Iranian-backed terrorists and militants across the Middle East, who are also likely to now take action.</p> <p><ins>It remains to be seen what form that response will take. Though Iran and its proxies cannot win a conventional conflict against the United States, they had already demonstrated a number of potential asymmetric options last year, including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Crops' shooting down a U.S. Navy drone over the Gulf of Oman in June 2019. The United States has also blamed Iran directly <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/29874/the-strike-on-saudi-oil-facilities-was-unprecedented-and-it-underscores-far-greater-issues" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">for carrying out unprecedented Link: https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/29874/the-strike-on-saudi-oil-facilities-was-unprecedented-and-it-underscores-far-greater-issues </a> suicide drone and cruise missile attacks on oil infrastructure in Saudi Arabia three months later, as well as <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/28602/navy-explosives-expert-shows-off-evidence-of-iran-involvement-in-tanker-attacks" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">a string of attacks Link: https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/28602/navy-explosives-expert-shows-off-evidence-of-iran-involvement-in-tanker-attacks </a> on commercial oil tankers during the year. </ins></p><p><ins>Iran could use <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/28292/latest-video-of-irans-bond-villain-like-ballistic-missile-lairs-shows-key-new-detail" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">its considerable arsenal Link: https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/28292/latest-video-of-irans-bond-villain-like-ballistic-missile-lairs-shows-key-new-detail </a> of <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/15673/iran-says-its-limited-how-far-its-missiles-can-fly-but-also-that-it-doesnt-matter" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">ballistic missiles Link: https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/15673/iran-says-its-limited-how-far-its-missiles-can-fly-but-also-that-it-doesnt-matter </a> to threaten various countries in the region, including Israel and Saudi Arabia, <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/14464/us-army-opens-permanent-base-in-southern-israel-as-trump-slams-iran-deal" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">both of Link: https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/14464/us-army-opens-permanent-base-in-southern-israel-as-trump-slams-iran-deal </a> which<a href="https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/30363/its-not-what-the-u-s-is-deploying-to-saudi-arabia-its-the-structure-of-the-deployment" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">host U.S. forces Link: https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/30363/its-not-what-the-u-s-is-deploying-to-saudi-arabia-its-the-structure-of-the-deployment </a>, as well.

Iranian-backed militias in Iraq reportedly briefly <a href="https://www.kurdistan24.net/en/news/85bb0696-0d58-4a66-9aff-8c0554f059ab" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">abducted two French journalists</a> following the attack on the U.S. embassy earlier this week, possibly believing they were Americans. Non-kinetic alternatives, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2019/11/14/secret-iranian-network-behind-aggressive-us-cyberattacks-exposed-in-new-report/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">such as cyberattacks</a>, could be another part of the equation.</p><p>If Iran were to pursue any of those options, it would almost certainly beget at least similar responses, though the United States has now shown a willingness to take increasingly disproportionate steps in its ostensible goal of deterring Iran. Major escalatory actions from either side also increasingly run the risk of drawing in other regional or even global actors who have a stake in the situation, such as Russia or China, in some way. There is also the danger that third parties could find themselves caught in the crossfire from future tit-for-tat military or terrorist attacks.</p><p>With regards simply to Iraq, there had <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/31674/ah-64-gunships-and-extra-marines-race-to-u-s-embassy-in-iraq-after-militant-mob-attacks" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">already been renewed calls</a> to eject U.S. forces from the country in response to the airstrikes on Kata'ib Hezbollah, which is technically operating under the auspices by the Iraqi government. Months of protests, notably from demonstrators largely <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/01/iraq-anti-government-protesters-denounce-pro-iran-crowds-200102144314331.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">opposed to Iranian influence</a> in the country, have already weakened the Iraqi government and this recent series of events, culminating in Soleimani's death, have put it in an extremely disadvantageous position. </p><p>Whatever happens now, it is safe to say that the geopolitical situation in the Middle East, and likely beyond, has dramatically and fundamentally changed in ways that are still very much unfolding.</p><p>UPDATE: 12:45am EST—</p><p>Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has vowed "<a href="https://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2020/01/03/Iran-supreme-leader-Khamenei-vows-severe-revenge-for-Soleimani-killing.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">severe revenge</a>" and said that Soleimani's death will prompt those "resisting" the United States and Israel to redouble their efforts. He also declared three days of mourning. </p><p>A meeting of Iran's National Security Council is now underway, as well. The Iranians also summoned the Swiss ambassador to issue a formal complaint about the U.S. action. Since the United States does not have formal diplomatic relations with Iran, the Swiss government acts as a go-between.</p><p>U.S. defense officials <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/02/world/middleeast/qassem-soleimani-iraq-iran-attack.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">have confirmed</a> that a drone operated by the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) carried out the strike. They have also said that the United States is well postured to respond to Iranian retaliation.

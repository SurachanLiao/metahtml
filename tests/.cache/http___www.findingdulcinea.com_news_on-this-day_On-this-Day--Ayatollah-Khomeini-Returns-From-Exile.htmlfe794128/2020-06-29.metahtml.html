		<a target="_blank" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/khomeini_ayatollah.shtml">Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini was forced out of Iran in 1964</a> after repeatedly lambasting the Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, for his Westernization measures and ties to the United States and Israel. While in exile in France, <a target="_blank" href="http://wsu.edu/~dee/SHIA/REV.HTM">the Ayatollah fomented opposition against the Shah</a>, calling for general strikes, and turning public opinion in his favor.</p><p> As a result, <a target="_blank" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/january/16/newsid_2530000/2530475.stm">the Shah fled Iran on Jan. 16, 1979</a>, amid an increasingly restive Iranian population.

Millions of his supporters lined to route to cheer his name, and hundreds of thousands gathered at the cemetery to hear him speak.

	<p class="resource_text">
		The government <a href="http://www.ketabeqom.net/index.php/page,otherEn.STextFajr/scid,458/fatherid,458" target="_blank">published the new Iranian constitution on Nov. 15, 1979</a>, concentrating power in the hands of the unelected Supreme Religious Leader. Khomeini&#8217;s power grab drew much protest, which the Ayatollah answered by subduing his opposition. &#8220;By early summer 1980 all political groups opposing the government had to go underground,&#8221; according to Persian cultural scholar Mohammad Mehdi Korrami.</p><p> However, Khomeini&#8217;s political suppression was soon overshadowed by two events. First, in November 1979, <a href="http://www.findingdulcinea.com/news/on-this-day/November/On-this-Day--Iran-Hostage-Crisis-Begins.html" target="_blank">Iranians took 52 Americans hostage</a> in retaliation for the Shah taking medical refuge in the United States. The following year saw skirmishes between Iran and Saddam Hussein&#8217;s Iraq <a href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/293527/Iran-Iraq-War" target="_blank">escalate into the Iran-Iraq war</a>. The war lasted eight years and resulted in massive Iranian casualties and financial burdens. </p><p> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/12806/timeline.html">U.S.-Iranian relations since the Islamic Revolution</a> have &#8220;been sporadic and marred by mutual distrust and debacles,&#8221; according to the Council on Foreign Relations. The hostage crisis of 1979-80, in which the Iranians held 52 Americans, was one of the first events to indicate that the U.S. relationship with the new Khomeini regime would be an unpleasant one.

		<a href="http://www.iranchamber.com/history/rkhomeini/ayatollah_khomeini.php" target="_blank">Ayatollah Khomeini was raised with the teachings of Islamic religious tradition</a>, and went on to become the &#8220;Supreme Leader&#8221; of Iran. The Iran Chamber Society&#8217;s biography of Ayatollah Khomeini states that &#8220;he did not fulfill his pre-revolution promises to the people of Iran but instead he started to marginalize ... the opposition groups and those who opposed the clerical rules.&#8221;

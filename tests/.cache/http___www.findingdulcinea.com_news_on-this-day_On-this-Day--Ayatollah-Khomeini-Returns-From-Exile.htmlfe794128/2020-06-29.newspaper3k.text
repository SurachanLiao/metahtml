The government published the new Iranian constitution on Nov. 15, 1979 , concentrating power in the hands of the unelected Supreme Religious Leader. Khomeini’s power grab drew much protest, which the Ayatollah answered by subduing his opposition. “By early summer 1980 all political groups opposing the government had to go underground,” according to Persian cultural scholar Mohammad Mehdi Korrami.However, Khomeini’s political suppression was soon overshadowed by two events. First, in November 1979, Iranians took 52 Americans hostage in retaliation for the Shah taking medical refuge in the United States. The following year saw skirmishes between Iran and Saddam Hussein’s Iraq escalate into the Iran-Iraq war . The war lasted eight years and resulted in massive Iranian casualties and financial burdens. U.S.-Iranian relations since the Islamic Revolution have “been sporadic and marred by mutual distrust and debacles,” according to the Council on Foreign Relations. The hostage crisis of 1979-80, in which the Iranians held 52 Americans, was one of the first events to indicate that the U.S. relationship with the new Khomeini regime would be an unpleasant one.

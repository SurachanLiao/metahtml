As a source in the Ministry of Defense of the Republic of Korea told the newspaper&#160;Korea Herald, the squad&#8217;s special equipment will include drones, suicide bombers, reconnaissance drones and even heavy grenade launchers. The structure and training plans of the squad are classified, but according to the information of the South Korean media, the soldiers of the new squad will train according to methodology used by the US special purpose team SEAL Team Six, which assassinated Osama bin Laden.</p><p align="justify"><strong>At the same time, it should be remembered that an attempt to create a special squad in South Korea&#160;in 1968 with similar goals ended in tragedy.</strong> At the time, 31 South Korean criminals were promised a pardon if the squad they formed killed Kim Il-sung. The group underwent intensive training, during which three people were killed, and in the end they were sent on rubber boats to the DPRK, but halfway were recalled. The prisoners were not released, the exhausting training continued, and the date of the new operation was set. In 1971, members of the squad rebelled, killed their instructors, tried to get to Seoul and, when they were blocked by the army, blew themselves up with grenades. The four survivors were later executed. In 2003&#160;the South Korean film &#8220;Silmido&#8221; was made about this tragic episode.</p><p align="justify"><img class="wp-image-98127 alignright jetpack-lazy-image" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.europereloaded.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MikePompeo-300x235.jpg?resize=246%2C193" alt="MikePompeo" width="246" height="193"><img class="wp-image-98127 alignright" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.europereloaded.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MikePompeo-300x235.jpg?resize=246%2C193" alt="MikePompeo" width="246" height="193">Such radical plans to get rid of political opponents are hardly surprising, especially when these plans are developed and supervised by the CIA, which is adept in these matters. And it&#8217;s no wonder that even the director of the US Central Intelligence Agency, Mike Pompeo (pictured), spoke in October at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies forum in Washington, saying that <strong>if the CIA liquidates the leader of the DPRK, Kim Jong-un, he would not acknowledge involvement of American agents in the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/kim-jong-un-north-korean-leader-dies-not-going-talk-cia-director-mike-pompeo-a8012721.html" target="_blank">assassination</a>.</strong></p><p align="justify">Everyone knows that in order to maintain their dominance, the US stops at nothing, including the murders of undesirables. <strong>During the 50s and 60s, they killed the largest number of foreign leaders and public figures who were fighting not for communism, but for their countries&#8217; national independence.</strong> Then came a certain lull, connected both with the policy of &#8220;d&#233;tente&#8221; and with scandalous exposures of the CIA&#8217;s activities by the Senate Commission of F. Church in 1975. The committee&#8217;s conclusions about the illegal activities of American intelligence services (in particular, evidence of murders and numerous attempts on the lives of foreign statesmen) led to the adoption by US President G. Ford of an order banning &#8220;officially sanctioned&#8221; murders of foreign leaders. However, in 1981 this presidential decree was overturned by Reagan, and the list of victims began to grow rapidly once again.</p><p align="justify"><img class="wp-image-98136 alignleft jetpack-lazy-image" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.europereloaded.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Chavezbald-300x227.jpg?resize=225%2C170" alt="Chavezbald" width="225" height="170"><img class="wp-image-98136 alignleft" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.europereloaded.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Chavezbald-300x227.jpg?resize=225%2C170" alt="Chavezbald" width="225" height="170">After numerous media discussions, longstanding interest is not letting up in the secret of <strong>Venezuelan President Hugo Ch&#225;vez&#8217;s&#160;fast-developing infection and subsequent death with a new form of biological weapon: a cancer virus and the American special services&#8217; involvement in this.</strong></p><p align="justify">However, another highly strange and inexplicable fact (other than the special operation of the US special services) is that, besides Hugo Chavez, a number of other Latin American leaders, clearly disliked by Washington, &#8220;unexpectedly&#8221; fell ill with cancer all at the same time. Among them were <strong>Argentine President Nestor Kirchner</strong> (succeeded by Christine Kirchner), <strong>Brazilian President I. Lula da Silva</strong> (after whom Dilma Roussef came to power), and <strong>Paraguayan President Fernando Lugo</strong> (who was overthrown during the CIA&#8217;s coup d&#8217;&#233;tat in 2012; shortly thereafter he was diagnosed with cancer). It is also curious that after the conservative and pro-American <strong>president of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos</strong> began peace talks with the partisans of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), he also &#8220;unexpectedly&#8221; contracted cancer.</p><p align="justify">Venezuelan writer Luis Brito Garcia counted more than 900 attempts on the life of <strong>Cuban leader Fidel Castro</strong> organized by the CIA. And in the last years of his life, Castro also suffered a mysterious oncological bowel disease, which struck him after the 2006 &#8220;People&#8217;s Summit&#8221; in the Argentine city of Cordoba.</p><p align="justify">We also recall the very strange death of former <strong>Palestinian President (PLO) Yasser Arafat</strong>, who suffered &#8230; leukemia in 2004.</p><p align="justify">It is also not unreasonable to cite WikiLeaks&#8217; revelations that&#160;<strong>in 2008 the CIA asked its embassy in Paraguay to collect biometric data, including DNA, of all four presidential candidates.</strong> With knowledge of a person&#8217;s DNA code, it is easy to develop an oncogene for each individual. And if we assume that such data were obtained on the eve of the elections in Brazil, then Dilma Roussef&#8217;s cancer, contracted in 2009, fits perfectly into this theory.</p><p align="justify">So, in addition to forceful options for eliminating political opponents (as, in particular, happened with Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein or Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi), it is unlikely that the CIA would be above infecting them with cancer viruses. <strong>Moreover, similar experiments have been conducted for a long time in the secret laboratories of the CIA,</strong> where they became a &#8220;military trophy of the American special services&#8221; based on the brutal concentration camp human experimentation of Josef Mengele, and before that &#8220;on the experience&#8221; of the American, Cornelius &#8220;Doctor Death&#8221; Rhoads. <img class="size-medium wp-image-98133 alignright jetpack-lazy-image" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.europereloaded.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/rockefeller-university-300x225.jpg?resize=300%2C225" alt="rockefeller-university" width="300" height="225"><img class="size-medium wp-image-98133 alignright" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.europereloaded.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/rockefeller-university-300x225.jpg?resize=300%2C225" alt="rockefeller-university" width="300" height="225"><strong>This pathologist from the Rockefeller Institute of Medical Research started work in Puerto Rico and became a &#8220;pioneer&#8221; in virtually all areas of the creation of new technologies for killing people, from chemical and biological methods to radiation.</strong> With funding from the Rockefeller Institute, he conducted experiments in Puerto Rico in the early 30s infecting people with cancer cells, which work was conducted inside a secret &#8220;Building No. 439&#8243;.</p><p align="justify"><strong>Is cancer the effect of a new weapon of the American intelligence agencies, fitting in well with the &#8220;modus vivendi&#8221; of the agonizing North American empire?</strong> We note only that the disease affected only those politicians whose political direction was contrary to the dominant position of the United States.</p><p align="justify"><strong>The US is on the edge of economic collapse and remains afloat only because it can launch a printing press to re-credit its economy, constantly growing its military budget and secret CIA operations.</strong> Therefore, it is entirely logical to assume that &#8220;the craftsmen of Langley&#8221; found new quick and inexpensive methods of effectively eliminating opponents. The most important advantage of these methods is that they leave no traces, are disguised as cancer or a heart attack, and eliminate the possibility of exposure and direct liability.</p><p align="justify">************</p><p align="justify">ER recommends other articles by <a href="https://journal-neo.org" target="_blank">New Eastern Outlook</a></p><p align="justify"><strong>Vladimir Platov, an expert on the Middle East, exclusively for the online magazine&#160;&#8220;<a href="https://journal-neo.org%20" target="_blank">New Eastern Outlook</a>&#8221;.<br> <a href="https://journal-neo.org/2018/01/14/cia-and-the-assassination-of-leaders-overseas/">https://journal-neo.org/2018/01/14/cia-and-the-assassination-of-leaders-overseas/</a></strong></p></div>

<h2>Number Of Patients Who Have Recovered From The Wuhan Virus Has Increased</h2>
<p>Insanely high numbers of confirmed cases, deaths and isolation have been flooding the news since the Wuhan virus outbreak.</p>
<p>What we barely get to see is the silver lining to all this, that hundreds have successfully recovered.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/XHNews/status/1224313498248704002" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Source</a></p>
<p>As of yesterday (3 Feb), over 600 patients in China tested negative for the virus, giving us hope that fighting it wouldn&#8217;t be an impossible battle.</p>
<h3>More infections &amp; deaths, but also more recovery</h3>
<p>After Hubei authorities reported 64 new deaths today (4 Feb), tension over the health crisis seems to keep mounting.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/wuhan-virus-china-coronavirus-death-toll-rises-12387992" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Channel NewsAsia (CNA)</a> pinned the total death count in China at 425, making the global total 427, following two external fatalities in <a href="https://mustsharenews.com/philippines-wuhan-virus-death/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Philippines</a> on Saturday (1 Feb) and <a href="https://mustsharenews.com/hong-kong-wuhan-virus-death/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hong Kong today</a>.</p> 
<p>The total number of cases in China alone is at 20,438, a large jump from the 17,205 yesterday (3 Feb). That means over 3,000 new cases cropped up in just a day.</p>
<p>Visit any news site and you can easily see these numbers in tables or graphs showing the figures that would scare you.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/topics/wuhan-virus?cid=cna-asia_wuhan_virus_outbreak_desktop_22012020_cna" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Source</a></p>
<p>What they fail to show is the flip side to all this, which is the statistics for recovery.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/coronavirus-chinas-hubei-province-reports-64-new-deaths-more-than-2300-new-infections" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Straits Times (ST)</a>, a total of 632 patients have walked out of Chinese hospitals free of the Wuhan virus by the end of yesterday (3 Feb).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-02/01/c_138747379.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Source</a></p>
<p>Reference site <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Worldometer</a> meanwhile, which posts timely updates of the outbreak, places the number at 642.</p> 
<p>Whichever source may be true, the numbers show that the virus may not be as deadly as we make it to be.</p>
<h3>Novel coronavirus not as deadly as SARS</h3>
<p>Experts have drawn links between the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV and the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) purely because they&#8217;re different strains of the same virus.</p>
<p>Unlike SARS, however, the 2019-nCoV may be less deadly, &#8220;although it appears to spread much faster&#8221;, reports<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-latest-factbox/latest-on-the-coronavirus-spreading-in-china-and-beyond-idUSKBN1ZX054" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Reuters</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/XHNews/status/1224313498248704002" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Source</a></p>
<p>Out of the roughly 8,000 infected, SARS killed almost 800, putting the mortality rate at about 10%.</p>
<p>By calculation, the current mortality rate for the 2019-nCoV or Wuhan virus is 2%, which is consistent with the <a href="https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/transcripts/who-audio-script-ncov-rresser-unog-29jan2020.pdf?sfvrsn=a7158807_4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">World Health Organization&#8217;s (WHO) early estimate</a> on 29 Jan.</p>
<h3>Hope more Wuhan virus patients will recover</h3>
<p>The elation on the faces of hundreds who have walked out of hospitals free of the virus is truly uplifting.</p>
<p><a href="https://elevenmyanmar.com/news/20-patients-discharged-from-hospital-in-wuhan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Source</a></p>
<p>With medical staff working tirelessly to treat patients and researchers coming up with groundbreaking potential cures, there&#8217;s hope yet that the outbreak will blow over soon.</p>
<p>Till then, let&#8217;s do our best to observe all the health and safety measures, for the greater good.</p>

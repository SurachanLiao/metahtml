                            <p>A Washington state man in his 30s was diagnosed last week with the Wuhan virus, known in official medical circles as a coronavirus. One of five confirmed patients in the U.S., he remains in isolation at Providence Regional Medical Center in Everett.</p>

<p>Dave Ross spoke with Dr. Jay Cook, Chief Medical Officer for the hospital, about the local risk.</p>
<p>The patient in Everett is in stable condition, Dr. Cook confirmed.</p><p id="div-gpt-ad-in_article_1">
			 
		</p><p>&#8220;The thing I think that concerns most people is that it&#8217;s a new virus,&#8221; Dr. Cook said. &#8220;It has not, until just very recently, been seen or described.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Wuhan virus is part of the coronavirus family, which includes the common cold, the flu, and SARS. This new virus affects the respiratory system.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because it&#8217;s new and because this has sort of escalated again over a relatively short period of time, I think just this amount of uncertainty is often what fuels fear,&#8221; Dr. Cook said.</p>
<p>Chinese health authorities now report that the number of confirmed cases has increased to 4,500, a jump of nearly 60 percent. At least 106 people have died.</p>
<p>Forty-three people in Washington state had close contact with the local patient before health officials diagnosed him.</p>
<p>Dr. Cook says Wuhan virus does not appear to be as contagious as a disease like the measles, but officials are working with limited information.</p><p id="div-gpt-ad-in_article_2">
			 
		</p><p>&#8220;We know that if someone walks through a room that has measles, it can be transmitted an hour or two later,&#8221; Dr. Cooks said. &#8220;So far, this virus does not seem to have that level of risk of infection.</p>
<p>China has quarantined the entire city of Wuhan, and recently extended that quarantine to neighboring towns. Hong Kong has enacted a limit on visitors from mainland China.</p>
<p>&#8220;Boy, isn&#8217;t that an extraordinary step?&#8221; Dr. Cook said. &#8220;I&#8217;m not aware of any effort that is even remotely of this magnitude to try to quarantine what I&#8217;ve read is up to 50 million people. It&#8217;s such an extraordinary challenge to do that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It at least sends a signal to me that they believe that this is a serious problem, that they want to try to do what they can to limit its spread,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization chose not to diagnose the virus as a &#8220;global health emergency of international concern&#8221; when officials met last week, as the virus still remains mostly contained in China.</p><p id="div-gpt-ad-in_article_3">

<p>&#8220;The symptoms you really can&#8217;t tell from a common cold, at least early on,&#8221; Dr. Cook said. &#8220;Chances are, especially if you haven&#8217;t traveled to central China over the last couple of weeks, that what you have really is a cold or the flu.&#8221;</p>
<p>Because a specialized test for Wuhan virus must be sent to the Centers for Disease Control headquarters in Atlanta, officials are not testing everyone who comes in.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re certainly not recommending testing everyone that just has the sniffles or a sneeze or cough,&#8221; Dr. Cook said.</p>
<p>Providence Regional Medical Center in Everett has personnel from the CDC on hand to assist. Everett doctors are also communicating with the CDC&#8217;s virus specialist in Atlanta.</p>
<p>They don&#8217;t plan to release the patient anytime soon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly we&#8217;re gonna err on the side of caution, because so little is known about this virus,&#8221; Dr. Cook said. &#8220;We want to make sure that we keep everyone safe, and when we decide that it&#8217;s safe for him to go home, we want to be very confident that the risk to anyone that he may come in contact with is extraordinarily low.&#8221;</p><p id="div-gpt-ad-in_article_4">

We were virtually certain that Mueller’s report would lack the forensic findings that we VIPS had arrived at through the kind of rigorous investigation that the FBI avoided doing. So we gave our Memo to you with the title: “Mueller’s Forensics-Free Findings”.</p><p>Sans forensics, Mueller’s report fell far short of Rosenstein’s earlier commitment “to ensure a full and thorough investigation”. It was also clear to us that relying for forensics on CrowdStrike, a private cyber-security firm of checkered reputation, picked and paid for by the Democratic National Committee, would signal a conflict of interest on this controversial issue. Now we know a lot more as a result of testimony released last month (but widely ignored in Establishment media).</p><p><a href="https://www.antiwar.com/blog/2020/06/05/intel-vets-to-the-attorney-general-muellers-forensics-free-findings/#more-35309" class="more-link">Continue reading<span class="screen-reader-text">“Intel Vets: To the Attorney General – Mueller’s Forensics-Free Findings”</span></a></p></article> <article id="post-35305" class="post-35305 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-news"><p><ins><a href="https://news.wbfo.org/post/graphic-video-two-buffalo-police-officers-suspended-after-elderly-man-shoved-and-injured">The police shove Link: https://news.wbfo.org/post/graphic-video-two-buffalo-police-officers-suspended-after-elderly-man-shoved-and-injured </a> this elderly man to the ground for asking them a question, then has his head bleeds and he lies motionless, they walk off to hassle other protesters.

Howell in US District Court. The four defendants are Adrienne Pine, David Paul, Kevin Zeese and Margaret Flowers. They were arrested on May 16 2019 when federal police raided the Venezuelan Embassy in violation of the Vienna Convention, which requires host countries to protect embassies and restricts them from entering without permission from the sovereign government.</ins></p><p><ins>Judge Howell sentenced the Embassy Protective Collective to no jail time. After a jury refused to convict them in early February, resulting in a mistrial, the prosecutors offered to drop the federal charge and substitute one of most minor local misdemeanor charges in the DC Code, incommoding, basically causing a disturbance. The protectors were facing a potential year in jail and $100,000 fine each. They are now on six months of probation.</ins></p><p><ins>The four protectors were in the Venezuelan Embassy in Washington DC for over a month last spring with the permission of the elected, constitutional government of Venezuela, which is recognized by the United Nations and over 130 countries. The United States was attempting to overthrow the democratically elected Venezuelan government. When that failed, it took the unprecedented step of recognizing the then-president of the National Assembly, Juan Guaido, as president and handing Venezuela’s assets in the United States over to him. All of this violates international law.</ins></p><p><ins><a href="https://www.antiwar.com/blog/2020/06/03/federal-charges-against-four-venezuelan-embassy-protectors-dropped/#more-35294" class="more-link">Continue reading<span class="screen-reader-text">“Federal Charges Against Four Venezuelan Embassy Protectors Dropped”</span> Link: https://www.antiwar.com/blog/2020/06/03/federal-charges-against-four-venezuelan-embassy-protectors-dropped/#more-35294 </a></ins></p></article><article id="post-35290" class="post-35290 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-news"><p><ins>Originally appeared at <a href="http://www.theamericanconservative.com/">The American Conservative Link: http://www.theamericanconservative.com/ </a>.</ins></p><p><ins>The president ordered an attack on protesters to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/inside-the-push-to-tear-gas-protesters-ahead-of-a-trump-photo-op/2020/06/01/4b0f7b50-a46c-11ea-bb20-ebf0921f3bbd_story.html">clear the way for a photo op Link: https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/inside-the-push-to-tear-gas-protesters-ahead-of-a-trump-photo-op/2020/06/01/4b0f7b50-a46c-11ea-bb20-ebf0921f3bbd_story.html </a> last night, and he also threatened to deploy the military on American soil:</ins></p><blockquote><p><ins>When Trump had returned safely to the White House less than an hour later, the verdict seemed clear: The president had staged an elaborate photo op, using a Bible awkwardly held aloft as a prop and a historic church that has long welcomed presidents and their families as a backdrop.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>In the process, protesters had been tear gassed and attacked, and Trump had taken a raging conflagration and doused it with accelerant.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>“We long ago lost sight of normal, but this was a singularly immoral act,” said Brendan Buck, a longtime former Hill aide who is now a Republican operative. “The president used force against American citizens, not to protect property, but to soothe his own insecurities.

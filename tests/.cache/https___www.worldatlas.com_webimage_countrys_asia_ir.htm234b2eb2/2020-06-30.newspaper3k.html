<div><p>Iran, the second largest country in the <a href="https://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/me.htm">Middle East</a>, has 5,000 years of fascinating history, and is home to one of the world's oldest continuous major civilizations.</p><p>       Known as Persia until 1935, Iran was unified as a nation in 625 BC  by the Medes, and was first ruled by the Achaemenid Empire; succeeded  by the Seleucid Empire, the Parthians and then the Sassanids until 651  AD. </p><p>       Muslims invaded Iran in 656, marking a turning point for their  history, as the new Islamic policy became gradually absorbed into the  Persian civilization. </p><p><img src="https://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/asia/iran/irpics/descriptionpics/genghis.jpg">Genghis  Khan invaded Iran in 1218, and massacred more than half of the  country's population. The past six centuries of Islamic influence were  stripped away as the Mongols destroyed the culture, burned libraries and  replaced mosques with Buddhist temples. </p><p>       Mongol commanders continued to rule Iran, even after Genghis'  death in 1227, and remained there until the arrival of Timur in 1381.  Timur conquered Iran piece by piece, and was known for his sheer  brutality in getting what he wanted.  </p> <p id="div-gpt-ad-1463171380981-2">

                                <p></p><p>       Timur's successors continued to reign over much of Iran until  1452, at which point they lost the region to the Black Sheep Turkmen;  who were in turn conquered by the White Sheep Turkmen in 1468. </p><p><img src="https://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/asia/iran/irpics/descriptionpics/safavids.jpg">However,  it wasn't long before the Safavid dynasty took control, and it was  under their ruling that Persia went through a revival. </p><p>       From the beginning, Sunnism was the dominant form of Islam in most  of Iran, but as the Safavids' power over the region grew they initiated  a religious policy to recognize Shi'a Islam as the official religion of  the empire. </p><p>       The Safavid dynasty is also credited for founding the modern  nation-state of Iran, as a significant portion of Iran's current borders  originated during their reign. </p><p><img src="https://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/asia/iran/irpics/descriptionpics/mirwaishotak.jpg">By  the early 1600s, the Safavid dynasty had become a major world power,  and began the promotion of tourism to Iran. The dynasty lasted until the  early 1700s, when Iran became the target of repeated raids, and         Mir Wais Khan defeated the dynasty&#160;in 1722. </p>  <p id="div-gpt-ad-1463171380981-3">

                                <p></p><p>       In the midst of chaos that ensued during this moment, the Ottomans and <a href="https://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/asia/ru.htm">Russians</a> seized territory for themselves.  It was Nader Shah that restored the boundary lines and order to Iran. </p><p>       Nader was known as one of the last great conquerors of <a href="https://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/as.htm">Asia</a>, but his cruel nature during his final years led to a series of revolts and his ultimate assassination in 1747. </p><p>       Following Nader's death, a period of anarchy in Iran prevailed as  commanders fought for power, until the Qajar dynasty succeeded in  becoming the new shahs. </p><p>       Aside from the Qajars, a few <a href="https://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/eu.htm">European</a> countries, such as <a href="https://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/europe/ukgb.htm">Great Britain</a>, <a href="https://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/asia/ru.htm">Russia</a>, and <a href="https://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/europe/fr.htm">France</a> began establishing footholds in the region.

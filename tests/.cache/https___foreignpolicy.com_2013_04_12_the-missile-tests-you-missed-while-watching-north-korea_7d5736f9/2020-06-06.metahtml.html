</p><p> Two nuclear-armed countries conducted missile tests this past week &#8212; and neither of them was North Korea. Instead, the missile launches came from nuclear rivals India and Pakistan. </p><p> Last Sunday, India <a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/agni-ii-missile-odisha-defence-strategic-forces-nuclear-capable-missile/1/261124.html">fired</a> a medium-range, nuclear-capable Agni-II missile. The missile, which has a range of over 1,200 miles, was launched successfully from Wheeler Island in the Bay of Bengal. Then, on Wednesday, Pakistan <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/south-asia/pakistan-tests-hatfiv-missile/article4601609.ece">tested</a> its own Hatf-IV/Shaheen-I missile. Pakistani officials said the missile successfully hit its target at sea, and <a href="http://www.defensenews.com/article/20130410/DEFREG03/304100018/Pakistan-Tests-Improved-Shaheen-Missile">demonstrates</a> the country&#8217;s ability to deliver a nuclear payload with a range of more than 500 miles. </p><p> The dueling missile tests aren&#8217;t cause for alarm, though, says Shuja Nawaz, director of the Atlantic Council&#8217;s South Asia Center. "These tests are frequent with Islamabad and New Delhi keeping each other informed," he told <span class="fp_red">FP</span>. "Both governments have lowered the rhetoric recently. Pakistan is pausing for elections. So expect no officially sponsored crises." </p><p> "Missile tests by India and Pakistan are relatively routine and frequent," added Gary Samore, a former Obama administration WMD czar and now executive director for research at Harvard&#8217;s Belfer Center . "We don&#8217;t pay much attention to them." So we can all breathe easy &#8212; for today at least.&#160;  </p><section class="bio-no-photo"><p class="last-author">

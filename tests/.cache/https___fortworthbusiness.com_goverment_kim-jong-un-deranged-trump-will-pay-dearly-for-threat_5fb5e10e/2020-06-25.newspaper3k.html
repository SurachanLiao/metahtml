<div><p>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) &#8212; North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, in an extraordinary and direct rebuke, called President Donald Trump &#8220;deranged&#8221; and said he will &#8220;pay dearly&#8221; for his threats, a possible indication of more powerful weapons tests on the horizon.</p><p>Hours later, North Korea&#8217;s foreign minister reportedly said that his country may be planning to test a hydrogen bomb in the Pacific Ocean to fulfill Kim&#8217;s vow to take the &#8220;highest-level&#8221; action against the United States.</p><p>Kim, in his statement, said Trump is &#8220;unfit to hold the prerogative of supreme command of a country.&#8221; He also described the U.S. president as &#8220;a rogue and a gangster fond of playing with fire.&#8221;</p><p>The dispatch was unusual in that it was written in the first person, albeit filtered through the North&#8217;s state media, which are part of propaganda efforts meant to glorify Kim. South Korea&#8217;s government said it was the first such direct address to the world by any North Korean leader.</p><p>Some analysts saw a clear sign that North Korea would ramp up its already brisk pace of weapons testing, which has included missiles meant to target U.S. forces throughout Asia and the U.S. mainland.</p><p>&#8220;I will make the man holding the prerogative of the supreme command in the U.S. pay dearly for his speech calling for totally destroying the DPRK,&#8221; said the statement carried by North&#8217;s official Korean Central News Agency on Friday morning.</p><p>DPRK is the abbreviation of the country&#8217;s official name, the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea.</p><p>North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho told reporters on the sidelines of a United Nations gathering that his country&#8217;s response &#8220;could be the most powerful detonation of an H-bomb in the Pacific,&#8221; according to South Korea&#8217;s Yonhap news agency.</p><p>Ri reportedly added that &#8220;We have no idea about what actions could be taken as it will be ordered by leader Kim Jong Un.&#8221;</p><p>Such a test would be considered a major provocation by Washington and its allies.</p><p>The statement by Kim Jong Un responded to Trump&#8217;s combative speech at the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday where he mocked Kim as a &#8220;Rocket Man&#8221; on a &#8220;suicide mission,&#8221; and said that if &#8220;forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.&#8221;</p><p>Kim characterized Trump&#8217;s speech to the world body as &#8220;unprecedented rude nonsense.&#8221;</p><p>He said Trump&#8217;s remarks &#8220;have convinced me, rather than frightening or stopping me, that the path I chose is correct and that it is the one I have to follow to the last.&#8221;</p><p>Kim said he is &#8220;thinking hard&#8221; about his response and that he would &#8220;tame the mentally deranged U. S. dotard with fire.&#8221;</p><p>Kim Dong-yub, a former South Korean military official who is now an analyst at Seoul&#8217;s Institute for Far Eastern Studies, said Kim Jong Un&#8217;s statement indicated that North Korea will respond to Trump with its most aggressive missile test yet. That might include firing a Hwasong-14 intercontinental ballistic missile over Japan to a range of around 7,000 kilometers (4,349 miles) to display a capability to reach Hawaii or Alaska.</p><p>The statement will further escalate the war of words between the adversaries as the North moves closer to perfecting a nuclear-tipped missile that could strike America.</p><p>In recent months, the North has launched a pair of still-developmental ICBMs it said were capable of striking the continental United States and a pair of intermediate-range missiles that soared over Japanese territory. Earlier this month, North Korea conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test to date drawing stiffer U.N. sanctions.</p><p>South Korea called Kim Jong Un&#8217;s rebuke a &#8220;reckless provocation&#8221; that would deepen his country&#8217;s international isolation and lead to its demise.</p><p>South Korea&#8217;s Unification Ministry spokesman Baik Tae-hyun told reporters Friday that North Korea must immediately stop such provocations and return to talks on nuclear disarmament.</p><p>___</p><p>Mat Pennington reported from the United Nations.

<blockquote>
<p>Twenty years after the "Islamic Revolution" the human rights situation in Iran remains poor.  The Government restricts
citizens' right to change their government, manipulates the electoral system and represses political dissidents.
. Systematic abuses include extrajudicial killings and summary executions; disappearances; widespread use of torture and other
degrading treatment; harsh prison conditions; arbitrary arrest and detention; lack of due process; unfair trials; infringement
on citizens' privacy; and restrictions on
freedom of speech, press, assembly, association, religion, and movement.  Religious minorities, in
particular Baha'is, have come under increasing repression by conservative elements of the judiciary and security
establishment. The Government restricts the work of
human rights groups. Women face legal and social discrimination, and violence against women occurs.</p>

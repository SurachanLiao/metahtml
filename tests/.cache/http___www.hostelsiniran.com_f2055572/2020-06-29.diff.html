there are few

in mind to the question "<a href="http://hostelsiniran.com/iran-travel-guide/what-is-a-hostel">what 
is a hostel?</a>", several groups of professional 
<a href="http://toursiniran.com/iran-tour-guides">Iranian tour guides</a> were sent to major touristic

<a href="http://hostelsiniran.com/iran-travel-guide/cities-in-iran">cities 
in Iran</a>. The first step for these people who know the 
<a href="http://hostelsiniran.com/iran-travel-guide/tourism-industry-in-iran-statistics">tourism in Iran</a> very well, was to 
gain 
reliable information about all backpacking hostels and budget hotels in <ins>Tehran, 
</ins> <del>Tehran, 
</del> <a href="http://hostelsiniran.com/tehran">Iran's 
capital</a>. Later on, the groups were sent to other cities like

<a href="http://hostelsiniran.com/shiraz">Shiraz</a>,

information included a list of all Iran accommodation facilities in different cities, 
their exact <ins>locations,</ins> <del><b>locations</b>,</del> a list of the facilities and services they 
offer, photos from the facilities, and finally of course the services’ <ins>prices.

aside from <ins>accommodation,</ins> <del>accommodation,</del> offer other services such as operating 
<a href="http://toursiniran.com">Iran tours</a> or booking 
<a href="http://irantts.com">Iran train tickets</a>, or even 
<a href="http://irantts.com">Iran bus tickets</a>. The second step in 
creating such a platform was to process and classify the information that was earned by 
our inspectors. In this step all the hostels or hotels in Iran went through an 
objective process of assessment and were <ins>ranked.</ins> <del><b>ranked</b>.</del> It is necessary to mention that
SevenHostels 
Group has tried its best to follow the international ranking norms in its 
assessment process. It’s also necessary to mention that this process of 
assessment is a constant one; our inspectors visit the enlisted hostels and 
hotels regularly to make sure they follow the standards with which they’re 
introduced to the backpackers and other travelers.</p> <p align="center">Your browser does not support HTML5 video.</p> <h3 align="left">Iran Travel Guide, Iran Tourist Spots Near The Hotels and

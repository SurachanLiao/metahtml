both hotels and hostels in Iran, was started by SevenHostels Group in 
May 2015. The purpose of starting such a website has been to solve a 
common difficulty that most foreign travelers face when they
<a href="http://hostelsiniran.com/iran-travel-guide/visiting-iran-and-safety-of-a-woman-travelling-alone">
visit Iran</a>; finding decent hostels 
or cheap hotels in Tehran or in other Iranian cities. Here on this website it's possible to book a bed/room at any 
hotel or hostel in Iran online; There are listings of 
<a href="http://hostelsiniran.com/tehran/hostels-and-hotels">hotels in Tehran</a>,

<a href="http://hostelsiniran.com/alamut/hostels-and-hotels">hotels in Alamut</a>, 
etc. The reason that 
it&#8217;s not easy to earn reliable information about hotels or hostels in Iran is not that there are few of them in this country, but that 
there are few 
hostels or hotels that have proper websites in English. Now, what could SevenHostels Group do to facilitate the process of earning 
reliable information 
about accommodation facilities in Iran?</p>

<h2 align="left">Iran Accommodation; Hostels and Cheap Hotels in Tehran, Iran</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">First, and having a clear answer 
in mind to the question "<a href="http://hostelsiniran.com/iran-travel-guide/what-is-a-hostel">what 
is a hostel?</a>", several groups of professional 
<a href="http://toursiniran.com/iran-tour-guides">Iranian tour guides</a> were sent to major touristic

<a href="http://hostelsiniran.com/iran-travel-guide/cities-in-iran">cities 
in Iran</a>. The first step for these people who know the 
<a href="http://hostelsiniran.com/iran-travel-guide/tourism-industry-in-iran-statistics">
tourism in Iran</a> very well, was to 
gain 
reliable information about all backpacking hostels and budget hotels in Tehran, 
<a href="http://hostelsiniran.com/tehran">Iran's 
capital</a>. Later on, the groups were sent to other cities like 
<a href="http://hostelsiniran.com/kashan">Kashan</a>, 
<a href="http://hostelsiniran.com/isfahan">Isfahan</a>, 
<a href="http://hostelsiniran.com/shiraz">Shiraz</a>, 
<a href="http://hostelsiniran.com/yazd">Yazd</a>, 
<a href="http://hostelsiniran.com/alamut">Alamut</a>, 
<a href="http://hostelsiniran.com/dizin">Dizin</a>, 
<a href="http://hostelsiniran.com/tabriz">Tabriz</a>, 
<a href="http://hostelsiniran.com/ilam">Ilam</a>, 
<a href="http://hostelsiniran.com/varzaneh">Varzaneh</a>, 
<a href="http://hostelsiniran.com/qazvin">Qazvin</a>, 
<a href="http://hostelsiniran.com/garmeh">Garmeh</a>, etc. with the same mission. The earned 
information included a list of all Iran accommodation facilities in different cities, 
their exact locations, a list of the facilities and services they 
offer, photos from the facilities, and finally of course the services&#8217; prices. 
Needless to say, there are many hostel, hotels, or ecolodges in Iran that
aside from accommodation, offer other services such as operating 
<a href="http://toursiniran.com">Iran tours</a> or booking 
<a href="http://irantts.com">Iran train tickets</a>, or even 
<a href="http://irantts.com">Iran bus tickets</a>. The second step in 
creating such a platform was to process and classify the information that was earned by 
our inspectors. In this step all the hostels or hotels in Iran went through an 
objective process of assessment and were ranked. It is necessary to mention that
SevenHostels 
Group has tried its best to follow the international ranking norms in its 
assessment process. It&#8217;s also necessary to mention that this process of 
assessment is a constant one; our inspectors visit the enlisted hostels and 
hotels regularly to make sure they follow the standards with which they&#8217;re 
introduced to the backpackers and other travelers.</p>

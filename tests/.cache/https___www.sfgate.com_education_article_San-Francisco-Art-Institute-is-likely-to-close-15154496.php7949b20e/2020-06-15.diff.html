                    </p><p>The San Francisco Art Institute announced on Monday that it will not accept any new students for the 2020 fall semester, according to the <a href="https://datebook.sfchronicle.com/art-exhibits/the-san-francisco-art-institute-considering-cancelling-its-fall-semester" target="_blank" rel="noopener">San Francisco Chronicle</a>. In a letter sent to faculty, staff, students and trustees, Levy and SFAI President Gordon Knox announced that the oldest art school in San Francisco's declining financial situation had been exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>“Given our current financial situation, and what we expect to be a precipitous decline in enrollment due to the pandemic, we are now considering the suspension of our regular courses and degree programs starting immediately after graduation in May of this year,” the letter read.</p><p>The letter also stated that layoffs of staff and faculty with 60 days notice would be occurring.</p><p>SFAI had been “aggressively pursuing” alternatives to closure, such as merging with larger Bay Area schools, according to <a href="https://www.kqed.org/arts/13877340/san-francisco-art-institute-to-close-at-end-of-spring-semester" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KQED</a>. However, these merger talks have come to a halt recently as potential partner schools focus on protecting their own communities from the virus.</p><p>RELATED: <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/food/article/Boba-Guys-founder-on-what-it-s-like-to-fire-400-15147048.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Boba Guys founder on what it’s like to fire 400 people, shutter 17 locations in a single day</a></p><p>“While we remain hopeful there is a strategic partnership that will allow this commitment to continue, we are realistic that this will not happen anytime soon in the face of an unprecedented global pandemic,” the letter said.</p><p>The SFAI campus closed on March 13 just before its scheduled spring break, and classes for the remainder of the spring semester will continue in online form starting on March 30. Students who were planning to continue at SFAI in the fall were encouraged in the letter to “pursue placement at another school.”</p><p>While there is a strong possibility that SFAI will never reopen as an independent institution, Board Chair Pam Levy remained somewhat optimistic in an interview with The Chronicle.</p><p>“We might be smaller. We might be consolidated to one campus. We might be in partnership with another institution, but we will continue,” Levy said.</p><p>Madeline Wells is an SFGATE associate digital reporter.

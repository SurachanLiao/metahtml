They analyze the historical performance of markets during times of civil unrest and explore whether U.S. equities have &#8220;priced in&#8221; the possibility that the ongoing mass protests in the U.S. could accelerate the spread of COVID-19. Ed and Ash also discuss the yield curve and retracement levels for the S&amp;P. In the intro, Real Vision&#8217;s Nick Correa talks about the 1957 pandemic, the Eisenhower recession, and how they may intersect.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/feeds.feedburner.com/~r/zerohedge/feed/~4/16Cqifztq0k?quality=60" height="1" width="1" alt=""></p><p><a href="https://shop.spreadshirt.com/USSANews/">Visit the USSA News store!</a><br> <a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/zerohedge/feed/~3/16Cqifztq0k/daily-briefing-june-2-2020">Click this link for the original source of this article. </a><br> Author: Tyler Durden</p><p class="ai-viewports ai-viewport-1 ai-viewport-2 ai-insert-2-25143336"></p><p>This content is courtesy of, and owned and copyrighted by, https://zerohedge.com and its author.

<p>As school environments become increasingly saturated with wireless technologies, our children are exposed to exponentially higher concentrations of harmful wireless radiation during some of their most important developmental years.</p>
<p>Luckily, some state legislators across the country are beginning to listen to the scientific community and ask, &#8220;What is all of this radiation doing to our kids&#8217; health? And how can we reduce exposures in school environments?&#8221;</p>
<p>Just last week, Alaska State Senator, <a href="https://www.akleg.gov/basis/Bill/Text/31?Hsid=SB0142A">Tom Begich, proposed legislation</a> that, if enacted, would require the Alaska Department of Health and Social Services to prepare a science-based analysis of wireless radiation health risks in schools. And last year, Oregon passed a bill to study the health effects of wireless radiation in schools, declaring a state of emergency.</p>
<p>Your state could be next.</p>

<p>&#8220;JPMorgan is asking thousands of US-based employees to work from home in test of &#8220;virus contingency plan&#8221; for closing domestic offices should the coronavirus spread. As part of the test, managers have requested that about 10% of staff across its consumer bank work remotely as part of the plan&#8217;s resiliency testing, <span>which has been code-named &#8220;Project Kennedy&#8221; (it wasn&#8217;t clear why JPM picked that name for the project).&#8221;</span></p>

Paul Gosar of Arizona, Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas are among those affected. Both Gaetz and Gosar closed their Washington offices. An aide for Collins told NBC News that in addition to the congressman, two staffers from his office are also self-quarantining.</p><p class="endmarkEnabled">Collins met with President Donald Trump last week during a visit to the CDC headquarters in Atlanta and Gaetz was on Air Force One with Trump on Monday. All four lawmakers said they are not experiencing symptoms but are acting out of caution.</p><p class="endmarkEnabled">"Members are very nervous," a senior Democratic leadership aide said. "There's a lot of concern that members could bring it home."</p><p class="endmarkEnabled"><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/coronavirus" target="_blank">Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak</a></p><p class="newsletter-signup__descr">Let our news meet your inbox.

The top four congressional leaders in both parties &#8212; Sens. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., Pelosi and Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. &#8212; met with top Capitol building staff to discuss the coronavirus last week.</p><p class="endmarkEnabled">"You cannot test everybody who comes in the front door of the Capitol," Pelosi told reporters Thursday.</p><p class="endmarkEnabled">"It is unreasonable and probably in some ways not focused enough on what needs to be focused on," she said, adding that the office of the Capitol physician would be making the decisions on protocols.</p><p class="endmarkEnabled">Congress as a whole could be more susceptible to dangerous symptoms of the coronavirus than the public in general. Sixty-six senators are over 60 &#8212; two-thirds of the body &#8212; with more than a quarter over 70. The average age of House members is 57.6 years, according to the Congressional Research Service.</p><p class="endmarkEnabled">Many members "are concerned, particularly older members and a number who have conditions that make them more susceptible," a source said.</p><p class="article-byline__inner mt2 mt0-m"><span class="article-byline__name article-byline__name founders-mono f3 lh-title ls-tight pt1 pt4-m ml9 ml0-m ml0-print">Kasie Hunt</span></p><p class="article-byline__bio article-byline__bio publico-txt f2 lh-copy mt3 mt0-m ml9-m">Kasie Hunt,&#160;the host of MSNBC's "Kasie DC," is a Capitol Hill correspondent for NBC News.</p><p class="article-byline__inner mt2 mt0-m"><span class="article-byline__name article-byline__name founders-mono f3 lh-title ls-tight pt1 pt4-m ml9 ml0-m ml0-print">Alex Moe</span></p><p class="article-byline__bio article-byline__bio publico-txt f2 lh-copy mt3 mt0-m ml9-m">Alex Moe is a Capitol Hill producer for NBC News covering the House of Representatives.&#160;</p></article>

Firms try to infer whether workers have made investments required for them to be productive, and simultaneously, workers try to deduce whether firms have made investments necessary for them to thrive. When multiple equilibria exist, group differences are sustained by both sides of the interaction &#8211; workers and firms. Strategic complementarity complicates both empirical analysis designed to detect discrimination and policy meant to alleviate it. Affirmative action is much less effective than in traditional statistical discrimination models. More generally, we demonstrate the futility of policies that are designed to correct gender and racial disparities but do not address both sides of the coordination problem. We propose a two-sided version of &#8220;investment insurance&#8221; &#8211; a policy in which the government (after observing a noisy version of the employer&#8217;s signal) offers to hire any worker who it believes to be qualified and whom the employers does not offer a job &#8211; and show that it (weakly) dominates any alternative. The paper concludes by proposing a way to identify statistical discrimination by employers when beliefs are complements.</p></p><p class="biblio-entry node node-biblio node-teaser contextual-links-region article clearfix"><span class="biblio-authors">Roland G.

Treatment schools altered their schedules to have teachers specialize in a subset of subjects in which they have demonstrated relative strength (based on value-add measures and principal observations). The average impact of encouraging schools to specialize their teachers on student achievement is -0.11 standard deviations per year on a combined index of math and reading test scores. Students enrolled in special education and those with less experienced teachers demonstrated marked negative results.

Students&#8217; reported beliefs about the relationship between education and outcomes were influenced by the information treatment.&#160; However, there were no measurable changes in student effort, attendance, suspensions, or state test scores, though there is evidence that scores on college entrance exams four years later increased. The patterns in the data appear most consistent with a model in which students have present-bias or lack knowledge of the educational production function, though other explanations are possible.</p><span class="biblio_file_links"><span class="file"> <a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/fryer/files/textmessaging2016.pdf" type="application/pdf; length=1030045">PDF</a></span><span class="file"> <a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/fryer/files/appendixmanuscripttablesfigures_final.pdf" type="application/pdf; length=685540">Online Appendix</a></span></span></p><p class="biblio-separator-bar">2015</p><p class="biblio-entry node node-biblio node-teaser contextual-links-region article clearfix"><span class="biblio-authors">Roland G Fryer J, Dobbie W</span>. <span class="biblio-title"><a href="/fryer/publications/impact-voluntary-youth-service-future-outcomes-evidence-teach-america-0">The Impact of Voluntary Youth Service on Future Outcomes: Evidence from Teach For America</a></span>.

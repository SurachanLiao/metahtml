The victim in the Joseph Schwartz case was sent by his Yeshivah/School to see a therapist/vad of Monroe for help since he complained that he was abused by a person outside the community, which is a very big step from the School for sending him for help (but still wrong for not reporting it right<span class="text_exposed_show">away. But lets not go there now) the so called Vad from monroe was convinced about the allegations against Mr. schwartz and has told the now 18 year old boy that they have heard from others that Schwartz is a monster and he needs to be arrested (which is a very big step from the Vad, its called PROGRESS) finally the boy found some courage..... Lets go back a little&gt; The boy was only 15 years old when he was molested the first time by this monster in a Mkivah, the boy went and told the Rabbi from the Shul and others around like family &amp; teachers in Yeshivah, and guess what they have told him??? "Go home, you are lying, stop making such story's up" and he went home and was not able to have a full night of sleep since.... Now lets go back to where we were up too.... It took about 3 years for the boy to finally break and go to the police by the push of the Vad of Monroe (dont forget its after 3 years of being pushed around and abused by the monster Schwartz over and over again and again, just because no one wanted to believe him) Now after the arrest came to light, the same Vad, listen clearly here.... The same Vad that told him to report to the police turned against him just after the arrest.. How?? They went to the Grand Rabbi Aron Teitelbom and told him that this Bucher went to the police to report the abuse, they have called up everyone in the Yeshivah/School and told them what he has done and how horrible it is for the School and he is a Muser. the Bucher returned to Yeshivah a few hours after the arrest and was gang approached by many in his community and school boys screaming after him Muser and that he is wrong with going to the police, he dosn't belong here and so on, the Vad has turned a laughing face right in front of him........ What is this?? U support him and encourage him to go to the police and then u turn a blind eye on him as he never spoke to u in his life??? Why?? Because you chickened out and u want to protect your name in the community??? Really??? Well i am really sorry Mr. Teitelbom from the so called Vad of Monroe, u know why?? Because the Bucher was smarter then u and recorded the conversation between u and him how u encourage him to go to the police and how u telling him that anyone that touches underage boys needs to be arrested and off the streets forever... I will post the recording in order to be able to prove how wrong and how corrupt the community is. I hope this will break the fake game in the community. The recordings will be posted as soon as we get em (yes i already heard the recording) They were shacked and scared that it will come back to them so they ran and turned there back on a victim AGAIN!!!</span></span></span> <p class="post-footer-line post-footer-line-1"><ins><span class="post-author vcard">Posted by

In January 2014, the New York City (NYC) Department of Health and Mental Hygiene received a report of a new case of HSV-1 infection in a newborn male infant following direct orogenital suction. To date, a total of 14 laboratory-confirmed cases of HSV-infection attributable to direct orogenital suction have been reported to the Health Department since 2000. Two of these infants died, and at least two others suffered brain damage (4).</span></ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins><span class="Apple-style-span">In the most recent case, the infant was the term product of a full-term pregnancy and normal vaginal delivery. </span></ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins><span class="Apple-style-span">He had ritual Jewish circumcision including direct orogenital suction on day of life 8. On day of life 13, at a well-child visit, a rash was noted on and around genitals. </span></ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins><span class="Apple-style-span">The baby was treated with topical antibacterial ointment. </span></ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins><span class="Apple-style-span">On day of life 16, the baby returned to his provider for worsening rash, and a topical anti-fungal was added to the regimen. </span></ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins><span class="Apple-style-span">On day of life 18, lesions progressed to include the perineum and the right foot. HSV infection was suspected, and the infant was referred to a pediatric dermatologist. </span></ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins><span class="Apple-style-span">The next day, upon evaluation of the baby, the dermatologist, also suspecting HSV, collected specimens for direct visualization and for viral culture, and the baby was admitted to a hospital for treatment. </span></ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins><span class="Apple-style-span">The location of herpes lesions (on the genitals and on the foot, a dermatomal distribution reflecting involvement of sacral nerves), viral type (HSV type 1, which is commonly found in the mouth of adults), and timing of infection (5 days after circumcision) are consistent with transmission during direct contact between the mouth of the ritual circumciser (mohel) and the newly circumcised infant penis.</span></ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="post-footer-line post-footer-line-1"><ins><span class="post-author vcard">Posted by

Then I came to Israel and fell in love.</span></span></span> </ins></p><p><ins><span class="Apple-style-span"><span>I fell in love with a country, with a religion and with a people. Later on, I fell in love with an Israeli. Not just any Israeli, a </span>sabra<span>, a good Jerusalem boy whose mother’s family had escaped from the Nazis in Europe and whose father was the son of a Rabbi from Yemen. Despite the fact I was an ex-</span>shiksa,<span>they welcomed me with warmth and acceptance into their family.</span></span></ins></p><p><ins></ins></p><p dir="LTR"><ins><span class="Apple-style-span">shiksa.<span>A very good </span>shiksa<span>; pure British blood, blonde-haired and from a good family of Bible-believing Christians. Then I came to Israel and fell in love.</span></span></ins></p><ins> </ins><p dir="LTR"><ins><span class="Apple-style-span">Now I am a proud Jew, an ardent Zionist, and still deeply enamored with my country, my people and my religion … and I have three gorgeous dark Israeli kids who don’t look anything like me.</span></ins></p><ins> </ins><p dir="LTR"><ins><span class="Apple-style-span">When I first came to study at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, it was because, as a scholar of theology and history, I had always been interested in Judaism and the Jewish people. Three weeks after I arrived, a suicide bomber blew himself up on a bus on its way to the University, killing one of my ulpan classmates. It was tempting to flee, but I stayed. I had found the place I wanted to be and terror was not going to move me away from where my soul felt at peace.</span></ins></p><ins> </ins><p dir="LTR"><ins><span class="Apple-style-span">I don’t think that people come to study in Israel, no matter how great the universities are here, if they don’t have some kind of pre-existing interest or curiosity about Israel and Judaism. It is not hard to believe that the Prime Minister’s son’s girlfriend, who is probably not enjoying her fifteen minutes of fame as the world’s most famous shiksa at the moment, was drawn to our country and people for some reason as well.</span></ins></p><ins> </ins><p dir="LTR"><ins><span class="Apple-style-span">I chose to tie my fate with that of the Jewish people and join the family. I underwent an orthodox conversion in Jerusalem with some wonderful rabbis who told me from the outset, “First be a good person, then be a good Jew,” and that is how I live my life. I may not be the best Jew but I definitely try. I fill my life and raise my family with Jewish values and traditions; we celebrate holidays, observe ancient rituals; we live and breathe the history of our People in our daily lives.</span></ins></p><ins> </ins><p dir="LTR"><ins><span class="Apple-style-span">I joined a long line of shiksas who chose to become part of the Jewish People. Shiksas like Ruth who said, ““Your people shall be my people, and your God, my God,” and even Moses’ wife, Zipporah the Cushite could be considered a convert to Judaism.  But without a doubt my favorite biblical shiksa/convert is Rahab, from the Book of Joshua.</span></ins></p><ins> </ins><p dir="LTR"><ins><span class="Apple-style-span">A rather unpleasant experience happened to me during my conversion process. My rabbis were amazing, godly people, but my encounter with the rabbinical establishment in Israel was less ‘spiritual’. The whole process is run on the basis of suspicion and accusation. Heaven forbid that someone might actually want to join the Jewish people because of their deep belief in the religion’s tenets. The highlight for me was when a Shaliach Beit HaDin (a rabbinical court official) told me that because I had too many stamps in my passport, I couldn’t open a conversion file at the Interior Ministry because they were suspicious that I might be a “call girl”. I kid you not.</span></ins></p><ins> </ins><p dir="LTR"><ins><span class="Apple-style-span">When I completed the conversion process and the day came to immerse in the mikvah and officially become a Jewess, they asked me what name I would take. I answered that my Jewish name would be Rahab. “No, no, no,” they protested. “You cannot be Rahab, you must mean Rachel.” They would not accept such a choice and in the end half my documents say “Rahab” and the other half read “Rachel.” But in my heart, I am Rahab and proud of it.</span></ins></p><ins> </ins><p dir="LTR"><ins><span class="Apple-style-span">Rahab was a great biblical figure. She believed in the God of Israel and helped the Israelites. She had an impressive Jewish husband, Joshua, and among her descendants you can find a <a href="http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/rahab-midrash-and-aggadah">who’s who list of priests and prophets Link: http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/rahab-midrash-and-aggadah </a>. And they called her a “call girl” as well.</span></ins></p><ins> </ins><p dir="LTR"><ins><span class="Apple-style-span">Years later, when I served in government, I had the opportunity to represent both the Prime Minister, and all the converts in a sense, on the <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/gov-t-to-speed-up-conversion-for-thousands-of-immigrants-1.235867">Halfon Committee Link: http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/gov-t-to-speed-up-conversion-for-thousands-of-immigrants-1.235867 </a>, an Inter-Ministerial Committee set up to examine the overall organizational structure and pooling of resources in the area of conversion in Israel. Our recommendations, which unfortunately were not all implemented, included the appointment of volunteer rabbis for the special courts for conversion; granting independent status as well as necessary authority to the Conversion Administration in the Office of the Prime Minister and recognition of the unique status of the <a href="http://www.jafi.org.il/JewishAgency/English/About/Board+of+Governors/Board+Plenary+resolutions/res2feb08.htm">Joint Institute for Jewish Studies Link: http://www.jafi.org.il/JewishAgency/English/About/Board+of+Governors/Board+Plenary+resolutions/res2feb08.htm </a>.</span></ins></p><ins> </ins><p dir="LTR"><ins><span class="Apple-style-span">I hoped, and still hope, that the conversion process in Israel can be improved so that those who earnestly want to join the Jewish people and tie their fate with ours can be welcomed and nurtured, not humiliated and accused.</span></ins></p><ins> </ins><p dir="LTR"><ins><span class="Apple-style-span">David Breakstone, the Vice-Chairman of the World Zionist Organization, recently wrote <a href="http://blogs.timesofisrael.com/ticking-babies-boom/">a blog post Link: http://blogs.timesofisrael.com/ticking-babies-boom/ </a>about the problem of recognition of the Judaism of the love of his son’s life and the difficulties of the conversion requirements in Israel. Now the Prime Minister’s son is in love with a shiksa, who maybe one day might want to join the Jewish people (as did his father’s second wife), maybe Netanyahu should invest some time and effort into streamlining and improving the conversion process so that it will allow sincere shiksas to become righteous Jews who will raise happy Jewish families in the Land of Israel.</span></ins></p><ins> </ins><ins><span>Read more: <a href="http://blogs.timesofisrael.com/on-shiksas-love-and-the-prime-ministers-son/#ixzz2rnEj1yuX">On shiksas, love and the prime minister's son | Rachael Risby-Raz | Ops &amp; Blogs | The Times of Israel Link: http://blogs.timesofisrael.com/on-shiksas-love-and-the-prime-ministers-son/#ixzz2rnEj1yuX </a><a href="http://blogs.timesofisrael.com/on-shiksas-love-and-the-prime-ministers-son/#ixzz2rnEj1yuX">http://blogs.timesofisrael.com/on-shiksas-love-and-the-prime-ministers-son/#ixzz2rnEj1yuX Link: http://blogs.timesofisrael.com/on-shiksas-love-and-the-prime-ministers-son/#ixzz2rnEj1yuX </a> Follow us: <a href="http://ec.tynt.com/b/rw?id=da7qt6C20r440iacwqm_6l&amp;u=timesofisrael" target="_blank">@timesofisrael on Twitter Link: http://ec.tynt.com/b/rw?id=da7qt6C20r440iacwqm_6l&amp;u=timesofisrael </a>| <a href="http://ec.tynt.com/b/rf?id=da7qt6C20r440iacwqm_6l&amp;u=timesofisrael" target="_blank">timesofisrael on Facebook Link: http://ec.tynt.com/b/rf?id=da7qt6C20r440iacwqm_6l&amp;u=timesofisrael </a></span> </ins><p class="post-footer-line post-footer-line-1"><ins><span class="post-author vcard">Posted by

A young New Square man claims the highly-regarded rabbi and mentor sexually abused him for five years after he went to him for solace after Sept. 11. The allegations reignited claims that other sexual abuse cases have been covered up.</span></span></ins></p><ins> </ins><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span"><p><ins>"It's clear that many victims of child molestation in New Square are getting angry at the corruption that allows child molestation to continue," says Rabbi Noson-Leiter of Monsey. Noson-Leiter attended the hearing with other activists who say they want to make sure justice gets served for the alleged victim. </ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Also at the hearing was Yossi, who shared his story with News 12 last year. Yossi became the first sex abuse victim from New Square to ever seek justice through the courts. Taubenfeld's younger brother, Hershel, was convicted of molesting Yossi, but managed to avoid prison time.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Taubenfeld's attorney is urging the judge to resist comparing his client to his younger brother, saying he's innocent. If Taubenfeld is found guilty, he would likely become the first sex offender from New Square to serve prison time.</ins></p><ins> </ins></span></span><ins> </ins><p class="post-footer-line post-footer-line-1"><ins><span class="post-author vcard">Posted by

As far as I knew, the case was still active and nothing I reported was wrong.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Note that the Post was told by Trachtenberg's attorney that I never responded to his email – which is false and which the Post knew to be false. But as you'll see below, that lie by Trachtenberg's attorney is not in the Post's report. Neither is the reason for the dismissal of the case against Trachtenberg. (I've been told it has to do with a statute of limitations question caused in part by a prosecutor's error – but I have not yet been able to confirm this.)</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Also note that the Post repeatedly refused to share the lawsuit with me so I could respond to it or to tell me why the case was dropped – something they don't tell readers, either.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>This is a hit job done in part to placate the haredi community and to make up for its Menachem Stark "Who didn't want him dead?" cover.

It’s hard to believe that assimilation will enter through the front door of your house. Your son’s actions and implications are far, far from both the family and national aspect. His children and your grandchildren will not be Jewish, not on the national level of the son of the Prime Minister of Israel.”</span></ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins><span class="Apple-style-span">Continuing, Gofshtein said,“What kind of example is this for the son of the Prime Minister of the Jewish State—-which invests millions in preventing assimilation abroad—-to have assimilation occur in his own house? Your father is turning in his grave over his son’s actions, allowing his legacy to die out through his grandchildren because of a marriage to a non-Jew.”</span></ins></p> </div>

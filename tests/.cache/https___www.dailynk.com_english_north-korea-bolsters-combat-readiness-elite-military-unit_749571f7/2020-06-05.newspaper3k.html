<div><p>Sources report that training regimen of the Storm Corps has become more intense this year</p><p>On Dec. 7, a special education session was reportedly provided to the &#8220;Storm Corps,&#8221; an elite military unit tasked with the infiltration of South Korea as well as sabotage operations during warfare. According to sources, the session contained anti-American propaganda claiming &#8220;US imperialists&#8221; were trying to eliminate North Korea&#8217;s leader Kim Jong Un.&#160;</p>
<p>On Monday, North Korean military sources informed Daily NK about a solemn education session held on Saturday at the Storm Corps command facilities in Tokchon, South Pyongan Province. The event is said to have been supervised by the General Political Bureau&#8217;s Propaganda and Agitation Department. It might have been an attempt to instill a &#8220;war-time atmosphere&#8221; in the elite military unit.&#160;</p>
<p>A source told Daily NK the session was based on U.S. President Donald Trump&#8217;s recent threats to order military strikes against North Korea. &#8220;The speaker condemned [the US] for &#8216;brazenly discussing regime change and precision strikes&#8217;, as well as for its &#8216;unacceptable and frenzied efforts to eliminate the leadership&#8217;&#8221;&#8217; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The speaker did not forget to mention that &#8216;we need to actively resist the US imperialists murderous and villainous special forces, which have crept into the southern part of the Republic [South Korea],&#8217;&#8221; the source recalled.</p>
<p>This aligns with the official response of Pak Jong Chon, chief of the General Staff of the Korean People&#8217;s Army (KPA), to Trump&#8217;s comments. He had warned that North Korea would retaliate against any US attack.&#160;</p>
<p>PREPARING FOR THE WORST?&#160;</p>
<p>North Korea&#8217;s Storm Corps unit was founded for the purpose of establishing a &#8220;second front&#8221; across the Korean Peninsula in case of a war. The elite military unit is also tasked with political subversion operations such as espionage and military sabotage.</p>
<p>The unit reportedly consists of approximately 20,000 members. Its soldiers are said to run an offensive program specifically designed for warfare. To prepare for their special operations, the unit&#8217;s soldiers receive intensive training in both educative and combative.</p>
<p>&#8220;[North Korea] is apparently intensifying class-conscious and anti-American education in the Storm Corps, which is known to conduct the most brutal special training to prepare for their missions,&#8221; a source said. &#8220;Because the North Korean-American talks are not progressing and disparaging comments were made about Kim Jong Un,&#8221; he said, the country&#8217;s leaders have &#8220;set out to ramp up education efforts in special ops units.&#8221;</p>

<p>In addition, the elite military unit&#8217;s combat training has allegedly gotten more intense compared to last year: &#8220;Soldiers had to endure a 40 kilometer march in full gear immediately after a battalion&#8217;s routine inspection of emergency wartime supplies,&#8221; the source told Daily NK. &#8220;High-level officials closely monitored whether all soldiers could complete the exercise in time and without any dropouts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Both the command and the entire battalion had to do the march this time whereas previously, fewer personnel had to participate in exercises,&#8221; the source added. The atmosphere during the exercise, he said, was thus &#8220;overflowing with tension.&#8221;</p>

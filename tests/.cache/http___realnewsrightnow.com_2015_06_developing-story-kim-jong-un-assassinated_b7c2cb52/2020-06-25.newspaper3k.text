PYONGYANG, Prk. – North Korea’s Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un was reportedly killed today by an unknown assassin in Pyongyang during an official inspection of a newly built training facility for the country’s national football team. Kim was providing on the spot guidance to a group of football players near the Kim Il-sung Stadium when he was struck in the head by a bullet.

Despite the North Korean regime’s best efforts, word of the assassination spread like wildfire throughout the Korean peninsula causing South Korea to deploy additional ground units to the Demilitarized Zone and place their military on high alert. China has reportedly taken similar steps, sending artillery and mechanized units to it’s border with North Korea.

President Obama has yet to publicly comment on the assassination, but the Central Intelligence Agency, in a rare and unprecedented statement, said the three-generation Kim leadership, dating back to the Korean War, has been receiving covert assistance from the agency. The CIA did not elaborate on the level of support, only referring to it as “an experiment.”

These damning implications raise new questions about who is ultimately responsible for the crimes and atrocities committed by the North Korean regime over the last sixty years. The country has remained in near-total isolation since 1945 when Kim Il-sung, a possible CIA operative, took control of the upper Korean peninsula. Kim Il-sung developed a cult of personality which was passed along to his son Kim Jong-il and finally, grandson, Kim Jong-un. Using fear and intimidation combined with various forms of mind control, which the CIA itself briefly experimented with in the 1950’s, the Kim Dynasty was able to subdue the North Korean people for over half a century.

A high ranking official with the Department of Defense, speaking on condition of anonymity, told this reporter that the United States is “quietly deploying” three carrier groups to the Sea of Japan. Additionally, the official said, U.S.-based missile defense systems have been placed on the highest alert. When asked, the official refused to confirm or deny whether or not the actions were related to Kim Jong-un’s assassination.

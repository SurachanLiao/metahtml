GenZ, is the generation that grew up having to be part of mass shooter drills at school.&#160;</p><p>What&#8217;s more is that as Trump took office, GenZ stepped into one of the most politically divided worlds of our time.&#160;</p><p>Born between 1996 and 2010, GenZ has grown up in an era where gun violence is frequent, immigration is a very debated topic and the deteriorating climate is acknowledged as a crisis. They are now coming of age during a global pandemic that is disproportionately affecting black and brown communities, and as protesters take to the streets to call out racism and police brutality as well as selfish protests demanding states re-open for no other reason than to go to a salon, get a coffee etc.&#160;</p><p>They are watching us attack each other over basic human decency like wearing masks so as to protect each other, they also keep watching black and brown American&#8217;s gunned down at the hands of cops who do not view black or brown American&#8217;s as equals to white American&#8217;s. They have also fallen witness to a criminal justice system that punishes black or brown american&#8217;s more severely than whites.&#160;</p><p>They have also grown up in a world that if it does not change, they will be highly unlikely to become homeowners, get out of college debt, and will witness continued violence and injustice.&#160;&#160;</p><p>1 in 10 voters this November will be GenZ.&#160;</p><p>They are ready to start a revolution in an effort to make this world a better place for us all. Boomers are less likely to embrace change, especially if it threatens their beliefs, comfort and is different from the 40&#8217;s and 50&#8217;s ideology.</p><p>Boomers are not an overwhelming majority, nor are racists and bigots, the one thing GenZ has on their side are the generations that came after the boomers, our majority stands right along with GenZ and those numbers at the polls are looking a lot like the revolution GenZ wants is in fact going to come to fruition.&#160;</p><p>Let&#8217;s be clear, they are not seeking a revolution that urges violent behavior, they want a revolution that works with leaders, governments and each other to promote healthy change in this country. GenZ is very, very uniquely positioned to affect change because of social media and the way that it unites them.&#160;</p><p>John Della Volpe, director of polling at the Harvard Kennedy School&#8217;s Institute of Politics: &#8220;This generation has grown up in a world that is considerably different from GenX, even Millennials. They&#8217;ve had friends, families, relationships with people who have been different than you based on whatever the difference is: socioeconomic, gender identity, and therefore, they&#8217;ve noticed that those friends and family members, even acquaintances are really no different than you as a generation. That is part of the reason they&#8217;ve been filled with so much empathy.&#8221;&#160;</p><p>This generation truly does understand the world around them better than most of the other generations, they have opened their eyes to it where others refuse and continue to believe in things that are no longer healthy for this world, or simply because they are too selfish to care about the other human beings that happen to inhabit this planet.&#160;</p><p>GenZ across this country have expressed their dismay with a culture that tolerates violence and are committed to learning how to combat injustice at every level, from violence to the way companies pay and take care of employees, to the way that we protest, what we protest, and how we combat injustice.&#160;</p><p>If you are not willing to stand with GenZ to promote change in this country, you might want to step out of the way, like it or not change is and will be coming.&#160;</p><p>Cristal M Clark</p><p><a href="https://crimeshop.org">https://crimeshop.org</a></p><p><a href="https://apple.news/TQl7IRxuXQqaBdPnt023HIA">IOS users can find The Crime Shop on Apple News</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/thecimeshop">@thecrimeshop on twitter</a></p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/crimeshop.cc/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/crimeshop.cc/?hl=en</a></p><p><a href="https://gab.ai/thecrimeshop">https://gab.ai/thecrimeshop</a></p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/cristal.marieclark">https://www.facebook.com/cristal.marieclark</a></p><h3 class="sd-title">Share this:</h3><ul><li class="share-twitter"><a href="https://twitter.com/share" class="twitter-share-button">Tweet</a></li></ul><h3 class="sd-title">Like this:</h3><p class="likes-widget-placeholder post-likes-widget-placeholder"><span class="button"><span>Like</span></span> <span class="loading">Loading...</span></p><p class="comment-links clearfix"><a href="https://crimeshop.org/2020/06/22/104-shot-14-killed-over-fathers-day-weekend-in-chicago/#respond" class="read alignleft">0 Comments</a><a href="https://crimeshop.org/2020/06/22/104-shot-14-killed-over-fathers-day-weekend-in-chicago/#respond" class="add alignright">Leave a comment</a></p></article><article id="post-17516" class="post-17516 post type-post status-publish format-aside hentry category-commentary tag-coronavirus tag-covid-19 tag-donald-trump tag-the-firebirds-spending-my-money tag-trump-administration tag-trump-administration-wastes-7-3-million-on-fake-test-tubs post_format-post-format-aside"><p>Trump Administration Fucks Up &#8211; Again to the Tune of $7.3 Million</p><p>Buy&#8217;s Plastic Tubes Made for Bottling &#8211; Soda Instead of&#160; Medical Test Tubes</p><p>Cristal M Clark&#160;</p><p>When you have a leader like Donald Trump running the show this makes perfect sense, I mean the man did take credit for making Juneteenth famous as most people didn&#8217;t even know what it was before he made it famous, he&#8217;s also recently stated that he&#8217;d done more for our black brothers and sisters than even Abraham Lincoln did, and just this week said that we would have less cases of Corornavirus if we stopped testing for it, the number of cases would go way down, it would just disappear. I assume so would the number of pregnancies in the nation if we just stopped testing for it, how about cancer right, just stop testing for it and the number of cases would simply drop as if it just never existed.&#160;</p><p>WTF?</p><p>Like our inept leader the Trump administration tends to just stumble about making ridiculously stupid decisiions and mistakes. The Trump administration spent $7.3 million in taxpayer money on what they thought were test tubes needed to combat the Coronavirus, rather than properly vet the company and what they actually sell, they just flippantly spent our taxpayer money and made a rather embarrassing purchase.&#160;</p><p>Texas based Fillakit LLC sold the administration Plastic tubes that are made for bottling soda and health officials are somewhat dumbstruck by the administration&#8217;s choice in test tubes for things like contaminated blood samples.&#160;</p><p>To make things worse, according to former employees and ProPublica&#8217;s observation of the company&#8217;s operations, Fillakit employees do not always wear masks, gather the miniature soda bottles with snow shovels and dump them into plastic bins before squirting saline into them, all in the open air. Rendering them quite possibly contaminated already.&#160;</p><p>Comforting right? That is just how much Donald Trump and his administration care about the citizens of this nation.&#160;</p><p>And, I am not the only one saying that: the tubes are designed to be expanded with heat and pressure into 2-liter soda bottles, they do not fit the racks used in laboratory analysis of test samples. Even if the bottles were the right size, experts agree that the company&#8217;s process likely contaminated the tubes and could yield false test results.</p><p>Teresa Green, a retired science teacher who worked at Fillakit&#8217;s makeshift warehouse outside of Houston for two weeks before leaving out of frustration: &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t even clean, let alone sterile.&#8221;&#160;</p><p>Officials in New York, New Jersey, Texas, and New Mexico confirmed they can&#8217;t use the Fillakit tubes. FEMA has asked health officials in several states to find an alternative use for the unfinished soda bottles.</p><p>The Trump administration&#8217;s often chaotic and frantic hiring of first-time federal contractors with little scrutiny during the pandemic shows how uneducated, inept and useless this administration truly is. The federal government has awarded more than $2 billion to first-time contractors for work related to the coronavirus many of which, like Fillakit, had no experience with medical supplies. </p><p>To put the icing the cake here, the Federal Emergency Management Agency signed its first deal with Fillakit on May 7, just 6 days after the company was formed by an ex-telemarketer repeatedly accused of fraudulent practices over the past not one but two fucking decades. Fillakit has supplied a total of more than 3 million tubes, which FEMA then approved and sent to all 50 states. If the company fulfills its contractual obligation to provide 4 million tubes, it will receive a total of $10.16 million of taxpayer dollars all wasted on shit we can&#8217;t use!&#160;</p><p>Round of applause for Trump and his administration on this one, thanks for wasting our fucking money dipshits.</p><p>Cristal M Clark</p><p><a href="https://crimeshop.org">https://crimeshop.org</a></p><p><a href="https://apple.news/TQl7IRxuXQqaBdPnt023HIA">IOS users can find The Crime Shop on Apple News</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/thecimeshop">@thecrimeshop on twitter</a></p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/crimeshop.cc/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/crimeshop.cc/?hl=en</a></p><p><a href="https://gab.ai/thecrimeshop">https://gab.ai/thecrimeshop</a></p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/cristal.marieclark">https://www.facebook.com/cristal.marieclark</a></p><h3 class="sd-title">Share this:</h3><ul><li class="share-twitter"><a href="https://twitter.com/share" class="twitter-share-button">Tweet</a></li></ul><h3 class="sd-title">Like this:</h3><p class="likes-widget-placeholder post-likes-widget-placeholder"><span class="button"><span>Like</span></span> <span class="loading">Loading...</span></p><p class="comment-links clearfix"><a href="https://crimeshop.org/2020/06/18/trump-administration-fucks-up-again-to-the-tune-of-7-3-million/#respond" class="read alignleft">0 Comments</a><a href="https://crimeshop.org/2020/06/18/trump-administration-fucks-up-again-to-the-tune-of-7-3-million/#respond" class="add alignright">Leave a comment</a></p></article><article id="post-17505" class="post-17505 post type-post status-publish format-aside hentry category-commentary tag-fbi tag-jungle-out-there-feat-sam-tinnesz tag-lonni-kocontes tag-micki-kanesaki post_format-post-format-aside"><p>Disgraced California Attorney Strangles Woman Throws her Overboard Cruise Ship</p><p>Lonni Kocontes Kills Ex-Wife for Money</p><p>Cristal M Clark&#160;</p><p>Ahhh love when it&#8217;s good it&#8217;s a love story, when it&#8217;s soured and you add in the possibility of monetary gain, it becomes a story for the Oxygen Channel.</p><p>62-year old Lonni Kocontes was convicted this week of murdering his ex-wife, 52-year-old ex-wife Micki Kanesaki by way of strangling her and then discarding her body by tossing her overboard whilst on a cruise ship during a Mediterranean cruise.&#160;</p><p>Here&#8217;s how prosecutors painted the picture: Lonni Kocontes and his wife flew to Spain and boarded the cruise ship on May 21, 2006. Four days later, the couple took a day trip to the town of Messina, Italy, and then returned to the ship. Micki Kanesaki was last seen alive on the ship around 11 p.m.</p><p>Prosecutors alleged that Lonni Kocontes strangled his wife later that night and then threw her body overboard. He later reported her missing and returned to California on May 27. Oddly that was the same day his wife&#8217;s body was found floating off the coast of Paola, Italy.</p><p>Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer: &#8220;The defendant thought he committed the perfect crime by throwing the victim overboard from the balcony of a cruise ship in the middle of the ocean.&#8221;</p><p>Todd did not stop there: &#8220;But he made a mistake. Despite all of his painstaking planning to pick the perfect ship, the perfect room and the perfect time to commit a murder, the fact that he strangled her before throwing her overboard gave us the very evidence to convict him of murder. She couldn&#8217;t breathe in water because she was dead long before her body ever hit the ocean and when authorities found her, her cause of death was determined to be asphyxiation, not drowning. He chose the ship, he chose the balcony room and now the judge will decide his fate.&#8221;</p><p>This is where things get a little long and drug out, this happened in 2006, but Loren was not arrested until February 2013 down in Safe Harbor, Florida.&#160;</p><p>No one apparently suspected Lonni of murder until 2008 when he attempted to transfer $1 million between various bank accounts he shared with his former wife. Soon, the FBI started investigating the money transfer and the United States Attorney&#8217;s Office eventually took possession of the accounts where everyone discovered the motive, he stood to inherit the $1 million had her death been an actual accident and had he gone about obtaining it the right way. So basically one could say Lonni made a rookie move and got caught red handed with his hand in the cookie jar.&#160;</p><p>Lonni now faces life without the possibility of parole and is scheduled to be sentenced on September 18.</p><p>Cristal M Clark</p><p><a href="https://crimeshop.org">https://crimeshop.org</a></p><p><a href="https://apple.news/TQl7IRxuXQqaBdPnt023HIA">IOS users can find The Crime Shop on Apple News</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/thecimeshop">@thecrimeshop on twitter</a></p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/crimeshop.cc/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/crimeshop.cc/?hl=en</a></p><p><a href="https://gab.ai/thecrimeshop">https://gab.ai/thecrimeshop</a></p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/cristal.marieclark">https://www.facebook.com/cristal.marieclark</a></p><h3 class="sd-title">Share this:</h3><ul><li class="share-twitter"><a href="https://twitter.com/share" class="twitter-share-button">Tweet</a></li></ul><h3 class="sd-title">Like this:</h3><p class="likes-widget-placeholder post-likes-widget-placeholder"><span class="button"><span>Like</span></span> <span class="loading">Loading...</span></p><p class="comment-links clearfix"><a href="https://crimeshop.org/2020/06/17/disgraced-california-attorney-strangles-woman-throws-her-overboard-cruise-ship/#respond" class="read alignleft">0 Comments</a><a href="https://crimeshop.org/2020/06/17/disgraced-california-attorney-strangles-woman-throws-her-overboard-cruise-ship/#respond" class="add alignright">Leave a comment</a></p></article><article id="post-17495" class="post-17495 post type-post status-publish format-aside hentry category-commentary tag-att tag-facebook tag-instagram tag-messenger tag-srint tag-t-mobile-network-down tag-the-network-is-down-jazz-office tag-verizon post_format-post-format-aside"><p>T-Mobile-Sprint Down, Verizon and AT&amp;T Experiencing Issues Because of It</p><p>Facebook, Messenger and Instagram Also Having Issues&#160;</p><p>Cristal M Clark&#160;</p><p>If you are wondering why your call isn&#8217;t going through or why your friends are not texting you back, stop because all the major carriers are having issues today because the T-Mobile network is down. T-Mobile, Verizon and AT&amp;T customers are experiencing issues placing calls across the US, according to user reports on Downdetector and on social media, of course. And that isn&#8217;t the only issue we are seeing today, Facebook, Messenger and Instagram are also seeing outages.&#160;</p><p>AT&amp;T and Verizon are pointing the finger at T-Mobile but the reality is, all the major carriers are having issues today.&#160; Sprint, now a subsidiary of T-Mobile and US Cellular are both caught up in the network outage.&#160;</p><p>As of 6:02PM ET, T-Mobile appears to be resolving the issue, tweeting that &#8220;data services are now available&#8221; and that &#8220;some calls are completing,&#8221; but it doesn&#8217;t yet have a timeline for a full fix.</p><p>But for some more fun, since around 5AM local time, users started to report issues with Facebook, Messenger and Instagram. It appears the issues have not yet been fixed.&#160;</p><p>According to reports on DownDetector, users are reporting that both the Facebook website and Facebook Messenger were down. Instagram users also reported that direct messages were not working on the platform. WhatsApp did not seem to be having any issues.&#160;</p><p>Facebook reports the issues have been resolved but some users are still reportedly having issues.&#160;</p><p>Hopefully Twitter, Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, Amazon Prime, AppleTV + and YouTube don&#8217;t go down. No one likes to deal with tech issues on a Monday, especially on a Monday so here&#8217;s to hoping things get resolved by morning.&#160;</p><p>Cristal M Clark</p><p><a href="https://crimeshop.org">https://crimeshop.org</a></p><p><a href="https://apple.news/TQl7IRxuXQqaBdPnt023HIA">IOS users can find The Crime Shop on Apple News</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/thecimeshop">@thecrimeshop on twitter</a></p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/crimeshop.cc/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/crimeshop.cc/?hl=en</a></p><p><a href="https://gab.ai/thecrimeshop">https://gab.ai/thecrimeshop</a></p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/cristal.marieclark">https://www.facebook.com/cristal.marieclark</a></p><h3 class="sd-title">Share this:</h3><ul><li class="share-twitter"><a href="https://twitter.com/share" class="twitter-share-button">Tweet</a></li></ul><h3 class="sd-title">Like this:</h3><p class="likes-widget-placeholder post-likes-widget-placeholder"><span class="button"><span>Like</span></span> <span class="loading">Loading...</span></p><p class="comment-links clearfix"><a href="https://crimeshop.org/2020/06/15/t-mobile-sprint-down-verizon-att-experiencing-issues-because-of-it/#respond" class="read alignleft">0 Comments</a><a href="https://crimeshop.org/2020/06/15/t-mobile-sprint-down-verizon-att-experiencing-issues-because-of-it/#respond" class="add alignright">Leave a comment</a></p></article><article id="post-17488" class="post-17488 post type-post status-publish format-aside hentry category-commentary tag-21-states-report-surge-in-new-coronavirus-infections-and-hospitalizations tag-alexis-ffrench-rivers-piano-solo tag-surge-in-new-coronavirus-cases-sweep-us post_format-post-format-aside"><p>Coronavirus Infections Surge Across the United States&#160;</p><p>Leaving Questions Unanswered&#160;&#160;</p><p>Cristal M Clark&#160;</p><p>The numbers of those infected with the novel Covid-19 virus have surged as states reopen and amid the mass protests that are sweeping the nation. Within the last week 21 states have seen an increase in their average daily new coronavirus cases since reopening.&#160;</p><p>Those states are: Wyoming, Hawaii, Alabama, Oregon, South Carolina, Oklahoma, Nevada, Florida, Arizona, Arkansas, Montana, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Dakota, Alaska, Texas, Vermont, Georgia, Washington and California.</p><p>Florida reported 69,069 cumulative cases Thursday, which is higher by 2.5% from the previous day. The 7 day total of 8,886 is the most since the pandemic began.</p><p>Florida is not alone sadly, Alabama, Oregon and South Carolina are also reporting some of the biggest increases. Alabama saw a 92% change in its seven-day average, while Oregon&#8217;s seven-day average was up 83.8% and South Carolina&#8217;s was up 60.3%.&#160;</p><p>Along with the increase in infection rates, states are seeing an increase in hospitalizations, which is cause for concern. As more and more individuals become infected and spread the virus, more and more are getting sick enough to go to the hospital, which increases the chance of hospitals not being able to handle the number sick as they head in for treatment.&#160;</p><p>Since states have started to ease stay at home orders and allow for businesses to reopen, we&#8217;ve seen inconsistencies, some states are reopening more than others and along with that people have started to ignore social distancing rules, not wearing face masks, gathering in large crowds and of course travel throughout the US.&#160;</p><p>Then we add in the mass protests sweeping the nation and it is all fueling the fire.&#160;</p><p>The good news is that most states are unwilling to shut down again due to the budget shortfall the nationwide shutdown caused them. The bad news is that because of the damage to the economy, more and more companies are not hiring back the workforce that they had prior to statewide shutdowns, which gives people the opportunity to go to protests, rallies, riots and the like.&#160;</p><p>The biggest unanswered question here is why do many experts still believe that we are going to see another wave of the virus in the fall? Is that not what&#8217;s happening now? As more and more become infected by fall we may just very well hit herd immunity, if someone who had the infection is immune to it for a year or two.&#160;</p><p>While that question is logical it&#8217;s the fact that some states have reopened pretty much everything with very lax social distancing and safety measures in place. While other states that have reopened but not fully, have more strict rules in place, so we could see yet another wave in the fall and winter months.&#160;&#160;</p><p>The concern for many states of course our most vulnerable population, how do we protect them or do we isolate them until a vaccine is created?&#160;</p><p>Unfortunately, isolating our most vulnerable population may be what we have to do if we are going to create jobs and get out of the recession. I know that people do not like that as an answer but we as a nation need to consider it as well as practice safety measures for the rest of us so that we do not overburden our healthcare system.&#160;</p><p>Cristal M Clark</p><p><a href="https://crimeshop.org">https://crimeshop.org</a></p><p><a href="https://apple.news/TQl7IRxuXQqaBdPnt023HIA">IOS users can find The Crime Shop on Apple News</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/thecimeshop">@thecrimeshop on twitter</a></p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/crimeshop.cc/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/crimeshop.cc/?hl=en</a></p><p><a href="https://gab.ai/thecrimeshop">https://gab.ai/thecrimeshop</a></p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/cristal.marieclark">https://www.facebook.com/cristal.marieclark</a></p><h3 class="sd-title">Share this:</h3><ul><li class="share-twitter"><a href="https://twitter.com/share" class="twitter-share-button">Tweet</a></li></ul><h3 class="sd-title">Like this:</h3><p class="likes-widget-placeholder post-likes-widget-placeholder"><span class="button"><span>Like</span></span> <span class="loading">Loading...</span></p><p class="comment-links clearfix"><a href="https://crimeshop.org/2020/06/14/coronavirus-infections-surge-across-the-united-states/#respond" class="read alignleft">0 Comments</a><a href="https://crimeshop.org/2020/06/14/coronavirus-infections-surge-across-the-united-states/#respond" class="add alignright">Leave a comment</a></p></article><article id="post-17475" class="post-17475 post type-post status-publish format-aside hentry category-commentary tag-blm tag-criminal-justice-reform tag-criminal-law tag-criminal-sentencing tag-george-floyd tag-judicial-reform tag-love-letter-to-criminal-justice-reform tag-police-reform tag-unfair-jail-sentencing post_format-post-format-aside"><p>Criminal Justice Reform &#8211; How Do We Tackle That?</p><p>Broken Criminal Justice System of the United States of America&#160;</p><p>Cristal M Clark&#160;</p><p>As we face racial bias at the hands of the police we must also face Judicial Reform along with Criminal Justice reform. Both our Judicial System and&#160; Criminal Justice System in the United States happens to be two of the most broken, outdated and lopsided systems in the world.&#160;</p><p>In terms of Criminal Justice, in the past few months I have worked with prosecutors and victims of crime and continue to hear about DA&#8217;s offering deferred sentences as if they are candy to the wealthy, affluent and the white. On the flip side should someone be black, brown or poor well they are not afforded the same opportunity as their white counterpart who committed similar crimes.&#160;</p><p>That is completely inexcusable, disgraceful, disgusting and highlights how those that working in the Criminal Justice System, make a mockery of it. I am not sure how many of you advocate for the rights of those who were punished to fullest extent but that maybe did not deserve that, victims or family members of victims, but if you do are not sick of hearing defense lawyers argue that defendants due to status, education or race deserve more of an opportunity than someone less fortunate or who is black or brown?</p><p>When you look at reforming the Criminal Justice System, you also have to look at Judicial reform as a whole which is part political, and that is a much more difficult feat to actually accomplish but it can be done.&#160;</p><p>We need to take away the ability to offer plea deals based off of race, social standing, class and sex. That needs to be taken away right away. Deferred sentencing should only be allowed for minor infractions, deferred sentencing should never be allowed or offered when an act of criminal violence has been committed.&#160;</p><p>Deferred sentencing in recent years has widely been abused by prosecutors nationwide, leaving victims, revictimized, disrespected and unheard through the process. What is deeply more concerning is the rate at which a deferred sentence is offered to white, affluent males as opposed to black or hispanic males who commit like crimes. What that ends up doing to an offender, if they finish the deferred sentence and comply with everything, that record vanishes from a public records search. I don&#8217;t need to tell what that does to someone&#8217;s chances of being employed, who was not offered the same grace.</p><p>We as a society need to push for reform and change within that system, one of our best opportunities to do that is to vote, Judges are voted for not appointed. Do your homework on Judges in your city or municipality and get out and vote. Another crucial step is having each other&#8217;s backs. Seek out victim advocates in your community that don&#8217;t work for the DA&#8217;s office, most of us will offer our services for free which I know a lot of people do not know about. Your assigned victims advocate through the Criminal Justice System works for the prosecution, the prosecution cares only for a guilty plea, not you, not what you want or what you need much less actually seeking justice as per the guidelines of the law. Seems like that is too quickly forgotten once an offender is in the Criminal Justice System.&#160;And, we can push to defund cities, counties and municipalities when the courts in each continually fail at upholding the law and continue to make a mockery of our Criminal Justice System. </p><p>Those of us that go into courtrooms are a strong reminder and a powerful one of precisely where the system abuses and misuses its power, how deals are being offered that should not be and how Judges just preside and go along with things forgetting just what our Criminal Justice System is here for. Advocates like myself also fight for those that are facing having the book thrown at them when that simply is not warranted or those that have been abused by the very system they are facing for some type of criminal activity.&#160;&#160;</p><p>We also need to address DA&#8217;s and prosecutors who both abuse and misuse their power to offer a deal. We the people, have the right and the power to remove any DA or prosecutor who has a history of giving too many deals to one class or race, who offer deals just to get a conviction, and who are handing out deferred sentences like candy. One of the worst acts of a DA is to give a deferred sentence to someone who commits an act of violence whether it is beating up a neighbor or an act of domestic violence. Too many times later down the road the offender ends up murdering or severely hurting someone else. Yet DA&#8217;s in recent years are handing out deferred sentences left and right. DA&#8217;s are here to represent the law and it&#8217;s victims, not themselves.&#160;</p><p>We also have to start looking at every law written on the books, many are antiquated and outdated, they make no sense when one looks at the sentencing phase. Laws need to be overhauled and rewritten along with sentencing guidelines.&#160;</p><p>How deals are handed out and offered need to be handled with strict, constructive and fair guidelines. As Reverend Al Sharpton put it, we need a Criminal Justice System that is a Criminal Justice System for all &#8211; not just one race, not just the white race or just black race. Taking that a step further we need a system that no longer offers better deals to the wealthy and affluent over those that are not. No more holding down people just because of race or social and financial class.&#160;</p><p>Protesting gets the cause noticed but we also need to follow that through with action and a strong commitment to be heard, to have conversations with those we need to, to show up and not put up with injustice and racial bias through our Criminal Justice System and to offer our help in making the necessary and long overdue changes this country needs, most importantly we need to advocate for each other through the process when needed.&#160;</p><p>Together we are the best chance of making change happen but we have to fight for each other here too without any bias whatsoever.&#160;</p><p>It&#8217;s now a time for action across the board here, we&#8217;ve talked on the news and in the streets long enough, now it&#8217;s time to start sitting with leaders, prosecutors, attorneys and Judges and make change happen.&#160;</p><p>Cristal M Clark</p><p><a href="https://crimeshop.org">https://crimeshop.org</a></p><p><a href="https://apple.news/TQl7IRxuXQqaBdPnt023HIA">IOS users can find The Crime Shop on Apple News</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/thecimeshop">@thecrimeshop on twitter</a></p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/crimeshop.cc/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/crimeshop.cc/?hl=en</a></p><p><a href="https://gab.ai/thecrimeshop">https://gab.ai/thecrimeshop</a></p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/cristal.marieclark">https://www.facebook.com/cristal.marieclark</a></p><h3 class="sd-title">Share this:</h3><ul><li class="share-twitter"><a href="https://twitter.com/share" class="twitter-share-button">Tweet</a></li></ul><h3 class="sd-title">Like this:</h3><p class="likes-widget-placeholder post-likes-widget-placeholder"><span class="button"><span>Like</span></span> <span class="loading">Loading...</span></p><p class="comment-links clearfix"><a href="https://crimeshop.org/2020/06/11/criminal-justice-reform-how-do-we-tackle-that/#respond" class="read alignleft">0 Comments</a><a href="https://crimeshop.org/2020/06/11/criminal-justice-reform-how-do-we-tackle-that/#respond" class="add alignright">Leave a comment</a></p></article><article id="post-17466" class="post-17466 post type-post status-publish format-aside hentry category-commentary tag-ankle-grease-cops tag-blue-wall-of-silence tag-defund-police tag-donald-trump tag-george-floyd tag-militarized-police tag-police-brutality post_format-post-format-aside"><p>So You Want to Defund The Police?</p><p>What Defunding the Police Looks Like&#160;</p><p>Cristal M Clark&#160;</p><p>I was at the market this AM, lots of folks out early and a lot of talk about what it would mean to defund the police. For the most part people understand what that means while some think it means shutting down police departments nationwide. There&#8217;s been a lot of talk around defunding, dismantling, abolishing, and reimagining what police forces look like. And with all of that talk, a lot of confusion about what each concept really means.&#160;</p><p>Defunding the police simply means that funds would be diverted away from police and reinvesting the funds back into the community, mental health care and the like.&#160;</p><p>I wrote about this at length a few&#160; years ago, it&#8217;s a smart move but the trick is, doing it right. At the start of the statewide shutdowns, we had states not able to make it two hours into the shutdown without being bankrupt, so who can we trust to control reinvesting those funds and doing it properly? We need to be smart about talks surrounding defunding the police here, local and state governments more than proved in a very overwhelming way that they are not capable of being responsible when it comes to taxpayer dollars when we shut the nation down, now they are begging for a bailout from Trump.&#160;</p><p>Not that they should not be getting a bailout but the reality here is who can we trust to handle this type of move properly?&#160;</p><p>Does defunding mean less police on the streets? Most likely not, the reality here is that police these days are expected to do more than just police and in a lot of cases they are performing services they were never trained to handle. Police are performing homeless services, working with children in schools, responding to calls for mental health crises, performing social work and welfare checks, mediating non-violent domestic disputes,fighting terrorism abroad and responding to drug overdoses.&#160;</p><p>So when we talk about defunding we must first find ways that communities can bring in outsiders to handle nonviolent situations, that means bringing social workers, community leaders who work with the homeless already, people who are medically trained to help with drug addiction issues and victims advocates who know and understand how to deescalate in domestic violence situations.&#160;</p><p>People who are in favor of defunding the department argue that reform and laws don&#8217;t stop police from illegally killing citizens and others want to better train the police, some are calling for legal oversight of what police can and cannot do, with more training as a solution. But we have been down that road so many times before and has it really had an impact on police getting away with behaving badly?&#160;</p><p>Here is the example: The police department in Minneapolis, where George Floyd was killed, instituted significant reforms and training programs based on President Obama&#8217;s task force on policing in response to the unrest in Ferguson, Mo. The police force required bias and de-escalation training and the use of body cameras. It tightened its use-of-force standards, diversified its leadership, and started collecting demographic data. Yet we find ourselves again, a black man was killed ruthlessly at the hands of a white cop who had multiple complaints filed against him previously for excessive use of force.&#160;</p><p>We faced that question, and we failed at the reform and training thing.&#160;</p><p>Camden, N.J. dismantled its entire police force in 2012 at that time they enjoyed a murder rate more than 6 times the national average and 175 open-air drug markets within the city&#8217;s nine square miles.&#160;</p><p>You know what happened?&#160;</p><p>Murder rates declined significantly, and by 2018, the city experienced its lowest rate since 1987, robberies, violent crimes, and property crimes also declined.&#160;</p><p>After the police department was disbanded, chief of police J. Scott Thomson created the Camden County Police Department where he hired more officers with lower pay and placed an emphasis on community policing and that has been working.&#160;</p><p>J. Scott Thomson: &#8220;For us to make the neighborhood look and feel the way everyone wanted it to, it wasn&#8217;t going to be achieved by having a police officer with a helmet and a shotgun standing on a corner. Officers identify more with being in the Peace Corps than being in the Special Forces.&#8221;</p><p>Almost all of the officers in the city now have GPS tracking and body cameras. There is an 18-page use-of-force policy, police are required to intervene when they see abuse of power, and the department has the authority to fire any officer who acts out of line.&#160;</p><p>That is what protesters and communities are asking for, the government shoved the training and reform stuff down our throats and quite simply put it hasn&#8217;t worked, it&#8217;s time to try something new.&#160;</p><p>Accomplishing that is much easier said than done, we can&#8217;t dismantle police departments nationwide, but we can change how they police turning them into more of a Peace Corps force rather than a large militant group.&#160;</p><p>It is time to start funding community police programs and to rely less on Police nationwide to handle issues and problems they simply are not trained to handle, it&#8217;s time to demilitarize police and to train them better at being partners of the community and less at being bullies, untrustworthy, murderous and as if they are above and over us just because they were a uniform, have a badge and carry a gun. Just about anyone can do that these days.&#160;</p><p>Cristal M Clark</p><p><a href="https://crimeshop.org">https://crimeshop.org</a></p><p><a href="https://apple.news/TQl7IRxuXQqaBdPnt023HIA">IOS users can find The Crime Shop on Apple News</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/thecimeshop">@thecrimeshop on twitter</a></p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/crimeshop.cc/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/crimeshop.cc/?hl=en</a></p><p><a href="https://gab.ai/thecrimeshop">https://gab.ai/thecrimeshop</a></p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/cristal.marieclark">https://www.facebook.com/cristal.marieclark</a></p><h3 class="sd-title">Share this:</h3><ul><li class="share-twitter"><a href="https://twitter.com/share" class="twitter-share-button">Tweet</a></li></ul><h3 class="sd-title">Like this:</h3><p class="likes-widget-placeholder post-likes-widget-placeholder"><span class="button"><span>Like</span></span> <span class="loading">Loading...</span></p><p class="comment-links clearfix"><a href="https://crimeshop.org/2020/06/10/so-you-want-to-defund-the-police/#respond" class="read alignleft">0 Comments</a><a href="https://crimeshop.org/2020/06/10/so-you-want-to-defund-the-police/#respond" class="add alignright">Leave a comment</a></p></article><article id="post-17453" class="post-17453 post type-post status-publish format-aside hentry category-commentary tag-anthony-fauci tag-anti-vaxxer tag-donald-trump tag-operation-warp-speed tag-the-hives-walk-idiot-walk tag-trump-is-a-deranged-idiot post_format-post-format-aside"><p>Operation Warp Speed &#8211; Unlikely, Dangerous and Irresponsible</p><p>Coronavirus Vaccine Highly Unlikely by Election Time</p><p>Cristal M Clark&#160;</p><p>Trump is pushing the idea that we will be seeing a Coronavirus Vaccine by the end of the year, although he is pushing the scientific community for results by October all so that he can win the election. That math does add up, push for a vaccine, be hailed as a hero. Then once you win the election in November, millions start dying, because of a vaccine you touted, promised and bullied to get?&#160;&#160;</p><p>That could spell some fairly deadly consequences but what it also spells is just how little the man sitting in the oval office values the lives of American Citizens. Whats more is that the notion of fast tracking a vaccine is highly unlikely if you were to ask prominent health experts and veteran vaccine developers who agree that it is rather unlikely without some type of a miracle.</p><p>Dr. Stanley Plotkin, credited with inventing a rubella vaccine in 1964, said developing a vaccine in a year to a year and half was &#8220;feasible,&#8221; but dependent on the efficacy of the vaccines currently in development and on the ability to mass produce them.&#160;</p><p>&#8220;In the best of circumstances, we should have a vaccine or let&#8217;s say vaccines between 12 and 18 months, whether those circumstances will be the best or not, we don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p><p>Who can forget that Trump&#8217;s own top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, told the &#8220;Today&#8221; show that January 2021 is the earliest a vaccine could be ready, but cautioned that that timeline is &#8220;aspirational&#8221; and it also depends on companies producing a vaccine before researchers are sure it will work.</p><p>Not to mention FDA licensing typically takes years to conduct the large population studies needed to prove its safety so Trump&#8217;s promise is simply not feasible and could be quite deadly if he can manage for force someone&#8217;s hand.&#160;</p><p>It is completely irresponsible and dangerous to play around with a vaccine just so that one can win an election. I am far from being an anti-vaxxer, I believe in vaccines but when you attempt to bully your way through the scientific community to try to &#8220;make&#8221; them get a vaccine ready before it&#8217;s time just so you can win the election, I believe it is dangerous, irresponsible and could arrive just in time to kill ones voters.&#160;</p><p>Trump is a coward, a deranged lunatic and he promised a wall and managed to build one around the White House out of fear of protesters, Trump failed all of us with the Coronavirus and shut down the country too late to stop the spread, spews hatred and vile accusations at victims, reporters and anyone who does not agree with him, he is a sexist, a bigot, and a known racist.&#160;</p><p>Would you agree to get a vaccine Trump is pushing to make happen knowing how little he cares for any of us in the United States?</p><p>Cristal M Clark</p><p><a href="https://crimeshop.org">https://crimeshop.org</a></p><p><a href="https://apple.news/TQl7IRxuXQqaBdPnt023HIA">IOS users can find The Crime Shop on Apple News</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/thecimeshop">@thecrimeshop on twitter</a></p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/crimeshop.cc/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/crimeshop.cc/?hl=en</a></p><p><a href="https://gab.ai/thecrimeshop">https://gab.ai/thecrimeshop</a></p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/cristal.marieclark">https://www.facebook.com/cristal.marieclark</a></p><h3 class="sd-title">Share this:</h3><ul><li class="share-twitter"><a href="https://twitter.com/share" class="twitter-share-button">Tweet</a></li></ul><h3 class="sd-title">Like this:</h3><p class="likes-widget-placeholder post-likes-widget-placeholder"><span class="button"><span>Like</span></span> <span class="loading">Loading...</span></p><p class="comment-links clearfix"><a href="https://crimeshop.org/2020/06/09/operation-warp-speed-unlikely-dangerous-and-irresponsible/#respond" class="read alignleft">0 Comments</a><a href="https://crimeshop.org/2020/06/09/operation-warp-speed-unlikely-dangerous-and-irresponsible/#respond" class="add alignright">Leave a comment</a></p></article><article id="post-17444" class="post-17444 post type-post status-publish format-aside hentry category-commentary tag-potus tag-dom-flemons-georgia-drumbeat tag-donald-trump tag-donald-trump-is-a-racist tag-trump-account-first-on-twitter-when-word-racist-searched tag-twitter post_format-post-format-aside"><p>Trump&#8217;s Twitter Account First When Users Search the Word &#8216;Racist&#8217;</p><p>Because Donald Trump is a Racist</p><p>Cristal M Clark&#160;</p><p>Yesterday users on Twitter began reporting that when they searched the word racist Donald Trump&#8217;s Twitter was one the first to come up and that should surprise no one in particular.&#160;</p><p>&#8220;The top result for racist on Twitter is the president of the United States,&#8221; The Verge&#8217;s Tom Warren tweeted.&#160;</p><p>According to Twitter this is due to an algorithm, which is triggered by user behavior naturally.&#160;</p><p>All of this of course comes during a time when the Don and Twitter are getting into pissing matches. On May 28th Trump issued an executive order in an attempt to regulate it and other companies like Instagram, Facebook, and Youtube. And, that was because Twitter decided they would start fact checking Trump&#8217;s tweets not to mention one of the tweets the day before the executive order had been flagged for violence.&#160;</p><p>Yet Trump still chooses to utilize twitter to spread hate, spewing misinformation, touting himself and inciting violent behaviors among his followers. During a press conference on Friday in response to a reporter asking Trump how he planned to combat racism here in the US Trump Responded with: &#8220;And by the way, what&#8217;s happened to our country, and what you now see what&#8217;s been happening is the greatest thing that can happen toward race relations, toward the African American community, the Asian American, the Hispanic American community, for women, for everything,&#8221;</p><p>Trump in case you didn&#8217;t know happens to think that he is the least racist individual to ever grace this fine earth, which we all know to be untrue. October 16, 1973. The Justice Department&#8217;s 1973 lawsuit against Trump Management Company focused on 39 properties in New York City. The government alleged that employees were directed to tell African American lease applicants that there were no open apartments. Company policy, according to an employee quoted in court documents, was to rent only to &#8220;Jews and executives.&#8221;</p><p>In the early 1990s, Trump attempted to block the building of new casinos in Connecticut and New York that could cut into his casino operations in Atlantic City which subsequently went bankrupt. The reason, Nativie American&#8217;s wanted to build the new casinos and according to Trump, they didn&#8217;t look like Indians to him.&#160;</p><p>In the summer of 2005, Donald Trump had an idea: What if the next season of his reality-TV show, The Apprentice, pitted a team of successful African Americans versus a team of successful whites? Yes, that didn&#8217;t go over well and was scrapped.&#160;</p><p>Who can forget the Birtherism issue Trump pounced on that was surrounding President Obama? Trump is still spreading those rumors to this day.&#160;</p><p>6 months into Trump&#8217;s presidency, on the night of Friday, August 11, 2017, hundreds of neo-Nazis and white supremacists marched onto the University of Virginia&#8217;s campus in Charlottesville chanting &#8220;Jews will not replace us&#8221; and &#8220;Blood and soil,&#8221; a Nazi slogan. The &#8220;Unite the Right&#8221; rally was protesting the proposed removal of a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee. Despite the violence and hate happening Trump said &#8220;there were very fine people on both sides.&#8221; After having initially condemning the Neo-Nazi&#8217;s, the KKK, the Far Right, and other hate groups.&#160;</p><p>Donald Trump has assembled a long record of comment on issues involving African Americans as well as Mexicans, Hispanics more broadly, Native Americans, Muslims, Jews, immigrants, women, and people with disabilities.&#160;</p><p>And all of those comments, well they don&#8217;t paint a rosey image of Donald Trump. His bigotry and intolerance shines right on through. He once placed ads calling for the execution of 5 young black and Latino men accused of rape, who were later shown to be innocent, a former employee of Trump&#8217;s Castle in Atlantic city once reported that whenever Donald and Ivana came to the casino, the bosses would order all the black people off the floor. I mean look at his presidential campaign which was fueled by nativist sentiment directed at nonwhite immigrants, and he proposed barring Muslims from entering the country.&#160;</p><p>Seeing Trump&#8217;s twitter account show up first when you search the word &#8220;racist&#8221; is not a shock at all in fact, it makes perfect sense.&#160;</p><p>Cristal M Clark</p><p><a href="https://crimeshop.org">https://crimeshop.org</a></p><p><a href="https://apple.news/TQl7IRxuXQqaBdPnt023HIA">IOS users can find The Crime Shop on Apple News</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/thecimeshop">@thecrimeshop on twitter</a></p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/crimeshop.cc/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/crimeshop.cc/?hl=en</a></p><p><a href="https://gab.ai/thecrimeshop">https://gab.ai/thecrimeshop</a></p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/cristal.marieclark">https://www.facebook.com/cristal.marieclark</a></p></article></div>

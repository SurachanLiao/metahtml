<div><p>Iran&#8212;with a population approaching 84 million and buttressed by ample oil reserves&#8212;is one of the most powerful countries in the Middle East. Its resurgence in the first decade of the 21st century was one of the many unintended outcomes of US military adventures in Afghanistan and Iraq. Suddenly rid of two hostile regimes on its borders&#8212;the Taliban and Saddam Hussein&#8212;Iran extended its power into the Arab Middle East, cementing its growing power in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Palestine.</p>

<p>In its current situation, Iran remains a deeply troubled country as it struggles to come up from underneath recently lifted international sanctions that were placed upon it by Western countries&#8212;specifically the P5+1 countries&#8212;due to Iran's nuclear-related activities. Those sanctions squeezed Iran&#8217;s oil exports and access to global financial markets, resulting in soaring inflation and plummeting foreign currency reserves. From 2015, when the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action was implemented, until May 2018, when the United States abruptly withdrew from it, Iran was free to do business with the world, trade delegations and regional and European actors sought to do business with Iran.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/what-status-iran-nuclear-agreement">President Trump's withdrawal from the JCPOA</a> was accompanied by the reestablishment of sanctions on Iran's oil and banking industries. Since that time, tensions between Iran and the United States have steadily risen, particularly in December of 2019 and January 2020, when the two countries traded attacks. In January, President Donald Trump ordered a drone attack to assassinate Qassem Soleimani, the head of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force. Iran announced they would pull out of the JCPOA completely. For a few days in January 2020, Iran and the U.S. were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/11/us/politics/iran-trump.html">brought to the brink of war</a> before cautiously edging back.</p>
<p>Most Iranians are more concerned with stagnant living standards rather than foreign policy. The economy can&#8217;t flourish in a constant state of confrontation with the outside world, which hit new heights under former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (2005&#8211;2013). President Hassan Rouhani, in office since 2013, now presides over a country mired in financial crises with a chaotic banking sector. In mid-November 2019, an abrupt raise in gasoline prices led to public anti-government demonstrations, which were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/01/world/middleeast/iran-protests-deaths.html">brutally suppressed</a> by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard: between 180 and 450 people were killed in four days of intense violence.&#160;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/the-iranian-revolution-of-1979-195528">1979 Islamic Revolution</a> brought to power radical Islamists led by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who created a unique and peculiar political system mixing theocratic and republican institutions. It is a complex system of competing institutions, parliamentary factions, powerful families and military-business lobbies.</p>
<p>Today, the system is dominated by hard-line conservative groups backed by the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the most powerful politician in Iran. The conservatives have managed to sideline both the right-wing populists backed by former President Ahmadinejad and reformists calling for a more open political system. Civil society and pro-democracy groups have been suppressed.</p>
<p>Many Iranians believe the system is corrupt and rigged in favor of powerful groups that care about money more than ideology and who deliberately perpetuate tensions with the West to distract the public from domestic problems. No political group has yet been able to challenge Supreme Leader Khamenei.</p>

<p>Dissent, freedom of the press and freedom of expression remain highly restricted in the country. Journalists and bloggers are continuously arrested by the Intelligence Unit of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps for "colluding with the foreign media" and sentenced to prison. Hundreds of websites remain blocked, and&#8212;depending on the province&#8212;police and the judiciary arrest performers at musical concerts, particularly those featuring female vocalists and musicians.</p>

<p>Early information out of China, where COVID-19 first started, shows that some people are at higher risk of getting very sick from this illness. This includes:</p>
<ul><li>Older adults</li><li>People who have serious chronic medical conditions like:<ul><li>Heart disease</li><li>Diabetes</li><li>Lung disease</li></ul></li></ul>
<p>If a COVID-19 outbreak happens in your community, it could last for a long time. (An outbreak is when a large number of people suddenly get sick.) Depending on how severe the outbreak is, public health officials may recommend community actions to reduce people&#8217;s risk of being exposed to COVID-19. These actions can slow the spread and reduce the impact of disease.</p>
<p>If you are at higher risk for serious illness from COVID-19 because of your age or because you have a serious long-term health problem, it is extra important for you to take actions to reduce your risk of getting sick with the disease.</p>

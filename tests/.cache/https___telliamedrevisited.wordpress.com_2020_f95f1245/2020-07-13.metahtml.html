		<p>Almost four months ago, I posted some <a href="https://telliamedrevisited.wordpress.com/2020/02/29/words-of-wisdom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">words of wisdom</a> about the challenges and dilemma of preparing for a pandemic:</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything we do before a pandemic will seem alarmist. Everything we do after a pandemic will seem inadequate. This is the dilemma we face, but it should not stop us from doing what we can to prepare.&#8221; &#8212; Michael O. Leavitt, 2007 (former Secretary of Health and Human Services)</p>
<p>Given our failure to contain the current pandemic, I&#8217;ll offer a corollary:</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not easy to put a pandemic back in the bottle after it&#8217;s on the loose. Our early efforts at containment are the least costly and most critical.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I have been very fortunate to know and work with outstanding Black scientists throughout my career.&#160; Here are a few of them.</p>
<p>I met <a href="https://jsnn.ncat.uncg.edu/people/joseph-graves/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joe Graves</a> when we were undergraduates at Oberlin College.&#160; We took an evolution course together.&#160; I remember discussing with Joe our mutual fascination with evolution and wondering how we might go about studying it. &#160;I met up again with Joe at UC-Irvine, where we were both conducting evolution experiments&#8212;Joe using fruit flies, and me with bacteria.&#160; Joe and I reconnected once more when he and I became founding members of the <a href="https://www3.beacon-center.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BEACON Center for the Study of Evolution in Action</a>.&#160; Joe now studies bacterial evolution, and we are becoming scientific collaborators as well.</p>
<p>JoAnn White was an ecologist at UNC, <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2407477?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents" target="_blank" rel="noopener">studying the life-history and population dynamics of periodical cicadas</a>.&#160; She served on my doctoral advisory committee and was a highly successful faculty member.&#160; Unfortunately, she left academia, even though she had tenure, because it was too frustrating. I was honored that she asked me to write a reference letter when she moved to a new profession.&#160; But it was a terrible loss for academia to lose such an outstanding scientist and role model as JoAnn White.</p>
<p><a href="https://turnerlab.yale.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paul Turner</a> was one of my first graduate students.&#160; He joined my lab in the Department of Ecology and Evolution at UC-Irvine, and he moved with me to MSU, receiving his Ph.D. in 1995.&#160; Paul has impressed me in many ways, not only as a superb scientist and mentor, but also in his upbeat outlook on life.&#160; Somehow he manages to smile and laugh about the challenges of being a departmental chair and interim dean, even while running a lab that conducts ground-breaking research.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lynette_Ekunwe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lynette Ekunwe</a> was my lab manager and technician for seven years after I moved to MSU. She helped to sustain the long-term evolution experiment with E. coli after its move from UC-Irvine, and she helped run my lab group as it grew in size. Lynette moved to Jackson State University when her husband, the late <a href="https://hbcudigest.com/jackson-state-mourns-esteemed-biology-professor-stephen-i-n-ekunwe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steve Ekunwe,</a> took a faculty position there. After the move, Lynette earned a doctorate in public health, and she now works in the field of epidemiology.</p>
<p>I first met <a href="https://edwards.oeb.harvard.edu/people/scott-v-edwards" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scott Edwards</a> when he was a graduate student at UC-Berkeley. I suspected that he was a rising star, and I was right.&#160; Although Scott and I have not collaborated on actual science, we&#8217;ve worked together in other ways.&#160; Scott and I served successive terms as Presidents of the <a href="https://www.evolutionsociety.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Society for the Study of Evolution</a>, and he has been a valued member of the <a href="https://www3.beacon-center.org/welcome/beacons-external-advisory-committee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">External Advisory Board</a> for the BEACON Center.</p>
<p>Shenandoah Oden was an undergraduate from Detroit when she joined my lab in the 1990s.&#160; She worked with postdoc <a href="https://sfelenalab.csic.es/sfelena/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Santiago Elena</a> on measuring the fitness effects of random insertion mutations in E. coli, leading to a <a href="http://myxo.css.msu.edu/lenski/pdf/1998,%20Genetica,%20Elena%20et%20al.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paper in Genetica</a>. What I remember best about Shenandoah is a question she asked me right after <a href="https://pages.uoregon.edu/bohannanlab/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brendan Bohannan</a> presented his dissertation seminar: &#8220;How do scientists come up with the questions they ask?&#8221; I told her that was the best question that any student had ever asked me.&#160; It reminded me of how Joe Graves and I, when we were undergrads, wondered how we might study evolution. To Shenandoah, I explained the importance of personal curiosity and mentors in finding questions that are both interesting and answerable.</p>
<p><a href="https://vetmed.illinois.edu/directory/index.pl?dept=726" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marwa Adewa</a>,&#160;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maia-rowles-85626543/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maia Rowles</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kiyana-weatherspoon-65746249/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kiyana Weatherspoon</a> were three excellent undergraduate researchers in my lab, all of whom were mentored by <a href="https://www.blount-lab.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zachary Blount</a>. Maia and Kiyana were coauthors on a <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2015.2292" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paper in the Proceedings of the Royal Society, London B</a>, which reported the results of what we call the &#8220;all-hands project&#8221;&#8212;one in which a generation of lab members performed a set of parallel assays to measure the subtle changes in fitness in late generations of the long-term evolution experiment with E. coli. Marwa now works in the field of veterinary medical research, while Maia and Kiyana are pursuing careers with a biomedical focus.</p>
<p><a href="https://news.stonybrook.edu/university/clarkecdo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Judi Brown Clarke</a> was, until very recently, the Diversity Director for our BEACON Center. In that role she generated and managed many successful programs that introduced hundreds of students at all levels to evolution and provided them with opportunities to engage in scientific research. She also was a great listener and valuable source of advice for many of us when we faced personal challenges and setbacks. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judi_Brown_Clarke" target="_blank" rel="noopener">An Olympic medalist</a>, Judi recently became the Chief Diversity Officer at Stony Brook University.</p>
<p>I met <a href="https://twitter.com/RELenski/status/996450619916419078" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jay Bundy</a> in 2013, at the Evolution meeting in Snowbird, Utah.&#160; Who was this student who was asking so many thoughtful, insightful questions of the speakers?&#160; I ran into Jay as we rushed between talks, introduced myself, and learned that he was a masters student at Penn State.&#160; He wasn&#8217;t sure if he was interested in microbes, but I encouraged him to think about joining BEACON.&#160; Jay came to MSU, first as a BEACON staff member contributing to education and outreach activities, and then as a graduate student in the Department of Integrative Biology.&#160; He also contributed to the all-hands project.&#160; However, he switched from studying bacteria to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avida" target="_blank" rel="noopener">digital organisms</a>, and he&#8217;s now performing and analyzing experiments to quantify how the duration of history in an evolving lineage&#8217;s previous environment influences its subsequent evolution in a new environment. Stay tuned for Jay&#8217;s findings&#8212;he&#8217;s working on a huge paper. Jay is as deeply thoughtful about science and life as I imagined when I first heard his questions at the Evolution meeting.</p>
<p>I also met <a href="https://msutoday.msu.edu/360/2019/nkrumah-grant-from-ged-to-phd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nkrumah Grant</a> in 2013, when he visited MSU while exploring possible graduate programs.&#160; He immediately impressed me with his personal story of overcoming obstacles.&#160; Nkrumah explained to me his love of science as a child, and how he had gotten discouraged and derailed before undertaking a concerted effort to pursue his dream of science and scholarship.&#160; And pursue it he did &#8230; and continues to do.&#160; From a G.E.D. to a Ph.D.&#160; Co-author on the all-hands project, co-first-author on a paper <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/55414" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just published in eLife</a>, and three more papers posted to bioRxiv in the last few weeks. &#160;He also just <a href="https://twitter.com/WatersLabMSU/status/1265738605781278728" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defended his dissertation</a>, giving a beautiful public seminar followed by an engaging, collegial exam.&#160; Nkrumah has done all this and more while being a dedicated father and working tirelessly to promote equity and inclusion in science.</p>
<p>Last but not least, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ali-abdel-magid-281a63170/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ali Abdel Magid</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jalin-jordan-157362176/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jalin Jordan</a> are two of the current generation of superb undergraduate researchers in the lab. Ali is working with Nkrumah on the evolution of bacterial cell size, while Jalin works with <a href="https://www.matterwithcuriosity.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kyle Card</a> on the evolution of antibiotic resistance.&#160; Both Ali and Jalin are also working toward future careers in medicine. This summer, they are reading work that integrates evolution and medicine including the landmark book, <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/120768/why-we-get-sick-by-randolph-m-nesse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Why We Get Sick, by Nesse and Williams</a>, and the path-breaking paper by <a href="https://telliamedrevisited.wordpress.com/2013/09/03/lieberman-et-al-2011-nature-genetics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tami Lieberman et al. on the evolution of bacteria in the lungs of CF patients</a>.</p>
<p>My science is better, and my life richer, because of all these people, and many more.&#160; How much better science would be, and how much richer all of our lives would be, if we would open more doors, listen more carefully, and live, learn, and work together.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>After reading a draft of this essay, Nkrumah Grant, Joe Graves, and Jay Bundy all asked me to say more about this:&#160; How can we achieve the aspirations expressed in my closing sentence above?&#160;</p>
<p>I plan to reflect more on their vital question.&#160; In the meantime, I invite readers who have ideas to put them in the comments below.</p>
<p>EDIT: I should also acknowledge two other influences: A high-school teacher, Mrs. Clayton, who taught a Black History class that I took, and who introduced me to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Douglass" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Frederick Douglass</a>, whose <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_and_Times_of_Frederick_Douglass" target="_blank" rel="noopener">autobiography</a> I read with awe and admiration.</p>

	<h2 class="entry-title"><a href="https://telliamedrevisited.wordpress.com/2020/05/04/five-more-years/" rel="bookmark">Five More Years</a></h2>	
		<p>The E. coli long-term evolution experiment (LTEE) began in 1988, and it has run for over 32 years with only <a href="https://telliamedrevisited.wordpress.com/2017/03/13/some-wrinkles-in-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">occasional interruptions</a>. The latest interruption, of course, reflects the <a href="https://telliamedrevisited.wordpress.com/2020/03/09/we-interrupt-this-experiment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">temporary closure of my lab during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic</a>. Fortunately, one of the advantages of working with bacteria is that we can freeze population samples and later revive them, which will allow us to resume their daily propagation when it is prudent to do so.&#160; Indeed, we&#8217;ve frozen samples of all 12 populations throughout the LTEE&#8217;s history, allowing &#8220;time travel&#8221; to measure and analyze their <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/342/6164/1364" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fitness trajectories</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature18959" target="_blank" rel="noopener">genome evolution</a>, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/105/23/7899" target="_blank" rel="noopener">historical contingencies</a>, and more.</p>
<p>Even as the experiment is on ice, the lab team continues to analyze recently collected data, prepare papers that report their findings, and make plans for future work. Their analyses use data collected from the LTEE itself, as well as from various experiments spun off from the LTEE.&#160; <a href="https://msutoday.msu.edu/360/2019/nkrumah-grant-from-ged-to-phd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nkrumah Grant</a> is writing up analyses of genomic and phenotypic aspects of metabolic evolution in the LTEE populations. &#160;<a href="https://msutoday.msu.edu/feature/2019/msu-scientist-excels-while-dealing-with-syndromes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kyle Card</a> is examining genome sequences for evidence of historical contingencies that influence the evolution of antibiotic resistance. <a href="https://www.blount-lab.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zachary Blount</a> is comparing the evolution of new populations propagated in citrate-only versus citrate + glucose media. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Minako_Izutsu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minako Izutsu</a> is examining the effects of population size on the genetic targets of selection, while <a href="https://twitter.com/relenski/status/1025368221422166016" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Devin Lake</a> is performing numerical simulations to understand the effects of population size on the dynamics of adaptive evolution.&#160; So everyone remains busy and engaged in science, even with the lab temporarily closed.</p>
<p>Today, I&#8217;m excited to announce two new developments.&#160; First, the National Science Foundation (NSF) has renewed the grant that supports the LTEE for the next 5 years. This grant enables the continued propagation of the LTEE lines, the storage of frozen samples, and some core analyses of the evolving populations. The grant is funded through the NSF&#8217;s <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=13544" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Long Term Research in Environmental Biology (LTREB) Program</a>, which &#8220;supports the generation of extended time series of data to address important questions in evolutionary biology, ecology, and ecosystem science.&#8221; Thank you to the reviewers and program officers for their endorsement of our research, and to the American public and policy-makers for supporting the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NSF&#8217;s mission &#8220;to promote the progress of science</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Second, <a href="https://barricklab.org/twiki/bin/view/Lab" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jeff Barrick</a> joins me as co-PI on this grant for the next 5 years, and I expect he will be the lead PI after that period.&#160; In fact, Jeff and his team will take over the daily propagation of the LTEE populations and storage of the sample collection even before then. I&#8217;m not planning to retire during the coming grant period. Instead, this transfer of responsibility is intended to ensure that the LTEE remains in good hands for decades to come. In the meantime, Jeff&#8217;s group will conduct some analyses of the LTEE lines even before they take over the daily responsibilities, while my team will continue working on the lines after the handoff occurs.</p>
<p><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002185" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Several years ago I wrote</a>&#160;about the qualifications of scientists who would lead the LTEE into the future: &#8220;My thinking is that each successive scientist responsible for the LTEE would, ideally, be young enough that he or she could direct the project for 25 years or so, but senior enough to have been promoted and tenured based on his or her independent achievements in a relevant field (evolutionary biology, genomics, microbiology, etc.). Thus, the LTEE would continue in parallel with that person&#8217;s other research, rather than requiring his or her full effort, just like my team has conducted other research in addition to the LTEE.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jeff is an outstanding young scientist with all of these attributes. Two years ago he was promoted to Associate Professor with tenure in the Department of Molecular Biosciences at the University of Texas at Austin.&#160; He has expertise in multiple areas relevant to the LTEE including evolution, microbiology, genomics, bioinformatics, biochemistry, molecular biology, and synthetic biology. He directs a substantial team of technicians, postdocs, and graduate students, which will provide ample coverage for the daily LTEE transfers (including weekends and holidays). Last but not least, Jeff has participated in the LTEE and made many contributions to it including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Participated in propagating the LTEE lines and related activities while he was a postdoc in my lab from 2006 to 2010.</li>
<li><a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=a59MTe0AAAAJ&amp;hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Authored many papers</a> using samples from the LTEE, including almost all of them that have analyzed genome sequences as well as several recent papers examining the genetic underpinnings of the ability to use citrate that evolved in one lineage.</li>
<li>Developed the open-source <a href="https://barricklab.org/twiki/bin/view/Lab/ToolsBacterialGenomeResequencing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">breseq computational pipeline</a>&#160;for comprehensively identifying mutations that distinguish ancestral and evolved genomes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Someone might reasonably ask if the LTEE will work in the same way when it is moved to another site. The answer is yes: the environment is simple and defined, so it is readily reproduced. Indeed, I moved the LTEE from UC-Irvine to MSU many years ago, the lab has moved between buildings here at MSU, and we&#8217;ve shared strains with scientists at many other institutions, where measurements and inferences have been satisfactorily reproducible. As an additional check, Jeff&#8217;s team at UT-Austin ran a set of the competition assays that we use to measure the relative fitness of evolved and ancestral bacteria, and we compared the new data to data that we had previously obtained here at MSU. The two datasets agreed well, in line with the inherent measurement noise in assessing relative fitness. Fitness is the most integrative measure of performance of the LTEE populations, and it is potentially sensitive to subtle differences in conditions. These results provide further evidence that, when the time comes, the LTEE can continue its journey of adaptation and innovation in its new home.</p>
<p>Evolve, LTEE, evolve!</p>

		<p>The LTEE ran for over 32 years and more than 73,000 generations, without <a href="https://telliamedrevisited.wordpress.com/2017/03/13/some-wrinkles-in-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">missing a beat</a>. Then this stupid coronavirus came along and made me shut down the lab and stop the experiment. Well, I think it&#8217;s high time for everyone to return to the lab and get back to work.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve wasted a hell of a lot of time here.&#160; <a href="https://telliamedrevisited.wordpress.com/2020/03/09/we-interrupt-this-experiment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The LTEE lines were frozen on March 9th</a>.&#160; That&#8217;s 23 days ago, for crying out loud.&#160; Do you know how many generations have been lost?&#160; With 100-fold daily dilution and regrowth, that&#8217;s ~6.7 generations per day.&#160; So we&#8217;ve already lost over 150 generations. And with 12 populations that&#8217;s a net loss of more than 1,800 generations.</p>
<p>Another way of looking at it is that each population produces around half a billion new cells each day.&#160; So that&#8217;s 23 x 12 x 500,000,000 cells that went missing. You get the picture, that&#8217;s a sh*t-load (a technical term for those of us who study E. coli) of baby bacteria that never got born!</p>
<p><a href="https://telliamedrevisited.wordpress.com/2015/01/05/eppur-si-muove/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I&#8217;ve gotten in enough trouble already with a certain crowd for our claim to have observed evolution</a>. If they find out we&#8217;ve denied these adorable baby bacteria their existence, <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Lenski_affair" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there&#8217;s no telling what letters they might send me</a>.</p>
<p>Plus, speaking as a scientist, I have this premonition that something really big would have happened during those missing generations. I&#8217;ve been expecting them to evolve the ability to produce palladium from citrate. They could then use the palladium for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_fusion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cold fusion</a>, which would surely get some attention. Stupid virus!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI0x0KYChq4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Heigh-ho, heigh-ho, it&#8217;s back to work I go</a>.&#160; I sure hope you have a nice day at home.</p>

		<p>The following is a guest post written by my colleague, <a href="https://msu.edu/~pennock5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rob Pennock</a>.</p>
<p>*****</p>
<p>Do you teach a biology lab that has been disrupted by the coronavirus outbreak?&#160; If so, you may want to consider using the <a href="https://avida-ed.msu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Avida-ED</a> experimental evolution platform as a virtual replacement.</p>
 
<p>To limit the spread of the coronavirus, many colleages and universities have suspended in-person classes, and instructors have had to scramble to replace them with on-line instruction.&#160; Biology faculty who teach laboratory-based courses find it especially difficult or impossible to do their planned lab exercises.&#160; Avida-ED may provide a valuable substitute for some classes.</p>
<p>Avida-ED is an award-winning educational application developed at Michigan State University for undergraduate biology courses. It is aimed at helping students learn about evolution and the scientific method by allowing them to design and perform actual experiments to test hypotheses about evolutionary mechanisms using evolving digital organisms.&#160; Funded by the NSF, Avida-ED is the educational version of a model system used by researchers to perform evolution experiments&#8211;including many that have been published in leading scientific journals (see some examples below).&#160; Avida-ED is not a simulation, but an instantiation of the evolutionary mechanisms and process that allows for real experiments.&#160; Avida-ED produces copious data that can be analyzed within the application or exported for statistical analysis.&#160; Avida-ED has been used in classrooms across the country and around the world for over a decade.</p>
<p>Here are more reasons that Avida-ED may provide a useful, quick replacement for your lab:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avida-ED is free.</li>
<li>Avida-ED requires no special registration or configuration.</li>
<li>Avida-ED is accessible on-line and runs locally in your web browser.</li>
<li>The user-friendly interface requires little technical training to use.</li>
<li>It includes ready-to-use exercises to teach a variety of evolutionary concepts.</li>
<li>It can also be used for open-ended labs where students design and perform their own experiments.</li>
<li>It can be used to teach principles of experimental design and scientific method.</li>
</ul>
<p>See the <a href="https://avida-ed.msu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Avida-ED web site</a> for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Link to the Avida-ED application launch page.</li>
<li>Model exercises (under the Curriculum link).</li>
<li><a href="https://avida-ed.msu.edu/files/curricula/LabBook/Avida-ED_LabBook.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Avida-ED lab book</a>.</li>
<li>Quick start user manual.</li>
<li>Background information about digital evolution.</li>
<li>Articles about Avida-ED, including effectiveness studies.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Avida-ED team is working to provide instructional videos for the core exercises from train-the-trainer workshops that we have offered in previous summers, where we teach faculty how to use the software in their own classes.&#160; We can also provide instructor support materials for some exercises offline for certified instructors.&#160; A <a href="http://avida-ed-mirror1.beacon-center.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mirror&#160;of the Avida-ED site</a> is available in case the primary site goes down.</p>

		<p>Attention Earthlings: &#160;If you&#8217;re not scared by the coronavirus pandemic that is now accelerating around your planet, then you&#8217;re not paying attention. The time for action&#8212;both personal and collective&#8212;is now. </p>
<p>As Harvard epidemiologist <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-infection-outbreak-worldwide-virus-expert-warning-today-2020-03-02/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marc Lipsitch has said</a>, this pandemic is not an existential crisis for humanity&#8211;our species will survive. However, most of us have lived in a blessed time and place compared to most of humanity, one that has been largely free of deadly infections. The actions we take now&#8212;immediately&#8212;will be critical to restore that safety that we took for granted.</p>
<p>I think it is entirely possible, maybe even likely, that Europe will get hit harder by the coronavirus than China has been hit, and the US may get hit even harder than Europe.</p>
<p>I have two reasons for these scenarios:</p>
<p>1/ Epidemiology: &#160;China&#8217;s outbreak started from a single point source in Wuhan. Europe got multiple seeds from many travelers, which then started many separate transmission chains. The US, meanwhile, has gotten many independent seeds both from China and from Europe &#8230; hundreds or even thousands of smoldering embers at first, most growing unseen and uncontained to vastly larger numbers now, and still growing exponentially&#8212;roughly doubling every week. We&#8217;ve had severely limited testing, and many of those cases with few if any symptoms are especially hard to find, making it exceptionally hard to trace contacts and contain the infection with self-isolation and quarantine.</p>
<p>2/ Sociopolitical: China has deep social roots, a respect for expert knowledge, and (like it or not) rigid enforcement of rules. Europe has, at least, the respect for expert knowledge. But here in the US, we have deep social divisions, widespread skepticism of expertise (often fed by those divisions), an extremely complex political landscape with federal, state, &amp; municipal layers of government (also polarized by the social divisions), and many independent-minded people who are inclined to disregard advice and instructions&#8212;a wonderful attitude some of the time, but an exceptionally dangerous attitude during a pandemic. (I apologize for these over-generalizations; they are only intended to call attention to some of the particular challenges that we face here in the US.)</p>
<p>I certainly hope I&#8217;m wrong that the USA will be especially hard hit by COVID19. However, we must face up to the challenges&#8212;both epidemiological and sociopolitical&#8212;that the coronavirus pandemic brings to us individually and collectively. Take care everyone.</p>
<p>Attention Parents of high-school and university students who are interested in parties and/or bars, especially with many schools now closed to in-class instruction: &#160;It&#8217;s time for heart-to-heart discussions with your kids&#8212;not about &#8220;the birds and the bees&#8221; but about &#8220;the bugs and disease&#8221;&#8212;for everyone&#8217;s sake.</p>
<p>ADDED:&#160; Here&#8217;s a great image for parents to share with their high-school and college-age kids about the critical role they can play by social distancing.&#160; It was made by <a href="https://twitter.com/Sports2STEM/status/1238975448442220544" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Drazan</a>.</p>

	<h2 class="entry-title"><a href="https://telliamedrevisited.wordpress.com/2020/03/13/meetings-large-and-small/" rel="bookmark">Meetings Large and&#160;Small</a></h2>	
		<p>In this post, I will explain why it is <a href="https://telliamedrevisited.wordpress.com/2020/03/01/love-in-the-time-of-coronavirus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">important not only that we cancel large conferences</a> and other events, we should also curtail medium and even small gatherings that are non-essential.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/joshuasweitz/status/1237556232304508928" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joshua Weitz has done a great service by explaining how the probability that one or more participants in an event is infected scales with the size of the gathering</a>. In brief, even when the vast majority of people are not infected, the chance that somebody is infected goes up as the number of participants gets larger. I think most people are also now coming to grips with the rapid growth of this outbreak, which means that a meeting with relatively low risk today might be a very bad idea a month from now.</p>
<p>But does this mean that medium-sized and small events can proceed without worry? No. Let me explain why even these events should be reduced to the bare minimum that are essential. Most of my readers are fellow scientists, so what follows is cast in the language of conferences and departmental seminars&#8212;but hopefully others can relate these to similarly sized gatherings in their own lives.</p>
<p>Ok, to begin. You&#8217;re very pleased to hear that the conference you had planned to attend next month was canceled. With 10,000 attendees, and with infections doubling every week, it was clearly smart to cancel such a large conference. But your departmental research seminar is attended by only 100 people. Surely that can safely continue, right?</p>
<p>If only your department had a seminar, and if it was a one-time event, then sure, why not. However, there are 25 other departments around the country in your field of study alone, and each of the departments has planned 4 weekly talks over the coming month.&#160; Seen in that light, it&#8217;s like that large conference of 10,000 &#8212; except that its 25 x 4 = 100 events with 100 attendees each. In other words, there are 10,000 potential transmissions of the viral infection.</p>
<p>In general, as event sizes get larger (more participants), the frequency and number of those events becomes smaller.&#160; I don&#8217;t have data to back this up (maybe somebody does), but I&#8217;d bet that the number of small gatherings increases even faster than the number of participants falls off.&#160; For example, for every conference of 10,000 people, I expect there are even more than 100 meetings of 100 people.</p>
<p>Therefore, reducing non-essential gatherings of all sizes should be part of our individual and collective efforts at social distancing. It&#8217;s no fun, I know. But it&#8217;s one of the best ways we can ward off this beast of a virus, and thereby protect our colleagues, our friends and families, and our communities.</p>

The 38-year-old pop princess just went Q&amp;A in an Instagram video answering fan questions ranging from her favorite food to her top travel destination &#8211; while Britney got the thumbs-up for admitting that the humble <a href="/c/britney-spears-freebritney-answers-fans-questions-favorite-food-chili-dog-song-toxic-vacation-spots">chili dog tops her food list</a>, her 24.8 million followers were left with one unanswered question.</p>
<p>Britney, who has been repeatedly asked if she is "okay" as her own Instagram followers fear both for her mental health and her status amid her <a href="/129683/britney-spears-chained-up-album-art-linked-to-conservatorship-cr">2008-commenced conservatorship</a>, had ignored addressing the much-debated issue.

        Britney Spears/Instagram
      </span><p>Britney's video, seen below, showed her in the usual spot she's known for popping up in. That's one blank wall, and one stunning blonde in a floral crop top in front of it. "Ok, so a lot of fans have been asking me a lot of questions," Britney began, with the vibe suggesting that she'd be answering the most-asked questions. "I listened," Britney continued, speaking of the "comments" she's been reading.</p>
<p>Britney revealed that her favorite song is "Toxic" &#8211; the singer couldn't come up with her "favorite song in the whole world." Turks &amp; Caicos alongside Hawaii were revealed as Britney's favorite places to visit. The "Circus" singer also sent major props to chili dogs.</p>
</p><p class="top"><h2 class="headline">'The Most Asked Question Is Are You Okay...We're Worried'</h2><span class="image-attribution">
        Britney Spears/Instagram
      </span><p>Britney continued with the limited "favorites" list &#8211; her three wishes were for "love, happiness, and a world supply of designer clothes." It's worth noting here that the star who made <a href="https://www.eonline.com/uk/news/1064561/red-alert-britney-spears-went-to-target-80-times-last-year" target="_blank" rel="noopener">80 trips to Target</a> in 2018 and shouted out 2020 Pride in a budget Pretty Little Thing dress isn't hugely into flashing designer goods &#8211; the odd <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B1MOKuXAFUW/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$6,000 Christian Louboutin shoe</a>, aside. The comments section is where it really took off.</p>
<p>Over 730 likes were left to a reply reading: "The most asked question is if you are okay...... we are all worried..." Scroll for more.</p>
</p><p class="top"><h2 class="headline">Suggestions She 'Can't Talk', Isn't 'Allowed' To Reply To Comments</h2><span class="image-attribution">
        Britney Spears/Instagram
      </span><p>Just yesterday, Britney updated with another floral crop top snap. "May this gracious beautiful summer help us all spread our wings and fly to where our hearts truly desire," she wrote. Over 2,400 likes were left to a reply asking: "Brit are you ok???"</p>
<p>Also liked were remarks deeming the much-misunderstood songstress "not okay" &#8211; most alarming, however, were suggestions that the star whose finances and legal aspects are controlled by her father and his lawyer is, somehow, controlled and not permitted to speak.</p>
<p>"She can't talk," one fan wrote. As another stated that "most have detected that something is likely wrong," more replies came in to suggest that Britney won't be informing her fans of her "okay" status &#8211; because she just isn't permitted to.</p>

        Britney Spears/Instagram
      </span><p>Britney is not active in the comments section to her Instagram. The star who has been deemed both happy and stable and the exact opposite this year has, however, spoken for herself. In March, Britney <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/britney-spears-instagram-bullying-mean-comments-response-a9408091.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<p>&#8220;Reading all of the mean comments really hurts my feelings... and I wanted to share because you really shouldn&#8217;t be saying all of these mean things to someone you don&#8217;t even know&#8230; this goes for bullying anyone really!!!!!!&#8221;</p>
<p>#FreeBritney rages on. Likewise, the star's lack of freedom, with her conservatorship <a href="/c/britney-spears-conservatorship-cancelled-coronavirus-covid-19-court-videos-photos-quaratined">extended until at least August</a> on account of the global pandemic.</p>

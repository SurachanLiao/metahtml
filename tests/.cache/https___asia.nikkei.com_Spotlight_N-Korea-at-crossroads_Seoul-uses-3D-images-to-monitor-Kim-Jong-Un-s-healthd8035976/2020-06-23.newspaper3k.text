SEOUL -- South Korean intelligence is keeping a close watch on North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's health by analyzing 3-D images of his body, tracking his gait, posture and any other signs of health problems.

National Intelligence Service officials revealed the monitoring activity at a parliamentary audit this week.

According to the South Korean government's analysis, Kim had reached a body weight of 130 kg in 2015, up from 90 kg when he became the North's ruler in 2012 following the death of his father, Kim Jong Il.

In 2014, the younger Kim was observed to be limping, raising speculation that he was experiencing health issues. At last April's inter-Korean summit, he appeared short of breath while traveling on foot.

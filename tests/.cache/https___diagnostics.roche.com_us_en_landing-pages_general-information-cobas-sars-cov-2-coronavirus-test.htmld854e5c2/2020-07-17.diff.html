The test is designed to help determine if a patient has been exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and if the patient has developed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Roche has already started shipping the new antibody test to leading laboratories globally and will ramp up production capacity to the high double-digit millions by mid-May to serve healthcare systems in countries accepting the CE mark¹ as well as the U.S.</ins></p><ins> </ins></section></p><ins> </ins><p class="c-faqNormal__row__col js-faq-col" tabindex="0"><ins></ins></p><p><ins>What is an “antibody test” and a “serology test”? What type of sample is required?</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>An antibody test detects antibodies that an individual produces after exposure to a pathogen such as the novel coronavirus. A serology test is a diagnostic test involving blood serum—the part of a person’s blood that contains proteins other than those involved in blood clotting. Roche’s new test is both an antibody test and a serology test in that it uses blood serum to determine the presence of antibodies associated with exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. From patients, blood samples drawn by health-care professionals are required, similar in size to samples drawn for common lab tests.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="c-faqNormal__row__col js-faq-col" tabindex="0"><ins></ins></p><p><ins>Why are such tests important in dealing with the COVID-19 epidemic?</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Antibody tests such as Roche’s can assess if a person was exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The test may be used in epidemiological research to better understand the spread of the disease, and together with molecular tests, to aid in the diagnosis of suspected COVID-19 patients. If further studies confirm that antibodies confer immunity to SARS-CoV-2, and how long this immunity lasts, then this could help determine if individuals can go back into the workforce without risk of being infected and infecting others.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="c-faqNormal__row__col js-faq-col" tabindex="0"><ins></ins></p><p><ins>Are specific instruments needed to run the Roche antibody test? Are they the same instruments used with the cobas® SARS-CoV-2 Test? If not, why not?</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Roche’s antibody test is performed on a cobas e analyzer—cobas e 411, cobas e 601/602, or cobas e 801. The cobas e analyzers required for the antibody test are not the same as the cobas 6800/8800 platforms used with Roche’s molecular test for SARS-CoV-2. The technology of serology testing is different.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="c-faqNormal__row__col js-faq-col" tabindex="0"><ins></ins></p><p><ins>Where are the tests, the cobas e analyzers, and the needed consumables made?</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The Roche antibody test is being developed in Penzberg, Germany, and produced in Penzberg and Mannheim, Germany. The analyzers on which this test will run are produced in Japan. Other components, such as system consumables and reagents, originate throughout our global supply chain network.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="c-faqNormal__row__col js-faq-col" tabindex="0"><ins></ins></p><p><ins>How many tests will you have, and how will you decide where to distribute them?</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>We anticipate producing high double-digit millions of tests per month globally.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="c-faqNormal__row__col js-faq-col" tabindex="0"><ins></ins></p><p><ins>What is the installed base of cobas e analyzers in the U.S.?</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>More than 3,000 cobas e analyzers of the four models are installed in the U.S.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="c-faqNormal__row__col js-faq-col" tabindex="0"><ins></ins></p><p><ins>How many tests will be going into my lab/location/state?</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>We are committed to deliver the broadest geographic impact to areas most impacted by the virus. In alignment with the government, we will focus on ensuring laboratories in high population density areas have access and scale global production rapidly in an effort to expand broader access as quickly as possible.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="c-faqNormal__row__col js-faq-col" tabindex="0"><ins></ins></p><p><ins>Are you coordinating allocation of these tests with the Federal Government?</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>We remain in constant dialogue with the White House coronavirus task force and government agencies with regard to the allocation of tests and other issues related to the pandemic.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="c-faqNormal__row__col js-faq-col" tabindex="0"><ins></ins></p><p><ins>Will you keep producing your COVID-19 diagnostic test and support the Research Use Only (RUO) solution you announced in February?</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Yes, we have been increasing production of the cobas® SARS-CoV-2 Test, which received EUA on March 12, 2020. We also continue to support laboratories carrying out SARS-CoV-2 testing on our LightCycler® and cobas z 480 Analyzers to run the TIB Molbiol LightMix® assays.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="c-faqNormal__row__col js-faq-col" tabindex="0"><ins></ins></p><p><ins>What is the price of the Roche antibody test and how does it compare with similar tests?</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>In pandemic situations like this, cost should not be a barrier to accessing diagnostics. We are committed to delivering as many tests as possible to people who need them.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Individual labs determine the price of the tests they offer to patients.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="c-faqNormal__row__col js-faq-col" tabindex="0"><ins></ins></p><p><ins>Do you have enough supply of reagents and consumable materials to manufacture the antibody test and allow laboratories to use it in large numbers?</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>We are confident in our ability to manufacture the antibody test in large and growing numbers in the weeks ahead. When planning the ramp up of our test, we have taken a holistic view on all the different consumables and general purpose reagents that are needed to run the test.  We are in close contact with the suppliers of the system consumables and ramping up production to ensure the assumed increased demand coming from anti-SARS-CoV-2 testing can be fulfilled.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="c-faqNormal__row__col js-faq-col" tabindex="0"><ins></ins></p><p><ins>Will Roche’s test be an IgG, IgM or IgG/IgM assay?</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The Roche Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay detects high affinity antibodies, using the double antigen sandwich (DAGS) format. The Roche assay will detect IgM, IgA, or IgG antibodies if they are high affinity antibodies, which appear in the late or convalescent phase of infection. This approach offers excellent specificity, as evidenced by the 99.81% specificity across 5,272 samples, and greatly reduces the risk of false positives.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="c-faqNormal__row__col js-faq-col" tabindex="0"><ins></ins></p><p><ins>Why is Roche developing an antibody test for SARS-CoV-2?</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The primary purpose of our test is to assess exposure status to SARS-CoV-2. We evaluated multiple antigens to choose the best assay format. Our high affinity antibody assay design targets only mature antibodies, and has less probability of detecting weakly cross-reacting antibodies than an indirect assay format. Since understanding exposure to the virus is most important at this phase of the pandemic, an assay design with high specificity and low cross-reactivity is key.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="c-faqNormal__row__col js-faq-col" tabindex="0"><ins></ins></p><p><ins>What specimen type is needed for the Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay?</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>This test will run Serum, Li-heparin Plasma, K2 EDTA, and K3 EDTA.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="c-faqNormal__row__col js-faq-col" tabindex="0"><ins></ins></p><p><ins>How long does it take to get a result?</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The assay will be an 18 minute test.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="c-faqNormal__row__col js-faq-col" tabindex="0"><ins></ins></p><p><ins>What is the specificity of the test?</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Based on the measurement of a total of 5272 samples, the Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay has 99.81% specificity and shows no cross-reactivity with the common cold coronaviruses. This means it can lower the chance of false positives.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="c-faqNormal__row__col js-faq-col" tabindex="0"><ins></ins></p><p><ins>What is the clinical sensitivity?</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The assay exhibited 100% clinical sensitivity for samples collected &gt;14 days after PCR confirmation.

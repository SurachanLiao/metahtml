			This Alpha News Daily site still uses an early Microsoft FrontPage 
			web development program which is not very mobile phone friendly and 
			is no longer supported by many hosting companies, so our new site

			As a note, this prophecy study concerning Russia and Iran was first published 
			in 1999 and was then posted and linked to news reports on this site 
			... Alpha News Daily ... starting in 2002.&#160; </p>
			<p>
			It was slightly expanded and updated a couple of years ago to 
			include &#147;The Second Witness&#148; of this same prophecy from another 
			ancient source.</p>
			<p>
			It may be interesting to note that in 2010 Iran's Ayatollah Khamenei 
			referred to and quoted from this study in a major speech to the "Basij" 
			in Iran concerning his perspective (and version) of the coming 
			Apocalypse.&#160; </p>
			<p>
			We have watched this Bible Prophecy rising steadily, methodically, 
			and without interruption for a number of years.</p>
			<p>
			It now appears the time draws near ... </p>
			 
			<p>
			
			
			God has set aside&#160;two 
			whole chapters&#160;in 
			the Bible to warn all Mankind of this coming war.</p>
			 
			<p>
			GOD warns Iran (Persia), being fully directed, commanded, and 
			controlled by Russia (Magog), along with a coalition of allies 
			(including Turkey) WILL go to war and will attack and invade 
			Israel.</p>
			<p>
			In Ezekiel 38-39 the Bible warns this coming war 
			between Russia, Iran, and Israel will take place sometime&#160;AFTER&#160;Israel 
			would be re-gathered into Her land as a nation (which was fulfilled 
			on May 14, 1948).&#160; &#160;</p>
			<p>
			
			
			This 
			prophetic war has never yet taken place.&#160; &#160;</p>
			<p>
			The 
			only time in history Persia (Iran) has ever gone to war against 
			Israel was to&#160;help&#160;Israel 
			throw off the yoke of the Byzantine Empire around 614 AD.</p>
			<p>
			THE BIBLE warns the US will&#160;NOT&#160;defend 
			Israel.&#160; According to the Bible, Israel must stand alone &#133;&#160;with 
			God.&#160; For when this coming war&#160;does&#160;finally 
			start, the United States will be unwilling or unable to help 
			Israel defend herself.&#160; Even though the Bible warns the invading 
			armies will be ultimately destroyed by God, it will be a&#160;devastating&#160;war 
			for both Israel&#160;and&#160;the 
			whole world.&#160;</p>
			<p>
			Bible scholars are divided as to whether this coming 
			war is part of the prophetic battle of Armageddon or will just&#160;precede&#160;Armageddon 
			in order to prepare a path for the Antichrist (a coming World Leader 
			who will&#160;enforce&#160;a 
			Peace Plan (&#147;covenant&#148;) upon Israel) which will trigger the&#160;final&#160;prophetic 
			7-Year period of time which&#160;God&#160;has 
			set aside for Israel and the World which is sometimes called the 
			&#147;Apocalypse&#148; &#133;</p>
			<p>
			
			ALL MANKIND&#160;should be 
			sitting on the edge of their seats with white knuckles watching this 
			terrible prophecy slowly starting to unfold &#133;</p>

            After many days&#160; you will be visited.&#160;&#160;&#160;

            <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
            and gathered from many people on the mountains of Israel, </p>
            <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
			which had long been desolate&#160; 
            (this war will take place after Israel became a nation in 
			1948) </p>

            <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
            You will ascend, coming like a storm,&#160; </p>
            <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
            covering the land (of Israel) like a cloud, </p>
            <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
            you and all your troops and many peoples with you." </p>
            <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
            (Ezekiel 38:1-10)</p>
             

  <p>
  
  The Bible 
  warns Russia will also act as a GUARD (including weapons) for Iran and their 
  allies ...</p>

   

  <p>
  &#160;&#160; "Prepare yourself&#160;&#160; 
  (Russia&#160; - "Magog")</p>

  <p>
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; and be ready, </p>

  <p>
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; you&#160; 
  (Russia) </p>

  <p>
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; and all your 
  companies (allies) that are gathered about you; </p>

  <p>
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; and be a 
  GUARD for them."&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; ("Them" is Iran, 
  Turkey, and the other 
  allies listed)</p>

  <p>
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; (Ezekiel 38:7)&#160;&#160; </p>

   

  <p>
  A "guard" protects, defends, blocks threats of "international sanctions"... 
  and provides weapons, technology, intelligence, command, and control ...
  and often stays quietly hidden in the shadows until the time is 
  right.</p>

			 
			 
			<p>Ezekiel 38:11-17&#160; . . .
            </p>

					<p>&#160;&#160; that 
					thoughts will arise in your mind, </p>
					<p>&#160;&#160; and 
					you will make an evil plan: </p>
					<p>&#160;&#160; You 
					(the one who leads Russia) will say, </p>
					<p>&#160;&#145;I will go 
					up against a land of unwalled villages;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; (the cities in 
					Israel are no longer 'walled')</p>
					<p>&#160;&#160; I 
					will go to a peaceful people, who dwell safely, </p>
					<p>&#160;&#160; all 
					of them dwelling without walls, and having neither bars nor

					<p>&#160;&#160; to 
					take plunder and to take booty,&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
                    (Greed, envy, and arrogance will fuel this invasion)</p>
					<p>&#160;&#160; to

					<p>&#160;&#160; that are 
					again inhabited, (look at Israel today)</p>
					<p>&#160;&#160; 
					and against a people gathered from the nations,&#160; (this 
					will take place after 1948!)</p>
					<p>&#160;&#160; who 
					have acquired livestock and goods, </p>
					<p>&#160;&#160; who

					<p>&#160;&#160; 
					Sheba (Saudi Arabia), Dedan (Kuwait),&#160;&#160;&#160;

            <p align="justify">We are not exactly sure when this attack/invasion 
            will take place ... but, from current news headlines, it looks as

			the first time in history the world has seen the imminent 
			fulfillment of this prophecy.&#160; Add the fact Russia is fully 
			backing Iran, and Turkey is quickly turning against 
			Israel, and all 
			of these nations either are, or  soon will be, armed with nuclear weapons, you will 
			find the world may soon be facing this terrible prophetic war 
            . . . </p>
			 
			<p align="justify">It is

			<p align="justify">
            The 
            invading armies will be utterly destroyed . . . by GOD!!!</p>
			 
			 
			<p align="justify">In 
            Ezekiel 39 the Bible goes on to warn the invading armies will be utterly destroyed ... 
            by GOD!&#160; Also in Ezekiel 39 there are hints this coming war may go nuclear because Israel 
			will wait months to enter the 
            battlefield after the battle, they will "set apart men 
            regularly employed" (professionals) to bury the dead, and later 
            if a bone is spotted it is to be "marked" for the professionals to 
            bury (exactly the same procedures that are 
            now found in our military nuclear/biological/chemical "battlefield 
            cleanup" manuals today) ... the aftermath of this invasion will 
			be very, very gruesome.</p>
			 
			<p align="justify">Some 
			scholars feel it must be part of, or the beginning of "The Battle of Armageddon" 
			(because of some of the terminology used), and others believe it must happen sometime before 
            Armageddon and will set the stage for the coming "Antichrist" (who 
            will rise over 10 nations which were part of the Roman Empire) to fill the world power vacuum that will be left 
			after this coming war ...  </p>
			 
			<p align="justify">The 
            United States will be "neutralized" sometime before this attack and 
            will be unwilling or unable to help defend Israel, for the Bible 
            warns Israel must stand alone ... with God!</p>
			 
			<p align="justify">More 
            importantly, many good Bible prophecy scholars believe the strange 
            prophetic event called&#160; "The Rapture" must take place 
			sometime before God intervenes in this coming battle ... </p>

			Disaster coming for Iran ...</p>
			 
			<p align="justify">
			Another ancient Biblical name for Iran (Persia) is &#147;Elam."&#160; In 
			the book of Jeremiah, we find an additional prophecy concerning a 
			coming judgment against Iran (Elam) ... 
			 
&#160;&#160; &#147;Thus says the Lord of hosts: (Lord of Armies) 
&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;&#145;Behold, I will break the bow of Iran (Elam), 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The foremost of their might. 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Against Elam I will bring the four winds 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; From the four quarters of heaven, 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; And scatter them toward all those winds; 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; There shall be no nations  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; where the outcasts of Iran (Elam) will not go. 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; For I will cause Iran (Elam) to be dismayed before 
			their enemies 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; And before those who seek their life. 
&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;I will bring disaster upon them, 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; My fierce anger,&#146; says the Lord; 
&#160;&#160; &#160;&#145;And I will send the sword after them 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Until I have consumed them. 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; I will set My throne in Iran (Elam), 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; And will destroy from there the king and the princes,&#146; 
			says the Lord. 
&#160;&#160;&#160; &#145;But it shall come to pass in the latter days: 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; I will bring back the captives of Iran (Elam),&#146; says 
			the Lord.&#148; 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; (Jeremiah 49:35-39)

    		Please do not ignore these Bible prophecies . . .

    Many people will 
    simply yawn and ignore these Bible prophecies and the 
    headlines we are now seeing.&#160; </p>
     
    <p align="justify">
    Yet, 
  God does NOT fulfill His prophecies or prophetic warnings in secret, 
  but so all the world can see.&#160; For many years now a number of Bible prophecy 
    teachers and scholars have been warning the one piece of the puzzle missing 
    was for Turkey (a NATO ally-nation) to turn toward Russia and Iran 
    and against Israel (as this 
    prophecy predicts, and we are now seeing.)&#160; </p>
     
    <p align="justify">
    
    The world has waited over 2,500 years to see the headlines we are now 
    seeing ...</p>
     
			<p align="justify">
    This prophetic war between Iran and Israel 
  has never yet taken place ... and it is very much a part of the 
  coming "Apocalypse" and Armageddon scenario.&#160;  God has been warning and 
  preparing this generation for this coming war for well over 10 
  years ... and the headlines concerning this coming war can now be found almost 
  daily all around the world.&#160; </p>
     
    <p align="justify">
    God is trying to get our attention and to 
  draw those who are His back to Him before it is too late.&#160; With 
  open arms and with tears of joy God promises to welcome and to shelter and comfort
    ALL 
  who will come to Him before these events take place (or before their 
    earthly bodies 
  die) ... yet, the Bible warns God will not mourn, nor have  mercy, on those who reject and ignore and 
    mock His Word and His warnings. </p>

                The books of Ezekiel and

                war against Israel which will trigger an IRREVERSIBLE

                Note:&#160; The book of Enoch is an 
                ancient book (Enoch was Noah's great-grandfather), and portions of at least 10 copies of the book 
                were found among the Dead Sea Scrolls.&#160; Although the book of 
                Enoch is relatively unknown because it is in disfavor with many 
                churches today for its detailed description of angelic 
                interactions with mankind, many of the early church fathers such 
                as Justin Martyr, Tatian, Irenaeus, Bishop of Lyons, Clement of 
                Alexandria, Tertullian, Origen, Methodius of Philippi, and Ambrose of Milan 
                also accepted  the book of Enoch as Scriptural writing. 
                The ancient Ethiopian Church and the Coptic Church in Egypt have 
                always accepted it as Biblical canon.&#160; Another prophecy 
                from Enoch is found quoted directly in the book of Jude in the 
                New Testament (Jude 1:14-15).</p>

            From 
            the Wikipedia Encyclopedia&#160; -&#160; Scythia (Magog 
            in Hebrew) comprised an area in Eurasia inhabited in ancient times 
            by Iranian nomadic peoples, speaking Iranian languages and known as 
            the Scythians or Scyths. The location and extent of 
            Scythia varied over time, from the Altay Mountains region where 
            Mongolia, China, Russia, and Kazakhstan come together, across 
            southern Ukraine to the lower Danube river area, Bulgaria and 
            Georgia.&#160; The Chinese knew the

            horses and human sacrifices.&#160;&#160; Mummification techniques

            Scythia </span>(Magog in Hebrew)<span id="DocDisplay1_txtDocText">, 
            ancient region of Eurasia, extending from the Danube river on the 
            west to the borders of China on the east. The Scythians 
            flourished from the 8th to the 4th cent. BC They spoke an 
            Indo-Iranian language but had no system of writing. They were 
            nomadic conquerors and skilled horsemen. They seem to be related to 
            the Saka, another nomadic tribe that roamed the steppes of central 
            Asia at about the same time. The so-called Royal Scyths established 
            a kingdom in the E Crimea before the 9th cent. BC They seem to have 
            maintained themselves as a ruling class while others (probably 
            native inhabitants) worked the grain fields. The Scythians are 
            traditionally associated with the area between the Danube and the 
            Don, but modern excavations in the Altai Mts., particularly at the 
            site of Pazyryk, suggest that their origins were in Western Siberia 
            (Russia) before 
            they moved east into Southern Russia in the early 1st millennium BC.&#160; Scythian 
            power was maintained in the 8th cent. BC in obscure warfare with the 
            Cimmerians.  In South Russia they were 
            displaced (2nd or 1st century BC) by the related Sarmatians.</span></p>

            <p align="justify">We know 
            the descendants of Magog by their Greek designation as the Scythians 
            (depicted in their legends as descending from Scythes , the 
            youngest of the three sons of Heracles, from sleeping with a half 
            viper and half woman).&#160; The name Scythian designates a number of 
            nomadic tribes from the Russian steppes, one group of which invaded 
            the Near East in the 8th and 7th centuries B.C. After being repulsed 
            from Media, many of the later Scyths settled in the fertile area of 
            the Ukraine north of the Black Sea. Other related tribes occupied 
            the area to the east of the Caspian Sea.&#160; </p>
             
            <p align="justify">The ancient Greek historian Herodotus (5th 
            century B.C) describes them living in Scythia (i.e., the 
            territory north of the Black Sea). He describes Scythia as a square, 
            20 days journey (360 miles) on a side. It encompassed the lower 
            reaches of the Dniester, Bug, Dnieper, and Don Rivers where they 
            flow into the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov.&#160; </p>
             
            <p align="justify">The Scythian language belonged to the Iranian 
            family of the Indo-European languages.&#160; The Ossetian dialect of 
            central Caucasus appears to be a survivor.&#160; The original area in 
            which Iranian was spoken extended from the mid-Volga and the Don 
            regions to the northern Urals and beyond. From here, 
            Iranian-speaking tribes colonized Media, Parthia, Persia, Central 
            Asia, and as far as the Chinese border. </p>
             
            <p align="justify">In the 7th century B.C. the Scythians swept 
            across the area, displacing the Cimmerians from the steppes of the 
            Ukraine east of Dnieper River, who fled from them across the 
            Caucasus.&#160; It is provocative that even the name "Caucasus" appears 
            to have been derived from Gog-hasan, or "Gog's Fort."</p>

			they have done. It is freely offered to any and all who will receive 
			it.</p>
			<p>
			Jesus died rejected and alone on the Cross. The Bible, God&#146;s Word, 
			tells us that it was not the nails which were driven through His 
			hands and feet that kept Jesus on the Cross, it was His love for 
			you. He willingly and lovingly took the penalty and punishment for 
			all of your sins. Each and every one of them, regardless how big or 
			how small. Your debt, paid in full, by Him. Through God&#146;s grace, you 
			simply need to accept it and believe it. It is free to everybody. It 
			is available to everybody. But, God has given each of us the free 
			will to make our own choice. We must choose to accept it. We must 
			choose to believe it.</p>
			<p>
			If you sincerely believe Jesus (Yeshua) lovingly 
			suffered and died on the Cross for&#160;all&#160;of 
			your sins, and was buried and Resurrected on the third day and then 
			ask Him to come into your life as Lord while honestly trying to turn 
			away from all those things God says are wrong, you&#160;will&#160;go 
			to Heaven.&#160;</p>
			<p>
			With open arms and with tears of joy He will receive 
			all who will come to Him in faith and in love &#133;&#160;it&#146;s 
			God&#146;s Promise!!!</p>

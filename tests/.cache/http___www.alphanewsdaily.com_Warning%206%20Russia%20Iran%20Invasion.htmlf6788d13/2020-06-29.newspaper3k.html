			As a note, this prophecy study concerning Russia and Iran was first published 
			in 1999 and was then posted and linked to news reports on this site 
			... Alpha News Daily ... starting in 2002.&#160; </p>
			<p>
			It was slightly expanded and updated a couple of years ago to 
			include &#147;The Second Witness&#148; of this same prophecy from another 
			ancient source.</p>
			<p>
			It may be interesting to note that in 2010 Iran's Ayatollah Khamenei 
			referred to and quoted from this study in a major speech to the "Basij" 
			in Iran concerning his perspective (and version) of the coming 
			Apocalypse.&#160; </p>
			<p>
			We have watched this Bible Prophecy rising steadily, methodically, 
			and without interruption for a number of years.</p>
			<p>
			It now appears the time draws near ... </p>
			<p>&#160;</p>
			<p>
			
			<strong>
			God has set aside&#160;</strong><strong>two 
			whole chapters</strong><strong><strong>&#160;in 
			the Bible to warn all Mankind of this coming war.</strong></strong></p>
			<p>&#160;</p>
			<p>
			GOD warns Iran (Persia), being fully directed, commanded, and 
			controlled by Russia (Magog), along with a coalition of allies 
			(including Turkey) WILL go to war and <i>will</i> attack and invade 
			Israel.</p>
			<p>
			In Ezekiel 38-39 the Bible warns this coming war 
			between Russia, Iran, and Israel will take place sometime&#160;AFTER&#160;Israel 
			would be re-gathered into Her land as a nation (which was fulfilled 
			on May 14, 1948).&#160; &#160;</p>
			<p>
			
			<i>
			<b>This 
			prophetic war has never yet taken place.&#160;</b> &#160;</i></p>
			<p>
			The 
			only time in history Persia (Iran) has ever gone to war against 
			Israel was to&#160;<i>help</i>&#160;Israel 
			throw off the yoke of the Byzantine Empire around 614 AD.</p>
			<p>
			THE BIBLE warns the US will&#160;NOT&#160;defend 
			Israel.&#160; According to the Bible, Israel must stand alone &#133;&#160;with 
			God.&#160; For when this coming war&#160;<i>does&#160;</i>finally 
			start, the United States will be unwilling or unable to help 
			Israel defend herself.&#160; Even though the Bible warns the invading 
			armies will be ultimately destroyed by God, it will be a&#160;<i>devastating</i>&#160;war 
			for both Israel&#160;and&#160;the 
			whole world.&#160;</p>
			<p>
			Bible scholars are divided as to whether this coming 
			war is part of the prophetic battle of Armageddon or will just&#160;precede&#160;Armageddon 
			in order to prepare a path for the Antichrist (a coming World Leader 
			who will&#160;enforce&#160;a 
			Peace Plan (&#147;covenant&#148;) upon Israel) which will trigger the&#160;final&#160;prophetic 
			7-Year period of time which&#160;God&#160;has 
			set aside for Israel and the World which is sometimes called the 
			&#147;Apocalypse&#148; &#133;</p>
			<p>
			
			ALL MANKIND&#160;should be 
			sitting on the edge of their seats with white knuckles watching this 
			terrible prophecy slowly starting to unfold &#133;</p>

                also accepted  the book of Enoch as Scriptural writing. 
                The ancient Ethiopian Church and the Coptic Church in Egypt have

            <b>From 'Encyclopedia.com</b>&#160; -&#160;
            <b>Scythia </b>(<i>Magog</i> in Hebrew), 
            ancient region of Eurasia, extending from the Danube river on the 
            west to the borders of China on the east. The <b>Scythians</b> 
            flourished from the 8th to the 4th cent. BC They spoke an 
            Indo-Iranian language but had no system of writing. They were 
            nomadic conquerors and skilled horsemen. They seem to be related to 
            the Saka, another nomadic tribe that roamed the steppes of central 
            Asia at about the same time. The so-called Royal Scyths established 
            a kingdom in the E Crimea before the 9th cent. BC They seem to have 
            maintained themselves as a ruling class while others (probably 
            native inhabitants) worked the grain fields. The Scythians are 
            traditionally associated with the area between the Danube and the 
            Don, but modern excavations in the Altai Mts., particularly at the 
            site of Pazyryk, suggest that their origins were in Western Siberia 
            (Russia) before 
            they moved east into Southern Russia in the early 1st millennium BC.&#160; Scythian 
            power was maintained in the 8th cent. BC in obscure warfare with the 
            Cimmerians.  In South Russia they were 
            displaced (2nd or 1st century BC) by the related Sarmatians.</p>

			<span class="introtext"><p align="justify">We know 
            the descendants of Magog by their Greek designation as the Scythians 
            (depicted in their legends as descending from Scythes , the 
            youngest of the three sons of Heracles, from sleeping with a half 
            viper and half woman).&#160; The name Scythian designates a number of 
            nomadic tribes from the Russian steppes, one group of which invaded 
            the Near East in the 8th and 7th centuries B.C. After being repulsed 
            from Media, many of the later Scyths settled in the fertile area of 
            the Ukraine north of the Black Sea. Other related tribes occupied 
            the area to the east of the Caspian Sea.&#160; </p>
            <p align="justify">&#160;</p>
            <p align="justify">The ancient Greek historian Herodotus (5th 
            century B.C) describes them living in Scythia (i.e., the 
            territory north of the Black Sea). He describes Scythia as a square, 
            20 days journey (360 miles) on a side. It encompassed the lower 
            reaches of the Dniester, Bug, Dnieper, and Don Rivers where they 
            flow into the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov.&#160; </p>
            <p align="justify">&#160;</p>
            <p align="justify">The Scythian language belonged to the Iranian 
            family of the Indo-European languages.&#160; The Ossetian dialect of 
            central Caucasus appears to be a survivor.&#160; The original area in 
            which Iranian was spoken extended from the mid-Volga and the Don 
            regions to the northern Urals and beyond. From here, 
            Iranian-speaking tribes colonized <i>Media, Parthia, Persia, Central 
            Asia, </i>and as far as the Chinese border. </p>
            <p align="justify">&#160;</p>
            <p align="justify">In the 7th century B.C. the Scythians swept 
            across the area, displacing the Cimmerians from the steppes of the 
            Ukraine east of Dnieper River, who fled from them across the 
            Caucasus.&#160; It is provocative that even the name "Caucasus" appears 
            to have been derived from Gog-hasan, or "Gog's Fort."</p>

			simply need to accept it and believe it. It is free to everybody. It 
			is available to everybody. But, God has given each of us the free 
			will to make our own choice. We must choose to accept it. We must 
			choose to believe it.</p>

			If you sincerely believe Jesus (Yeshua) lovingly

			away from all those things God says are wrong, you&#160;will&#160;go

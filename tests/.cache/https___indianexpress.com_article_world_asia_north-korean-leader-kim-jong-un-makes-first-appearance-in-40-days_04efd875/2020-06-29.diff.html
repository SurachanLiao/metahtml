And it will tamp down, at least for the moment, rampant rumors of a coup and serious health problems.</p> <span class="custom-caption"> <del><img class="size-medium wp-image-2190053" src="https://indianexpress.com/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif" alt="North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un has made his first public appearance in five weeks, state media reported Tuesday, ending an absence that drove a frenzy of global speculation that something was amiss with the country's most powerful person.

The North didn’t say when the visit happened, nor did it address the leader’s health.</p> <p>The recent absence was, in part, “probably an attention-getting device and it certainly works,” Bruce Cumings, an expert on Korea at the University of Chicago, said in an email.</p> <p>“The North has been on a diplomatic offensive in Europe and elsewhere, it feels isolated and is, if we’re talking about relations with Washington. All this puts them back on the front page.”</p> <span class="custom-caption"> <del><img class="size-medium wp-image-2190054" src="https://indianexpress.com/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif" alt="People watch a TV news program showing photographs of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's first public appearance, at the Seoul Railway Station in Seoul, South Korea, Tuesday, Oct. 14, 2014.

From “Saturday Night Live” spoofs to the wild theories of journalists across the globe trying to parse his growing absence from the public eye, Kim captured nearly as many headlines as he did when he threatened to nuke his enemies last year.</p> <p>This ability to command attention by doing nothing says a lot about the North’s propaganda focus on Kim as the center of everything. Remove for 40 days the sun around which that propaganda spins and the international media, both traditional and social, exploded with curiosity.</p> <span class="custom-caption"> <del><img class="size-medium wp-image-2190056" src="https://indianexpress.com/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif" alt="FILE - In this July 27, 2013 photo, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un waves to war veterans during a mass military parade celebrating the 60th anniversary of the Korean War armistice in Pyongyang, North Korea.

(Source: AP)</span> <p>And while there was plenty of informed analysis from experts and frequent visitors to Pyongyang that said it probably wasn’t anything that serious, there seemed to be even more thinly sourced speculation.</p> <p>Kim was, by turns, reported to be suffering from gout, from diabetes, from a brain hemorrhage, from a heart ailment, from a leg injury that required surgery from a French doctor, from mental illness or, according to a head-turning British report, from a cheese addiction. There were rumors of a coup.</p> <p>The speculation was partly a result of Kim missing several high-profile events that he normally attends and his description in an official documentary last month as experiencing “discomfort.” Archive footage from August showed him overweight and limping.</p> <span class="custom-caption"> <del><img class="wp-image-2190055 size-medium" src="https://indianexpress.com/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif" alt="KIM-4"><img class="wp-image-2190055 size-medium" src="https://images.indianexpress.com/2014/10/kim-4.jpg?w=413" alt="KIM-4"> People pass by a TV news program showing North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, at a business building in Seoul, South Korea, Tuesday, Oct. 14, 2014.

(Source: AP)</span> <p>The South Korean government, however, saw no signs to indicate any major problems.</p> <p>At a South Korean parliamentary hearing Monday, Choi Yoon-hee, head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a lawmaker that whatever health problems Kim might have, they “are not severe enough to disrupt his status as the ruler of the country.”</p> <p>No unusual troop movements or other signs of a possible coup have emerged. Diplomacy at the highest level has continued: Three members of his inner circle made a surprise visit to the South, something analysts say would be impossible without the leader’s blessing. Foreign tourists and aid workers are still traveling to the North, and there have been no reports of new restrictions or warnings for diplomats.</p> <p>There’s also nothing particularly unusual about North Korean leaders laying low for extended periods. Kim’s grandfather, Kim Il Sung, and father, Kim Jong Il, both took long, unexplained breaks from work, often leading to similar rumors in Seoul and beyond of coups and sudden death. Kim Jong Un, who seems to genuinely like being at the center of things, took off without a word for three weeks in 2012.</p> <p>Part of the interest in Kim’s absence also stemmed from worries about what would happen to the country if the leader died without securing a succession.</p> <p>Kim Jong Un’s two older brothers, for whatever reasons, were deemed unfit to rule by Kim Jong Il, and little is known about Kim Jong Un’s sister.</p> <p>Kim reportedly does have a direct heir who may one day extend the Kim dynasty into a fourth generation. Probably not soon, though. She’s believed to be a toddler.</p> <p class="appstext">📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

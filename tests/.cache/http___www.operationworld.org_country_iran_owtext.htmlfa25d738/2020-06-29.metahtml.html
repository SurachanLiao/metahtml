Most have found refuge in the USA, Canada, Western Europe, Turkey, Gulf States and other lands &#150; where they can be evangelized. Western countries are making it harder for Iranians to immigrate. Pray for:</span></p><p>a) <span class="l-6-prayerchallengessubtextheadline">Diaspora churches.</span> <span class="generated-style">There are probably about 800 Persian-speaking Iranian churches and house fellowships, totalling around 200,000 people. Unity is frequently a challenge. Yet these diaspora Christians are highly active and generous regarding ministry into Iran and among other Iranians abroad; their contribution in this regard is crucial.</span></p><p>b) <span class="l-6-prayerchallengessubtextheadline">Ministries reaching out to the diaspora,</span> <span class="generated-style">providing not only evangelism tools and outreach but also church planting, discipleship and leadership training, so that Iranians living abroad will be reached and hopefully then reach other Iranians. Christian refugees fleeing from persecution are also assisted. Many diaspora Christians visit Iran and powerfully minister to their countrymen. Significant ministries include Elam Ministries, 222 Ministries, Persian World Outreach, Iran Alive Ministries and Iranian Christians International.</span></p><p><span class="l-5-prayerchallengestextheadline">Young people are particularly responsive to the gospel.</span> <span class="generated-style">With nearly two-thirds of the population under age 30, with disillusionment at an all-time high and with frustrated desires for freedom, there is a unique window of opportunity to impact this generation with the liberating good news about Jesus. Political, economic and social frustrations are often expressed in resentment against the regime and in increasing hedonism and materialism. Pray that the unmet longings of their hearts might be fulfilled as they meet Christ. Already, much of the underground church is made up of this younger generation.</span></p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For an additional 12  Challenges for Prayer see Operation World <a href="http://www.ivpress.com/operationworld">book, CD-ROM, or DVD-ROM</a>.</p></p></p><h3>More Information</h3><p>The Operation World <a href="http://www.ivpress.com/operationworld" target="_blank">book, CD-ROM, and DVD-ROM</a> provide far more information and fuel for prayer for the people of Iran.</p>  </p></div>

The posts included what was said to be a misleading video clip represented as a suspected Wuhan virus case at the coastal tourist destination of Pattaya. Each faces five years’ jail.</p><p>The center opened late last year to empower the national government to determine what is true and what is false and prosecute those it deems have spread the latter. In recent days it has gone into overdrive, churning out over a dozen items seeking to refute reports of infections, some of which <a href="https://www.antifakenewscenter.com/%e0%b8%82%e0%b9%88%e0%b8%b2%e0%b8%a7%e0%b8%9b%e0%b8%a5%e0%b8%ad%e0%b8%a1-%e0%b8%ad%e0%b8%a2%e0%b9%88%e0%b8%b2%e0%b9%81%e0%b8%8a%e0%b8%a3%e0%b9%8c-%e0%b8%8a%e0%b8%b2%e0%b8%a7%e0%b8%ad%e0%b8%b9/">strain credulity</a>.

It said that no trade or travel restrictions were needed at this time.</p><p>Northwest of Rome, Italy forced more than 6,000 tourists to stay aboard a cruise ship due to two suspected cases that later tested negative. Passengers were allowed off after several hours. Nevertheless, two cases were confirmed to be at hospitals in the capital this morning, and Italy immediately cut off all air travel to China.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="it">Sbarcati Taranto 403 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/migranti?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#migranti</a> da <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OceanViking?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#OceanViking</a></p> <p>216 uomini

She had stayed at several hotels in the city-state, including the Village Hotel Sentosa and Hotel 81 Princess in Geylang before going to Tan Tock Seng Hospital a week later where she tested positive for the virus.</p><p>The 13th confirmed case was a 73-year-old woman who arrived Jan. 21.

There are a number of wildlife markets in Indonesia, including one in Jatinegara, East Java, where vendors sell snakes and bats. Although it hasn’t been proven, epidemiologists say indicators suggest the virus leaped to humans from bats.</p><p>Animal rights coalition <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dogmeatfreeindonesia/posts/2533916733496653">Dog Meat Free Indonesia</a> this week wrote an open letter online to President Joko Widodo, calling for such markets to be closed.

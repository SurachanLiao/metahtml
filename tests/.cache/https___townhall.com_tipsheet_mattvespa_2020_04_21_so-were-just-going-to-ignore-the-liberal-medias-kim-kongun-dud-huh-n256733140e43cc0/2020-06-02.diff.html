North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un was supposedly in a dire medical situation. He might also have been dead. CNN first peddled this story, and then NBC News’ Katy Tur said that Kim was brain dead. She quickly deleted the tweet out of <a href="https://twitter.com/KatyTurNBC/status/1252419884023087106?s=20">an abundance of caution</a>. </p><p>So, what is going on? As Daily NK noted, Kim did have heart surgery on April 12, but he’s doing fine. He’s not on his death bed. And now, with this story being proven wrong, we’ll just go about our day as if nothing happened, right? </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">BREAKING: The US is monitoring intelligence that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is in grave danger after surgery, according to a US official <a href="https://t.co/WyprxoyV94">https://t.co/WyprxoyV94</a></p>— CNN International (@cnni) <a href="https://twitter.com/cnni/status/1252413501793951744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 21, 2020</a></blockquote> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en"><ins>.<a href="https://twitter.com/KatyTurNBC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@KatyTurNBC Link: https://twitter.com/KatyTurNBC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw </a> deleted this tweet <a href="https://t.co/DnHhFvZnOq">pic.twitter.com/DnHhFvZnOq Link: https://t.co/DnHhFvZnOq </a></ins></p><ins>— Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) </ins><ins><a href="https://twitter.com/DailyCaller/status/1252421986908696576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 21, 2020 Link: https://twitter.com/DailyCaller/status/1252421986908696576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw </a></ins></blockquote> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">An official from the presidential office in Seoul has said that there are no particular signs or developments within North Korea amid reports that Kim Jong Un is seriously ill after heart surgery.</p>— Laura Bicker (@BBCLBicker) <a href="https://twitter.com/BBCLBicker/status/1252433504224210945?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 21, 2020</a></blockquote><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">As a translator for Daily NK let me shed some light: Kim seems to have undergone a cardiovascular medical procedure on the 12th and is now receiving medical care at his holiday home.

This was the human centipede of journalism last night and no one seems to want to talk about this dud. Tur quoted two US officials and said this was confirmed. How did this come about? And what happened after you posted this? You can’t toss a grenade in the nursey and just walk away here. Then again, the shade of the liberal media in protecting their own has a wide reach. And no, this wasn't a dream. It happened, even though yesterday was 4/20. </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">So we're all just gonna pretend like multiple blue checks at major media outlets didn't spark massive global speculation last night that Kim Jong Un was brain dead or had croaked?</p>— JERRY DUNLEAVY (@JerryDunleavy) <a href="https://twitter.com/JerryDunleavy/status/1252633403448582150?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 21, 2020</a></blockquote><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Like was I hallucinating or did that actually happen</p>— JERRY DUNLEAVY (@JerryDunleavy) <a href="https://twitter.com/JerryDunleavy/status/1252633734186180614?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 21, 2020</a></blockquote><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">I mean I remember all the Ghana pall bearer memes so it must've been real</p>— JERRY DUNLEAVY (@JerryDunleavy) <a href="https://twitter.com/JerryDunleavy/status/1252633995084468224?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 21, 2020</a></blockquote><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Remember last night when a CNN anchor said the leader of North Korea was on life support and then MSNBC’s star anchor tweeted he’s brain dead and then she deleted and that’s not confirmed and this morning literally no one in media is asking how that kind of fuck up happened?</p>— Stephen L.

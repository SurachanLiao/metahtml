<p>So, your average muffler eliminates most of the exhaust noise by leading sound waves through sound-cancelling channels and chambers; modified and performance mufflers, on the other hand, let some of the cool sounds out.</p>

<p>If your muffler isn&#8217;t usually loud but starts to make noise, get that checked right away, as that could mean harmful fumes are leaking into your car.</p>

<div><p>Deep time is the multibillion-year time frame that scientists believe Earth has existed. Their <a href="https://www.space.com/24854-how-old-is-earth.html" rel="nofollow ugc">current estimate</a> puts our planet at 4.54 billion years old.</p>

<p>Deep time&#8217;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI7SbZx_Qiw" rel="nofollow ugc">hugeness</a>, and especially the distance between events within it, is a trip to comprehend. Cleopatra, for instance, died in 30 B.C., but she lived closer to the present day than when the Pyramids of Giza were built.</p> 

<p>If Earth&#8217;s history was represented on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8V_glRW1hA" rel="nofollow ugc">100-yard football field</a>, modern humans&#8212;so Cleopatra, the pyramids, and everyone else&#8212;show up an eighth of an inch before the end zone. Heck, the length of deep time has an error range of 50 million years&#8212;but in the grand scheme of things, that&#8217;s small. Less than two yards on the football field.</p></div>

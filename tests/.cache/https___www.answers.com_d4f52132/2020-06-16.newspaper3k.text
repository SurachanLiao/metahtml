Deep time is the multibillion-year time frame that scientists believe Earth has existed. Their current estimate puts our planet at 4.54 billion years old.

Deep time’s hugeness, and especially the distance between events within it, is a trip to comprehend. Cleopatra, for instance, died in 30 B.C., but she lived closer to the present day than when the Pyramids of Giza were built.

If Earth’s history was represented on a 100-yard football field, modern humans—so Cleopatra, the pyramids, and everyone else—show up an eighth of an inch before the end zone. Heck, the length of deep time has an error range of 50 million years—but in the grand scheme of things, that’s small. Less than two yards on the football field.

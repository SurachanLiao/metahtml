James Hoge, an engineer, hooked up the first traffic light to the trolley line's electricity in 1914, using the red and green lights that were already familiar from their use by railroads. The light was controlled by a policeman in a booth nearby, who would flip the switch between red and green. The yellow light didn't come until later; it was an invention of William Potts, a Detroit police officer.</p>

<p>Technically, there were several experiments with traffic lights before Hoge's success in Cleveland, but none of them took off like his did.</p></div></div><div class="a7 a8 a9 a17 a27"><div class="lazyload-placeholder"></div></div></div><div class="a359 a358 a349 a363 a360"><div class="a387" style="padding:24px 24px 12px 24px !important"><h6 class="a127 a352 a138"> <span>Promoted </span> in <span><a class="a127 a121 a123 a150" href="https://www.answers.com/t/grammarly">Grammarly</a></span> </h6><h2 class="a127 a353 a133" style="margin-bottom:4px;font-size:29px">Write With Confidence.</h2><h6 class="a127 a354 a138">Grammarly provides quality suggestions to ensure your writing is clear and mistake-free.

Cassandra was the daughter of the king of Troy, and the god Apollo gave her the ability of prophecy. She, however, angered the god, and he turned her gift into a curse—she could see the future, but no one would believe her. Subsequently, when she tried to warn the Trojans not to accept the mysterious giant horse left outside their gates, they didn't listen, which, of course, had disastrous consequences.</p>

<p>So Cassandra's myth is invoked in the present day whenever someone made a prediction that turned out to be correct, but no one believed them. It's also sometimes used in psychology to describe the feelings of people whose accounts of distressing events aren't believed.</p></div></div><div class="a7 a8 a9 a17 a27"><div class="lazyload-placeholder"></div></div></div><div class="a7 a293 a8 a17"><div class="a7 a8 a9 a17 a27"><div class="a7 a9 a51"><div class="a558"><div class="a300 a557 a301" style="min-height:0px"><div class="a303"><div class="a304"><div class="a278 a311 a559 a316" tabindex="0" role="button"><span class="a333">Space</span></div><div class="a278 a311 a565 a316" tabindex="0" role="button"><span class="a333">Astronauts</span></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="a343 a571 a342" tabindex="0" role="button"><svg class="a237 a341" focusable="false" viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" role="presentation"><path d="M12 8c1.1 0 2-.9 2-2s-.9-2-2-2-2 .9-2 2 .9 2 2 2zm0 2c-1.1 0-2 .9-2 2s.9 2 2 2 2-.9 2-2-.9-2-2-2zm0 6c-1.1 0-2 .9-2 2s.9 2 2 2 2-.9 2-2-.9-2-2-2z"></path></svg></div></div><h1 class="a127 a288 a132">How do astronauts use the bathroom in space<!-- -->?</h1><div class="a7 a9 a53"><div class="a347"><p>Very carefully. <a href="https://www.space.com/22597-space-poop-astronaut-toilet-explained.html" rel="nofollow ugc">Space bathroom technology</a> has come a long way over the years (there was a time when astronauts only had adhesive plastic bags as bathrooms), but it's still not exactly comfortable.

The purpose of a car muffler is to silence the car’s exhaust system—in fact, in the UK, <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/muffler" rel="nofollow ugc">they’re called silencers</a>—and most are pretty successful. The loud ones are either faulty, modified to be loud, or are something called “<a href="https://www.dragzine.com/tech-stories/exhaust/understanding-muffler-design-and-sound-absorption-strategies/" rel="nofollow ugc">performance mufflers</a>,” which are designed to increase car performance and split the gap between, well, muffled and unmuffled.</p>

<p>So, your average muffler eliminates most of the exhaust noise by leading sound waves through sound-cancelling channels and chambers; modified and performance mufflers, on the other hand, let some of the cool sounds out.</p>

<p>If your muffler isn’t usually loud but starts to make noise, get that checked right away, as that could mean harmful fumes are leaking into your car.</p>

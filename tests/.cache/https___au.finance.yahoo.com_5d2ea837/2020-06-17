The S&amp;P 500 Index swung between gains and losses for most of Wednesday on light volume before turning red late, with the energy, real estate and financial sectors leading the declines. Apple and Microsoft helped the Nasdaq Composite close positive. Infections increased from China to Brazil and Iran warned it may need a new lockdown. Texas reported a surge in hospitalizations.“The market is searching for a new catalyst,” said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. “The narrative around policy stimulus and better economic data seems to be losing its sway.”Investor optimism toward risk assets had been reflected in bets that new virus outbreaks won’t lead governments to pull back from gradually reopening businesses. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell urged Congress not to pull back too quickly on federal relief to households and small businesses put in place because of the pandemic.Meantime, Texas reported an 11% surge in virus hospitalizations, the biggest 24-hour increase since June 4. Brazil registered a record 34,918 new infections, while China is escalating containment measures in Beijing including canceling flights.The thin volume in U.S. equities on Wednesday exacerbated swings, including a drop that began around the time newspapers published summaries of John Bolton’s critical book about President Donald Trump.Elsewhere, crude oil futures declined after two sessions of gains.These are some key events coming up:Policy decisions from the Bank of England and the Swiss National Bank are due on Thursday.These are some of the main moves in markets:StocksThe S&amp;P 500 fell 0.4%.Futures on Japan’s Nikkei 225 were little changed.Hang Seng futures lost 0.2%.Futures on Australia’s S&amp;P/ASX 200 Index declined 0.6%.CurrenciesThe yen was at 109.98 per dollar.The offshore yuan held at 7.0775 per dollar.The euro bought $1.1246.BondsThe yield on 10-year Treasury yields fell one basis point to 0.74%.CommoditiesWest Texas Intermediate crude oil retreated 1.8% to $37.70 a barrel.Gold was at $1,726.89 an ounce.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.</p></div></div></div></li><li class="js-stream-content" data-reactid="67"><div class="Py(14px) Pos(r)" data-test-locator="mega" data-reactid="68"><div class="Cf" data-reactid="69"><div class="Ov(h) Pend(14%) Pend(0)--sm1024" data-reactid="70"><div class="C(#959595) Fz(11px) D(ib) Mb(6px)" data-reactid="71">Australian Associated Press</div><h3 class="Mb(5px)" data-reactid="72"><a href="/news/aap-markets-report-thursday-june-18-212805312--spt.html" class="Fw(b) Fz(18px) Lh(23px) LineClamp(2,46px) Fz(17px)--sm1024 Lh(19px)--sm1024 LineClamp(2,38px)--sm1024 mega-item-header-link Td(n) C(#0078ff):h C(#000) LineClamp(2,46px) LineClamp(2,38px)--sm1024 not-isInStreamVideoEnabled" data-reactid="73"><u class="StretchedBox" data-reactid="74"></u><!-- react-text: 75 -->AAP Markets report for Thursday, June 18<!-- /react-text --></a></h3><p class="Fz(14px) Lh(19px) Fz(13px)--sm1024 Lh(17px)--sm1024 LineClamp(3,57px) LineClamp(3,51px)--sm1024 M(0)" data-reactid="76">Movements on overseas markets.</p></div></div></div></li><li class="js-stream-content" data-reactid="77"><div class="Py(14px) Pos(r)" data-test-locator="mega" data-reactid="78"><div class="Cf" data-reactid="79"><div class="Ov(h) Pend(14%) Pend(0)--sm1024" data-reactid="80"><div class="C(#959595) Fz(11px) D(ib) Mb(6px)" data-reactid="81">Australian Associated Press</div><h3 class="Mb(5px)" data-reactid="82"><a href="/news/us-shares-flat-three-day-rally-154435978--spt.html" class="Fw(b) Fz(18px) Lh(23px) LineClamp(2,46px) Fz(17px)--sm1024 Lh(19px)--sm1024 LineClamp(2,38px)--sm1024 mega-item-header-link Td(n) C(#0078ff):h C(#000) LineClamp(2,46px) LineClamp(2,38px)--sm1024 not-isInStreamVideoEnabled" data-reactid="83"><u class="StretchedBox" data-reactid="84"></u><!-- react-text: 85 -->US stocks dip as new COVID-19 cases surge<!-- /react-text --></a></h3><p class="Fz(14px) Lh(19px) Fz(13px)--sm1024 Lh(17px)--sm1024 LineClamp(3,57px) LineClamp(3,51px)--sm1024 M(0)" data-reactid="86">US shares have closed mostly lower as investor sentiment appeared unsettled by a rise in coronavirus cases in six US states.</p></div></div></div></li><li class="js-stream-content" data-reactid="87"><div class="Py(14px) Pos(r)" data-test-locator="mega" data-reactid="88"><div class="Cf" data-reactid="89"><div class="Fl(start) Pos(r) Mt(2px) W(30%) Maw(255px)" data-reactid="90"><div class="H(0) Ov(h) Bdrs(2px)" style="padding-bottom:56%;" data-reactid="91"><img srcset="https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/qRgZh0rACMtysI6bQpXFOg--~B/Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMjM7cT04MDt3PTIyMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/2cddf52aa8646a8065cf539f20f0bbb1.cf.jpg 1x,https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/BB_ONl1hwMLGHTiJre57ag--~B/Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0yNDY7cT04MDt3PTQ0MDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/2cddf52aa8646a8065cf539f20f0bbb1.cf.jpg 2x" class=" W(100%) Trsdu(0s)!

It invests globally, including in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia.Bain joins firms like Blackstone Group Inc., Oaktree Capital Group LLC and Carlyle Group Inc. in looking to capitalize on potential opportunities created by the coronavirus pandemic that has hammered businesses.The first wave of deal flow early in the crisis included companies that needed to raise liquidity as they contended with high levels of cash burn and an erosion of enterprise value, according to Robinson. “The second wave, which will continue for a bit longer, is going to be the core restructurings for companies that are coming into issues with maturities or other liquidity problems,” he said.“I view 2020 as the great leveraging year,” he said. “Many companies are borrowing more debt or raising additional debt capital exactly when their earnings are declining.

The raise makes Square Peg Australia’s largest venture firm, with more than A$1 billion under management, it said.The fresh funds will help Square Peg back firms that are tapping the massive changes brought on by Covid-19, from increased online shopping and education, to shifts in healthcare and new work arrangements, said Square Peg co-founder and partner Paul Bassat.“In the space of two months, we have seen the equivalent of a decade’s worth of change in the take-up of online business models,” he said in the statement. “Covid-19 is a catalyst for the acceleration of long-term trends that have existed for a long time.”Bassat cited some of the companies that have thrived during the pandemic, such as U.S. software firms Slack Technologies Inc. and Zoom Video Communications Inc., and Canadian e-commerce firm Shopify Inc. Square Peg-backed Fiverr International Ltd. -– a freelance marketplace based in Israel -- has seen its share price more than triple since it listed last year.Square Peg’s raise signals investors still favor Australia’s venture capital industry despite heightened fears that investment from the nation’s A$2.73 trillion in retirement savings will slow amid the coronavirus-induced recession. Local venture firms raised almost A$4 billion in the past four years thanks to a flood of money from pension funds taking bets on early-stage companies.The fresh capital will support Square Peg’s fourth fund and to fund opportunities it’s already spotted from earlier financings. The firm has invested in tech-unicorns Canva Pty. and cross-boarder financing firm Airwallex Pty. The fund, created in 2012, is targeting companies in Australia as well as Israel and Southeast Asia.Having cash on hand allows the firm to fund investments on more favorable terms as the virus-induced market rout lowers private valuations. Previous downturns have bred unicorns including Aconex Ltd., Atlassian Corp. and Culture Amp Pty.Funds that managed to raise capital in the wake of the global financial crisis outperformed their peers by about 34% in the following five years, Tempus Partners founder and managing director Alister Coleman said.“It would be short sighted to not be giving yourself an opportunity to be capitalizing on the creativity that comes out of these periods,” Coleman said by phone.This is the first investment in Square Peg by AustralianSuper, the nation’s biggest pension fund. Hostplus has backed two other rounds.To be sure, venture firms remain cautious about their ability to raise capital as institutional investors and pension funds focus on re-balancing portfolios and chasing distressed assets in more traditional areas. It took about three years following the financial crisis for investment into Australia’s venture funds to recover, Preqin data show.“There’s going to be a slowdown in money raised by Australian institutions,” Blackbird co-founder Rick Baker, who’s currently raising A$550 million for a core and follow-on venture capital fund, said by phone last month. “If we can keep a core group of VC funds we can have a foundation to build on” when the recovery comes, he said.(Updates with cautionary outlook from penultimate paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.</p></div></div></div></li><li class="js-stream-content" data-reactid="126"><div class="Py(14px) Pos(r)" data-test-locator="mega" data-reactid="127"><div class="Cf" data-reactid="128"><div class="Ov(h) Pend(14%) Pend(0)--sm1024" data-reactid="129"><div class="C(#959595) Fz(11px) D(ib) Mb(6px)" data-reactid="130">Business Insider</div><h3 class="Mb(5px)" data-reactid="131"><a href="/news/t2-cua-patagonia-kickstarter-achieved-072437912.html" class="Fw(b) Fz(18px) Lh(23px) LineClamp(2,46px) Fz(17px)--sm1024 Lh(19px)--sm1024 LineClamp(2,38px)--sm1024 mega-item-header-link Td(n) C(#0078ff):h C(#000) LineClamp(2,46px) LineClamp(2,38px)--sm1024 not-isInStreamVideoEnabled" data-reactid="132"><u class="StretchedBox" data-reactid="133"></u><!-- react-text: 134 -->T2, CUA, Patagonia and Kickstarter have all achieved success off social good – here&#x27;s how their strategy works<!-- /react-text --></a></h3><p class="Fz(14px) Lh(19px) Fz(13px)--sm1024 Lh(17px)--sm1024 LineClamp(3,57px) LineClamp(3,51px)--sm1024 M(0)" data-reactid="135">&gt; This article is sponsored by CUA to empower community financial decision making. »In 2020, it&#x27;s becoming clear that the priorities of large businesses have shifted immensely. More than ever, businesses are making an effort to break the status-quo by using profits to foster their consumer community for the greater good, becoming leaders in their fields in the process.Here&#x27;s a look into how 5 different businesses have approached generating positive impacts for their employees, economies, communities, and the environment, integrating those goals as part of the profit-making process. * * * CUACUA (Credit Union Australia) was founded on the ethos of giving members access to fair and affordable finance while also having a say in the company’s direction.With a slew of community initiatives that have made up the foundation of their work since 1946, CUA members have the chance to participate in the governance of the company, as well as actively ask questions about their management and financial performance, putting the &quot;people&quot; at the forefront of their decision making as an entity. Currently providing banking and other financial services to more than 500,000 Aussies, CUA&#x27;s community focus extends beyond the power it gives to its members. In an Australian first collaboration with Australian Red Cross and Infoxchange, CUA has sought to connect people who are isolated with its Connected Future partnership, a digital inclusion initiative that provides essential skills to its members and communities to thrive in an online world.The credit union has also sought to create deeper social and community connections to support their most isolated members by educating and empowering them to make better financial choices.* * * T2Founded in 1996 in Fitzroy, Melbourne, aside from their immersive in-store consumer experiences, T2 is the largest tea retailer across Australia and New Zealand. Its attitude as a business is skewed towards not only providing the best product in the tea market, but also by continually innovating in attempts to increase sustainability. In 2020, the company officially sourced 72% of its tea ingredients sustainably, with the remaining 28% on track to be certified sustainably sourced by 2021. All T2 teabags are manufactured entirely from plant-based sources and, all teawares and accessories are derived from suppliers that are ethically audited by the SMETA 6.0. * * * PatagoniaPatagonia is one of the most popular outdoor apparel brands worldwide, with stores in 16 countries generating $750 million in revenue in 2017. Their dedication to community fostering has always been front-of-mind, as the company was a founding member of the Textile Exhcnage (formally known as Organic Exchange) - a nonprofit group formed in 2002 with the goal of increasing global sales of organic cotton apparel and home textile products. It was also the first brand to join the network of Bluesign system partners, which seeks out to level up consumer safety through improving the process of textile supply chains, which uses the &quot;Bluesign&quot; system to ensure its products will yield minimal impacts on people and the environment.* * * KickstarterHaving launched in 2009, Kickstarter is a leader in the crowd-funding field. Since then, 7.5 million people pledged $1.5 billion to fund creative projects.The independent company have a dedicated Trust &amp; Safety team which is dedicated to delving into concerns raised by project backers to ensure the security of their projects.* * * The Body ShopSkincare and cosmetics brands have been notoriously slow-moving in their efforts towards sustainability and cruelty-free product testing. The Body Shop, however, founded in 1976 with over 2500 stores worldwide, has been a leader in this movement. The company have a history of engaging customers in &quot;activist campaigns&quot; including &quot;Forever Against Animal Testing&quot; which influenced lawmakers and stakeholders worldwide to discuss the change in legislation around animal testing. Bringing their ethos into stores physically, The Body Shop&#x27;s recycling scheme encourages customers to return empty bottles back into the store for correct recycling methods, to reduce the companies contributions to landfill.</p></div></div></div></li><li class="js-stream-content" data-reactid="136"><div class="Py(14px) Pos(r)" data-test-locator="mega" data-reactid="137"><div class="Cf" data-reactid="138"><div class="Fl(start) Pos(r) Mt(2px) W(30%) Maw(255px)" data-reactid="139"><div class="H(0) Ov(h) Bdrs(2px)" style="padding-bottom:56%;" data-reactid="140"><img srcset="https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/paCIoRxHO3uVvc47pRifdQ--~B/Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMjM7cT04MDt3PTIyMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/fd2477094d51fd7cb47f7372c5f46112.cf.jpg 1x,https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/uNkemkSDa5BwbaTiQAzSFA--~B/Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0yNDY7cT04MDt3PTQ0MDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/fd2477094d51fd7cb47f7372c5f46112.cf.jpg 2x" class=" W(100%) Trsdu(0s)!

Futures on the notes extended the previous session’s decline, which was the most since mid-May.Analysts expect the central bank will offer some kind of reprieve to the bond market, most likely cutting the amount of funds lenders need to set aside in reserve. That could happen as soon as this month, according to a commentary published Wednesday by a state-run newspaper, which also cited the likelihood of a deposit-rate cut in the third quarter.The People’s Bank of China pumped trillions of yuan into the financial system earlier this year, driving borrowing costs to multiyear lows. While those policies encouraged lending, they also resulted in rampant arbitrage where corporates borrowed cheaply to buy high-yielding investment products, diverting money away from the real economy. It partly explains why the central bank is not rolling over some funds, stoking one of the worst sovereign bond routs in the world.Now, the concern is that tighter liquidity in the financial system will lead to higher funding costs and hurt the economic recovery, say Citigroup Inc. analysts.“The sale of the special government bonds is pressuring the already fragile market sentiment, which was hurt by a lack of PBOC easing since May,” said Becky Liu, head of China macro strategy at Standard Chartered Plc, predicting the 10-year yield will rise to just below 3% in coming weeks. “The central bank will bring forward its plan to cut reserve ratio to this or next month, with the aim of offsetting the liquidity blow.”The selloff has been fueled by fears that interbank liquidity could quickly dwindle, as China plans to issue 1 trillion yuan ($141 billion) of special government debt by the end of July to combat the impact of the global pandemic. Monday was the first time that China set a timeline for the sale, and said the notes will be auctioned in the public market. Liu said that raised concerns there will be market-wide liquidity tightness.China’s 10-year debt is the world’s third worst performer since May, following Bulgarian and Pakistani local-currency bonds. The notes have been pressured by tighter liquidity, as local authorities sold the most debt on record in May and banks have sought cash to cope with a massive funding gap this month.In that time, the central bank has been reluctant to open the spigot: it has put 840 billion yuan into the financial system with short- and medium-term loans to lenders in June, compared with a 2.7 trillion yuan liquidity hole created by maturing policy funds and interbank debt.On Wednesday, the PBOC skipped adding cash via its open-market operations, effectively withdrawing 60 billion yuan from the banking system. The yield on China’s 10-year government bonds extended an increase, rising 2 basis points to 2.88% as of 2:31 p.m. in Shanghai.Beijing has faced similar pressure recently. China’s government bonds also tumbled in October, sending the 10-year yield to a five-month high, as the PBOC disappointed traders by avoiding aggressive monetary stimulus. The central bank in early November reduced the interest rate on one-year loans to lenders.It needs to take action soon, as tighter liquidity could start to raise funding costs in the real economy and hurt growth, Citigroup strategists led by Sun Lu wrote in a note. Five-year AA-rated corporate bonds’ yield premium over sovereign notes has jumped by nearly one-third in the past three months, suggesting borrowing costs for cash-hungry smaller companies are climbing.Offering some comfort to investors, total debt issuance this month and next month may not be as significant as May if one considers both sovereign and local government bonds, according to Sun. The central and regional authorities are expected to sell as much as 1.6 trillion yuan of debt in both June and July, compared with a peak of 1.8 trillion yuan in May, she added. August’s figure is seen easing to 1.4 trillion yuan.“Liquidity will remain tight in the coming month,” said Xing Zhaopeng, a markets economist at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Shanghai. “The PBOC will likely loosen its policy at the end of this month when cash supply is the tightest.”(Updates second paragraph with latest prices for bonds, adds details on Wednesday’s open-market operations and bond yield in 10th paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.</p></div></div></div></li><li class="js-stream-content" data-reactid="149"><div class="Py(14px) Pos(r)" data-test-locator="mega" data-reactid="150"><div class="Cf" data-reactid="151"><div class="Ov(h) Pend(14%) Pend(0)--sm1024" data-reactid="152"><div class="C(#959595) Fz(11px) D(ib) Mb(6px)" data-reactid="153">Bloomberg</div><h3 class="Mb(5px)" data-reactid="154"><a href="/news/wind-giant-iberdrola-buy-infigen-063229964.html" class="Fw(b) Fz(18px) Lh(23px) LineClamp(2,46px) Fz(17px)--sm1024 Lh(19px)--sm1024 LineClamp(2,38px)--sm1024 mega-item-header-link Td(n) C(#0078ff):h C(#000) LineClamp(2,46px) LineClamp(2,38px)--sm1024 not-isInStreamVideoEnabled" data-reactid="155"><u class="StretchedBox" data-reactid="156"></u><!-- react-text: 157 -->Wind Giant Iberdrola to Buy Infigen in Australia Expansion<!-- /react-text --></a></h3><p class="Fz(14px) Lh(19px) Fz(13px)--sm1024 Lh(17px)--sm1024 LineClamp(3,57px) LineClamp(3,51px)--sm1024 M(0)" data-reactid="158">(Bloomberg) -- Spain’s Iberdrola SA, one of the world’s biggest wind power operators, has agreed to buy Australia’s Infigen Energy for A$840.6 million ($581 million), expanding its footprint in a country seen as one of the best places on the planet to develop renewables.Bilbao-based Iberdrola has more than 18 gigawatts of wind capacity in its global portfolio and has been looking to expand into the Australian market. In January, the group announced a A$500 million investment in a giant wind and solar hybrid project in South Australia in partnership with Ireland’s DP Energy.“The acquisition of Infigen is a unique opportunity for the Iberdrola group to consolidate its presence in the attractive Australian renewable energy market,” Iberdrola said in a statement. “Infigen provides an attractive platform for future growth and is consistent with Iberdrola group’s strategy to become the largest renewable energy player in the world.”Australia’s abundant sunshine, coupled with a strong wind resource, has driven a boom in renewables projects in recent years and the country now gets more than a fifth of its power from clean energy sources. However, investment levels tailed off in 2019 as an electricity grid built around now-aging coal-fired plants struggled to accommodate the new capacity, and as a government incentive program for large-scale renewables expired with no plan to replace it.The company will pay A$0.86 per Infigen stapled security, trumping an earlier A$0.80 offer from a group led by the Philippines conglomerate Ayala Corp. Infigen’s largest shareholder, TCI Funds, has entered a pre-bid agreement to sell a 20% stake to Iberdrola and the Infigen board has unanimously recommended the deal. Iberdrola’s agreement with Infigen gives it the right to match any counter-bid, so another bidder would have to offer a strong premium.Read: Wind and Sun Aplenty But Investors Wary of Australia Renewables“This looks like a strong bid from Iberdrola,” said James Nevin, analyst at RBC Capital Markets. “The Iberdrola offer represents a good price for Infigen’s shares given its current outlook.”Infigen shares ended Wednesday’s trade at A$0.88, having earlier risen as much as 9.8% to a three-year high of A$0.90.Sydney-based Infigen has one of the largest fleet of wind assets in Australia and also owns a gas peaking plant in New South Wales and a 25-megawatt big battery at Lake Bonney in South Australia. The deal is conditional on being approved by Australia’s foreign investment review board. Infigen’s financial advisers on the deal are Lazard and Goldman Sachs, while Iberdrola was advised by Nomura.(Updates with closing share price in seventh paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.</p></div></div></div></li><li class="js-stream-content" data-reactid="159"><div class="Py(14px) Pos(r)" data-test-locator="mega" data-reactid="160"><div class="Cf" data-reactid="161"><div class="Ov(h) Pend(14%) Pend(0)--sm1024" data-reactid="162"><div class="C(#959595) Fz(11px) D(ib) Mb(6px)" data-reactid="163">Business Insider</div><h3 class="Mb(5px)" data-reactid="164"><a href="/news/businesses-no-longer-taxed-using-053301259.html" class="Fw(b) Fz(18px) Lh(23px) LineClamp(2,46px) Fz(17px)--sm1024 Lh(19px)--sm1024 LineClamp(2,38px)--sm1024 mega-item-header-link Td(n) C(#0078ff):h C(#000) LineClamp(2,46px) LineClamp(2,38px)--sm1024 not-isInStreamVideoEnabled" data-reactid="165"><u class="StretchedBox" data-reactid="166"></u><!-- react-text: 167 -->Businesses will no longer be taxed for using Uber and rideshare companies in good news for business travellers<!-- /react-text --></a></h3><p class="Fz(14px) Lh(19px) Fz(13px)--sm1024 Lh(17px)--sm1024 LineClamp(3,57px) LineClamp(3,51px)--sm1024 M(0)" data-reactid="168">* The federal parliament has passed an amendent that allows rideshare companies to be exempt from the Fringe Benefits Tax (FBT).  * It puts the likes of Uber, DiDi and Ola on equal footing, at least in the eyes of the taxman, for the first time.   * It effectively makes rideshare companies a less expensive option for businesses if they choose to use them in lieu of taxis.  * Visit Business Insider Australia’s homepage for more stories.* * *The federal parliament has passed an amendment which allows rideshare companies to be exempt from the Fringe Benefits Tax (FBT) for the first time.The change to the FBT Assessment Act means tax, payable on perks offered by employers, will be scrapped on rides from the likes of Uber, DiDi, and Ola.It puts rideshare companies on equal footing with taxi companies who have long been exempt from the tax, which is applied to workplace perks like free gym memberships.As a result, businesses will be able to claim the same tax benefits as if they had used taxis instead, making it a cheaper option for business travellers.Foster said the change allows businesses to save money on employee transport and cut down on the administration involved when doing trips.&quot;Employees too will be able to claim transport costs from their employers, confident in the knowledge that their company won’t be liable for a fringe benefits tax as a result,&quot; Uber for Business Country Manager, Australia and New Zealand Georgia Foster said in a statement. &quot;The change represents an update to legislation created that did not anticipate advancements in transport options.&quot;When rideshare companies like Uber started springing up in Australia, the ATO deemed that cars used for ridesharing services are not taxis and are therefore subject to the FBT.&quot;The FBT exemption for taxi travel was originally introduced in 1995 to ensure employers were not unduly penalised for providing safe transport for employees - for example, after hours travel or travel home for sick employees,&quot; Foster said. &quot;However, at that time, ridesharing did not exist.&quot;The extension of the FBT exemption to ridesharing companies comes as Aussies start looking to go back to work, and rideshare companies begin reporting an uptick in demand.The move may just send some more business their way.</p></div></div></div></li><li class="js-stream-content" data-reactid="169"><div class="Py(14px) Pos(r)" data-test-locator="mega" data-reactid="170"><div class="Cf" data-reactid="171"><div class="Fl(start) Pos(r) Mt(2px) W(30%) Maw(255px)" data-reactid="172"><div class="H(0) Ov(h) Bdrs(2px)" style="padding-bottom:56%;" data-reactid="173"><img srcset="https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/GXnRbGydWKw.oB6Q.8l6EA--~B/Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMjM7cT04MDt3PTIyMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/7a39dfc828a01a700de18fc77c9aeedf.cf.jpg 1x,https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5TzzmboFxQusJ_S911E_hw--~B/Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0yNDY7cT04MDt3PTQ0MDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/7a39dfc828a01a700de18fc77c9aeedf.cf.jpg 2x" class=" W(100%) Trsdu(0s)!

It is not clear what started the clashes, but by the time they were finished 20 Indian soldiers were dead, along with an unknown number of Chinese casualties.The violence broke out Monday afternoon and went on until midnight on the Tibetan plateau along the freezing Galwan river, Indian officials said, asking not to be identified citing rules on speaking to the media. It’s the first time in 45 years that a military skirmish along the contested Himalayan border had turned deadly, and it signaled a sharp deterioration in ties between the two regional giants.In talks between senior military personnel to defuse a border standoff that’s been brewing for over a month, the two sides had agreed to create a buffer zone between the armies, Indian officials with knowledge of the matter said. Troops were to withdraw by a kilometer each to create an area that would separate the forces and ensure peace. Indian troops came under attack after they objected to Chinese troops’ construction of a fresh post in the buffer zone, the officials said.The Indian Army spokesman was not immediately available for a comment, while Zhang Shuili, a military spokesperson in China’s western battle zone command, said in a statement late Tuesday there were casualties on both sides, without elaborating.The uptick in tensions comes amid a rising din of nationalism stoked by both governments as the two powers jostle for regional influence. A further escalation could cast a shadow over a tripartite meeting planned with Russia this month.It’s not in either country’s interests to be locked into a bloody border conflict, said Anit Mukherjee, assistant professor in the South Asia program at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore.“This standoff -- with a loss of lives -- is a very serious development,” Mukherjee said. “In the days ahead, as the funerals of the fallen play out in public, it will lead to an emotional call for some sort of a response.”India stocks swung between gains and losses as investors weighed the consequences of a border conflict with China’s military while coronavirus infections continue to rise as the South Asian nation reopens. The S&amp;P BSE Sensex index was little changed at 33,578.22 as of 10 a.m. in Mumbai.In Washington, a senior administration official said on Tuesday the U.S. was monitoring the conflict and pointed out that President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India had discussed the border issue in a call early this month.Beijing’s WarningsAt a regular press briefing in Beijing Tuesday, China’s foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian warned India against making any unilateral movement that could complicate the situation. A statement released by India said military leaders at the border were trying to negotiate a solution.In a statement late Tuesday evening, India tried to defuse the situation and said it remained committed to peace on the border with China. The clash followed an attempt by the Chinese to alter the status quo in violation of de-escalation terms agreed to in recent talks, it added.The escalation risks upending a scheduled meeting between Indian and Chinese foreign ministers at the Russia-India-China summit on June 22 and may set back diplomatic progress made during two informal summits between President Xi Jinping and Modi, the most recent taking place last October in India.It comes as India’s longstanding differences with neighbor Pakistan continue to simmer and its relations with traditional ally Nepal significantly deteriorate, while Bangladesh is still smarting from New Delhi’s decision to adopt a religion-based citizenship law. Beijing is also under pressure as governments from the U.S. to Europe, Japan and Australia move to cut a dependence on China exposed by the pandemic, and it’s facing an international push to investigate the coronavirus, first identified in Wuhan.Leadership TestModi’s leadership will be tested as he manages the twin crises of a surging coronavirus epidemic and an economy that’s set for its first annual contraction in more than four decades this year.India and China — which together account for a population in excess of 2.7 billion, or one third of the world’s people — are no strangers to animosity, and fought a war in 1962 over their 3,488 kilometer (2,167 mile) unmarked boundary. But that was supposed to be behind them as economic and commercial realities took precedence.The challenge now is to de-escalate what is “arguably the most serious India-China border spat in years,” said Michael Kugelman, deputy director and senior associate for South Asia at the Washington-based Wilson Center. “Contrary to what Delhi has suggested, this won’t be an easy ladder to climb down.”While tensions are expected to eventually ease, they come at an especially tricky time for Modi, Kugelman said. “For an Indian government forced to confront its more powerful rival even while fighting a deadly pandemic and accompanying economic crisis, this is not what it wants to say the least.”(Updates with fresh detail in first three paragraphs, adds market detail in eigth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.</p></div></div></div></li><li class="js-stream-content" data-reactid="182"><div class="Py(14px) Pos(r)" data-test-locator="mega" data-reactid="183"><div class="Cf" data-reactid="184"><div class="Ov(h) Pend(14%) Pend(0)--sm1024" data-reactid="185"><div class="C(#959595) Fz(11px) D(ib) Mb(6px)" data-reactid="186">Reuters</div><h3 class="Mb(5px)" data-reactid="187"><a href="/news/group-86-ngos-issue-letter-050215763.html" class="Fw(b) Fz(18px) Lh(23px) LineClamp(2,46px) Fz(17px)--sm1024 Lh(19px)--sm1024 LineClamp(2,38px)--sm1024 mega-item-header-link Td(n) C(#0078ff):h C(#000) LineClamp(2,46px) LineClamp(2,38px)--sm1024 not-isInStreamVideoEnabled" data-reactid="188"><u class="StretchedBox" data-reactid="189"></u><!-- react-text: 190 -->Group of 86 NGOs issue letter calling for scrapping of planned Hong Kong security law<!-- /react-text --></a></h3><p class="Fz(14px) Lh(19px) Fz(13px)--sm1024 Lh(17px)--sm1024 LineClamp(3,57px) LineClamp(3,51px)--sm1024 M(0)" data-reactid="191">A group of 86 non-government organisations issued a joint letter on Wednesday asking Chinese authorities to scrap plans to introduce national security legislation in Hong Kong, saying it threatens basic rights and freedoms.

Queensland could also soon be added to the list.Having spent weeks working together in the newly-formed National Cabinet to coordinate Australia&#x27;s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the move did not go down well with the policy&#x27;s two major exemptions New South Wales and Victoria, which unlike others, never shut their domestic borders.&quot;None of this makes sense to me,&quot; NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian told reporters, despite New South Wales and Victoria having had far more COVID-19 cases than other states.Certainly, that hadn&#x27;t seemed to phase Queensland when it revealed this week it could create a travel bubble with New South Wales at the exclusion, again, of Victoria.Perhaps it was this isolationism, or the political scandal that has plagued his government this week, but Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews was not having it.&quot;I don&#x27;t want to be offensive to South Australians but why would you want to go there?&quot; he said, boasting the best bits of the country were in Victoria anyway.&quot;Stay-at-home, don&#x27;t get too stressed they won&#x27;t let you into Adelaide, why would you want to stay there?&quot;It&#x27;s unclear whether or not Andrews realised the kind of political firestorm his jab was about to set off.A little over an hour later, Marshall had returned fire with a video that appears to be part-SA tourism campaign, part-state political banter.https://twitter.com/marshall_steven/status/1273060024357490688The war of words emerged just days after the Prime Minister boasted of how the nation had pulled together during COVID-19, a sentiment quickly losing its shine as state premiers appear at each others&#x27; throats.It wasn&#x27;t just state leaders getting in on the fun, however.

The ATAR is used by universities to help them pick students for their courses. However, unis can also look at other criteria like a personal statement, a portfolio of work or an interview as well to guide their admission decision.Rather than looking at their ATAR, Swinburne&#x27;s early entry program will require students to finish Year 12, get a recommendation from their high school and meet minimum English requirements.The program will apply to its Bachelor of Arts, Business, Health Sciences and Design courses, with Swinburne in discussions with high schools and the Victorian Tertiary Admissions Centre (VTAC) to get the program underway. Year 12 graduates applying for standard entry into a degree, however, the ATAR will still be used.&quot;We know that students in 2020 continue to rise to the occasion and achieve exceptional results, and that completion of VCE remains of utmost importance,&quot; Swinburne University Pro-Vice-Chancellor Chris Pilgrim, said in a statement.&quot;But we also understand it has been a unique year of study for many and we want to support students to continue their studies into 2021.&quot;Swinburne joins other universities that are offering alternative entry requirements following the coronavirus pandemic. According to The Sydney Morning Herald, Macquarie University and the Australian National University will be accepting students next year based on their Year 11 results.  A &quot;narrow and flawed predictor of achievement&quot; Experts remain divided on the academic scoring system.Ian Marshmann, Honorary Principal Fellow at the Melbourne Centre for the Study of Higher Education, told Business Insider Australia via email the ATAR is based on academic achievement and particularly suited to courses with a high demand for places from Year 12 students.&quot;It has been shown over the years to be one of the most reliable predictors of success in university study,&quot; he said. &quot;It may not take full account of other non-academic achievements or individual capabilities that might be appropriate to take into account for the purposes of assessing potential to succeed within a particular course.&quot;However, others like Associate Professor Andrew Harvey, Director of the Centre for Higher Education Equity and Diversity Research at La Trobe University, described the ATAR as a &quot;narrow and flawed predictor of achievement&quot; which also &quot;distorts educational decisions.&quot;&quot;The system drives many students to choose school subjects to maximise their ATAR, and then drives most students to ‘spend’ their ATAR at university,&quot; he told Business Insider Australia via email. &quot;Students are thus often choosing school subjects and university courses that are not of most interest to them.&quot;  Are ATAR alternatives the answer? Marshman said some universities have been using entry requirements other than the ATAR for many of their courses, which can benefit students in the long term. &quot;Within the Group of Eight universities, ANU has also signalled that it will no longer rely on the ATAR as the basis for entry into its courses,&quot; he said.&quot;Relying on criteria other than the ATAR can be significantly more resource-intensive for individual universities although if the selection process is more suited to the particular course it is likely to lead to increased student success and retention levels in subsequent years.&quot; But Harvey believes many ATAR alternatives are just as flawed and could &quot;lower the academic bar&quot;.&quot;Using Year 11 marks is understandable, but can be unfair and also demotivating for Year 12 students,&quot; Harvey added. &quot;Principal [or] school recommendation schemes are often biased against under-represented students, labour intensive, and can have low predictive validity.&quot;Harvey added that interview and portfolio entry requirements &quot;are also usually biased against under-represented students&quot; as well as labour intensive, with some exceptions like the Big Picture Education program where students take on a number of internships between Year 9 and Year 12.For Harvey, the main problem is the &quot;ongoing disconnect&quot; between the school and university curriculum. He points out that La Trobe University is providing two new entry pathways in the second semester that aren&#x27;t based on an ATAR but on academic achievement.&quot;These are dual enrolment models, where students undertake both school and university-approved curriculum,&quot; Harvey said. &quot;By our data analysis, these models are better predictors of university performance than ATAR, and this aspect is critical.&quot;  Should the ATAR be scrapped completely? Marshman believes it is up to universities to decide whether or not to use the ATAR system. &quot;COVID-19 is not necessarily the determinant in decision-making around the use of ATARs,&quot; he pointed out.Harvey, on the other hand, said the ATAR is unlikely to go away completely unless most selective universities and courses are happy with an equally rigorous academic alternative.What he suggested was a way of measuring a student&#x27;s achievement beyond the ATAR and recognise their contributions to society.&quot;Many students serve their communities, care for family members, and are active citizens,&quot; he said. &quot;Universities need to reward these contributions at enrolment.&quot;</p></div></div></div></li><li class="js-stream-content" data-reactid="274"><div class="Py(14px) Pos(r)" data-test-locator="mega" data-reactid="275"><div class="Cf" data-reactid="276"><div class="Ov(h) Pend(14%) Pend(0)--sm1024" data-reactid="277"><div class="C(#959595) Fz(11px) D(ib) Mb(6px)" data-reactid="278">Reuters</div><h3 class="Mb(5px)" data-reactid="279"><a href="/news/uk-eyes-billion-pound-boost-023000014.html" class="Fw(b) Fz(18px) Lh(23px) LineClamp(2,46px) Fz(17px)--sm1024 Lh(19px)--sm1024 LineClamp(2,38px)--sm1024 mega-item-header-link Td(n) C(#0078ff):h C(#000) LineClamp(2,46px) LineClamp(2,38px)--sm1024 not-isInStreamVideoEnabled" data-reactid="280"><u class="StretchedBox" data-reactid="281"></u><!-- react-text: 282 -->UK eyes billion pound boost from Australia, New Zealand trade deals<!-- /react-text --></a></h3><p class="Fz(14px) Lh(19px) Fz(13px)--sm1024 Lh(17px)--sm1024 LineClamp(3,57px) LineClamp(3,51px)--sm1024 M(0)" data-reactid="283">Britain said its exports could increase by a billion pounds as a result of the trade deals it is seeking from Australia and New Zealand, setting out its negotiating objectives on Wednesday ahead of the start of formal talks.

equities and Treasuries and the dollar ended flat, with investors continuing to weigh an increase in coronavirus cases against optimism about stimulus measures.Futures in Japan were little changed, while contracts ticked lower in Hong Kong and Australia. The S&P 500 Index swung between gains and losses for most of Wednesday on light volume before turning red late, with the energy, real estate and financial sectors leading the declines. Apple and Microsoft helped the Nasdaq Composite close positive. Infections increased from China to Brazil and Iran warned it may need a new lockdown. Texas reported a surge in hospitalizations.“The market is searching for a new catalyst,” said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. “The narrative around policy stimulus and better economic data seems to be losing its sway.”Investor optimism toward risk assets had been reflected in bets that new virus outbreaks won’t lead governments to pull back from gradually reopening businesses. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell urged Congress not to pull back too quickly on federal relief to households and small businesses put in place because of the pandemic.Meantime, Texas reported an 11% surge in virus hospitalizations, the biggest 24-hour increase since June 4. Brazil registered a record 34,918 new infections, while China is escalating containment measures in Beijing including canceling flights.The thin volume in U.S. equities on Wednesday exacerbated swings, including a drop that began around the time newspapers published summaries of John Bolton’s critical book about President Donald Trump.Elsewhere, crude oil futures declined after two sessions of gains.These are some key events coming up:Policy decisions from the Bank of England and the Swiss National Bank are due on Thursday.These are some of the main moves in markets:StocksThe S&P 500 fell 0.4%.Futures on Japan’s Nikkei 225 were little changed.Hang Seng futures lost 0.2%.Futures on Australia’s S&P\u002FASX 200 Index declined 0.6%.CurrenciesThe yen was at 109.98 per dollar.The offshore yuan held at 7.0775 per dollar.The euro bought $1.1246.BondsThe yield on 10-year Treasury yields fell one basis point to 0.74%.CommoditiesWest Texas Intermediate crude oil retreated 1.8% to $37.70 a barrel.Gold was at $1,726.89 an ounce.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","pubtime":1592429581000,"is_eligible":true,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fau.finance.yahoo.com\u002Fnews\u002Fstock-futures-signal-muted-start-213301896.html","property":"Business","categoryLabel":"Business","title":"Stock Futures Signal Muted Start to Asia Trading: Markets Wrap","images":{"original":{"height":675,"width":1200,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002FcyjoKzlIeM8pHOBC8KnJaA--~B\u002FaD02NzU7dz0xMjAwO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen\u002Fbloomberg_markets_842\u002Faecdb0d32a45153c77a2e2d5751f2fee.cf.jpg"},"img:220x123":{"height":123,"width":220,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002F05PdMqmLt6EFRB4Fn2omsQ--~B\u002FZmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMjM7cT04MDt3PTIyMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen\u002Fbloomberg_markets_842\u002Faecdb0d32a45153c77a2e2d5751f2fee.cf.jpg"},"img:440x246":{"height":246,"width":440,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002FizbPiGw.1wOEV5IVvaaCgw--~B\u002FZmk9c3RyaW07aD0yNDY7cT04MDt3PTQ0MDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen\u002Fbloomberg_markets_842\u002Faecdb0d32a45153c77a2e2d5751f2fee.cf.jpg"}},"type":"article","link":"\u002Fnews\u002Fstock-futures-signal-muted-start-213301896.html","id":"a38715da-7a57-3dbb-857c-e51524261a15","publisher":"Bloomberg","publisher_id":"bloomberg_markets_842","off_network":false},{"i13n":{"bpos":1,"cpos":4,"cposy":7},"summary":"Movements on overseas markets.","pubtime":1592429285000,"is_eligible":true,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fau.finance.yahoo.com\u002Fnews\u002Faap-markets-report-thursday-june-18-212805312--spt.html","property":"Business","categoryLabel":"Business","title":"AAP Markets report for Thursday, June 18","type":"article","link":"\u002Fnews\u002Faap-markets-report-thursday-june-18-212805312--spt.html","id":"e6d587ac-25f2-33da-baab-d243264ca5c3","publisher":"Australian Associated Press","publisher_id":"aap.com.au","off_network":false},{"i13n":{"bpos":1,"cpos":5,"cposy":8},"summary":"US shares have closed mostly lower as investor sentiment appeared unsettled by a rise in coronavirus cases in six US states.","pubtime":1592426249000,"is_eligible":true,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fau.finance.yahoo.com\u002Fnews\u002Fus-shares-flat-three-day-rally-154435978--spt.html","property":"Business","categoryLabel":"Business","title":"US stocks dip as new COVID-19 cases surge","type":"article","link":"\u002Fnews\u002Fus-shares-flat-three-day-rally-154435978--spt.html","id":"5b93e457-0298-3eff-bdd7-79cfad5d4f43","publisher":"Australian Associated Press","publisher_id":"aap.com.au","off_network":false},{"i13n":{"bpos":1,"cpos":6,"cposy":9},"summary":"(Bloomberg) -- Bain Capital Credit has closed a new distressed debt and special situations fund, with more than $3.2 billion in commitments, according to Jeff Robinson, one of the firm’s managing directors.About 50% of that total has been invested and committed, with the majority being deployed in the last three months, Robinson said.“While we do this in all market environments, now is one of the most attractive ones we’ve seen,” Robinson said in an interview. “On the distressed side, in any 10-year period, there are maybe two great years to be a distressed investor, and we’re in the midst of those two great years.”The firm raised capital from existing and new investors for the program called Bain Capital Distressed and Special Situations Fund 2019. It invests globally, including in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia.Bain joins firms like Blackstone Group Inc., Oaktree Capital Group LLC and Carlyle Group Inc. in looking to capitalize on potential opportunities created by the coronavirus pandemic that has hammered businesses.The first wave of deal flow early in the crisis included companies that needed to raise liquidity as they contended with high levels of cash burn and an erosion of enterprise value, according to Robinson. “The second wave, which will continue for a bit longer, is going to be the core restructurings for companies that are coming into issues with maturities or other liquidity problems,” he said.“I view 2020 as the great leveraging year,” he said. “Many companies are borrowing more debt or raising additional debt capital exactly when their earnings are declining.

The raise makes Square Peg Australia’s largest venture firm, with more than A$1 billion under management, it said.The fresh funds will help Square Peg back firms that are tapping the massive changes brought on by Covid-19, from increased online shopping and education, to shifts in healthcare and new work arrangements, said Square Peg co-founder and partner Paul Bassat.“In the space of two months, we have seen the equivalent of a decade’s worth of change in the take-up of online business models,” he said in the statement. “Covid-19 is a catalyst for the acceleration of long-term trends that have existed for a long time.”Bassat cited some of the companies that have thrived during the pandemic, such as U.S. software firms Slack Technologies Inc. and Zoom Video Communications Inc., and Canadian e-commerce firm Shopify Inc. Square Peg-backed Fiverr International Ltd. -– a freelance marketplace based in Israel -- has seen its share price more than triple since it listed last year.Square Peg’s raise signals investors still favor Australia’s venture capital industry despite heightened fears that investment from the nation’s A$2.73 trillion in retirement savings will slow amid the coronavirus-induced recession. Local venture firms raised almost A$4 billion in the past four years thanks to a flood of money from pension funds taking bets on early-stage companies.The fresh capital will support Square Peg’s fourth fund and to fund opportunities it’s already spotted from earlier financings. The firm has invested in tech-unicorns Canva Pty. and cross-boarder financing firm Airwallex Pty. The fund, created in 2012, is targeting companies in Australia as well as Israel and Southeast Asia.Having cash on hand allows the firm to fund investments on more favorable terms as the virus-induced market rout lowers private valuations. Previous downturns have bred unicorns including Aconex Ltd., Atlassian Corp. and Culture Amp Pty.Funds that managed to raise capital in the wake of the global financial crisis outperformed their peers by about 34% in the following five years, Tempus Partners founder and managing director Alister Coleman said.“It would be short sighted to not be giving yourself an opportunity to be capitalizing on the creativity that comes out of these periods,” Coleman said by phone.This is the first investment in Square Peg by AustralianSuper, the nation’s biggest pension fund. Hostplus has backed two other rounds.To be sure, venture firms remain cautious about their ability to raise capital as institutional investors and pension funds focus on re-balancing portfolios and chasing distressed assets in more traditional areas. It took about three years following the financial crisis for investment into Australia’s venture funds to recover, Preqin data show.“There’s going to be a slowdown in money raised by Australian institutions,” Blackbird co-founder Rick Baker, who’s currently raising A$550 million for a core and follow-on venture capital fund, said by phone last month. “If we can keep a core group of VC funds we can have a foundation to build on” when the recovery comes, he said.(Updates with cautionary outlook from penultimate paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","pubtime":1592379933000,"is_eligible":true,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fau.finance.yahoo.com\u002Fnews\u002Faustralia-venture-fund-tops-1-210000296.html","property":"Business","categoryLabel":"Business","title":"Australia Venture Fund Tops A$1 Billion With Pension Backing","images":{"original":{"height":720,"width":1296,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002F9MDSsbzqfjS3tzJ.OAM9_Q--~B\u002FaD03MjA7dz0xMjk2O2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen\u002Fbloomberg_markets_842\u002F53dfee5c6c131d8d384591b03f174886.cf.jpg"},"img:220x123":{"height":123,"width":220,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002FL.2uU11MW0MSDFJFA2fK9g--~B\u002FZmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMjM7cT04MDt3PTIyMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen\u002Fbloomberg_markets_842\u002F53dfee5c6c131d8d384591b03f174886.cf.jpg"},"img:440x246":{"height":246,"width":440,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002FckdOuDnqqoVYc_5nVEnXvg--~B\u002FZmk9c3RyaW07aD0yNDY7cT04MDt3PTQ0MDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen\u002Fbloomberg_markets_842\u002F53dfee5c6c131d8d384591b03f174886.cf.jpg"}},"type":"article","link":"\u002Fnews\u002Faustralia-venture-fund-tops-1-210000296.html","id":"4ed098d5-09ef-3b15-ac79-7740387b61c5","publisher":"Bloomberg","publisher_id":"bloomberg_markets_842","off_network":false},{"i13n":{"bpos":1,"cpos":9,"cposy":12},"summary":"\u003E This article is sponsored by CUA to empower community financial decision making. »In 2020, it's becoming clear that the priorities of large businesses have shifted immensely. More than ever, businesses are making an effort to break the status-quo by using profits to foster their consumer community for the greater good, becoming leaders in their fields in the process.Here's a look into how 5 different businesses have approached generating positive impacts for their employees, economies, communities, and the environment, integrating those goals as part of the profit-making process. * * * CUACUA (Credit Union Australia) was founded on the ethos of giving members access to fair and affordable finance while also having a say in the company’s direction.With a slew of community initiatives that have made up the foundation of their work since 1946, CUA members have the chance to participate in the governance of the company, as well as actively ask questions about their management and financial performance, putting the \"people\" at the forefront of their decision making as an entity. Currently providing banking and other financial services to more than 500,000 Aussies, CUA's community focus extends beyond the power it gives to its members. In an Australian first collaboration with Australian Red Cross and Infoxchange, CUA has sought to connect people who are isolated with its Connected Future partnership, a digital inclusion initiative that provides essential skills to its members and communities to thrive in an online world.The credit union has also sought to create deeper social and community connections to support their most isolated members by educating and empowering them to make better financial choices.* * * T2Founded in 1996 in Fitzroy, Melbourne, aside from their immersive in-store consumer experiences, T2 is the largest tea retailer across Australia and New Zealand. Its attitude as a business is skewed towards not only providing the best product in the tea market, but also by continually innovating in attempts to increase sustainability. In 2020, the company officially sourced 72% of its tea ingredients sustainably, with the remaining 28% on track to be certified sustainably sourced by 2021. All T2 teabags are manufactured entirely from plant-based sources and, all teawares and accessories are derived from suppliers that are ethically audited by the SMETA 6.0. * * * PatagoniaPatagonia is one of the most popular outdoor apparel brands worldwide, with stores in 16 countries generating $750 million in revenue in 2017. Their dedication to community fostering has always been front-of-mind, as the company was a founding member of the Textile Exhcnage (formally known as Organic Exchange) - a nonprofit group formed in 2002 with the goal of increasing global sales of organic cotton apparel and home textile products. It was also the first brand to join the network of Bluesign system partners, which seeks out to level up consumer safety through improving the process of textile supply chains, which uses the \"Bluesign\" system to ensure its products will yield minimal impacts on people and the environment.* * * KickstarterHaving launched in 2009, Kickstarter is a leader in the crowd-funding field. Since then, 7.5 million people pledged $1.5 billion to fund creative projects.The independent company have a dedicated Trust & Safety team which is dedicated to delving into concerns raised by project backers to ensure the security of their projects.* * * The Body ShopSkincare and cosmetics brands have been notoriously slow-moving in their efforts towards sustainability and cruelty-free product testing. The Body Shop, however, founded in 1976 with over 2500 stores worldwide, has been a leader in this movement. The company have a history of engaging customers in \"activist campaigns\" including \"Forever Against Animal Testing\" which influenced lawmakers and stakeholders worldwide to discuss the change in legislation around animal testing. Bringing their ethos into stores physically, The Body Shop's recycling scheme encourages customers to return empty bottles back into the store for correct recycling methods, to reduce the companies contributions to landfill.","pubtime":1592378677000,"is_eligible":true,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fau.finance.yahoo.com\u002Fnews\u002Ft2-cua-patagonia-kickstarter-achieved-072437912.html","property":"Business","categoryLabel":"Business","title":"T2, CUA, Patagonia and Kickstarter have all achieved success off social good – here's how their strategy works","images":{"original":{"height":150,"width":200,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002FZDj9fQVpplt18ohUYUz0mQ--~B\u002FaD0xNTA7dz0yMDA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen-AU\u002Fy7.businessinsider\u002F2870bdaef77b347723fac9b862898a26.cf.jpg"}},"type":"article","link":"\u002Fnews\u002Ft2-cua-patagonia-kickstarter-achieved-072437912.html","id":"3666ae33-f87a-3a02-83cf-9660d1d32682","publisher":"Business Insider","publisher_id":"y7.businessinsider","off_network":false},{"i13n":{"bpos":1,"cpos":10,"cposy":13},"summary":"(Bloomberg) -- Investors in China’s tumbling sovereign bonds are counting on Beijing to unleash more cash into the financial system.A flood of issuance, liquidity withdrawals and returning risk appetite globally have combined to accelerate the selloff in Chinese government debt, with the yield on 10-year cash bonds hitting its highest level since February Wednesday. Futures on the notes extended the previous session’s decline, which was the most since mid-May.Analysts expect the central bank will offer some kind of reprieve to the bond market, most likely cutting the amount of funds lenders need to set aside in reserve. That could happen as soon as this month, according to a commentary published Wednesday by a state-run newspaper, which also cited the likelihood of a deposit-rate cut in the third quarter.The People’s Bank of China pumped trillions of yuan into the financial system earlier this year, driving borrowing costs to multiyear lows. While those policies encouraged lending, they also resulted in rampant arbitrage where corporates borrowed cheaply to buy high-yielding investment products, diverting money away from the real economy. It partly explains why the central bank is not rolling over some funds, stoking one of the worst sovereign bond routs in the world.Now, the concern is that tighter liquidity in the financial system will lead to higher funding costs and hurt the economic recovery, say Citigroup Inc. analysts.“The sale of the special government bonds is pressuring the already fragile market sentiment, which was hurt by a lack of PBOC easing since May,” said Becky Liu, head of China macro strategy at Standard Chartered Plc, predicting the 10-year yield will rise to just below 3% in coming weeks. “The central bank will bring forward its plan to cut reserve ratio to this or next month, with the aim of offsetting the liquidity blow.”The selloff has been fueled by fears that interbank liquidity could quickly dwindle, as China plans to issue 1 trillion yuan ($141 billion) of special government debt by the end of July to combat the impact of the global pandemic. Monday was the first time that China set a timeline for the sale, and said the notes will be auctioned in the public market. Liu said that raised concerns there will be market-wide liquidity tightness.China’s 10-year debt is the world’s third worst performer since May, following Bulgarian and Pakistani local-currency bonds. The notes have been pressured by tighter liquidity, as local authorities sold the most debt on record in May and banks have sought cash to cope with a massive funding gap this month.In that time, the central bank has been reluctant to open the spigot: it has put 840 billion yuan into the financial system with short- and medium-term loans to lenders in June, compared with a 2.7 trillion yuan liquidity hole created by maturing policy funds and interbank debt.On Wednesday, the PBOC skipped adding cash via its open-market operations, effectively withdrawing 60 billion yuan from the banking system. The yield on China’s 10-year government bonds extended an increase, rising 2 basis points to 2.88% as of 2:31 p.m. in Shanghai.Beijing has faced similar pressure recently. China’s government bonds also tumbled in October, sending the 10-year yield to a five-month high, as the PBOC disappointed traders by avoiding aggressive monetary stimulus. The central bank in early November reduced the interest rate on one-year loans to lenders.It needs to take action soon, as tighter liquidity could start to raise funding costs in the real economy and hurt growth, Citigroup strategists led by Sun Lu wrote in a note. Five-year AA-rated corporate bonds’ yield premium over sovereign notes has jumped by nearly one-third in the past three months, suggesting borrowing costs for cash-hungry smaller companies are climbing.Offering some comfort to investors, total debt issuance this month and next month may not be as significant as May if one considers both sovereign and local government bonds, according to Sun. The central and regional authorities are expected to sell as much as 1.6 trillion yuan of debt in both June and July, compared with a peak of 1.8 trillion yuan in May, she added. August’s figure is seen easing to 1.4 trillion yuan.“Liquidity will remain tight in the coming month,” said Xing Zhaopeng, a markets economist at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Shanghai. “The PBOC will likely loosen its policy at the end of this month when cash supply is the tightest.”(Updates second paragraph with latest prices for bonds, adds details on Wednesday’s open-market operations and bond yield in 10th paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","pubtime":1592376378000,"is_eligible":true,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fau.finance.yahoo.com\u002Fnews\u002Fchina-tumbling-bond-market-needs-000047028.html","property":"Business","categoryLabel":"Business","title":"China’s Tumbling Bond Market Needs a Big Liquidity Injection","images":{"original":{"height":675,"width":1200,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002FSb41C6Lu1sDIojQbaHd16Q--~B\u002FaD02NzU7dz0xMjAwO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen\u002Fbloomberg_markets_842\u002Ffd2477094d51fd7cb47f7372c5f46112.cf.jpg"},"img:220x123":{"height":123,"width":220,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002FpaCIoRxHO3uVvc47pRifdQ--~B\u002FZmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMjM7cT04MDt3PTIyMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen\u002Fbloomberg_markets_842\u002Ffd2477094d51fd7cb47f7372c5f46112.cf.jpg"},"img:440x246":{"height":246,"width":440,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002FuNkemkSDa5BwbaTiQAzSFA--~B\u002FZmk9c3RyaW07aD0yNDY7cT04MDt3PTQ0MDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen\u002Fbloomberg_markets_842\u002Ffd2477094d51fd7cb47f7372c5f46112.cf.jpg"}},"type":"article","link":"\u002Fnews\u002Fchina-tumbling-bond-market-needs-000047028.html","id":"67e56a7f-cfed-371f-b66b-129d630846aa","publisher":"Bloomberg","publisher_id":"bloomberg_markets_842","off_network":false},{"i13n":{"bpos":1,"cpos":11,"cposy":14},"summary":"(Bloomberg) -- Spain’s Iberdrola SA, one of the world’s biggest wind power operators, has agreed to buy Australia’s Infigen Energy for A$840.6 million ($581 million), expanding its footprint in a country seen as one of the best places on the planet to develop renewables.Bilbao-based Iberdrola has more than 18 gigawatts of wind capacity in its global portfolio and has been looking to expand into the Australian market. In January, the group announced a A$500 million investment in a giant wind and solar hybrid project in South Australia in partnership with Ireland’s DP Energy.“The acquisition of Infigen is a unique opportunity for the Iberdrola group to consolidate its presence in the attractive Australian renewable energy market,” Iberdrola said in a statement. “Infigen provides an attractive platform for future growth and is consistent with Iberdrola group’s strategy to become the largest renewable energy player in the world.”Australia’s abundant sunshine, coupled with a strong wind resource, has driven a boom in renewables projects in recent years and the country now gets more than a fifth of its power from clean energy sources. However, investment levels tailed off in 2019 as an electricity grid built around now-aging coal-fired plants struggled to accommodate the new capacity, and as a government incentive program for large-scale renewables expired with no plan to replace it.The company will pay A$0.86 per Infigen stapled security, trumping an earlier A$0.80 offer from a group led by the Philippines conglomerate Ayala Corp. Infigen’s largest shareholder, TCI Funds, has entered a pre-bid agreement to sell a 20% stake to Iberdrola and the Infigen board has unanimously recommended the deal. Iberdrola’s agreement with Infigen gives it the right to match any counter-bid, so another bidder would have to offer a strong premium.Read: Wind and Sun Aplenty But Investors Wary of Australia Renewables“This looks like a strong bid from Iberdrola,” said James Nevin, analyst at RBC Capital Markets. “The Iberdrola offer represents a good price for Infigen’s shares given its current outlook.”Infigen shares ended Wednesday’s trade at A$0.88, having earlier risen as much as 9.8% to a three-year high of A$0.90.Sydney-based Infigen has one of the largest fleet of wind assets in Australia and also owns a gas peaking plant in New South Wales and a 25-megawatt big battery at Lake Bonney in South Australia. The deal is conditional on being approved by Australia’s foreign investment review board. Infigen’s financial advisers on the deal are Lazard and Goldman Sachs, while Iberdrola was advised by Nomura.(Updates with closing share price in seventh paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","pubtime":1592375549000,"is_eligible":true,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fau.finance.yahoo.com\u002Fnews\u002Fwind-giant-iberdrola-buy-infigen-063229964.html","property":"Business","categoryLabel":"Business","title":"Wind Giant Iberdrola to Buy Infigen in Australia Expansion","type":"article","link":"\u002Fnews\u002Fwind-giant-iberdrola-buy-infigen-063229964.html","id":"1eef30dd-a2b7-393f-8c82-27ca36e4c74a","publisher":"Bloomberg","publisher_id":"bloomberg_markets_842","off_network":false},{"i13n":{"bpos":1,"cpos":12,"cposy":15},"summary":"* The federal parliament has passed an amendent that allows rideshare companies to be exempt from the Fringe Benefits Tax (FBT).  * It puts the likes of Uber, DiDi and Ola on equal footing, at least in the eyes of the taxman, for the first time.   * It effectively makes rideshare companies a less expensive option for businesses if they choose to use them in lieu of taxis.  * Visit Business Insider Australia’s homepage for more stories.* * *The federal parliament has passed an amendment which allows rideshare companies to be exempt from the Fringe Benefits Tax (FBT) for the first time.The change to the FBT Assessment Act means tax, payable on perks offered by employers, will be scrapped on rides from the likes of Uber, DiDi, and Ola.It puts rideshare companies on equal footing with taxi companies who have long been exempt from the tax, which is applied to workplace perks like free gym memberships.As a result, businesses will be able to claim the same tax benefits as if they had used taxis instead, making it a cheaper option for business travellers.Foster said the change allows businesses to save money on employee transport and cut down on the administration involved when doing trips.\"Employees too will be able to claim transport costs from their employers, confident in the knowledge that their company won’t be liable for a fringe benefits tax as a result,\" Uber for Business Country Manager, Australia and New Zealand Georgia Foster said in a statement. \"The change represents an update to legislation created that did not anticipate advancements in transport options.\"When rideshare companies like Uber started springing up in Australia, the ATO deemed that cars used for ridesharing services are not taxis and are therefore subject to the FBT.\"The FBT exemption for taxi travel was originally introduced in 1995 to ensure employers were not unduly penalised for providing safe transport for employees - for example, after hours travel or travel home for sick employees,\" Foster said. \"However, at that time, ridesharing did not exist.\"The extension of the FBT exemption to ridesharing companies comes as Aussies start looking to go back to work, and rideshare companies begin reporting an uptick in demand.The move may just send some more business their way.","pubtime":1592371981000,"is_eligible":true,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fau.finance.yahoo.com\u002Fnews\u002Fbusinesses-no-longer-taxed-using-053301259.html","property":"Business","categoryLabel":"Business","title":"Businesses will no longer be taxed for using Uber and rideshare companies in good news for business travellers","images":{"original":{"height":150,"width":200,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002FGqepuWNsUnHRsOTZ9BDf4Q--~B\u002FaD0xNTA7dz0yMDA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen-AU\u002Fy7.businessinsider\u002F75e685a5f0354159d3d731f088470c56.cf.jpg"}},"type":"article","link":"\u002Fnews\u002Fbusinesses-no-longer-taxed-using-053301259.html","id":"8c6d30ab-d2af-321d-b6f5-1d93c3c3a532","publisher":"Business Insider","publisher_id":"y7.businessinsider","off_network":false},{"i13n":{"bpos":1,"cpos":13,"cposy":16},"summary":"(Bloomberg) -- In near sub-zero temperatures in the thin air of 15,000 feet, Chinese and Indian soldiers attacked each other with stones, iron rods and bamboo poles wrapped in barbed wire laced with nails. It is not clear what started the clashes, but by the time they were finished 20 Indian soldiers were dead, along with an unknown number of Chinese casualties.The violence broke out Monday afternoon and went on until midnight on the Tibetan plateau along the freezing Galwan river, Indian officials said, asking not to be identified citing rules on speaking to the media. It’s the first time in 45 years that a military skirmish along the contested Himalayan border had turned deadly, and it signaled a sharp deterioration in ties between the two regional giants.In talks between senior military personnel to defuse a border standoff that’s been brewing for over a month, the two sides had agreed to create a buffer zone between the armies, Indian officials with knowledge of the matter said. Troops were to withdraw by a kilometer each to create an area that would separate the forces and ensure peace. Indian troops came under attack after they objected to Chinese troops’ construction of a fresh post in the buffer zone, the officials said.The Indian Army spokesman was not immediately available for a comment, while Zhang Shuili, a military spokesperson in China’s western battle zone command, said in a statement late Tuesday there were casualties on both sides, without elaborating.The uptick in tensions comes amid a rising din of nationalism stoked by both governments as the two powers jostle for regional influence. A further escalation could cast a shadow over a tripartite meeting planned with Russia this month.It’s not in either country’s interests to be locked into a bloody border conflict, said Anit Mukherjee, assistant professor in the South Asia program at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore.“This standoff -- with a loss of lives -- is a very serious development,” Mukherjee said. “In the days ahead, as the funerals of the fallen play out in public, it will lead to an emotional call for some sort of a response.”India stocks swung between gains and losses as investors weighed the consequences of a border conflict with China’s military while coronavirus infections continue to rise as the South Asian nation reopens. The S&P BSE Sensex index was little changed at 33,578.22 as of 10 a.m. in Mumbai.In Washington, a senior administration official said on Tuesday the U.S. was monitoring the conflict and pointed out that President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India had discussed the border issue in a call early this month.Beijing’s WarningsAt a regular press briefing in Beijing Tuesday, China’s foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian warned India against making any unilateral movement that could complicate the situation. A statement released by India said military leaders at the border were trying to negotiate a solution.In a statement late Tuesday evening, India tried to defuse the situation and said it remained committed to peace on the border with China. The clash followed an attempt by the Chinese to alter the status quo in violation of de-escalation terms agreed to in recent talks, it added.The escalation risks upending a scheduled meeting between Indian and Chinese foreign ministers at the Russia-India-China summit on June 22 and may set back diplomatic progress made during two informal summits between President Xi Jinping and Modi, the most recent taking place last October in India.It comes as India’s longstanding differences with neighbor Pakistan continue to simmer and its relations with traditional ally Nepal significantly deteriorate, while Bangladesh is still smarting from New Delhi’s decision to adopt a religion-based citizenship law. Beijing is also under pressure as governments from the U.S. to Europe, Japan and Australia move to cut a dependence on China exposed by the pandemic, and it’s facing an international push to investigate the coronavirus, first identified in Wuhan.Leadership TestModi’s leadership will be tested as he manages the twin crises of a surging coronavirus epidemic and an economy that’s set for its first annual contraction in more than four decades this year.India and China — which together account for a population in excess of 2.7 billion, or one third of the world’s people — are no strangers to animosity, and fought a war in 1962 over their 3,488 kilometer (2,167 mile) unmarked boundary. But that was supposed to be behind them as economic and commercial realities took precedence.The challenge now is to de-escalate what is “arguably the most serious India-China border spat in years,” said Michael Kugelman, deputy director and senior associate for South Asia at the Washington-based Wilson Center. “Contrary to what Delhi has suggested, this won’t be an easy ladder to climb down.”While tensions are expected to eventually ease, they come at an especially tricky time for Modi, Kugelman said. “For an Indian government forced to confront its more powerful rival even while fighting a deadly pandemic and accompanying economic crisis, this is not what it wants to say the least.”(Updates with fresh detail in first three paragraphs, adds market detail in eigth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","pubtime":1592371853000,"is_eligible":true,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fau.finance.yahoo.com\u002Fnews\u002Fchina-india-ties-tested-border-150317046.html","property":"News","categoryLabel":"News","title":"With Stones and Iron Rods, India-China Border Clash Turns Deadly","images":{"original":{"height":1333,"width":2000,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002FuTxHpgv095RXcmeNvkAU5w--~B\u002FaD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen\u002Fbloomberg_markets_842\u002F7a39dfc828a01a700de18fc77c9aeedf.cf.jpg"},"img:220x123":{"height":123,"width":220,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002FGXnRbGydWKw.oB6Q.8l6EA--~B\u002FZmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMjM7cT04MDt3PTIyMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen\u002Fbloomberg_markets_842\u002F7a39dfc828a01a700de18fc77c9aeedf.cf.jpg"},"img:440x246":{"height":246,"width":440,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002F5TzzmboFxQusJ_S911E_hw--~B\u002FZmk9c3RyaW07aD0yNDY7cT04MDt3PTQ0MDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen\u002Fbloomberg_markets_842\u002F7a39dfc828a01a700de18fc77c9aeedf.cf.jpg"}},"type":"article","link":"\u002Fnews\u002Fchina-india-ties-tested-border-150317046.html","id":"ea0e23e9-6055-33e4-9d46-4e91ecd5092c","publisher":"Bloomberg","publisher_id":"bloomberg_markets_842","off_network":false},{"i13n":{"bpos":1,"cpos":14,"cposy":17},"summary":"A group of 86 non-government organisations issued a joint letter on Wednesday asking Chinese authorities to scrap plans to introduce national security legislation in Hong Kong, saying it threatens basic rights and freedoms.

The ATAR is used by universities to help them pick students for their courses. However, unis can also look at other criteria like a personal statement, a portfolio of work or an interview as well to guide their admission decision.Rather than looking at their ATAR, Swinburne's early entry program will require students to finish Year 12, get a recommendation from their high school and meet minimum English requirements.The program will apply to its Bachelor of Arts, Business, Health Sciences and Design courses, with Swinburne in discussions with high schools and the Victorian Tertiary Admissions Centre (VTAC) to get the program underway. Year 12 graduates applying for standard entry into a degree, however, the ATAR will still be used.\"We know that students in 2020 continue to rise to the occasion and achieve exceptional results, and that completion of VCE remains of utmost importance,\" Swinburne University Pro-Vice-Chancellor Chris Pilgrim, said in a statement.\"But we also understand it has been a unique year of study for many and we want to support students to continue their studies into 2021.\"Swinburne joins other universities that are offering alternative entry requirements following the coronavirus pandemic. According to The Sydney Morning Herald, Macquarie University and the Australian National University will be accepting students next year based on their Year 11 results.  A \"narrow and flawed predictor of achievement\" Experts remain divided on the academic scoring system.Ian Marshmann, Honorary Principal Fellow at the Melbourne Centre for the Study of Higher Education, told Business Insider Australia via email the ATAR is based on academic achievement and particularly suited to courses with a high demand for places from Year 12 students.\"It has been shown over the years to be one of the most reliable predictors of success in university study,\" he said. \"It may not take full account of other non-academic achievements or individual capabilities that might be appropriate to take into account for the purposes of assessing potential to succeed within a particular course.\"However, others like Associate Professor Andrew Harvey, Director of the Centre for Higher Education Equity and Diversity Research at La Trobe University, described the ATAR as a \"narrow and flawed predictor of achievement\" which also \"distorts educational decisions.\"\"The system drives many students to choose school subjects to maximise their ATAR, and then drives most students to ‘spend’ their ATAR at university,\" he told Business Insider Australia via email. \"Students are thus often choosing school subjects and university courses that are not of most interest to them.\"  Are ATAR alternatives the answer? Marshman said some universities have been using entry requirements other than the ATAR for many of their courses, which can benefit students in the long term. \"Within the Group of Eight universities, ANU has also signalled that it will no longer rely on the ATAR as the basis for entry into its courses,\" he said.\"Relying on criteria other than the ATAR can be significantly more resource-intensive for individual universities although if the selection process is more suited to the particular course it is likely to lead to increased student success and retention levels in subsequent years.\" But Harvey believes many ATAR alternatives are just as flawed and could \"lower the academic bar\".\"Using Year 11 marks is understandable, but can be unfair and also demotivating for Year 12 students,\" Harvey added. \"Principal [or] school recommendation schemes are often biased against under-represented students, labour intensive, and can have low predictive validity.\"Harvey added that interview and portfolio entry requirements \"are also usually biased against under-represented students\" as well as labour intensive, with some exceptions like the Big Picture Education program where students take on a number of internships between Year 9 and Year 12.For Harvey, the main problem is the \"ongoing disconnect\" between the school and university curriculum. He points out that La Trobe University is providing two new entry pathways in the second semester that aren't based on an ATAR but on academic achievement.\"These are dual enrolment models, where students undertake both school and university-approved curriculum,\" Harvey said. \"By our data analysis, these models are better predictors of university performance than ATAR, and this aspect is critical.\"  Should the ATAR be scrapped completely? Marshman believes it is up to universities to decide whether or not to use the ATAR system. \"COVID-19 is not necessarily the determinant in decision-making around the use of ATARs,\" he pointed out.Harvey, on the other hand, said the ATAR is unlikely to go away completely unless most selective universities and courses are happy with an equally rigorous academic alternative.What he suggested was a way of measuring a student's achievement beyond the ATAR and recognise their contributions to society.\"Many students serve their communities, care for family members, and are active citizens,\" he said. \"Universities need to reward these contributions at enrolment.\"","pubtime":1592362555000,"is_eligible":true,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fau.finance.yahoo.com\u002Fnews\u002Faustralian-unis-ditching-atar-requirement-025555664.html","property":"News","categoryLabel":"News","title":"Swinburne University is ditching the ATAR requirement for 2021, but experts are torn over the 'narrow and flawed predictor' of success","images":{"original":{"height":150,"width":200,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002FHBEuAen2Ivjqp0WS.LOieQ--~B\u002FaD0xNTA7dz0yMDA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen-AU\u002Fy7.businessinsider\u002Fabcc3b70e8e862abea4e8094ae767fb7.cf.jpg"}},"type":"article","link":"\u002Fnews\u002Faustralian-unis-ditching-atar-requirement-025555664.html","id":"78b9113e-49bb-3852-9b04-8752e7522e5e","publisher":"Business Insider","publisher_id":"y7.businessinsider","off_network":false},{"i13n":{"bpos":1,"cpos":22,"cposy":25},"summary":"Britain said its exports could increase by a billion pounds as a result of the trade deals it is seeking from Australia and New Zealand, setting out its negotiating objectives on Wednesday ahead of the start of formal talks.

Morningstar categories help investors and investment professionals make meaningful comparisons between funds. The categories make it easier to build well-diversified portfolios, assess potential risk and identify top-performing funds. We place funds in a given category based on their portfolio statistics and compositions over the past three years. If the fund is new and has no portfolio history, we estimate where it will fall before giving it a more permanent category assignment. Where necessary, we may change a category assignment based on recent changes to the portfolio.","MORNINGSTAR_CATEGORY":"Morningstar category","MORNINGSTAR_STYLE_BOX_DESC":"Yahoo partners with Morningstar, a leading market research and investment data group to help investors rate and compare funds on Yahoo Finance.

The Nasdaq Composite headed for its seventh straight advance in the longest rally of the year. The S&amp;P 500 turned higer in afternoon trading, though lagged behind as an increase in coronavirus cases led to some renewed temporary shutdowns in the U.S. The index rallied almost 2% last week.“There’s absolutely a big tug-of-war going on right now,” JJ Kinahan, the chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade, said by phone. “Everyone is trying to figure out who is going to be the winners and losers when things get quote-unquote back to normal. That to me shows that everybody is trying to figure out which way to go.”Gold neared a seven-year high, while the dollar weakened. European stocks slumped, with Wirecard AG in free-fall after more than $2 billion in assets went missing. The yield on Germany’s 30-year government debt fell below zero for the first time since May. Crude oil hovered below $40 a barrel in New York.There are increasing signs that the virus is continuing to rapidly spread as governments work to reopen their economies. Cases of the deadly virus rose by a record for a single day on June 21, according to the World Health Organization, with flare ups across the U.S. and new scares in Germany and Australia.But investors are wagering that policymakers will be unwilling to stop business activity or slow progress toward a economic recovery. In the U.K., Prime Minister Boris Johnson is preparing to relax social distancing rules in a major boost to the hospitality industry.At the same time, risk appetite is being supported by historic stimulus programs by central banks around the world. Equity markets have steadied in recent weeks and the S&amp;P 500 is within 10% of its pre-pandemic peak.“The market doesn’t believe that we will see such draconian lockdowns even if there is a resurgence of the virus. The politics have moved on,” said James Athey, a money manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments. “Rightly or wrongly, there’s also a pretty widespread feeling that riskier assets won’t go down too far because the Federal Reserve won’t let them.”In Turkey, the benchmark equities index erased its 2020 losses, lifted in a rally driven mostly by a wave of buying from local investors.Here are some key events coming up:MSCI Inc. on Tuesday announces its market classification review for 2020.The IMF will release new 2020 growth projections on Wednesday.U.S. jobless claims, durable goods and GDP data are due Thursday.A rebalance of Russell indexes is due on Friday.These are the main moves in markets:For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.</p></div></div></div></li><li class="js-stream-content" data-reactid="132"><div class="Py(14px) Pos(r)" data-test-locator="mega" data-reactid="133"><div class="Cf" data-reactid="134"><div class="Ov(h) Pend(14%) Pend(0)--sm1024" data-reactid="135"><div class="C(#959595) Fz(11px) D(ib) Mb(6px)" data-reactid="136">Australian Associated Press</div><h3 class="Mb(5px)" data-reactid="137"><a href="/news/wall-st-treads-water-virus-cases-rise-144641427--spt.html" class="Fw(b) Fz(18px) Lh(23px) LineClamp(2,46px) Fz(17px)--sm1024 Lh(19px)--sm1024 LineClamp(2,38px)--sm1024 mega-item-header-link Td(n) C(#0078ff):h C(#000) LineClamp(2,46px) LineClamp(2,38px)--sm1024 not-isInStreamVideoEnabled" data-reactid="138"><u class="StretchedBox" data-reactid="139"></u><!-- react-text: 140 -->Wall St treads water as virus cases rise<!-- /react-text --></a></h3><p class="Fz(14px) Lh(19px) Fz(13px)--sm1024 Lh(17px)--sm1024 LineClamp(3,57px) LineClamp(3,51px)--sm1024 M(0)" data-reactid="141">US stocks have opened flat as investors weigh up a spike in new coronavirus cases with hopes for a recovery driven by economic stimulus measures.</p></div></div></div></li><li class="js-stream-content" data-reactid="142"><div class="Py(14px) Pos(r)" data-test-locator="mega" data-reactid="143"><div class="Cf" data-reactid="144"><div class="Ov(h) Pend(14%) Pend(0)--sm1024" data-reactid="145"><div class="C(#959595) Fz(11px) D(ib) Mb(6px)" data-reactid="146">Reuters</div><h3 class="Mb(5px)" data-reactid="147"><a href="/news/global-coronavirus-cases-top-9-144119163.html" class="Fw(b) Fz(18px) Lh(23px) LineClamp(2,46px) Fz(17px)--sm1024 Lh(19px)--sm1024 LineClamp(2,38px)--sm1024 mega-item-header-link Td(n) C(#0078ff):h C(#000) LineClamp(2,46px) LineClamp(2,38px)--sm1024 not-isInStreamVideoEnabled" data-reactid="148"><u class="StretchedBox" data-reactid="149"></u><!-- react-text: 150 -->Global coronavirus cases top 9 million as outbreak surges in Brazil, India<!-- /react-text --></a></h3><p class="Fz(14px) Lh(19px) Fz(13px)--sm1024 Lh(17px)--sm1024 LineClamp(3,57px) LineClamp(3,51px)--sm1024 M(0)" data-reactid="151">Global cases of the novel coronavirus surpassed 9 million on Monday, as Brazil and India grappled with a surge in infections, and the United States, China and other hard-hit countries reported new outbreaks, according to a Reuters tally.

In addition, the carrier will offer $1.5 billion in senior secured notes and said it would enter into a $500 million term loan facility.American’s actions show the broad range of tools airlines are using to bolster balance sheets amid a hesitant return to flying that for now is led largely by leisure travelers anxious to escape months of confinement. While carriers have resumed some of the domestic flights slashed when the virus hurt travel demand in late March, a full recovery is expected to take years. The largest U.S. carriers continue to burn through as much as $45 million daily as demand sags.With the equity offering, Fort Worth, Texas-based American joins Southwest Airlines Co., which raised about $4 billion with an April sale of 70 million shares and $2 billion in convertible notes due in 2025. United Airlines Holdings Inc. raised more than $1 billion in the industry’s first share sale during the coronavirus crisis.Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, BofA Securities and JPMorgan are jointly running the stock and notes offerings for American. The carrier used a pool of slots, gates and routes in various countries, including the U.S., China, Japan, Australia and South America as collateral for the bonds and term loan. The stock offering is to start trading Tuesday, according to a person familiar with the matter.American dropped 9.1% to $14.54 before the start of regular trading Monday, leading other carriers lower. American slumped 44% this year through June 19, in line with a Standard &amp; Poor’s index of the five biggest airline stocks.Bond TermsThe junk bonds were said to carry a yield of 11% in discussions last week ahead of the offering, Bloomberg News reported June 19. Final terms are subject to market conditions and other factors, American said Sunday. Part of the proceeds from the offering and loan will be used to refinance a $1 billion, 364-day financing the airline took out on March 18. The new $500 million loan, which will close with the bond offering, is due in 2024.American will grant underwriters up to $112.5 million worth of additional shares and the same amount in added convertible notes depending on demand, the carrier said.Carriers are pulling out all the stops to make sure they’re positioned for a fundamental change in their business. Delta Air Lines Inc. is preparing for a “slow and choppy” recovery that could take as long as three years to return “to a new level of normal,” the carrier said in a June 19 presentation.Up NextUnited may launch a $5 billion debt offering backed by its frequent-flyer program with a group of banks led by Goldman as soon as Monday, Bloomberg News has reported. Delta, Southwest and JetBlue Airways Corp. also have tapped debt investors in recent weeks to boost liquidity.In conjunction with effort to build cash reserves, carriers also have focused recently on employee leave and voluntary separation offers to cut spending as they prepare for the Oct. 1 expiration of no-furlough restrictions tied to federal payroll aid. The airlines earlier slashed flying, parked hundreds of aircraft, cut executive salaries, and took other steps in a rush to reduce expenses.Outside of the early $1 billion term loan from banks in March, American has depended largely on $5.8 billion in employee payroll support from the U.S. government because of the pandemic. The carrier is in talks for a separate $4.75 billion federal loan it expects to close this month.American has said it will have $11 billion in liquidity at the end of June, assuming it secures the second U.S. loan, while Delta has said it will have more than $15 billion; Southwest, $13.9 billion; and United, $9.4 billion.About 576,500 passengers passed through Transportation Security Administration airport checkpoints Thursday, compared with more than 2.7 million a year earlier.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.</p></div></div></div></li><li class="js-stream-content" data-reactid="185"><div class="Py(14px) Pos(r)" data-test-locator="mega" data-reactid="186"><div class="Cf" data-reactid="187"><div class="Ov(h) Pend(14%) Pend(0)--sm1024" data-reactid="188"><div class="C(#959595) Fz(11px) D(ib) Mb(6px)" data-reactid="189">Reuters</div><h3 class="Mb(5px)" data-reactid="190"><a href="/news/forex-aussie-kiwi-dollars-lead-111137031.html" class="Fw(b) Fz(18px) Lh(23px) LineClamp(2,46px) Fz(17px)--sm1024 Lh(19px)--sm1024 LineClamp(2,38px)--sm1024 mega-item-header-link Td(n) C(#0078ff):h C(#000) LineClamp(2,46px) LineClamp(2,38px)--sm1024 not-isInStreamVideoEnabled" data-reactid="191"><u class="StretchedBox" data-reactid="192"></u><!-- react-text: 193 -->FOREX-Aussie and Kiwi dollars lead gains; dollar falls<!-- /react-text --></a></h3><p class="Fz(14px) Lh(19px) Fz(13px)--sm1024 Lh(17px)--sm1024 LineClamp(3,57px) LineClamp(3,51px)--sm1024 M(0)" data-reactid="194">The New Zealand and Australian dollars surged ahead on Monday, while the U.S. dollar fell, edging away from last week&#x27;s two-and-a-half-week highs, as fears of a second wave of COVID-19 did little to dampen investors&#x27; risk appetite.

While China said the latest outbreak in Beijing is under control, other large emerging economies including Brazil, India and Indonesia continue to see cases soar.“The fight is nowhere close to being over,” said Tuuli McCully, the Singapore-based head of Asia Pacific economics at Scotiabank. “A second significant wave of infections in advanced economies is a huge risk for the global economy that is still in very early stages of recovery.”The concern comes as high frequency data tracked by Bloomberg Economics had been showing an improving picture for sectors such as transport and dining out as lockdown restrictions are eased. A sustained pickup in virus cases threatens to undermine or even reverse those trends.U-ShapeThe International Monetary Fund this week is set to unveil new forecasts for a world already facing its worst outlook since the Great Depression. While the easing of lockdown restrictions in parts of Europe and the U.S. had led some economists to envisage a V-shaped recovery for the world, the re-acceleration in the virus argues against any swift revival.“The flare-up tilts the risks from a V-shaped recovery to a U-shaped recovery,” said Deutsche Bank AG Chief Economist Torsten Slok.European stocks fell early on Monday, but later pared losses as investors bet that the economic recovery will keep going. Gold continued its march toward a 2012 high.An improvement in consumer confidence will be at the core of the recovery sequence if business investment and employment is to heal, according to Catherine Mann, Citigroup Inc. chief economist and former chief economist for the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The latest outbreak won’t help that outlook.“This is not a picture of recovery that is satisfactory in any way, shape or form,” she told the Australian National University’s Crawford Leadership Forum Monday.In recent weeks, an easing of lockdowns had allowed activity to recover. Bright spots in China include new house prices, which rose at the fastest pace in seven months in May as the coronavirus shutdowns were unwound. Consumer demand, industrial output and investment also showed improvement.Early South Korea export figures -- typically held up as a gauge of global demand -- show shipment declines easing in June amid resilient semiconductor demand and more purchases from China. Average daily shipments fell 16% in the first 20 days of the month compared with the prior year, improving from a decline that exceeded 20% in May.In the U.S., unemployment has hinted at bottoming out and retail sales surged by a record in May from the prior month, offering some hope of a quicker recovery from the pandemic-induced recession.In the euro area, measures of activity have slowly improved from their trough in April. Business confidence in Germany is on the mend, and figures in France show the economy there is now running about 12% below normal levels, compared with 29% at the peak of the lockdown. The purchasing managers indexes for the region have risen, though continue to signal contractions in manufacturing and services.Still, until there’s a vaccine, there won’t be a full recovery.Policy makers will need to remain alert to the need for more support, Warwick McKibbin of the Brookings Institution and Australia National University, who has modeled the macro-economic impact of the virus, told the Crawford Leadership Forum Monday.Almost $11 trillion of fiscal resources has been approved globally since the crisis began, with an extra $5 trillion still in the pipeline, according to the Institute of International Finance.“We are nowhere near the end of this pandemic,” McKibbin said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.</p></div></div></div></li><li class="js-stream-content" data-reactid="208"><div class="Py(14px) Pos(r)" data-test-locator="mega" data-reactid="209"><div class="Cf" data-reactid="210"><div class="Ov(h) Pend(14%) Pend(0)--sm1024" data-reactid="211"><div class="C(#959595) Fz(11px) D(ib) Mb(6px)" data-reactid="212">Business Insider</div><h3 class="Mb(5px)" data-reactid="213"><a href="/news/3-months-ago-australias-big-074516404.html" class="Fw(b) Fz(18px) Lh(23px) LineClamp(2,46px) Fz(17px)--sm1024 Lh(19px)--sm1024 LineClamp(2,38px)--sm1024 mega-item-header-link Td(n) C(#0078ff):h C(#000) LineClamp(2,46px) LineClamp(2,38px)--sm1024 not-isInStreamVideoEnabled" data-reactid="214"><u class="StretchedBox" data-reactid="215"></u><!-- react-text: 216 -->3 months ago, Australia&#x27;s big banks started freezing $176 billion worth of mortgages.

Now, seemingly out of nowhere, a recession – Australia&#x27;s first in three decades – threatened to properly challenge that status quo.The country&#x27;s big banks quickly went into bat for the government, agreeing on hardship programs that would allow homeowners in need to defer their repayments for three to six months.With the initial three-month period passing by on Saturday, the economy has only worsened, albeit on a better trajectory than initially feared.Unemployment is officially at 7.1%, although it is likely above 11% in real terms. The economy is expected to contract by anywhere from 5% and 8% before hopefully staging some kind of recovery next year.In the midst of all this, the federal government is due to undertake and possibly cut its JobKeeper program, which is subsidising the wages of workers nationwide.In other words, the ability of Australian workers to continue paying back their debts remains greatly impaired, with no real signs of improvement until 2021. At the same time, 485,065 mortgages (or $176 billion worth) remain frozen but will eventually need to be paid back. Add in business loans, and the clock is ticking on $237 billion in debt.The Commonwealth Bank, Australia&#x27;s largest, holds nearly $450 billion in home loans, making it a relatively good barometer for where the market is at.The bank told Business Insider Australia that it has issued around 112,000 mortgage deferrals, working out to about 88% of the customers that applied for one. With a hardship team now doubled in size, it has begun the Herculean task of reviewing those arrangements.&quot;We are starting to talk about what customers are going to do, obviously restarting payments being the best of that, from their perspective as well as ours,&quot; a CBA spokesperson told Business Insider Australia.&quot;We want to come up with a solution that is right for each customer, not a blanket solution that might not be the right answer for a group of people. It is in our interest and our customers’ interests if we can find a way to support them in difficult times.&quot;Those deferred repayments, after all, don&#x27;t simply vanish. They instead are added onto the outstanding debt with interest, raising the strain of repayments when they eventually recommence. Similarly, a loan default would see a customer lose a home and the bank its profit. While CBA maintains most of its customers are still able to service their debt, such bad debts are expected to rise over the next 12 months. On the other hand, many people aren&#x27;t in as bad shape as feared. Unemployment and economic forecasts have been upgraded while house prices haven&#x27;t yet taken the kind of hit that was originally expected.CBA says as many as one in five customers under hardship arrangements are still making partial repayments. This is perhaps the most important metric to look at, indicating just how hard up Australians and their banks might be in a few short months. ANZ and NAB, for example, appear to be in leakier boats, with just one in 10 hardship cases ready to make repayments again.The risk of some of their loans also appears to be higher. NAB holds around half the number of mortgages that CBA does, but has two-thirds of the hardship cases. Having issued around 100,000 deferrals, ANZ seems to be in a similar position.&quot;About 5% of the customers who took the deferral option are now making full repayments again on their ANZ accounts,&quot; a spokesperson said.While second-tier banks might make up a far smaller slice of the pie, they appear to be tracking better than the behemoths.Take ING, Australia&#x27;s fifth-largest mortgage lender, for instance. With a far smaller exposure to property investors than many of its larger competitors, it says one in three hardship customers are ready to make repayments again. A lighter caseload certainly makes it easier for them to get on top of it. Suncorp began its review process weeks ago, with a spokesperson telling Business Insider Australia customers are coping better than they were expected to back in March.Referring to overleveraged investors, Warren Buffett says it&#x27;s only when the tide goes out that you discover who&#x27;s been swimming naked. With these loan freezes set to melt in September, some Australian investors and banks might be caught similarly red-faced.</p></div></div></div></li><li class="js-stream-content" data-reactid="218"><div class="Py(14px) Pos(r)" data-test-locator="mega" data-reactid="219"><div class="Cf" data-reactid="220"><div class="Fl(start) Pos(r) Mt(2px) W(30%) Maw(255px)" data-reactid="221"><div class="H(0) Ov(h) Bdrs(2px)" style="padding-bottom:56%;" data-reactid="222"><img srcset="https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/gfkHTMOekwkryuYJzu7gZg--~B/Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMjM7cT04MDt3PTIyMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_AU/Sports/oly_au_aap/5851621_Markets_Aust_16-9_18979459_2016635_202006220606565d2caef9-1db3-4331-9413-3dcb4cd4817c.jpg_sd_1280x720.jpg.cf.jpg 1x,https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/JKj9yKPd3sYmAaVv283u.A--~B/Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0yNDY7cT04MDt3PTQ0MDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_AU/Sports/oly_au_aap/5851621_Markets_Aust_16-9_18979459_2016635_202006220606565d2caef9-1db3-4331-9413-3dcb4cd4817c.jpg_sd_1280x720.jpg.cf.jpg 2x" class=" W(100%) Trsdu(0s)!

The company had sought to swap the debt with new debt, but failed to get sufficient investor support.That payment failure brings the value of defaults in China’s offshore market to $4 billion this year, up 150% from a year earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Defaults onshore have slowed this year as the government seeks to avoid aggravating the economic slowdown.China’s dollar bond market has seen a record 11 defaults and distressed exchanges so far this year, up from nine last year, said Owen Gallimore, head of credit strategy at Australia &amp; New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. “There’s been a broad sector hit across private firms in particular.”Hilong said investors representing about 63.45% of the principal amount of the bond which comes due Monday accepted the exchange offer, according to a filing to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. That’s short of the required minimum acceptance rate of 80%.Concern had been growing that the company would fail to win sufficient support for its offer to swap new bonds for old ones. The 2022 dollar bond fell to record low of 30 cents on the dollar last week, while its shares plunged 28% over the past five days. The stock was down 3.9% at 3:40 p.m. in Hong Kong.Trading of the 2022 bond on the Hong Kong stock exchange was suspended from 9 a.m. Its 2020 dollar bond sank 12 cents to a record low of 43 cents.The Shanghai-based company is assessing the impact of the default on its other indebtedness and has extended the deadline of the exchange offer for a fourth time, until June 29, according to Hilong’s filing.Hilong is the latest borrower from Asia’s struggling oil sector to show signs of stress, after Hong Kong-listed oil explorer MIE Holdings Corp. defaulted on a dollar note in early May and an oil refiner from the eastern Shandong province missed a principal installment of a $1 billion loan earlier this month.Both Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings have recently downgraded Hilong following an earlier deadline extension, citing concerns over the firm’s heightened refinancing risk.During an investor call in late May, the company acknowledged it faces regulatory hurdles to transfer onshore funds abroad. It also said that it is in talks to bring in strategic investors but that such efforts may take a few months to complete.(Updates bond, share prices in eighth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.</p></div></div></div></li><li class="js-stream-content" data-reactid="244"><div class="Py(14px) Pos(r)" data-test-locator="mega" data-reactid="245"><div class="Cf" data-reactid="246"><div class="Ov(h) Pend(14%) Pend(0)--sm1024" data-reactid="247"><div class="C(#959595) Fz(11px) D(ib) Mb(6px)" data-reactid="248">Reuters</div><h3 class="Mb(5px)" data-reactid="249"><a href="/news/forex-dollar-shaky-investors-balance-061201124.html" class="Fw(b) Fz(18px) Lh(23px) LineClamp(2,46px) Fz(17px)--sm1024 Lh(19px)--sm1024 LineClamp(2,38px)--sm1024 mega-item-header-link Td(n) C(#0078ff):h C(#000) LineClamp(2,46px) LineClamp(2,38px)--sm1024 not-isInStreamVideoEnabled" data-reactid="250"><u class="StretchedBox" data-reactid="251"></u><!-- react-text: 252 -->FOREX-Dollar shaky as investors balance hope against virus fears<!-- /react-text --></a></h3><p class="Fz(14px) Lh(19px) Fz(13px)--sm1024 Lh(17px)--sm1024 LineClamp(3,57px) LineClamp(3,51px)--sm1024 M(0)" data-reactid="253">The dollar slipped on Monday in a choppy session as investors tried to navigate their way through an unsettling rise in coronavirus infections and weigh whether it would delay an economic recovery.

The Australian carrier collapsed in April under A$6.8 billion ($4.7 billion) of debt after the government declined to step in.Deloitte, which aims to secure a deal by the end of June, didn’t disclose the value of either proposal. It received interest in the airline from more than 20 suitors before most of them fell away.The auction of the second-largest airline in Australia, a market dominated by Qantas Airways Ltd., is a key moment for an industry facing more than $84 billion of losses worldwide this year because of Covid-19 and related travel restrictions. Until now, carriers have been kept on life support largely with state-backed loans and bailouts of at least $123 billion.Whoever wins the bid, Virgin Australia’s prospects are uncertain and business travel likely will be curtailed for years, said Warren Staples, a senior lecturer in management at RMIT University in Melbourne.“There might be a gap between what they pitch and the reality of what happens,” Staples said.Deloitte said Cyrus and Bain envisaged operating a “smaller, single-branded domestic and short-haul international airline that also has growth potential.” Both bidders have received approval from Australia’s Foreign Investment Review Board, Deloitte said.Spokespeople for Cyrus and Bain declined to comment before Deloitte’s statement on Monday.Cyrus promised to keep the airline’s headquarters in Queensland, according to people familiar with the matter who declined to be identified because details of the bid haven’t been made public. That pledge followed lobbying by Australian states including New South Wales and Victoria for prospective buyers to relocate the business, which had about 10,000 workers before the pandemic struck.Virgin Australia lost money for seven consecutive years before it finally succumbed to a near-halt in revenue. New Managing Director Paul Scurrah’s plan to cut costs, simplify the fleet and lighten the debt burden was quickly overwhelmed by the outbreak. The government ultimately refused to give the airline even A$200 million to survive, so it joined U.K. carrier FlyBe as one of the corporate casualties of the virus.State AidIn Europe, Air France-KLM and Deutsche Lufthansa AG are among airlines that have accessed a mixture of loans and state aid, while major U.S. carriers have received billions of dollars in government assistance. In Hong Kong, Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. this month announced a $5 billion rescue plan backed by the government.“It has potentially been a space in which state money has been more effective,” Staples said.A revival of domestic flights in the past month in key markets, including the U.S. and China, has encouraged investors. Qantas is reinstating some local services, and Australia and New Zealand -- which largely have suppressed their outbreaks -- are working on a trans-Tasman travel corridor.The early positive signs have propelled the Bloomberg World Airlines Index to a 28% increase from a May 15 low.Conditions are far from rosy, though. Australia’s tourism and trade minister, Simon Birmingham, said the country’s borders could remain closed to general tourism-related travel until 2021 as part of a strict containment strategy. Qantas has canceled most international flights until late October, and the pace of infections worldwide shows no sign of slowing.World Girds for Long, Hard Road Back After 450,000 Virus DeathsA buyout of Virgin Australia would represent a long-term bet on a sustainable recovery.Cyrus and Bain have courted Virgin Australia’s almost 10,000-strong workforce -- a key block of voting creditors -- through local media in recent days. Bain said its cuts to Virgin won’t be any deeper than Cyrus’, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. Some unions have backed Cyrus for its history of aviation investment beside Richard Branson’s Virgin Group, the newspaper said.Virgin Australia earlier attracted interest from Australian buyout firm BGH Capital Pty, Brookfield Asset Management Inc. of Canada and investors Indigo Partners LLC and Oaktree Capital Management LP.(Updates with two final bidders in the second paragraph, Cyrus plans for headquarters in the ninth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.</p></div></div></div></li><li class="js-stream-content" data-reactid="267"><div class="Py(14px) Pos(r)" data-test-locator="mega" data-reactid="268"><div class="Cf" data-reactid="269"><div class="Ov(h) Pend(14%) Pend(0)--sm1024" data-reactid="270"><div class="C(#959595) Fz(11px) D(ib) Mb(6px)" data-reactid="271">Business Insider</div><h3 class="Mb(5px)" data-reactid="272"><a href="/news/normal-financial-sees-10-billion-050127290.html" class="Fw(b) Fz(18px) Lh(23px) LineClamp(2,46px) Fz(17px)--sm1024 Lh(19px)--sm1024 LineClamp(2,38px)--sm1024 mega-item-header-link Td(n) C(#0078ff):h C(#000) LineClamp(2,46px) LineClamp(2,38px)--sm1024 not-isInStreamVideoEnabled" data-reactid="273"><u class="StretchedBox" data-reactid="274"></u><!-- react-text: 275 -->A normal financial year sees $10 billion in unclaimed expenses at tax time.

Billions, meanwhile, could be left unclaimed as workers forget to include them in their tax return.A survey conducted by Officeworks – one of the major beneficiaries of the woking from home trend – found that one in three Australians are still at their dining room table instead of their office cubicle.With half of those workers splashing out more than $100 to bring their home office up to speed, the ATO expects the number of deductions to soar this year.A normal financial year produces $10 billion in unclaimed expenses. This tax time could see it climb even higher, given just one in six Australians claims to have a good understanding of their tax return, according to Officeworks&#x27; research.In anticipation of this, the ATO has introduced a &quot;shortcut method&quot; to cover extra deductions and split them between households.&quot;If you use the shortcut method, all you need to do is keep a record of the hours you worked from home as evidence of your claim,&quot; ATO Assistant Commissioner Karen Foat said in a statement. &quot;But it is all-inclusive, meaning you can’t claim for any other working from home expenses.&quot;Healthcare, retail and hospitality workers, meanwhile, may have a whole host of new claims to make this year.&quot;Taxpayers working in jobs that require physical contact or close proximity with customers or clients during COVID-19 measures may be able to claim a deduction for items such as gloves, face masks, sanitiser or anti-bacterial spray if they have paid for the items and not been reimbursed,&quot; Foat said. There is, of course, another group likely to have a very different kind of tax time, as COVID-19 sees real unemployment enter double-digits.&quot;With more people working from home, working reduced hours or unfortunately not working at all, we expect to see claims for laundry expenses or travel expenses decline this year,&quot; Foat said.One in two Australians is expected to have lost income due to COVID-19, with 41% working reduced hours.Those stood down are advised to check that any lump payments or redundancy packages have been paid out correctly. One-off or regular payments for stood down workers for example are still taxable.No matter your situation, if you have any queries, the ATO advises you check its website for new information or contact a tax agent for more complicated circumstances.Disclaimer: This article contains general information only and is not intended to be used as personal advice.* * *READ MORE:  * Virtual pubs, Zoom yoga and lunch money: How companies like Canva, Atlassian and TransferWise are engaging staff working from home  * A new survey of Australian office workers has found we like working from home – but distractions and maintaining team culture are big concerns</p></div></div></div></li><li class="js-stream-content" data-reactid="277"><div class="Py(14px) Pos(r)" data-test-locator="mega" data-reactid="278"><div class="Cf" data-reactid="279"><div class="Fl(start) Pos(r) Mt(2px) W(30%) Maw(255px)" data-reactid="280"><div class="H(0) Ov(h) Bdrs(2px)" style="padding-bottom:56%;" data-reactid="281"><img srcset="https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/mS5glg7GefFhxjMa9GMz3g--~B/Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMjM7cT04MDt3PTIyMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_AU/Sports/oly_au_aap/5852414_Virgin_Australia_16-9_18980900_2016710_2020062213064807119476-c532-4e3b-a724-592127c27efc.jpg_sd_1280x720.jpg.cf.jpg 1x,https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.TFkjYoMaxlZEm5lWGWUgw--~B/Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0yNDY7cT04MDt3PTQ0MDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_AU/Sports/oly_au_aap/5852414_Virgin_Australia_16-9_18980900_2016710_2020062213064807119476-c532-4e3b-a724-592127c27efc.jpg_sd_1280x720.jpg.cf.jpg 2x" class=" W(100%) Trsdu(0s)!

You’ll make a better deal now!”The administration wielded the same warnings when pressing the World Health Organization during the global Covid-19 pandemic for changes in order to get American funding flowing again, according to a person familiar with the discussions. The demand was the same, the person said: commit to reforms aimed at improving transparency and eradicating a perceived bias toward China, or expect to make more painful concessions if Trump is re-elected.German Chancellor Angela Merkel may already have tasted the risks of snubbing the White House. Days after she refused Trump’s invitation to a G-7 summit he wanted to hold outside Washington this month, the administration announced plans to withdraw a quarter of U.S. troops currently stationed in Germany.Trump said he made that call because Germany still wasn’t on track to meet its commitment as a North Atlantic Treaty Organization member to spend 2% of gross domestic product on defense by 2024. Merkel, meanwhile, attributed her refusal to come to the U.S. to the pandemic, saying it was too early for an in-person meeting like the one Trump proposed.For the time being, countries appear to be holding off on deals with the Trump administration, or sticking to their guns in case a Biden administration softens the American stance. South Korea, for example, is still resisting U.S. demands to pay far more to host the 28,000 U.S. troops stationed on the peninsula, while several European countries are vowing to move ahead with plans to tax tech companies despite a U.S. threat to retaliate with tariffs.‘Pause Button’“A lot of countries in Europe and Asia will hide behind Covid-19 and hit the pause button, saying it is too difficult to do business as usual,” says John Chipman, director-general of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a London-based think tank. With the pandemic unlikely to really wind down before October, that time scale dovetails with the U.S. election.The Trump administration’s domestic response to the coronavirus and recent anti-racism protests may also see foreign capitals choose to wait.Trump’s defense secretary and chairman of the joint chiefs of staff both issued statements this month committing to protecting the U.S. Constitution, thinly veiled rebukes to the president’s ideas of assuming federal control to impose order by force.The rare impression of a U.S. president at public odds with his armed forces was underscored when former military leaders, including Jim Mattis, his first Secretary of Defense, spoke out to condemn Trump more directly. Mattis’s comments have a special resonance abroad -- until his resignation in 2019 he traveled widely to persuade allies that America’s institutions were strong enough to withstand Trump.“All these events taken together will have raised a question as to whether it’s worth investing a lot more in the Trump presidency,” Chipman said.China may be taking a similar wait-and-see approach, according to current and former officials. They say leaders in Beijing have calculated that a second Trump term would serve their interests, mostly because of the damage he’s done to U.S. alliances with other Western nations.Read more: China Warms to Idea of Four More Years of Trump PresidencyTrump has also made no secret of his desire for political favors, according to a forthcoming book by John Bolton, Trump’s former national security adviser, who writes that the president last year asked Chinese President Xi Jinping to buy more agricultural products to help him win votes in battleground states in the 2020 election.Western governments have expressed concern at Trump’s preference for transactional rather than values-based alliances. The U.K. and Canada, for example, balked at Trump’s plan to invite Russian President Vladimir Putin to a deferred G-7 meeting. The group kicked Russia out in 2014 to protest its annexation of Crimea, and Moscow’s interference in Ukraine has only intensified.Handshakes Devalued“Under this president, our handshake is devalued and our values are in tatters,” said Brett McGurk, the former U.S. special envoy to the coalition fighting Islamic State and now a frequent Trump critic. “That reservoir of soft power -- the awesome intangible that Russia or China can never match -- is being drained before the eyes of the world.”Administration officials appear sensitive to the risk they could find themselves treated as lame ducks. They’ve oriented much of their Iran strategy in recent months toward making it more difficult for all parties to the moribund 2015 nuclear deal to revive it should Biden win the White House.Trump, meanwhile, is looking to boost ties with nations skeptical of the European Union such as Poland’s President Andrzej Duda, who visits Washington this week. Meanwhile U.S. special envoy for the Balkans Richard Grenell, a Trump loyalist, has organized a meeting of the leaders of Serbia and Kosovo in Washington June 27, sidelining the EU which had been mediating in the search for a settlement. Tensions in the Balkans have risen as Serbia seeks to block international recognition of Kosovo’s independence, which the former province declared in 2008.Read more: Europe Worries Trump May Wreck Chunk of Merkel’s LegacyAnd by no means are all U.S. partners hesitant to work with Trump. Australia, another proposed G-7 guest, was quick to accept his invitation. Australia and Japan strongly support Trump’s stance on containing China, his planned focus for the summit and a rationale for including Russia.The U.S. in any case remains too powerful to ignore entirely. One European diplomat in Washington said many capitals learned a lesson by betting on Hillary Clinton in 2016, when the prevailing consensus was she would win the presidency.They may also be coming to a more sweeping conclusion: That massive swings in U.S. policy are here to stay, meaning allies will need to rely less on Washington, no matter who wins in November. That’s put a renewed focus on approaching thorny foreign-policy problems from the perspective of pure national interest, rather than as a unified alliance, the diplomat said. Otherwise, the risk of being blindsided by the U.S. is too great.Biden, for example, has pledged to undo Trump policies that were themselves drastic reversals. The former vice president says he’d re-enter the Paris climate agreement on the first day of his administration and review all U.S. tariffs and sanctions imposed under Trump. If Iran were to recommit to its obligations under the nuclear accord the U.S. would “strengthen and extend” the agreement, according to Biden’s campaign website.U.S. unpredictability has been on full display in the global battle against the coronavirus, with the U.S. giving other countries no warning about its decision to defund the WHO -- the latest in a string of international treaties and organizations that Trump has either left or undermined since coming to office.It was clear, too, in the way Trump punished China over its actions in Hong Kong. He stripped the city of some of its privileged trade status without first tipping off even the U.K., Hong Kong’s former colonial overseer and arguably America’s closest ally.Read more: Biden, Trump Quit Praising Xi to Feud Over Who’d Be TougherAmerica’s alliance network, based on a core of defense commitments with 34 nations, is not yet doomed, according to Mira Rapp-Hooper, whose book “Shields of the Republic: The Triumphs and Perils of America’s Alliance” was published this month. “The reason I remain somewhat optimistic is that the cost of doing foreign policy without the U.S. would be much more expensive for any one of our allies” as well as for the U.S. itself, she said.Yet that optimism may fade with a second Trump term. Asked if Trump Mark-II might be able to replace the post-war architecture alliances with a new, more ad hoc and interest-based network of international relationships, she was skeptical.Said Rapp-Hooper, a senior fellow for Asia studies at the New York-based Council on Foreign Relations: “I don’t see the U.S. as a credible builder of a new world order.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.</p></div></div></div></li><li class="js-stream-content" data-reactid="313"><div class="Py(14px) Pos(r)" data-test-locator="mega" data-reactid="314"><div class="Cf" data-reactid="315"><div class="Fl(start) Pos(r) Mt(2px) W(30%) Maw(255px)" data-reactid="316"><div class="H(0) Ov(h) Bdrs(2px)" style="padding-bottom:56%;" data-reactid="317"><img srcset="https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/OjaA7UaRmaI4ZSkof3IzvQ--~B/Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMjM7cT04MDt3PTIyMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_AU/Sports/oly_au_aap/5852362_Stockland_16-9_18980440_2016705_202006221106561414b6b6-3c84-4782-b867-2c5efc77d1ee.jpg_sd_1280x720.jpg.cf.jpg 1x,https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/VTQVsbuKMiV.lUrjN79k7w--~B/Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0yNDY7cT04MDt3PTQ0MDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_AU/Sports/oly_au_aap/5852362_Stockland_16-9_18980440_2016705_202006221106561414b6b6-3c84-4782-b867-2c5efc77d1ee.jpg_sd_1280x720.jpg.cf.jpg 2x" class=" W(100%) Trsdu(0s)!

Flight Centre Travel Group Ltd. and Webjet Ltd. both tapped shareholders for additional capital to weather the health crisis, while Helloworld Travel Ltd. in March stood down a substantial portion of its workforce. As lockdowns ease, the shift to domestic travel will likely underpin gains for these companies, according to RBC.Broad tourist-related travel in and out of Australia probably won’t return until 2021, according to the government. The nation’s largest airline, Qantas Airways Ltd., canceled most international flights until late October after the announcement.Australians spend roughly the same amount per night on domestic and international excursions, though overseas trips usually cost more as they last longer. The average holiday abroad cost A$8,500 ($5,817) and lasted 24 days in 2019, according to Tourism Research Australia and Council of Australian Tour Operators data analyzed by RBC. A vacation closer to home set travelers back A$958 and lasted 3.5 days.Assets in holiday hotspots such as Kangaroo Island and Fraser Island make SeaLink Travel Group Ltd. best-placed to benefit from a domestic travel boom, RBC said. Corporate Travel Management Ltd. will see a boost as business trips pick up, and is likely to report one of the “least bad” earnings results for the second half compared to peers, the analysts added.Still, even domestic travel may be limited as individual states keep their borders closed and the threat of additional coronavirus outbreaks loom. Australia’s second-most populous state, Victoria, has tightened Covid-19 controls as a spike in cases raises concerns about a potential second wave.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.</p></div></div></div></li></ul></div></div></div><script>if (window.performance) {window.performance.mark && window.performance.mark('FinStream');window.performance.measure && window.performance.measure('FinStreamDone','PageStart','FinStream');}</script></div><div data-reactid="19"><div id="mrt-node-Col1-3-AdUnitWithTdAds" data-locator="subtree-root"><div id="Col1-3-AdUnitWithTdAds-Proxy" data-reactroot="" data-reactid="1" data-react-checksum="238790885"><div class="ad-foot" data-reactid="2"><div data-reactid="3"><div class="" data-reactid="4"><div id="defaultFOOT-sizer" class="darla-container Pos-r Z-0 Pos(r) Ov(a) Z(0)" style="height:0;width:0;" data-reactid="5"><!-- react-text: 6 --><!-- /react-text --><div id="defaultFOOT-wrapper" class="Pos-a T-0 B-0 Start-0 End-0 Ov-h Pos(a) T(0) B(0) Start(0) End(0) Ov(h)" data-reactid="7"><div id="defaultdestFOOT" style=""></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><script>if (window.performance) {window.performance.mark && window.performance.mark('Col1-3-AdUnitWithTdAds');window.performance.measure && window.performance.measure('Col1-3-AdUnitWithTdAdsDone','PageStart','Col1-3-AdUnitWithTdAds');}</script></div><div data-reactid="20"><div id="mrt-node-Col1-4-AdUnitWithTdAds" data-locator="subtree-root"><div id="Col1-4-AdUnitWithTdAds-Proxy" data-reactroot="" data-reactid="1" data-react-checksum="998550158"><div class="ad-fsrvy" data-reactid="2"><div data-reactid="3"><div class="" data-reactid="4"><div id="defaultFSRVY-sizer" class="darla-container Pos-r Z-0 Pos(r) Ov(a) Z(0)" style="height:0;width:0;" data-reactid="5"><!-- react-text: 6 --><!-- /react-text --><div id="defaultFSRVY-wrapper" class="Pos-a T-0 B-0 Start-0 End-0 Ov-h Pos(a) T(0) B(0) Start(0) End(0) Ov(h)" data-reactid="7"><div id="defaultdestFSRVY" style=""></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><script>if (window.performance) {window.performance.mark && window.performance.mark('Col1-4-AdUnitWithTdAds');window.performance.measure && window.performance.measure('Col1-4-AdUnitWithTdAdsDone','PageStart','Col1-4-AdUnitWithTdAds');}</script></div><div data-reactid="21"><div id="mrt-node-Col1-5-DcmPixelIFrame" data-locator="subtree-root"><div id="Col1-5-DcmPixelIFrame-Proxy" data-reactroot="" data-reactid="1" data-react-checksum="-2055505783"><iframe src="https://6427509.fls.doubleclick.net/activityi;src=6427509;type=mktsmt;cat=lpauq3;u1=5bbf5264b1c55a306d943761aaef09cf3338b5df061480bd142c151e75ba41cc;dc_lat=;dc_rdid=;tag_for_child_directed_treatment=;tfua=;npa=;ord=1?" class="H(1px) W(1px) Bd(0) D(n)" data-reactid="2"></iframe></div></div><script>if (window.performance) {window.performance.mark && window.performance.mark('Col1-5-DcmPixelIFrame');window.performance.measure && window.performance.measure('Col1-5-DcmPixelIFrameDone','PageStart','Col1-5-DcmPixelIFrame');}</script></div></div></div></div></div><!-- react-empty: 22 --><!-- react-empty: 23 --><div id="YDC-Overlay" class="YDC-Overlay" data-reactid="24"><div id="YDC-Overlay-Stack" class="YDC-Overlay-Stack Z(11) End(0) Pos(f) Start(0) lw-nav-open_Pos(r) lw-nav-open_Z(10) T(0)" data-reactid="25"><div id="YDC-Overlay-Stack-Composite" data-reactid="26"><div data-reactid="27"><div id="mrt-node-Overlay-0-DesktopNav" data-locator="subtree-root"><div id="Overlay-0-DesktopNav-Proxy" data-reactroot="" data-reactid="1" data-react-checksum="1251136734"><div id="Overlay-0-DesktopNav" class="Pos(r) Z(1)" data-reactid="2"><nav class="tdv2-applet-navrail" data-reactid="3"><div class="Ff($yahooSansFinanceFont)!" data-reactid="4"><div id="Overlay-0-DesktopNav" class="nr-applet-main-nav Pos(r) Start(0) End(0) Z(8) H(navHeight) Lh(navHeight) Fz(13px) Fw(b) Bdw(1px) Miw(980px) Bdc($c-divider) Bdts(s) Bdc(borderColorDark)" data-reactid="5"><div class="Bgc(#f9f9f9) Bgc($bg-header) Bgc(t)!" data-reactid="6"><div class="nr-applet-title Fl(start) Pend(navPaddings) Bxz(bb) Ov(h) H(navHeight) Mstart(navPaddings) Miw(170px)" data-reactid="7"><div class="" data-reactid="8"><a class="nr-applet-nav-item Td(n) rapidnofollow Ell Td(n) D(ib) Lh(itemHeight_uhMagDesign) Tt(c)!

In addition, the carrier will offer $1.5 billion in senior secured notes and said it would enter into a $500 million term loan facility.American’s actions show the broad range of tools airlines are using to bolster balance sheets amid a hesitant return to flying that for now is led largely by leisure travelers anxious to escape months of confinement. While carriers have resumed some of the domestic flights slashed when the virus hurt travel demand in late March, a full recovery is expected to take years. The largest U.S. carriers continue to burn through as much as $45 million daily as demand sags.With the equity offering, Fort Worth, Texas-based American joins Southwest Airlines Co., which raised about $4 billion with an April sale of 70 million shares and $2 billion in convertible notes due in 2025. United Airlines Holdings Inc. raised more than $1 billion in the industry’s first share sale during the coronavirus crisis.Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, BofA Securities and JPMorgan are jointly running the stock and notes offerings for American. The carrier used a pool of slots, gates and routes in various countries, including the U.S., China, Japan, Australia and South America as collateral for the bonds and term loan. The stock offering is to start trading Tuesday, according to a person familiar with the matter.American dropped 9.1% to $14.54 before the start of regular trading Monday, leading other carriers lower. American slumped 44% this year through June 19, in line with a Standard & Poor’s index of the five biggest airline stocks.Bond TermsThe junk bonds were said to carry a yield of 11% in discussions last week ahead of the offering, Bloomberg News reported June 19. Final terms are subject to market conditions and other factors, American said Sunday. Part of the proceeds from the offering and loan will be used to refinance a $1 billion, 364-day financing the airline took out on March 18. The new $500 million loan, which will close with the bond offering, is due in 2024.American will grant underwriters up to $112.5 million worth of additional shares and the same amount in added convertible notes depending on demand, the carrier said.Carriers are pulling out all the stops to make sure they’re positioned for a fundamental change in their business. Delta Air Lines Inc. is preparing for a “slow and choppy” recovery that could take as long as three years to return “to a new level of normal,” the carrier said in a June 19 presentation.Up NextUnited may launch a $5 billion debt offering backed by its frequent-flyer program with a group of banks led by Goldman as soon as Monday, Bloomberg News has reported. Delta, Southwest and JetBlue Airways Corp. also have tapped debt investors in recent weeks to boost liquidity.In conjunction with effort to build cash reserves, carriers also have focused recently on employee leave and voluntary separation offers to cut spending as they prepare for the Oct. 1 expiration of no-furlough restrictions tied to federal payroll aid. The airlines earlier slashed flying, parked hundreds of aircraft, cut executive salaries, and took other steps in a rush to reduce expenses.Outside of the early $1 billion term loan from banks in March, American has depended largely on $5.8 billion in employee payroll support from the U.S. government because of the pandemic. The carrier is in talks for a separate $4.75 billion federal loan it expects to close this month.American has said it will have $11 billion in liquidity at the end of June, assuming it secures the second U.S. loan, while Delta has said it will have more than $15 billion; Southwest, $13.9 billion; and United, $9.4 billion.About 576,500 passengers passed through Transportation Security Administration airport checkpoints Thursday, compared with more than 2.7 million a year earlier.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","pubtime":1592828926000,"is_eligible":true,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fau.finance.yahoo.com\u002Fnews\u002Famerican-airlines-planning-1-5-161517493.html","property":"Business","categoryLabel":"Business","title":"American Air Braces Balance Sheet With $3.5 Billion in Financing","images":{"original":{"height":2667,"width":4000,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002F2rEXyl.xK5V0LkCEvcKQDA--~B\u002FaD0yNjY3O3c9NDAwMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen\u002Fbloomberg_markets_842\u002Fd491ffbad83066a4e9ba61bbaf355e8f.cf.jpg"},"img:220x123":{"height":123,"width":220,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002FX_QVccuVka27iYVr9R42DA--~B\u002FZmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMjM7cT04MDt3PTIyMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen\u002Fbloomberg_markets_842\u002Fd491ffbad83066a4e9ba61bbaf355e8f.cf.jpg"},"img:440x246":{"height":246,"width":440,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002FOjq_IdacGL04bZVDqLW9WQ--~B\u002FZmk9c3RyaW07aD0yNDY7cT04MDt3PTQ0MDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen\u002Fbloomberg_markets_842\u002Fd491ffbad83066a4e9ba61bbaf355e8f.cf.jpg"}},"type":"article","link":"\u002Fnews\u002Famerican-airlines-planning-1-5-161517493.html","id":"6164a530-b815-3561-a918-ee68a061a86e","publisher":"Bloomberg","publisher_id":"bloomberg_markets_842","off_network":false},{"i13n":{"bpos":1,"cpos":14,"cposy":17},"summary":"The New Zealand and Australian dollars surged ahead on Monday, while the U.S. dollar fell, edging away from last week's two-and-a-half-week highs, as fears of a second wave of COVID-19 did little to dampen investors' risk appetite.

While China said the latest outbreak in Beijing is under control, other large emerging economies including Brazil, India and Indonesia continue to see cases soar.“The fight is nowhere close to being over,” said Tuuli McCully, the Singapore-based head of Asia Pacific economics at Scotiabank. “A second significant wave of infections in advanced economies is a huge risk for the global economy that is still in very early stages of recovery.”The concern comes as high frequency data tracked by Bloomberg Economics had been showing an improving picture for sectors such as transport and dining out as lockdown restrictions are eased. A sustained pickup in virus cases threatens to undermine or even reverse those trends.U-ShapeThe International Monetary Fund this week is set to unveil new forecasts for a world already facing its worst outlook since the Great Depression. While the easing of lockdown restrictions in parts of Europe and the U.S. had led some economists to envisage a V-shaped recovery for the world, the re-acceleration in the virus argues against any swift revival.“The flare-up tilts the risks from a V-shaped recovery to a U-shaped recovery,” said Deutsche Bank AG Chief Economist Torsten Slok.European stocks fell early on Monday, but later pared losses as investors bet that the economic recovery will keep going. Gold continued its march toward a 2012 high.An improvement in consumer confidence will be at the core of the recovery sequence if business investment and employment is to heal, according to Catherine Mann, Citigroup Inc. chief economist and former chief economist for the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The latest outbreak won’t help that outlook.“This is not a picture of recovery that is satisfactory in any way, shape or form,” she told the Australian National University’s Crawford Leadership Forum Monday.In recent weeks, an easing of lockdowns had allowed activity to recover. Bright spots in China include new house prices, which rose at the fastest pace in seven months in May as the coronavirus shutdowns were unwound. Consumer demand, industrial output and investment also showed improvement.Early South Korea export figures -- typically held up as a gauge of global demand -- show shipment declines easing in June amid resilient semiconductor demand and more purchases from China. Average daily shipments fell 16% in the first 20 days of the month compared with the prior year, improving from a decline that exceeded 20% in May.In the U.S., unemployment has hinted at bottoming out and retail sales surged by a record in May from the prior month, offering some hope of a quicker recovery from the pandemic-induced recession.In the euro area, measures of activity have slowly improved from their trough in April. Business confidence in Germany is on the mend, and figures in France show the economy there is now running about 12% below normal levels, compared with 29% at the peak of the lockdown. The purchasing managers indexes for the region have risen, though continue to signal contractions in manufacturing and services.Still, until there’s a vaccine, there won’t be a full recovery.Policy makers will need to remain alert to the need for more support, Warwick McKibbin of the Brookings Institution and Australia National University, who has modeled the macro-economic impact of the virus, told the Crawford Leadership Forum Monday.Almost $11 trillion of fiscal resources has been approved globally since the crisis began, with an extra $5 trillion still in the pipeline, according to the Institute of International Finance.“We are nowhere near the end of this pandemic,” McKibbin said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","pubtime":1592815819000,"is_eligible":true,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fau.finance.yahoo.com\u002Fnews\u002Fvirus-surge-jolts-prospects-world-085019975.html","property":"Business","categoryLabel":"Business","title":"Virus Surge Jolts Prospects for World Economy","images":{"original":{"height":760,"width":1296,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002FMcKEvU2cCtgLrDvmT4l6Ag--~B\u002FaD03NjA7dz0xMjk2O2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen\u002Fbloomberg_markets_842\u002F597fb32583de80fa6b951268e02b4f9b.cf.jpg"},"img:220x123":{"height":123,"width":220,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002FsCC.yxEH5YKPkclLSTABOQ--~B\u002FZmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMjM7cT04MDt3PTIyMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen\u002Fbloomberg_markets_842\u002F597fb32583de80fa6b951268e02b4f9b.cf.jpg"},"img:440x246":{"height":246,"width":440,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002FWjWKtxngzlo_tyzjHU.cyA--~B\u002FZmk9c3RyaW07aD0yNDY7cT04MDt3PTQ0MDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen\u002Fbloomberg_markets_842\u002F597fb32583de80fa6b951268e02b4f9b.cf.jpg"}},"type":"article","link":"\u002Fnews\u002Fvirus-surge-jolts-prospects-world-085019975.html","id":"6c169ba7-c7a0-39a9-b68f-7d2d18eaa1fe","publisher":"Bloomberg","publisher_id":"bloomberg_markets_842","off_network":false},{"i13n":{"bpos":1,"cpos":16,"cposy":19},"summary":"* Australian banks have begun reviewing their customers who have deferred their home loan repayments.  * The hardship arrangements were created in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and allowed customers facing hardship to avoid paying back their debts for up to six months.  * With that grace period set to end in September, Business Insider Australia checked in on how Australians and their banks are getting along.  * Visit Business Insider Australia's homepage for more stories.* * *After COVID-19 bit into the Australian economy, thoughts predictably turned to its property market.Sky-high prices had helped the country accumulate staggering levels of household debt. Now, seemingly out of nowhere, a recession – Australia's first in three decades – threatened to properly challenge that status quo.The country's big banks quickly went into bat for the government, agreeing on hardship programs that would allow homeowners in need to defer their repayments for three to six months.With the initial three-month period passing by on Saturday, the economy has only worsened, albeit on a better trajectory than initially feared.Unemployment is officially at 7.1%, although it is likely above 11% in real terms. The economy is expected to contract by anywhere from 5% and 8% before hopefully staging some kind of recovery next year.In the midst of all this, the federal government is due to undertake and possibly cut its JobKeeper program, which is subsidising the wages of workers nationwide.In other words, the ability of Australian workers to continue paying back their debts remains greatly impaired, with no real signs of improvement until 2021. At the same time, 485,065 mortgages (or $176 billion worth) remain frozen but will eventually need to be paid back. Add in business loans, and the clock is ticking on $237 billion in debt.The Commonwealth Bank, Australia's largest, holds nearly $450 billion in home loans, making it a relatively good barometer for where the market is at.The bank told Business Insider Australia that it has issued around 112,000 mortgage deferrals, working out to about 88% of the customers that applied for one. With a hardship team now doubled in size, it has begun the Herculean task of reviewing those arrangements.\"We are starting to talk about what customers are going to do, obviously restarting payments being the best of that, from their perspective as well as ours,\" a CBA spokesperson told Business Insider Australia.\"We want to come up with a solution that is right for each customer, not a blanket solution that might not be the right answer for a group of people. It is in our interest and our customers’ interests if we can find a way to support them in difficult times.\"Those deferred repayments, after all, don't simply vanish. They instead are added onto the outstanding debt with interest, raising the strain of repayments when they eventually recommence. Similarly, a loan default would see a customer lose a home and the bank its profit. While CBA maintains most of its customers are still able to service their debt, such bad debts are expected to rise over the next 12 months. On the other hand, many people aren't in as bad shape as feared. Unemployment and economic forecasts have been upgraded while house prices haven't yet taken the kind of hit that was originally expected.CBA says as many as one in five customers under hardship arrangements are still making partial repayments. This is perhaps the most important metric to look at, indicating just how hard up Australians and their banks might be in a few short months. ANZ and NAB, for example, appear to be in leakier boats, with just one in 10 hardship cases ready to make repayments again.The risk of some of their loans also appears to be higher. NAB holds around half the number of mortgages that CBA does, but has two-thirds of the hardship cases. Having issued around 100,000 deferrals, ANZ seems to be in a similar position.\"About 5% of the customers who took the deferral option are now making full repayments again on their ANZ accounts,\" a spokesperson said.While second-tier banks might make up a far smaller slice of the pie, they appear to be tracking better than the behemoths.Take ING, Australia's fifth-largest mortgage lender, for instance. With a far smaller exposure to property investors than many of its larger competitors, it says one in three hardship customers are ready to make repayments again. A lighter caseload certainly makes it easier for them to get on top of it. Suncorp began its review process weeks ago, with a spokesperson telling Business Insider Australia customers are coping better than they were expected to back in March.Referring to overleveraged investors, Warren Buffett says it's only when the tide goes out that you discover who's been swimming naked. With these loan freezes set to melt in September, some Australian investors and banks might be caught similarly red-faced.","pubtime":1592811916000,"is_eligible":true,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fau.finance.yahoo.com\u002Fnews\u002F3-months-ago-australias-big-074516404.html","property":"Business","categoryLabel":"Business","title":"3 months ago, Australia's big banks started freezing $176 billion worth of mortgages.

The company had sought to swap the debt with new debt, but failed to get sufficient investor support.That payment failure brings the value of defaults in China’s offshore market to $4 billion this year, up 150% from a year earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Defaults onshore have slowed this year as the government seeks to avoid aggravating the economic slowdown.China’s dollar bond market has seen a record 11 defaults and distressed exchanges so far this year, up from nine last year, said Owen Gallimore, head of credit strategy at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. “There’s been a broad sector hit across private firms in particular.”Hilong said investors representing about 63.45% of the principal amount of the bond which comes due Monday accepted the exchange offer, according to a filing to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. That’s short of the required minimum acceptance rate of 80%.Concern had been growing that the company would fail to win sufficient support for its offer to swap new bonds for old ones. The 2022 dollar bond fell to record low of 30 cents on the dollar last week, while its shares plunged 28% over the past five days. The stock was down 3.9% at 3:40 p.m. in Hong Kong.Trading of the 2022 bond on the Hong Kong stock exchange was suspended from 9 a.m. Its 2020 dollar bond sank 12 cents to a record low of 43 cents.The Shanghai-based company is assessing the impact of the default on its other indebtedness and has extended the deadline of the exchange offer for a fourth time, until June 29, according to Hilong’s filing.Hilong is the latest borrower from Asia’s struggling oil sector to show signs of stress, after Hong Kong-listed oil explorer MIE Holdings Corp. defaulted on a dollar note in early May and an oil refiner from the eastern Shandong province missed a principal installment of a $1 billion loan earlier this month.Both Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings have recently downgraded Hilong following an earlier deadline extension, citing concerns over the firm’s heightened refinancing risk.During an investor call in late May, the company acknowledged it faces regulatory hurdles to transfer onshore funds abroad. It also said that it is in talks to bring in strategic investors but that such efforts may take a few months to complete.(Updates bond, share prices in eighth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","pubtime":1592811791000,"is_eligible":true,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fau.finance.yahoo.com\u002Fnews\u002Fchina-offshore-defaults-top-4-040906211.html","property":"Business","categoryLabel":"Business","title":"China’s Offshore Defaults Top $4 Billion as Oil Firm Joins List","images":{"original":{"height":1333,"width":1999,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002FPqlmUpDG1jPJt23VQ327UA--~B\u002FaD0xMzMzO3c9MTk5OTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen\u002Fbloomberg_markets_842\u002F7a55519baa896e47444ce5345ccf9d71.cf.jpg"},"img:220x123":{"height":123,"width":220,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002F2vzucVVod.ZxECEffSxJCA--~B\u002FZmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMjM7cT04MDt3PTIyMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen\u002Fbloomberg_markets_842\u002F7a55519baa896e47444ce5345ccf9d71.cf.jpg"},"img:440x246":{"height":246,"width":440,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002FoC84hGKFZLZ9rpXYE.nZNA--~B\u002FZmk9c3RyaW07aD0yNDY7cT04MDt3PTQ0MDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen\u002Fbloomberg_markets_842\u002F7a55519baa896e47444ce5345ccf9d71.cf.jpg"}},"type":"article","link":"\u002Fnews\u002Fchina-offshore-defaults-top-4-040906211.html","id":"aed36bf8-d5fa-3c73-ae41-346fae126be8","publisher":"Bloomberg","publisher_id":"bloomberg_markets_842","off_network":false},{"i13n":{"bpos":1,"cpos":19,"cposy":22},"summary":"The dollar slipped on Monday in a choppy session as investors tried to navigate their way through an unsettling rise in coronavirus infections and weigh whether it would delay an economic recovery.

The Australian carrier collapsed in April under A$6.8 billion ($4.7 billion) of debt after the government declined to step in.Deloitte, which aims to secure a deal by the end of June, didn’t disclose the value of either proposal. It received interest in the airline from more than 20 suitors before most of them fell away.The auction of the second-largest airline in Australia, a market dominated by Qantas Airways Ltd., is a key moment for an industry facing more than $84 billion of losses worldwide this year because of Covid-19 and related travel restrictions. Until now, carriers have been kept on life support largely with state-backed loans and bailouts of at least $123 billion.Whoever wins the bid, Virgin Australia’s prospects are uncertain and business travel likely will be curtailed for years, said Warren Staples, a senior lecturer in management at RMIT University in Melbourne.“There might be a gap between what they pitch and the reality of what happens,” Staples said.Deloitte said Cyrus and Bain envisaged operating a “smaller, single-branded domestic and short-haul international airline that also has growth potential.” Both bidders have received approval from Australia’s Foreign Investment Review Board, Deloitte said.Spokespeople for Cyrus and Bain declined to comment before Deloitte’s statement on Monday.Cyrus promised to keep the airline’s headquarters in Queensland, according to people familiar with the matter who declined to be identified because details of the bid haven’t been made public. That pledge followed lobbying by Australian states including New South Wales and Victoria for prospective buyers to relocate the business, which had about 10,000 workers before the pandemic struck.Virgin Australia lost money for seven consecutive years before it finally succumbed to a near-halt in revenue. New Managing Director Paul Scurrah’s plan to cut costs, simplify the fleet and lighten the debt burden was quickly overwhelmed by the outbreak. The government ultimately refused to give the airline even A$200 million to survive, so it joined U.K. carrier FlyBe as one of the corporate casualties of the virus.State AidIn Europe, Air France-KLM and Deutsche Lufthansa AG are among airlines that have accessed a mixture of loans and state aid, while major U.S. carriers have received billions of dollars in government assistance. In Hong Kong, Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. this month announced a $5 billion rescue plan backed by the government.“It has potentially been a space in which state money has been more effective,” Staples said.A revival of domestic flights in the past month in key markets, including the U.S. and China, has encouraged investors. Qantas is reinstating some local services, and Australia and New Zealand -- which largely have suppressed their outbreaks -- are working on a trans-Tasman travel corridor.The early positive signs have propelled the Bloomberg World Airlines Index to a 28% increase from a May 15 low.Conditions are far from rosy, though. Australia’s tourism and trade minister, Simon Birmingham, said the country’s borders could remain closed to general tourism-related travel until 2021 as part of a strict containment strategy. Qantas has canceled most international flights until late October, and the pace of infections worldwide shows no sign of slowing.World Girds for Long, Hard Road Back After 450,000 Virus DeathsA buyout of Virgin Australia would represent a long-term bet on a sustainable recovery.Cyrus and Bain have courted Virgin Australia’s almost 10,000-strong workforce -- a key block of voting creditors -- through local media in recent days. Bain said its cuts to Virgin won’t be any deeper than Cyrus’, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. Some unions have backed Cyrus for its history of aviation investment beside Richard Branson’s Virgin Group, the newspaper said.Virgin Australia earlier attracted interest from Australian buyout firm BGH Capital Pty, Brookfield Asset Management Inc. of Canada and investors Indigo Partners LLC and Oaktree Capital Management LP.(Updates with two final bidders in the second paragraph, Cyrus plans for headquarters in the ninth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","pubtime":1592802184000,"is_eligible":true,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fau.finance.yahoo.com\u002Fnews\u002Ffinal-virgin-australia-bids-key-190000299.html","property":"Business","categoryLabel":"Business","title":"Final Virgin Australia Bids a Key Test for Ailing Airlines","images":{"original":{"height":675,"width":1200,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002F36SC8fUJwCLOyHfOkq713w--~B\u002FaD02NzU7dz0xMjAwO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen\u002Fbloomberg_markets_842\u002Fdd64d45dfc4c34bea629be26ebd53be8.cf.jpg"},"img:220x123":{"height":123,"width":220,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002FwqW8RJaHP5nlbeDtV19XsQ--~B\u002FZmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMjM7cT04MDt3PTIyMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen\u002Fbloomberg_markets_842\u002Fdd64d45dfc4c34bea629be26ebd53be8.cf.jpg"},"img:440x246":{"height":246,"width":440,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002FLqwuSCQ_k.ZewGhDsZ81Wg--~B\u002FZmk9c3RyaW07aD0yNDY7cT04MDt3PTQ0MDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen\u002Fbloomberg_markets_842\u002Fdd64d45dfc4c34bea629be26ebd53be8.cf.jpg"}},"type":"article","link":"\u002Fnews\u002Ffinal-virgin-australia-bids-key-190000299.html","id":"03ac5f8f-4f7c-3b3c-aa08-c4b415206248","publisher":"Bloomberg","publisher_id":"bloomberg_markets_842","off_network":false},{"i13n":{"bpos":1,"cpos":21,"cposy":24},"summary":"* Australians are heading for an atypical tax time after COVID-19 saw millions of people work from home.  * This year, there is expected to be a surge in deductions as workers claim everything from COVID-19 protective clothing to home office gear.  * The ATO has encouraged Australians to take their time completing their return and consider using the \"shortcut method\".  * Visit Business Insider Australia's homepage for more stories.* * *Millions of Australians are about to encounter a tax return unlike any other.This year there is expected to be a surge in deductions as workers claim everything from COVID-19 protective clothing to home office gear. Billions, meanwhile, could be left unclaimed as workers forget to include them in their tax return.A survey conducted by Officeworks – one of the major beneficiaries of the woking from home trend – found that one in three Australians are still at their dining room table instead of their office cubicle.With half of those workers splashing out more than $100 to bring their home office up to speed, the ATO expects the number of deductions to soar this year.A normal financial year produces $10 billion in unclaimed expenses. This tax time could see it climb even higher, given just one in six Australians claims to have a good understanding of their tax return, according to Officeworks' research.In anticipation of this, the ATO has introduced a \"shortcut method\" to cover extra deductions and split them between households.\"If you use the shortcut method, all you need to do is keep a record of the hours you worked from home as evidence of your claim,\" ATO Assistant Commissioner Karen Foat said in a statement. \"But it is all-inclusive, meaning you can’t claim for any other working from home expenses.\"Healthcare, retail and hospitality workers, meanwhile, may have a whole host of new claims to make this year.\"Taxpayers working in jobs that require physical contact or close proximity with customers or clients during COVID-19 measures may be able to claim a deduction for items such as gloves, face masks, sanitiser or anti-bacterial spray if they have paid for the items and not been reimbursed,\" Foat said. There is, of course, another group likely to have a very different kind of tax time, as COVID-19 sees real unemployment enter double-digits.\"With more people working from home, working reduced hours or unfortunately not working at all, we expect to see claims for laundry expenses or travel expenses decline this year,\" Foat said.One in two Australians is expected to have lost income due to COVID-19, with 41% working reduced hours.Those stood down are advised to check that any lump payments or redundancy packages have been paid out correctly. One-off or regular payments for stood down workers for example are still taxable.No matter your situation, if you have any queries, the ATO advises you check its website for new information or contact a tax agent for more complicated circumstances.Disclaimer: This article contains general information only and is not intended to be used as personal advice.* * *READ MORE:  * Virtual pubs, Zoom yoga and lunch money: How companies like Canva, Atlassian and TransferWise are engaging staff working from home  * A new survey of Australian office workers has found we like working from home – but distractions and maintaining team culture are big concerns","pubtime":1592802087000,"is_eligible":true,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fau.finance.yahoo.com\u002Fnews\u002Fnormal-financial-sees-10-billion-050127290.html","property":"Business","categoryLabel":"Business","title":"A normal financial year sees $10 billion in unclaimed expenses at tax time.

You’ll make a better deal now!”The administration wielded the same warnings when pressing the World Health Organization during the global Covid-19 pandemic for changes in order to get American funding flowing again, according to a person familiar with the discussions. The demand was the same, the person said: commit to reforms aimed at improving transparency and eradicating a perceived bias toward China, or expect to make more painful concessions if Trump is re-elected.German Chancellor Angela Merkel may already have tasted the risks of snubbing the White House. Days after she refused Trump’s invitation to a G-7 summit he wanted to hold outside Washington this month, the administration announced plans to withdraw a quarter of U.S. troops currently stationed in Germany.Trump said he made that call because Germany still wasn’t on track to meet its commitment as a North Atlantic Treaty Organization member to spend 2% of gross domestic product on defense by 2024. Merkel, meanwhile, attributed her refusal to come to the U.S. to the pandemic, saying it was too early for an in-person meeting like the one Trump proposed.For the time being, countries appear to be holding off on deals with the Trump administration, or sticking to their guns in case a Biden administration softens the American stance. South Korea, for example, is still resisting U.S. demands to pay far more to host the 28,000 U.S. troops stationed on the peninsula, while several European countries are vowing to move ahead with plans to tax tech companies despite a U.S. threat to retaliate with tariffs.‘Pause Button’“A lot of countries in Europe and Asia will hide behind Covid-19 and hit the pause button, saying it is too difficult to do business as usual,” says John Chipman, director-general of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a London-based think tank. With the pandemic unlikely to really wind down before October, that time scale dovetails with the U.S. election.The Trump administration’s domestic response to the coronavirus and recent anti-racism protests may also see foreign capitals choose to wait.Trump’s defense secretary and chairman of the joint chiefs of staff both issued statements this month committing to protecting the U.S. Constitution, thinly veiled rebukes to the president’s ideas of assuming federal control to impose order by force.The rare impression of a U.S. president at public odds with his armed forces was underscored when former military leaders, including Jim Mattis, his first Secretary of Defense, spoke out to condemn Trump more directly. Mattis’s comments have a special resonance abroad -- until his resignation in 2019 he traveled widely to persuade allies that America’s institutions were strong enough to withstand Trump.“All these events taken together will have raised a question as to whether it’s worth investing a lot more in the Trump presidency,” Chipman said.China may be taking a similar wait-and-see approach, according to current and former officials. They say leaders in Beijing have calculated that a second Trump term would serve their interests, mostly because of the damage he’s done to U.S. alliances with other Western nations.Read more: China Warms to Idea of Four More Years of Trump PresidencyTrump has also made no secret of his desire for political favors, according to a forthcoming book by John Bolton, Trump’s former national security adviser, who writes that the president last year asked Chinese President Xi Jinping to buy more agricultural products to help him win votes in battleground states in the 2020 election.Western governments have expressed concern at Trump’s preference for transactional rather than values-based alliances. The U.K. and Canada, for example, balked at Trump’s plan to invite Russian President Vladimir Putin to a deferred G-7 meeting. The group kicked Russia out in 2014 to protest its annexation of Crimea, and Moscow’s interference in Ukraine has only intensified.Handshakes Devalued“Under this president, our handshake is devalued and our values are in tatters,” said Brett McGurk, the former U.S. special envoy to the coalition fighting Islamic State and now a frequent Trump critic. “That reservoir of soft power -- the awesome intangible that Russia or China can never match -- is being drained before the eyes of the world.”Administration officials appear sensitive to the risk they could find themselves treated as lame ducks. They’ve oriented much of their Iran strategy in recent months toward making it more difficult for all parties to the moribund 2015 nuclear deal to revive it should Biden win the White House.Trump, meanwhile, is looking to boost ties with nations skeptical of the European Union such as Poland’s President Andrzej Duda, who visits Washington this week. Meanwhile U.S. special envoy for the Balkans Richard Grenell, a Trump loyalist, has organized a meeting of the leaders of Serbia and Kosovo in Washington June 27, sidelining the EU which had been mediating in the search for a settlement. Tensions in the Balkans have risen as Serbia seeks to block international recognition of Kosovo’s independence, which the former province declared in 2008.Read more: Europe Worries Trump May Wreck Chunk of Merkel’s LegacyAnd by no means are all U.S. partners hesitant to work with Trump. Australia, another proposed G-7 guest, was quick to accept his invitation. Australia and Japan strongly support Trump’s stance on containing China, his planned focus for the summit and a rationale for including Russia.The U.S. in any case remains too powerful to ignore entirely. One European diplomat in Washington said many capitals learned a lesson by betting on Hillary Clinton in 2016, when the prevailing consensus was she would win the presidency.They may also be coming to a more sweeping conclusion: That massive swings in U.S. policy are here to stay, meaning allies will need to rely less on Washington, no matter who wins in November. That’s put a renewed focus on approaching thorny foreign-policy problems from the perspective of pure national interest, rather than as a unified alliance, the diplomat said. Otherwise, the risk of being blindsided by the U.S. is too great.Biden, for example, has pledged to undo Trump policies that were themselves drastic reversals. The former vice president says he’d re-enter the Paris climate agreement on the first day of his administration and review all U.S. tariffs and sanctions imposed under Trump. If Iran were to recommit to its obligations under the nuclear accord the U.S. would “strengthen and extend” the agreement, according to Biden’s campaign website.U.S. unpredictability has been on full display in the global battle against the coronavirus, with the U.S. giving other countries no warning about its decision to defund the WHO -- the latest in a string of international treaties and organizations that Trump has either left or undermined since coming to office.It was clear, too, in the way Trump punished China over its actions in Hong Kong. He stripped the city of some of its privileged trade status without first tipping off even the U.K., Hong Kong’s former colonial overseer and arguably America’s closest ally.Read more: Biden, Trump Quit Praising Xi to Feud Over Who’d Be TougherAmerica’s alliance network, based on a core of defense commitments with 34 nations, is not yet doomed, according to Mira Rapp-Hooper, whose book “Shields of the Republic: The Triumphs and Perils of America’s Alliance” was published this month. “The reason I remain somewhat optimistic is that the cost of doing foreign policy without the U.S. would be much more expensive for any one of our allies” as well as for the U.S. itself, she said.Yet that optimism may fade with a second Trump term. Asked if Trump Mark-II might be able to replace the post-war architecture alliances with a new, more ad hoc and interest-based network of international relationships, she was skeptical.Said Rapp-Hooper, a senior fellow for Asia studies at the New York-based Council on Foreign Relations: “I don’t see the U.S. as a credible builder of a new world order.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","pubtime":1592798401000,"is_eligible":true,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fau.finance.yahoo.com\u002Fnews\u002Fworld-leaders-face-dilemma-deal-040001020.html","property":"Politics","categoryLabel":"Politics","title":"World Leaders Face Dilemma: Deal With Trump or Hang On for Biden","images":{"original":{"height":1333,"width":2000,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002Fo98tz1YLorTF7iWd6s8b0g--~B\u002FaD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen\u002Fbloomberg_markets_842\u002F9946b1df6c758931b6f47da1f8d4c83b.cf.jpg"},"img:220x123":{"height":123,"width":220,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002FJGi89gZMsq_fozeYmOd8XQ--~B\u002FZmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMjM7cT04MDt3PTIyMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen\u002Fbloomberg_markets_842\u002F9946b1df6c758931b6f47da1f8d4c83b.cf.jpg"},"img:440x246":{"height":246,"width":440,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002FS9vCeZ.nzcgaDj.fA1XhDg--~B\u002FZmk9c3RyaW07aD0yNDY7cT04MDt3PTQ0MDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen\u002Fbloomberg_markets_842\u002F9946b1df6c758931b6f47da1f8d4c83b.cf.jpg"}},"type":"article","link":"\u002Fnews\u002Fworld-leaders-face-dilemma-deal-040001020.html","id":"11efb58e-1fe4-349c-bfb2-f6058b85d1a1","publisher":"Bloomberg","publisher_id":"bloomberg_markets_842","off_network":false},{"i13n":{"bpos":1,"cpos":25,"cposy":28},"summary":"Stockland's chief executive Mark Steinert will retire after seven years at the helm, while the property group has flagged a reduced second half distribution.","pubtime":1592797421000,"is_eligible":true,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fau.finance.yahoo.com\u002Fnews\u002Fstockland-lowers-payout-ceo-exit-034341285--spt.html","property":"Business","categoryLabel":"Business","title":"Stockland lowers payout, CEO to exit","images":{"original":{"height":720,"width":1280,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002F2OIGyf9mzBkqqeHzkkVwGQ--~B\u002FaD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u\u002Fhttp:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen_AU\u002FSports\u002Foly_au_aap\u002F5852362_Stockland_16-9_18980440_2016705_202006221106561414b6b6-3c84-4782-b867-2c5efc77d1ee.jpg_sd_1280x720.jpg.cf.jpg"},"img:220x123":{"height":123,"width":220,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002FOjaA7UaRmaI4ZSkof3IzvQ--~B\u002FZmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMjM7cT04MDt3PTIyMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--\u002Fhttp:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen_AU\u002FSports\u002Foly_au_aap\u002F5852362_Stockland_16-9_18980440_2016705_202006221106561414b6b6-3c84-4782-b867-2c5efc77d1ee.jpg_sd_1280x720.jpg.cf.jpg"},"img:440x246":{"height":246,"width":440,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002FVTQVsbuKMiV.lUrjN79k7w--~B\u002FZmk9c3RyaW07aD0yNDY7cT04MDt3PTQ0MDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--\u002Fhttp:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen_AU\u002FSports\u002Foly_au_aap\u002F5852362_Stockland_16-9_18980440_2016705_202006221106561414b6b6-3c84-4782-b867-2c5efc77d1ee.jpg_sd_1280x720.jpg.cf.jpg"}},"type":"article","link":"\u002Fnews\u002Fstockland-lowers-payout-ceo-exit-034341285--spt.html","id":"fb9042a3-c0c5-33d6-9a2b-935fe79b1776","publisher":"Australian Associated Press","publisher_id":"aap.com.au","off_network":false},{"i13n":{"bpos":1,"cpos":26,"cposy":29},"summary":"(Bloomberg) -- Australians eager for a getaway after months of coronavirus lockdowns are likely to spark a domestic travel recovery as international borders remain closed, according to RBC Capital Markets.“With a potentially increased number of consumers shifting overseas holiday dollars to domestic trips in the coming months, a number of travel companies under coverage are well placed to capture a share of this demand,” RBC analysts led by Tim Piper wrote.The nation’s travel-booking firms plunged this year as border curbs and social distancing measures dampened demand. Flight Centre Travel Group Ltd. and Webjet Ltd. both tapped shareholders for additional capital to weather the health crisis, while Helloworld Travel Ltd. in March stood down a substantial portion of its workforce. As lockdowns ease, the shift to domestic travel will likely underpin gains for these companies, according to RBC.Broad tourist-related travel in and out of Australia probably won’t return until 2021, according to the government. The nation’s largest airline, Qantas Airways Ltd., canceled most international flights until late October after the announcement.Australians spend roughly the same amount per night on domestic and international excursions, though overseas trips usually cost more as they last longer. The average holiday abroad cost A$8,500 ($5,817) and lasted 24 days in 2019, according to Tourism Research Australia and Council of Australian Tour Operators data analyzed by RBC. A vacation closer to home set travelers back A$958 and lasted 3.5 days.Assets in holiday hotspots such as Kangaroo Island and Fraser Island make SeaLink Travel Group Ltd. best-placed to benefit from a domestic travel boom, RBC said. Corporate Travel Management Ltd. will see a boost as business trips pick up, and is likely to report one of the “least bad” earnings results for the second half compared to peers, the analysts added.Still, even domestic travel may be limited as individual states keep their borders closed and the threat of additional coronavirus outbreaks loom. Australia’s second-most populous state, Victoria, has tightened Covid-19 controls as a spike in cases raises concerns about a potential second wave.For more articles like this, please visit us at

Morningstar categories help investors and investment professionals make meaningful comparisons between funds. The categories make it easier to build well-diversified portfolios, assess potential risk and identify top-performing funds. We place funds in a given category based on their portfolio statistics and compositions over the past three years. If the fund is new and has no portfolio history, we estimate where it will fall before giving it a more permanent category assignment. Where necessary, we may change a category assignment based on recent changes to the portfolio.","MORNINGSTAR_CATEGORY":"Morningstar category","MORNINGSTAR_STYLE_BOX_DESC":"Yahoo partners with Morningstar, a leading market research and investment data group to help investors rate and compare funds on Yahoo Finance.

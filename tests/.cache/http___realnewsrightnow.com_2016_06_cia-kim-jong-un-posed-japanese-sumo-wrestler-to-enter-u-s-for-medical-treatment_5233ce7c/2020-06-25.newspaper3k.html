<div><p>NEW YORK, Ny. &#8211; A cache of top-secret documents published by the controversial whistle-blower website Wikileaks on Monday revealed that in September of 2014, North Korea&#8217;s Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un traveled in secret to the United States where, posing as a Japanese sumo wrestler, he underwent ankle surgery at one of New York City&#8217;s most prestigious hospitals.</p>
<p>In October of 2014, South Korea&#8217;s National Intelligence Service reported in a briefing to lawmakers that a cyst had been found on the North Korean dictator&#8217;s right ankle. Intelligence analysts believed at the time that due to possible muscle or nerve damage, Kim had undergone surgery to remove the cyst at the hands of several &#8220;European experts&#8221; that were flown to Pyongyang.</p>

<p>However, according to internal CIA communications obtained by Wikileaks, Kim and a small entourage, all carrying forged Japanese passports and identification papers, flew from Beijing International Airport on a direct flight to New York&#8217;s JFK International Airport. &#8220;From the moment they landed, they were under intense surveillance,&#8221; a U.S. intelligence official speaking on condition of anonymity told The New York Times.&#160;</p>
<p>Kim Jong-un, accompanied by a handful of high-ranking North Korean officials, checked into the Plaza, a five-star luxury hotel opposite Central Park on Fifth Avenue. According to hotel records obtained by&#160;The New York Times, Kim was registered under the name &#8216;Keito Kamatsu&#8217; and prior to his arrival, hotel staff were briefed on Kim&#8217;s fictitious status as a world-renowned sumo champion.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were absolutely delighted to host Mr. Keito,&#8221; Grace Baldwin, a concierge at the Plaza hotel, told the&#160;New York Daily News. Ms. Baldwin described Kim as jovial yet reserved. He reminded her of &#8220;an over-sized teddy bear, like the kind they used to sell at FAO Schwarz.&#8221; Baldwin went on to say that Kim and his entourage racked up more than $26,000 in room service charges during their three-week stay. &#8220;Most of it was spent on desserts,&#8221; she admitted.</p>
<p>However, splurging on lavish desserts wasn&#8217;t all the autocratic dictator did while visiting the Big Apple. On September 19, 2014, Kim Jong-un checked into the New York-Presbyterian Hospital where he underwent surgery to remove the cyst on his ankle. According to a document marked TOP SECRET//SCI//NOFORN, meaning sensitive compartmentalized information that should not be viewed by foreign nationals, two members of the CIA&#8217;s Special Activities Division were present and posing as hospital staff during the procedure.</p>
<p>Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who reviewed the classified material in full, said it&#8217;s not clear what role &#8211; if any &#8211; the CIA agents might have played during Kim&#8217;s operation at New York-Presbyterian. &#8220;Were they merely there to observe or was there a more sinister purpose behind their presence?&#8221; Assange speculated as to whether the CIA may have implanted a tracking device in the North Korean leader&#8217;s ankle before doctors had a chance to sew him up and send him on his way.</p>

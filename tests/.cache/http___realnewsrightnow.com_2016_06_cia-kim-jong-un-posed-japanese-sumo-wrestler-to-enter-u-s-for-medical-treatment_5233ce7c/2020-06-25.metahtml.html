Intelligence analysts believed at the time that due to possible muscle or nerve damage, Kim had undergone surgery to remove the cyst at the hands of several &#8220;European experts&#8221; that were flown to Pyongyang.</p><p>However, according to internal CIA communications obtained by Wikileaks, Kim and a small entourage, all carrying forged Japanese passports and identification papers, flew from Beijing International Airport on a direct flight to New York&#8217;s JFK International Airport. &#8220;From the moment they landed, they were under intense surveillance,&#8221; a U.S. intelligence official speaking on condition of anonymity told The New York Times.&#160;</p><p>Kim Jong-un, accompanied by a handful of high-ranking North Korean officials, checked into the Plaza, a five-star luxury hotel opposite Central Park on Fifth Avenue. According to hotel records obtained by&#160;The New York Times, Kim was registered under the name &#8216;Keito Kamatsu&#8217; and prior to his arrival, hotel staff were briefed on Kim&#8217;s fictitious status as a world-renowned sumo champion.</p><p>&#8220;We were absolutely delighted to host Mr. Keito,&#8221; Grace Baldwin, a concierge at the Plaza hotel, told the&#160;New York Daily News. Ms. Baldwin described Kim as jovial yet reserved. He reminded her of &#8220;an over-sized teddy bear, like the kind they used to sell at FAO Schwarz.&#8221; Baldwin went on to say that Kim and his entourage racked up more than $26,000 in room service charges during their three-week stay. &#8220;Most of it was spent on desserts,&#8221; she admitted.</p><p>However, splurging on lavish desserts wasn&#8217;t all the autocratic dictator did while visiting the Big Apple. On September 19, 2014, Kim Jong-un checked into the New York-Presbyterian Hospital where he underwent surgery to remove the cyst on his ankle. According to a document marked TOP SECRET//SCI//NOFORN, meaning sensitive compartmentalized information that should not be viewed by foreign nationals, two members of the CIA&#8217;s Special Activities Division were present and posing as hospital staff during the procedure.</p><p>Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who reviewed the classified material in full, said it&#8217;s not clear what role &#8211; if any &#8211; the CIA agents might have played during Kim&#8217;s operation at New York-Presbyterian. &#8220;Were they merely there to observe or was there a more sinister purpose behind their presence?&#8221; Assange speculated as to whether the CIA may have implanted a tracking device in the North Korean leader&#8217;s ankle before doctors had a chance to sew him up and send him on his way.</p><h3 class="sd-title">Share the News:</h3><ul><li class="share-facebook"><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" class="share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text" href="http://realnewsrightnow.com/2016/06/cia-kim-jong-un-posed-japanese-sumo-wrestler-to-enter-u-s-for-medical-treatment/?share=facebook" target="_blank" title="Click to share on Facebook"><span class="sharing-screen-reader-text">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class="share-email"><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" class="share-email sd-button share-icon no-text" href="http://realnewsrightnow.com/2016/06/cia-kim-jong-un-posed-japanese-sumo-wrestler-to-enter-u-s-for-medical-treatment/?share=email" target="_blank" title="Click to email this to a friend"><span class="sharing-screen-reader-text">Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class="share-twitter"><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" class="share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text" href="http://realnewsrightnow.com/2016/06/cia-kim-jong-un-posed-japanese-sumo-wrestler-to-enter-u-s-for-medical-treatment/?share=twitter" target="_blank" title="Click to share on Twitter"><span class="sharing-screen-reader-text">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class="share-reddit"><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" class="share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text" href="http://realnewsrightnow.com/2016/06/cia-kim-jong-un-posed-japanese-sumo-wrestler-to-enter-u-s-for-medical-treatment/?share=reddit" target="_blank" title="Click to share on Reddit"><span class="sharing-screen-reader-text">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class="share-jetpack-whatsapp"><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" class="share-jetpack-whatsapp sd-button share-icon no-text" href="http://realnewsrightnow.com/2016/06/cia-kim-jong-un-posed-japanese-sumo-wrestler-to-enter-u-s-for-medical-treatment/?share=jetpack-whatsapp" target="_blank" title="Click to share on WhatsApp"><span class="sharing-screen-reader-text">Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li><a href="#" class="sharing-anchor sd-button share-more"><span>More</span></a></li></ul><ul><li class="share-tumblr"><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" class="share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text" href="http://realnewsrightnow.com/2016/06/cia-kim-jong-un-posed-japanese-sumo-wrestler-to-enter-u-s-for-medical-treatment/?share=tumblr" target="_blank" title="Click to share on Tumblr"><span class="sharing-screen-reader-text">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class="share-linkedin"><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" class="share-linkedin sd-button share-icon no-text" href="http://realnewsrightnow.com/2016/06/cia-kim-jong-un-posed-japanese-sumo-wrestler-to-enter-u-s-for-medical-treatment/?share=linkedin" target="_blank" title="Click to share on LinkedIn"><span class="sharing-screen-reader-text">Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class="share-pinterest"><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" class="share-pinterest sd-button share-icon no-text" href="http://realnewsrightnow.com/2016/06/cia-kim-jong-un-posed-japanese-sumo-wrestler-to-enter-u-s-for-medical-treatment/?share=pinterest" target="_blank" title="Click to share on Pinterest"><span class="sharing-screen-reader-text">Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class="share-print"><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" class="share-print sd-button share-icon no-text" href="http://realnewsrightnow.com/2016/06/cia-kim-jong-un-posed-japanese-sumo-wrestler-to-enter-u-s-for-medical-treatment/#print" target="_blank" title="Click to print"><span class="sharing-screen-reader-text">Click to print (Opens in new window)</span></a></li></ul><section id="authorpage" class="authorpage"><p class="author-content">

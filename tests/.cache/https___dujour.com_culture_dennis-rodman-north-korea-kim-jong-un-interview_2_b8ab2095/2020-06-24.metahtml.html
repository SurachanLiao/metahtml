Now Dennis Rodman is ready to talk</p><p class="bylines">Written by <a href="https://dujour.com/contributors/lindsay-silberman/">Lindsay Silberman</a></p><p>Photographed by Alex John Beck</p><p>Produced by Jason Binn</p></p><p id="caption-attachment-42900" class="wp-caption-text">Dennis Rodman; photo by Alex John Beck</p><p>DJ:&#160;You&#8217;ve said in the past that Kim Jong-un <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2013/03/dennis-rodman-kim-jong-un-wants-president-obama-to-call-him/" target="_blank">wants President Obama to call him</a>. Can you elaborate on that?</p><p>DR:&#160;He really, really wants to talk to Obama. He can&#8217;t say it enough. He wants to talk to him to try to open that door a little bit. He&#8217;s saying that he doesn&#8217;t want to bomb anybody. He said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to kill Americans.&#8221; He loves Americans.</p><p>DJ:&#160;Have you ever seen anything alarming in your time there?</p><p>DR:&#160;It&#8217;s just like any other country, you go to Russia, Germany, you&#8217;re gonna see soldiers all over the place. You see soldiers that carry guns and sit at the airports. It&#8217;s just like that.</p><p>DJ:&#160;But the difference is that in North Korea there are hundreds of thousands of people suffering and starving in labor camps.</p><p>DR:&#160;You name any country in the world&#8230; Which country does not have that shit? Every country has that.</p><p>DJ:&#160;When you hear that people are dying of malnourishment and being overworked&#8212;have you been in the fields, have you seen that?</p><p>DR:&#160;I&#8217;ve seen it. They work for peanuts. But like I said, he&#8217;s not like his grandfather or father. He&#8217;s not like that. He&#8217;s actually trying to change it. He&#8217;s actually doing cool things for these people, and that&#8217;s why they love him so much.</p><p>DJ:&#160;And the accusations about him <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/south-korean-kim-jong-un-killed-uncles-family-2014-1" target="_blank">having his family members killed</a>&#8230;</p><p>DR:&#160;You could say anything here about North Korea and people would believe it. The last time I went there, when they said they killed his girlfriend, they killed his uncle, they just fed him to the dogs&#8230; They were standing right behind me.</p><p>DJ:&#160;You&#8217;re saying that the uncle that the North Korean government itself&#160;<span><a href="http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/2013/201312/news13/20131213-05ee.html" target="_blank">confirms was executed</a> is actually alive?</span></p><p>DR: He was standing right there.</p><p>DJ: Are you ever concerned about your safety when you&#8217;re over there?</p><p>DR: I love my country. I love my country to death. And there&#8217;s no other place in the world I&#8217;d rather live. But if I go to North Korea&#8212;the next time I go to North Korea&#8212;the fear for me of not coming back&#8230; It won&#8217;t be because of North Korea. So I&#8217;m just letting you know right now&#8230; [long pause] That&#8217;s the real truth. Read between the lines on that one.</p><p>DJ: So you think the American government would have a problem with you coming back into the country?</p><p>DR: When I go there, it&#8217;s going to be a problem coming back. Because they could actually stop me from coming back. They could actually pull my passport. They already told me that. They&#8217;re afraid of me because I know so much.</p><p>DJ:<span> &#8220;They&#8221; being&#8230;?</span></p><p>DR: Americans. Our government. They&#8217;ve got to be careful what they say, what they do, so I respect that. But for me, I mean, it&#8217;s freedom of speech. I&#8217;m not hurting anybody, I&#8217;m not putting anybody in danger, I&#8217;m just telling what I see. I have that leverage now that no one in the world has.</p><p>DJ: Is it true you&#8217;re being indicted by the U.S. Treasury?</p><p>DR: They want to indict me. And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;For what?&#8221; Treason. They&#8217;ve threatened me. They said I gave his wife a fur coat, a dress, I gave all these gifts. I was like, &#8220;I did? No I didn&#8217;t!&#8221;</p><p>DJ: Have you ever asked the U.S. government for support?</p><p>DR: I said six months ago [to the government], &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you guys help me?&#8221; They didn&#8217;t even give me a f&#8211;king response, so I was like, f&#8211;k it. I just wish people would actually take advantage of the situation that I have, instead of ridiculing me about everything I do. It&#8217;s so unfair. It&#8217;s very hard to try to do something like that in North Korea by yourself when the government don&#8217;t want to help you.</p><p>DJ: Why do you think that is?</p><p>DR: If Magic Johnson went over there, it would have been a whole different story. He would have had so many people helping him to do some good stuff for the world. But I did this all by myself. I want to go back and take a couple people with me so they could actually see it and say, &#8220;Hey, you know what? It&#8217;s actually true what he&#8217;s been saying.&#8221;</p><p>DJ: Who do you have in mind?</p><p>DR: I asked Oprah to go with me next time. I&#8217;ve asked quite a few people.</p><p>DJ: Does this make you more interested in politics or less?</p><p>DR: People put me in a category as this diplomat, this ambassador, which I don&#8217;t want to be. This is a sports thing. In 10 to 15 years, this is going to be historical. Watch. Because I went there for sports. No one&#8217;s ever done that! It&#8217;s using sports to open the doors for communication around the world. Going through sports, not through politics. So that people can see North Korea in a great light. That little kid is changing North Korea for the better, and once we see that, maybe he&#8217;ll just loosen up and start opening the door for the people of the world. That&#8217;s it.</p><p><a href="http://dujour.com/article/dennis-rodman-north-korea-kim-jong-un-video/42902">Click here to watch a video from the interview.</a></p><p>(This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.

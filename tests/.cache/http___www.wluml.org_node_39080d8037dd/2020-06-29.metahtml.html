Book II &#8211; Hodoud (Shari&#8217;a-based Punishments)
</p><p>
Section I &#8211; Shari&#8217;a-based Punishment for Adultery
</p><p>
Chapter 1- Definition and Reasons for Adultery Punishment</p>
<p>
Article 63 &#8211; Adultery is defined as the intercourse between a man and a woman whose intercourse is inherently forbidden &#8220;haraam&#8221;, even if it is from behind, other than those cases where the person has had a doubt [i.e., mistaken identity].
</p><p>
Article 64 &#8211; Adultery is punished when the adulterer is mature*, sane, and acting by free will and is also aware of the offence and its punishment.
</p><p>
Article 65 &#8211; If a man or a woman is aware that the intercourse with the other party is forbidden, and the other party is not aware, thinking that the intercourse is legitimate, then only the party who has been aware that the intercourse is forbidden shall be sentenced to the punishment.
</p><p>
Article 66 &#8211; If a man or a woman who have had intercourse together claim mistake and unawareness, then in the case that the claimant deems honest, then the claim is accepted without oath and witness and the punishment is annulled.
</p><p>
Article 67 &#8211; If an adulterer claims that s/he has committed adultery under duress, her/his claim is accepted if the contrary is not believed to be true.
</p><p>
Chapter 2- Methods of Proving Adultery in Court
</p><p>
Article 68 &#8211; If a man or woman confesses to adultery four times before the judge, s/he will be sentenced to the adultery punishment and if they confess less than four times, then s/he will be punished by Tazeer. [Tazeer refers to the punishments that are not defined by Sharia&#8217; and it is left to the Sharia&#8217; Judge to specify it by sentence to imprisonment, cash fine, or flogging in which case the number of lashes must be less than Hodoud.]
</p><p>
Article 69 &#8211; The confession is valid when the confessor has the virtues of maturity*, sanity, willingness, and liberty.
</p><p>
Article 70 &#8211; The confession must be explicit or appear to be not inconsistent with the case.
</p><p>
Article 71 &#8211; If a person confesses to adultery and then denies it, if the adultery is to be punished by killing or stoning**, then the denial annuls the punishment of killing and stoning. Otherwise, with the denial after the confession the punishment is not annulled.
</p><p>
Article 72 &#8211; If a person confesses to the type of adultery that is punishable and then repents, the judge can either ask the Head of Judiciary for clemency or carry out the punishment.
</p><p>
Article 73 &#8211; A woman who does not have a husband, shall not be punished for becoming pregnant unless her adultery is proven by one of the methods mentioned in this law.
</p><p>
Article 74 &#8211; Adultery, when punishable by either flogging or stoning, can be proven by the testimony of either four just men, or three just men and two just women.
</p><p>
Article 75 &#8211; If adultery is punishable by flogging, then it could also be proven by the testimony of two just men and four just women.
</p><p>
Article 76 &#8211; The testimony by women alone or along with the testimony of a just man does not prove adultery but the witnesses will be subject to the punishment for false accusation (Qazf) as specified by the law. [Qazf: is defined as accusing a person of adultery or anal sex. It is punishable by 80 lashes. (Article 139)]
</p><p>
Article 77 &#8211; The testimony of the witnesses must be clear and without ambiguity and based on observation and testimony based on conjectures is not credible.
</p><p>
Article 78 &#8211; If the witnesses describe the specifics of the subject of testimony, there should be no discrepancy in their descriptions in terms of the time, place, and such. In case of discrepancy among witnesses&#8217; testimonies, then not only the adultery is not proven but the witnesses will be sentenced to punishment for false accusation (Qazf).
</p><p>
Article 79 &#8211; The witnesses must testify one after another without any lapse of time. If some of the witnesses testify and then some other witnesses are not immediately present to testify or do not testify, then adultery is not proven. In this case, the witness will be subject to punishment for false accusation (Qazf).
</p><p>
Article 80 &#8211; The adultery punishment shall be executed immediately except for the cases described in the later articles.
</p><p>
Article 81 &#8211; If the adulterer repents prior to the testimony, then the punishment is annulled and if s/he repents after the testimony, then the punishment is not annulled.

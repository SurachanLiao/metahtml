                    South Korea played down a report Tuesday that the North's leader&#160;Kim&#160;Jong&#160;Un&#160;was being treated after surgery, as speculation mounted over his absence from a key anniversary.

    </p><p><a target="_self" href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/north-korea/">Pyongyang</a> marked the birthday of its late founder,&#160;<a target="_self" href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/kim-jong-un/">Kim</a>'s grandfather&#160;Kim&#160;Il Sung, on April 15 -- by far the most important date in its annual political calendar -- but&#160;Kim&#160;was not seen in attendance.</p><p>Daily NK, an online media outlet run mostly by North Korean defectors, said&#160;Kim&#160;had undergone a cardiovascular procedure earlier this month and was recovering at a villa in North Phyongan province.</p><p>"Excessive smoking, obesity, and fatigue were the direct causes of&#160;Kim's urgent cardiovascular treatment," it cited an unidentified source inside the country as saying.</p><p>No confirmation of the report was immediately available.</p><p>But it triggered widespread speculation, with CNN citing a US official saying that <a target="_self" href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/usa/">Washington</a> was "monitoring intelligence" that&#160;Kim&#160;was in "grave danger after a surgery". The report did not specify what the intelligence was.</p><p>In a statement, a spokesman for the South's presidential Blue House said: "We have nothing to confirm and no special movement has been detected inside North Korea as of now."</p><p>Some South Korean officials raised doubts about the credibility of the sourcing.</p><p>Reporting from inside the isolated country is notoriously difficult, especially on anything to do with the North's leadership, which is among its most closely-guarded secrets.</p><p>Both the unification ministry -- which handles inter-Korean relations -- and the defence ministry declined to comment.</p><p>Moon Chung-in, the security adviser to South Korean President Moon Jae-in, told AFP that he had not heard anything on&#160;Kim's health.</p><p>The North's state media last reported on&#160;Kim's activities on April 12, but previous absences on his part from the public eye have also prompted speculation about his health.</p><p>Analysts expressed caution over the Daily NK report.</p><p>Ahn Chan-il, a defector-turned-researcher based in Seoul, said heart surgery required sophisticated medical equipment "only accessible in facilities in Pyongyang", adding it was "unreasonable" to transport it elsewhere for the operation.</p><p>"Nothing is confirmed at this point, and it's too early to make a conclusion about his condition," he added.</p></article>

The report did not specify what the intelligence was.</p><p>In a statement, a spokesman for the South's presidential Blue House said: "We have nothing to confirm and no special movement has been detected inside North Korea as of now."</p><p>Some South Korean officials raised doubts about the credibility of the sourcing.</p><p>Reporting from inside the isolated country is notoriously difficult, especially on anything to do with the North's leadership, which is among its most closely-guarded secrets.</p><p>Both the unification ministry -- which handles inter-Korean relations -- and the defence ministry declined to comment.</p><p>Moon Chung-in, the security adviser to South Korean President Moon Jae-in, told AFP that he had not heard anything on Kim's health.</p><p>The North's state media last reported on Kim's activities on April 12, but previous absences on his part from the public eye have also prompted speculation about his health.</p><p>Analysts expressed caution over the Daily NK report.</p><p>Ahn Chan-il, a defector-turned-researcher based in Seoul, said heart surgery required sophisticated medical equipment "only accessible in facilities in Pyongyang", adding it was "unreasonable" to transport it elsewhere for the operation.</p><p>"Nothing is confirmed at this point, and it's too early to make a conclusion about his condition," he added.</p></article> <p><del>(AFP)</del></p><del> </del><p class="o-self-promo__text"><del><strong>Daily newsletter</strong>Receive essential international news every morning</del></p><del> </del><p class="o-self-promo__picto-newsletter"><del></del></p><del> </del><del><a href="https://emailing.france24.com/en/subscribe" target="_blank" class="o-self-promo__link o-self-promo__link--newsletter">Subscribe

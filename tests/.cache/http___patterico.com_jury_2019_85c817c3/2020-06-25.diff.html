              9:49 am                          </ins></p> <p>It is the first Sunday after Christmas. Today’s Bach piece is Part VI of his Christmas Oratorio, BWV 248:</p> <p>Today’s Gospel reading is <a href="" target="_blank">Matthew 2:13-23</a>:</p> <blockquote><p>The Escape to Egypt</p> <p>When they had gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream. “Get up,” he said, “take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him.”</p> <p>So he got up, took the child and his mother during the night and left for Egypt, where he stayed until the death of Herod. And so was fulfilled what the Lord had said through the prophet: “Out of Egypt I called my son.”</p> <p>When Herod realized that he had been outwitted by the Magi, he was furious, and he gave orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old and under, in accordance with the time he had learned from the Magi. Then what was said through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled:</p> <p>“A voice is heard in Ramah, 
    weeping and great mourning, 
Rachel weeping for her children 
    and refusing to be comforted, 
    because they are no more.”</p> <p>The Return to Nazareth</p> <p>After Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt and said, “Get up, take the child and his mother and go to the land of Israel, for those who were trying to take the child’s life are dead.”</p> <p>So he got up, took the child and his mother and went to the land of Israel. But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning in Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. Having been warned in a dream, he withdrew to the district of Galilee, and he went and lived in a town called Nazareth. So was fulfilled what was said through the prophets, that he would be called a Nazarene.</p></blockquote> <p><ins>The text of today’s piece is available <a href="http://www.emmanuelmusic.org/notes_translations/translations_cantata/t_bwv248-6.htm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here Link: http://www.emmanuelmusic.org/notes_translations/translations_cantata/t_bwv248-6.htm </a>. It contains these words:</ins></p><ins> </ins><blockquote><p><ins>Then Herod summoned the sages secretly and cleverly discovered from them when the star had appeared. And he directed them towards Bethlehem and said: 
— Go there and seek diligently for the infant, and when you find it, report to me, so that I can also come and pay my devotions to it. —</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>. . . .</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Liar, you seek only to destroy the Lord; 
You employ all false trickery 
to supplant the Savior; 
yet He, whose power no man can measure, 
remains in secure hands. 
Your heart, your false heart is already, 
with all its deceit, very well known 
to the Son of the Highest whom you seek to crush.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>. . . .</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>And God commanded them in a dream that they should not journey back to Herod, and they travelled by another way back to their own land.</ins></p></blockquote><ins> </ins><p><ins>Happy listening!

Despite some $1 billion in public and private spending, more people live on the streets than ever before. But rather than focus on the causes — addiction, mental illness and social breakdown — progressives in local government have waged war against abstract forces of oppression.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Last week, Seattle homeless ­advocates hosted their annual conference under the theme of “Decolonizing Our Collective Work.” ­According to the organizers, to reduce homelessness, government should prioritize “unpacking the current structures of power” and “examine the legacies of structural racism in our systems” to “co-design a path towards liberation with black, ­indigenous, brown and other marginalized communities.”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>What does all that mean?</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The director of King County’s homelessness program, Kira Zylstra, used taxpayer funds to hire a transgender stripper to perform during the conference. According to The Seattle Times, the stripper, Beyoncé Black St. James, “danced topless in a sheer bodysuit, gave lap dances and kissed attendees.” The audience — representatives from the region’s taxpayer-funded nonprofits and government agencies — clapped, cheered and handed St. James dollar bills.</ins></p></blockquote><ins> </ins><p><ins>Second news item:  <a href="https://apnews.com/e14a600779dddcabb8a3a809573285e2">Elizabeth Warren’s purity test backfires, revealing her own stunning hypocrisy: Link: https://apnews.com/e14a600779dddcabb8a3a809573285e2 </a></ins></p><ins> </ins><blockquote><p><ins>On a Saturday evening in June 2018, with temperatures in the 70s and the Red Sox playing at Fenway Park, supporters of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren gathered at the City Winery Boston for a fundraiser.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>They were treated to songs by the Grammy-winning artist Melissa Etheridge and heard remarks from Warren, who was months away from announcing her campaign for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.

Later, she added, “I do not sell access to my time.”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>…Even after her pledge not to hold private fundraisers, Warren has continued to attend the very kind of events for which she has criticized others. She has headlined fundraisers for the Democratic National Committee in settings that raise handsome sums, and she said she would continue to do that if she were the nominee, so that Democrats would not be at a financial disadvantage against President Donald Trump.</ins></p></blockquote><ins> </ins><p><ins>Third news item:  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/131201286936061/posts/2925457574177071/">Franklin Graham spills the beans about his father, and glosses over Trump’s behavior   Link: https://www.facebook.com/131201286936061/posts/2925457574177071/ </a> because the end justifies the means: </ins></p><ins> </ins><blockquote><p><ins>… Yes, my father Billy Graham founded Christianity Today; but no, he would not agree with their opinion piece. In fact, he would be very disappointed. I have not previously shared who my father voted for in the past election, but because of this article, I feel it is necessary to share it now. My father knew Donald Trump, he believed in Donald Trump, and he voted for Donald Trump. He believed that Donald J. Trump was the man for this hour in history for our nation.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Look at all the President has accomplished in a very short time. The economy of our nation is the strongest it has been in 50 years, ISIS &amp; the caliphate have been defeated, and the President has renegotiated trade deals to benefit all Americans. The list of accomplishments is long, but for me as a Christian, the fact that he is the most pro-life president in modern history is extremely important—and Christianity Today wants us to ignore that, to say it doesn’t count? The President has been a staunch defender of religious freedom at home and around the world—and Christianity Today wants us to ignore that? Also the President has appointed conservative judges in record number—and Christianity today wants us to ignore that? Christianity Today feels he should be removed from office because of false accusations that the President emphatically denies.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Is President Trump guilty of sin?

              8:40 am                          </ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Prof. Jonathan Adler has an excellent piece in the New York Daily News titled <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/ny-oped-why-the-house-must-vote-yes-20191218-fptgdb67ejfrlatwu7cv2vieg4-story.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Why the House must vote yes: Trump is the one who is upsetting our democracy and constitutional order Link: https://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/ny-oped-why-the-house-must-vote-yes-20191218-fptgdb67ejfrlatwu7cv2vieg4-story.html </a>. What I especially like about the piece is that Adler emphasizes what I think is most important: Trump’s Ukraine call is not a one-off, but part of a consistent pattern of abusing the office for personal gain:</ins></p><ins> </ins><blockquote><p><ins>A president who uses his power to subvert the workings of our constitutional structure has forfeited any claim to the office, whether or not that president pursues policies or appoints judges we might otherwise support.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>If it was correct for Congress to impeach a president for lying under oath in an effort to subvert a legal proceeding — as I believe it was — impeaching President Trump should be a no-brainer.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The current push for impeachment was triggered by revelations that the president sought to induce Ukrainian government officials to announce an investigation into a political rival by withholding congressionally authorized funds. These actions, which are virtually indisputable, represent a profound betrayal of the president’s oath and solemn obligations to our country and Constitution, but they are hardly the only impeachable actions Trump has committed.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>On repeated occasions, the president sought to obstruct a lawful inquiry into Russian efforts to interfere with our elections, according to the Mueller Report, including by directing subordinates to create false records that could be used to mislead investigators and dangling pardons before colleagues facing criminal prosecution.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>He has also encouraged foreign governments to seek to influence U.S. elections (in his favor, of course) and obstructed legitimate congressional investigations into matters large and small, ranging from the Ukraine matter to his compliance with the Constitution’s foreign emoluments clause. He has further given every indication that he sees nothing wrong with his conduct — it is “perfect,” after all — and is likely to continue.</ins></p></blockquote><ins> </ins><p><ins>Here’s Trump today, whining about how he was not entitled to witnesses in the House (not entirely true), despite the fact that when he goes to the Senate he … won’t be presenting any witnesses. Sure, he’s engaged in a little kabuki show about how he wants to, but he knows that witness testimony would be bad for him, because the facts and the truth are bad for him. He supposedly wanted to testify to Mueller too. Right.</ins></p><ins> </ins><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><ins>Trump suggests Adam Schiff should face severe punishment for paraphrasing his Zelensky call during a hearing: "In Guatemala they handle things much tougher than that." <a href="https://t.co/bUMrsKJpyv">pic.twitter.com/bUMrsKJpyv Link: https://t.co/bUMrsKJpyv </a></ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>— Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) <a href="https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1207028418656768000?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 17, 2019 Link: https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1207028418656768000?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw </a></ins></p></blockquote><ins> </ins><p><ins>He has a little shot about Schiff and how they handle people like him “much tougher” in Guatemala. Well. In 1945 the Italians handled a problem with their leader in a manner much tougher than this impeachment. So?</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Stuff like this is a reminder why he needs to be gone yesterday.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>The House must vote yes. If for no other reason, they must do it so that in the future, I can refer to the president as “impeached president Donald Trump.”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>P.S. If you’re outraged at the notion that a conservative site would support impeachment of a Republican president, I’ve got good news for you. Eleven years ago, Donald Trump indicated that <a href="https://t.co/ML46WfBsSz?amp=1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">he thought impeachment of a Republican president would have been a “wonderful thing” Link: https://t.co/ML46WfBsSz?amp=1 </a>:</ins></p><ins> </ins><blockquote><p><ins>“When [Pelosi] first got in and was named speaker,” Trump said to Blitzer then, “I met her. And I’m very impressed by her. I think she’s a very impressive person, I like her a lot.”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>“But I was surprised that she didn’t do more in terms of Bush and going after Bush,” he continued. “It just seemed like she was really going to look to impeach Bush and get him out of office. Which personally I think would have been a wonderful thing.”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>“For the war,” Trump replied. “For the war! Well, he lied! He got us into the war with lies!”</ins></p></blockquote><ins> </ins><p><ins>So supporting impeachment of a Republican president is acceptable, it turns out. After all, if Trump does it, it’s OK. That’s the law!</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Anyway, Trump will be impeached today. Which personally I think will be a wonderful thing.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="feedback"><ins><a href="http://patterico.com/jury/2019/12/18/the-house-should-impeach-donald-trump/#respond">Comments (0) Link: http://patterico.com/jury/2019/12/18/the-house-should-impeach-donald-trump/#respond </a> </ins></p><ins> </ins><h2><ins>12/17/2019</ins></h2><ins> </ins><p class="post" id="post-7655"><ins></ins></p><h3 class="storytitle"><ins><a href="http://patterico.com/jury/2019/12/17/slow-news-day/" rel="bookmark">Slow News Day Link: http://patterico.com/jury/2019/12/17/slow-news-day/ </a></ins></h3><ins> </ins><p class="meta"><ins>Filed under:              <a href="http://patterico.com/jury/category/uncategorized/" rel="category tag">Uncategorized Link: http://patterico.com/jury/category/uncategorized/ </a> —

              1:01 pm                          </ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>[guest post by Dana]</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>It’s a given that any House member selected by Nancy Pelosi to be an impeachment manager will see his or her political career boosted as a result.  And while there is some demurring about even thinking about being selected, we all know that politicians love the spotlight and any opportunity to be in it (for a perceived noble cause, that is) and raise their profiles is goal-worthy.  <a href="https://www.rollcall.com/news/house-members-eye-high-profile-impeachment-assignment">And it doesn’t get any more high profile than an impeachment:   Link: https://www.rollcall.com/news/house-members-eye-high-profile-impeachment-assignment </a></ins></p><ins> </ins><blockquote><p><ins>Speaker Nancy Pelosi will decide who and how many impeachment managers will travel to the other side of the Capitol to make arguments, present evidence, question witnesses and more in just the third time in U.S. history that a sitting president has been on trial before the Senate.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Her picks can be political as well as legal, some Democratic lawmakers say. The California Democrat would want members with trial experience who understand the Constitution and the case well — particularly because they must fight in a Republican-controlled Senate.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>But Pelosi also holds an opportunity to showcase diversity among the Democratic caucus and spotlight rising members who could use the historic Senate trial as a way to boost their national profile or fundraising power…</ins></p></blockquote><ins> </ins><p><ins>While some Democrats claim that they “haven’t given it any thought,”  others are jockeying for position:  </ins></p><ins> </ins><blockquote><p><ins>Behind the scenes, some Democratic members have jostled to be included. Others have taken themselves out of the running over campaign conflicts or because they don’t have as much legal or trial experience.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Some potential impeachment managers are largely keeping quiet about any ambitions in public.</ins></p></blockquote><ins> </ins><p><ins>Pelosi is not bound to follow any tradition, and if she taps an individual, they have no choice in the matter.  And while there are definite benefits to being selected, there is also a possibility of bombing in the spotlight:</ins></p><ins> </ins><blockquote><p><ins>The role of impeachment manager could help with the base and make a member an instant figure in the media and speaking circuit, said Virginia Democrat Rep. Gerald E. Connolly. “They’re going to be in the history books,” Connolly said.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>But there are downsides too. “It’s a lot of work for a brief moment in the sun, although a brief shiny moment in the sun,” Connolly said. “You could also really flop. All this expectation and you’re not quite what we thought. You bored the hell out of people, or you weren’t very compelling.”</ins></p></blockquote><ins> </ins><p><ins>[Ed.  My guess is that a whole lot of members are secretly hoping they will be selected, and are  artfully draping their subtle signaling in a protest of faux-humility (“Oh surely there are more deserving and qualified…”).] </ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Note:  </ins></p><ins> </ins><blockquote><p><ins>Over the weekend, The Washington Post reported that a group of 30 House freshmen led by Minnesota Democratic Rep. Dean Phillips sought to have Rep. Justin Amash as an impeachment manager.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Amash was the first Republican lawmaker to say that Trump committed impeachable offenses, and then left the Republican party and became an independent in July. He tweeted over the weekend that Republicans are “making a concerted effort to mislead” about impeachable wrongdoing.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>With Republicans apparently in lockstep in opposition to the articles of impeachment, Pelosi could see an advantage in adding Amash to the managers, Phillips told the Post.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>“To the extent that this can be bipartisan, it should, and I think including Representative Amash amongst the impeachment managers is a smart move both for the country, for the substance and for the optics,” Phillips said.</ins></p></blockquote><ins> </ins><p><ins>Here is the tweet referenced:</ins></p><ins> </ins><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><ins>Republicans are making a concerted effort to mislead. “High Crimes and Misdemeanors” is pointedly NOT about statutory crimes.

In fact, he says, if it hadn’t been for the Steele dossier, the FBI probably would haven’t even submitted a FISA application — that it had been reviewed in April of 2016 — or August, rather, of 2016 — they decided not to do it. They get the Steele dossier. They do it. It wasn’t part of a broader mosaic. That’s what you said, sir.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>James Comey: I’m not sure he and I are saying different things. What his report says is that the FBI thought it was a close call until they got the Steele report, put that additional information in, and that tipped it over to be probable cause. It’s a long FISA application. It includes Steele material and lots of other material. I don’t think we’re saying different things.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Chris Wallace: Well, I think you are, sir, because he’s saying — you’re saying it’s part of a broader mosaic; it’s just one element. He’s saying it was the tipping point. It’s what brought it over. That doesn’t make it part of a broader mosaic; it makes it the centerpiece of the whole FISA application and the ability to surveil Carter Page.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>James Comey: Yeah.

Unfortunately I have become quite discouraged about our government and in a broader sense society as a whole due to the blatant hypocrisy and people's inability to have even a small sense of decency. It might even border on apathy these days.

I found it sad that good and positive events and the achievement of individuals could not be honored and celebrated simply because of the person recognizing them.  

And I find it disturbing that our president can't seem to speak of anything without using hyperbole.

              <p>It is the first Sunday after Christmas. Today&#8217;s Bach piece is Part VI of his Christmas Oratorio, BWV 248:</p>

<p>Today&#8217;s Gospel reading is <a href="" target="_blank">Matthew 2:13-23</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>The Escape to Egypt</strong></p>
<p>When they had gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream. “Get up,” he said, “take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him.”</p>
<p>So he got up, took the child and his mother during the night and left for Egypt, where he stayed until the death of Herod. And so was fulfilled what the Lord had said through the prophet: “Out of Egypt I called my son.”</p>
<p>When Herod realized that he had been outwitted by the Magi, he was furious, and he gave orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old and under, in accordance with the time he had learned from the Magi. Then what was said through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled:</p>
<p>“A voice is heard in Ramah,<br />
    weeping and great mourning,<br />
Rachel weeping for her children<br />
    and refusing to be comforted,<br />
    because they are no more.”</p>
<p><strong>The Return to Nazareth</strong></p>
<p>After Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt and said, “Get up, take the child and his mother and go to the land of Israel, for those who were trying to take the child’s life are dead.”</p>
<p>So he got up, took the child and his mother and went to the land of Israel. But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning in Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. Having been warned in a dream, he withdrew to the district of Galilee, and he went and lived in a town called Nazareth. So was fulfilled what was said through the prophets, that he would be called a Nazarene.</p></blockquote>
<p>The text of today&#8217;s piece is available <a href="http://www.emmanuelmusic.org/notes_translations/translations_cantata/t_bwv248-6.htm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>. It contains these words:</p>
<blockquote><p>Then Herod summoned the sages secretly and cleverly discovered from them when the star had appeared. And he directed them towards Bethlehem and said:<br />
— Go there and seek diligently for the infant, and when you find it, report to me, so that I can also come and pay my devotions to it. —</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>Liar, you seek only to destroy the Lord;<br />
You employ all false trickery<br />
to supplant the Savior;<br />
yet He, whose power no man can measure,<br />
remains in secure hands.<br />
Your heart, your false heart is already,<br />
with all its deceit, very well known<br />
to the Son of the Highest whom you seek to crush.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>And God commanded them in a dream that they should not journey back to Herod, and they travelled by another way back to their own land.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><strong>Joseph Accepts Jesus as His Son</strong></p>
<p>This is how the birth of Jesus the Messiah came about: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be pregnant through the Holy Spirit. Because Joseph her husband was faithful to the law, and yet did not want to expose her to public disgrace, he had in mind to divorce her quietly.</p>
<p>But after he had considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, “Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.”</p>
<p>All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet: “The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel” (which means “God with us”).</p>
<p>When Joseph woke up, he did what the angel of the Lord had commanded him and took Mary home as his wife. But he did not consummate their marriage until she gave birth to a son. And he gave him the name Jesus.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Heart and mouth and deed and life<br />
must give testimony of Christ<br />
without fear or hypocrisy,<br />
that He is God and Savior.</p>
<p>Blessed mouth!<br />
Mary makes the inmost part of her soul<br />
known through thanks and praise;<br />
she begins to narrate to herself<br />
the miracle of the Savior,<br />
which He has worked in her as His handmaiden.<br />
O human race,<br />
slave to Satan and to sin,<br />
you are freed<br />
through Christ&#8217;s reassuring appearance<br />
from this burden and servitude!<br />
However your mouth and your stubborn spirit<br />
supresses, denies such goodness;<br />
yet know, that according to the scripture,<br />
an all-too-harsh judgment will be yours!</p></blockquote>

              <p>[guest post by Dana]</p>
<p>Feel free to talk about anything you think is newsworthy or might interest readers.</p>
<p>I’ll start.</p>
<p><strong>First news item</strong>:  Voters expect elected officials to enact viable solutions.  Unfortunately,  <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/12/18/waging-social-justice-war-on-the-taxpayers-dime/?utm_source=twitter_sitebuttons&amp;utm_medium=site%20buttons&amp;utm_campaign=site%20buttons">more often than not, government can only demonstrate its inability to fix anything</a>:  </p>
<blockquote><p>Homelessness in Seattle has reached a crisis point. Despite some $1 billion in public and private spending, more people live on the streets than ever before. But rather than focus on the causes — addiction, mental illness and social breakdown — progressives in local government have waged war against abstract forces of oppression.</p>
<p>Last week, Seattle homeless ­advocates hosted their annual conference under the theme of “Decolonizing Our Collective Work.” ­According to the organizers, to reduce homelessness, government should prioritize “unpacking the current structures of power” and “examine the legacies of structural racism in our systems” to “co-design a path towards liberation with black, ­indigenous, brown and other marginalized communities.”</p>
<p>What does all that mean?</p>
<p>The director of King County’s homelessness program, Kira Zylstra, used taxpayer funds to hire a transgender stripper to perform during the conference. According to The Seattle Times, the stripper, Beyoncé Black St. James, “danced topless in a sheer bodysuit, gave lap dances and kissed attendees.” The audience — representatives from the region’s taxpayer-funded nonprofits and government agencies — clapped, cheered and handed St. James dollar bills.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Second news item</strong>:  <a href="https://apnews.com/e14a600779dddcabb8a3a809573285e2">Elizabeth Warren&#8217;s purity test backfires, revealing her own stunning hypocrisy:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>On a Saturday evening in June 2018, with temperatures in the 70s and the Red Sox playing at Fenway Park, supporters of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren gathered at the City Winery Boston for a fundraiser.</p>
<p>They were treated to songs by the Grammy-winning artist Melissa Etheridge and heard remarks from Warren, who was months away from announcing her campaign for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. For the top donors, those who could contribute or raise $5,400 per couple or $2,700 a person, there was a VIP photo reception and premium seating.</p>
<p>For them and others who gave at least $1,000, there was also a gift: a souvenir wine bottle&#8230;</p>
<p>In Thursday night’s Democratic presidential debate in Los Angeles, Warren lit into rival Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, for attending a fundraiser at a “wine cave” in California’s Napa Valley where he dined and sipped under a chandelier with Swarovski crystals and where a novelty large bottle of wine can cost $900.</p>
<p>Billionaires in wine caves should not pick the next president of the United States,” Warren said. Later, she added, “I do not sell access to my time.”</p>
<p>&#8230;Even after her pledge not to hold private fundraisers, Warren has continued to attend the very kind of events for which she has criticized others. She has headlined fundraisers for the Democratic National Committee in settings that raise handsome sums, and she said she would continue to do that if she were the nominee, so that Democrats would not be at a financial disadvantage against President Donald Trump.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>&#8230; Yes, my father Billy Graham founded Christianity Today; but no, he would not agree with their opinion piece. In fact, he would be very disappointed. I have not previously shared who my father voted for in the past election, but because of this article, I feel it is necessary to share it now. My father knew Donald Trump, he believed in Donald Trump, and he voted for Donald Trump. He believed that Donald J. Trump was the man for this hour in history for our nation.</p>
<p>Look at all the President has accomplished in a very short time. The economy of our nation is the strongest it has been in 50 years, ISIS &amp; the caliphate have been defeated, and the President has renegotiated trade deals to benefit all Americans. The list of accomplishments is long, but for me as a Christian, the fact that he is the most pro-life president in modern history is extremely important—and Christianity Today wants us to ignore that, to say it doesn’t count? The President has been a staunch defender of religious freedom at home and around the world—and Christianity Today wants us to ignore that? Also the President has appointed conservative judges in record number—and Christianity today wants us to ignore that? Christianity Today feels he should be removed from office because of false accusations that the President emphatically denies.</p>
<p>Is President Trump guilty of sin? Of course he is, as were all past presidents and as each one of us are, including myself. </p></blockquote>

<p>Now onto the &#8220;trial&#8221; in the Senate, where the dialogue will go something like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>SENATE REPUBLICANS AND JOE MANCHIN: The House Democrats were so irresponsible rushing this process. How can we possibly know what happened without hearing from people like Mick Mulvaney or John Bolton??</p>
<p>CHUCK SCHUMER: Well, Trump&#8217;s the one who prevented them from testifying, but I know what. Let&#8217;s call them to testify now.</p>
<p>SENATE REPUBLICANS AND JOE MANCHIN: No.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;d like to hear from them, and someday we will know what they would have had to say. If it exonerates Donald Trump (lol), one will wonder why Trump didn&#8217;t want those folks subject to questioning. If it damns him, as I expect it will, the Senators who voted to squelch their testimony will go down in history as having been complicit in a partisan cover-up.</p>
<p>Ah well. As Bill Barr <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/446324-barr-defends-reputation-everyone-dies" rel="noopener" target="_blank">said</a> when asked about the possible damage to his reputation resulting from his partisan actions on behalf of Trump: &#8220;Everyone dies.&#8221; In the meantime, grab as much power as you can and hold onto it for dear life. If doing so requires you to be a toady and a puppet to a maniac, and to surrender everything you hold dear in the process &#8230; well, hey. It&#8217;s better than being thrown out of office and being a nobody.</p>
<p>Right?</p>

            <div class="storycontent">
              <p>Prof. Jonathan Adler has an excellent piece in the <em>New York Daily News</em> titled <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/ny-oped-why-the-house-must-vote-yes-20191218-fptgdb67ejfrlatwu7cv2vieg4-story.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Why the House must vote yes: Trump is the one who is upsetting our democracy and constitutional order</a>. What I especially like about the piece is that Adler emphasizes what I think is most important: Trump&#8217;s Ukraine call is not a one-off, but part of a consistent pattern of abusing the office for personal gain:</p>
<blockquote><p>A president who uses his power to subvert the workings of our constitutional structure has forfeited any claim to the office, whether or not that president pursues policies or appoints judges we might otherwise support.</p>
<p>If it was correct for Congress to impeach a president for lying under oath in an effort to subvert a legal proceeding — as I believe it was — impeaching President Trump should be a no-brainer.</p>
<p>The current push for impeachment was triggered by revelations that the president sought to induce Ukrainian government officials to announce an investigation into a political rival by withholding congressionally authorized funds. These actions, which are virtually indisputable, represent a profound betrayal of the president’s oath and solemn obligations to our country and Constitution, but they are hardly the only impeachable actions Trump has committed.</p>
<p>On repeated occasions, the president sought to obstruct a lawful inquiry into Russian efforts to interfere with our elections, according to the Mueller Report, including by directing subordinates to create false records that could be used to mislead investigators and dangling pardons before colleagues facing criminal prosecution.</p>
<p>He has also encouraged foreign governments to seek to influence U.S. elections (in his favor, of course) and obstructed legitimate congressional investigations into matters large and small, ranging from the Ukraine matter to his compliance with the Constitution’s foreign emoluments clause. He has further given every indication that he sees nothing wrong with his conduct — it is “perfect,” after all — and is likely to continue.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s Trump today, whining about how he was not entitled to witnesses in the House (not entirely true), despite the fact that when he goes to the Senate he &#8230; won&#8217;t be presenting any witnesses. Sure, he&#8217;s engaged in a little kabuki show about how he wants to, but he knows that witness testimony would be bad for him, because the facts and the truth are bad for him. He supposedly wanted to testify to Mueller too. Right.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Trump suggests Adam Schiff should face severe punishment for paraphrasing his Zelensky call during a hearing: &quot;In Guatemala they handle things much tougher than that.&quot; <a href="https://t.co/bUMrsKJpyv">pic.twitter.com/bUMrsKJpyv</a></p>

<p> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>He has a little shot about Schiff and how they handle people like him &#8220;much tougher&#8221; in Guatemala. Well. In 1945 the Italians handled a problem with their leader in a manner much tougher than this impeachment. So?</p>
<p>Stuff like this is a reminder why he needs to be gone yesterday.</p>
<p>The House must vote yes. If for no other reason, they must do it so that in the future, I can refer to the president as &#8220;impeached president Donald Trump.&#8221;</p>
<p>P.S. If you&#8217;re outraged at the notion that a conservative site would support impeachment of a Republican president, I&#8217;ve got good news for you. Eleven years ago, Donald Trump indicated that <a href="https://t.co/ML46WfBsSz?amp=1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">he thought impeachment of a Republican president would have been a &#8220;wonderful thing&#8221;</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;When [Pelosi] first got in and was named speaker,&#8221; Trump said to Blitzer then, &#8220;I met her. And I&#8217;m very impressed by her. I think she&#8217;s a very impressive person, I like her a lot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I was surprised that she didn&#8217;t do more in terms of Bush and going after Bush,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;It just seemed like she was really going to look to impeach Bush and get him out of office. Which personally I think would have been a wonderful thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For the war,&#8221; Trump replied. &#8220;For the war! Well, he lied! He got us into the war with lies!&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>So supporting impeachment of a Republican president is acceptable, it turns out. After all, if Trump does it, it&#8217;s OK. That&#8217;s the law!</p>
<p>Anyway, Trump will be impeached today. Which personally I think will be a wonderful thing.</p>

<p>If anyone knows about SCAMS it&#8217;s Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Judge Amy Berman Jackson sentenced Rick Gates to 45 days today, and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/17/politics/amy-berman-jackson-gates-barr/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">had some choice comments</a>, including pointed remarks that seemed directed at the SCAM artist in the White House and his surrogates, including the broomstick driver working for Trump with the last name of Conway:</p>
<blockquote><p>In total, more than $75 million flowed through the offshore accounts. Manafort laundered more than $18 million, which was used by him to buy property goods and services in the United States, income that he concealed from the United States Treasury, the Department of Justice and others. Gates transferred more than $3 million from the offshore accounts to other accounts that he controlled.</p>
<p>Those are facts. Those are not alleged facts, those are not alternative facts, or a narrative created by the media.</p>
<p>. . . .</p>
<p>One of the letter writers said that he got caught up in D.C. political drama. But I reject that. It&#8217;s perfectly possible to conduct yourself with ethics, integrity, and no hint of scandal, even in politics, even in D.C., even in Ukraine. Politics don&#8217;t corrupt people, people corrupt politics.</p></blockquote>
<p>Berman noted that Gates&#8217;s information</p>
<blockquote><p>included firsthand information about confidential campaign polling data being transmitted at the direction of the head of the campaign to one of those individuals to be shared with Russian and Ukrainian oligarchs.</p>
<p>It included firsthand information about a meeting within the campaign concerning attending a meeting with Russians for the sole stated purpose of providing information that could be used against Hillary Clinton. And it included firsthand information about claims made by an individual close to the campaign to be in contact with WikiLeaks concerning the release of emails obtained when the DNC computers were hacked.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yup. Can&#8217;t really find a genuine news story to comment on. It&#8217;s a snoozefest out there.</p>
<p>Gear up for tomorrow. I&#8217;ll likely be popping open a bottle of bourbon to celebrate.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a given that any House member selected by Nancy Pelosi to be an impeachment manager will see his or her political career boosted as a result.  And while there is some demurring about even thinking about being selected, we all know that politicians love the spotlight and any opportunity to be in it (for a perceived noble cause, that is) and raise their profiles is goal-worthy.  <a href="https://www.rollcall.com/news/house-members-eye-high-profile-impeachment-assignment">And it doesn&#8217;t get any more high profile than an impeachment:  </a></p>
<blockquote><p>Speaker Nancy Pelosi will decide who and how many impeachment managers will travel to the other side of the Capitol to make arguments, present evidence, question witnesses and more in just the third time in U.S. history that a sitting president has been on trial before the Senate.</p>
<p>Her picks can be political as well as legal, some Democratic lawmakers say. The California Democrat would want members with trial experience who understand the Constitution and the case well — particularly because they must fight in a Republican-controlled Senate.</p>
<p>But Pelosi also holds an opportunity to showcase diversity among the Democratic caucus and spotlight rising members who could use the historic Senate trial as a way to boost their national profile or fundraising power&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>While some Democrats claim that they &#8220;haven&#8217;t given it any thought,&#8221;  others are jockeying for position:  </p>
<blockquote><p>Behind the scenes, some Democratic members have jostled to be included. Others have taken themselves out of the running over campaign conflicts or because they don’t have as much legal or trial experience.</p>
<p>Some potential impeachment managers are largely keeping quiet about any ambitions in public.</p></blockquote>
<p>Pelosi is not bound to follow any tradition, and if she taps an individual, they have no choice in the matter.  And while there are definite benefits to being selected, there is also a possibility of bombing in the spotlight:</p>
<blockquote><p>The role of impeachment manager could help with the base and make a member an instant figure in the media and speaking circuit, said Virginia Democrat Rep. Gerald E. Connolly. “They’re going to be in the history books,” Connolly said.</p>
<p>But there are downsides too. “It’s a lot of work for a brief moment in the sun, although a brief shiny moment in the sun,” Connolly said. “You could also really flop. All this expectation and you’re not quite what we thought. You bored the hell out of people, or you weren’t very compelling.”</p></blockquote>
<p>[Ed.  <em>My guess is that a whole lot of members are secretly hoping they will be selected, and are  artfully draping their subtle signaling in a protest of faux-humility (<em>&#8220;Oh surely there are more deserving and qualified&#8230;&#8221;</em></em>).] </p>
<p>Note:  </p>
<blockquote><p>Over the weekend, The Washington Post reported that a group of 30 House freshmen led by Minnesota Democratic Rep. Dean Phillips sought to have Rep. Justin Amash as an impeachment manager.</p>
<p>Amash was the first Republican lawmaker to say that Trump committed impeachable offenses, and then left the Republican party and became an independent in July. He tweeted over the weekend that Republicans are “making a concerted effort to mislead” about impeachable wrongdoing.</p>
<p>With Republicans apparently in lockstep in opposition to the articles of impeachment, Pelosi could see an advantage in adding Amash to the managers, Phillips told the Post.</p>
<p>“To the extent that this can be bipartisan, it should, and I think including Representative Amash amongst the impeachment managers is a smart move both for the country, for the substance and for the optics,” Phillips said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here is the tweet referenced:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Republicans are making a concerted effort to mislead. “High Crimes and Misdemeanors” is pointedly NOT about statutory crimes. In fact, the Constitution doesn’t provide for impeachment for ordinary crimes; they must be “high.” Impeachable wrongdoing must relate to abuse of office.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m wondering which Supreme Court Justices *haven&#8217;t* gone on talk shows to promote their new books:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Justice Neil Gorsuch is on &quot;Fox &amp; Friends&quot; right now. The Q: How is it appropriate for a Supreme Court justice to try to goose sales of his three-month-old book by chatting on one of the most partisan shows on TV?</p>
<p>&mdash; Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) <a href="https://twitter.com/brianstelter/status/1206928018645618688?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 17, 2019</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, to Stelter, the problem isn&#8217;t Gorsuch goosing book sales, it&#8217;s that he&#8217;s a conservative Justice appearing on Fox and Friends, which everyone knows is the most Trump-friendly news/talk show around.   </p>
<p>Anyway, I tried to locate a similar protest from Stelter when <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nztz3yuF3lY">Justice Sonia Sotoymayor promoted her book</a> <em>Just Ask!</em> on the not-Trump friendly Daily Show with Trevor Noah, or when <a href="http://www.cc.com/video-clips/qxsatq/the-colbert-report-sonia-sotomayor">she appeared on the not Trump-friendly Colbert Report</a> to promote her autobiography, <em>My Beloved World,</em> and was unable to locate any similar concerns.  And funny, I also couldn&#8217;t find any objection by Stelter about Justice <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj2yh6QJJJk">Stephen Breyer promoting his third book, The Court and The World on the Colbert Report</a>.  Note:  both <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/trevor-noah-examines-the-extent-to-which-the-trumps-are-a-holes-and-uh-its-a-lot-video/">Trevor Noah</a> and <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/stephen-colbert-would-not-have-president-donald-trump-back-on-his-show">Stephen Colbert</a> have made it very clear that they have no love nor respect for Trump.  Neither do I, but at least I am an equal-opportunity condemner of hack politicians and media outlets &#8211; no matter what side of the aisle they represent.  Clearly Stelter cannot say the same about himself.</p>
<p>Given that Selter makes it clear that only one side of the aisle matters, while he promotes himself as a serious journalist who  anchors Reliable Sources and is CNN&#8217;s chief media correspondent, why anyone would find him <em>reliable </em>in his reporting is beyond me.  If he can&#8217;t be consistent in the small and inconsequential matters, why on earth would I think he would be any different with the  weightier issues that actually matter?</p>

<p>Looking to generate some sympathy before his upcoming rape trial, the disgraced movie mogul who has been accused of sexual assault or harassment by more than 80 women, petulantly whined <a href="https://pagesix.com/2019/12/15/harvey-weinstein-i-deserve-pat-on-back-when-it-comes-to-women/">in his first interview in more than a year</a> that he deserves credit for his support of women,<em> because he is a  delusional bastard:</em></p>
<blockquote><p>“I feel like the forgotten man,’’ the 67-year-old alleged rapist griped last week.</p>
<p>“I made more movies directed by women and about women than any filmmaker, and I’m talking about 30 years ago. I’m not talking about now when it’s vogue. I did it first! I pioneered it!” he bragged.</p>
<p>“It all got eviscerated because of what happened,’’ Weinstein said bitterly. “My work has been forgotten.’’</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>“I want this city to recognize who I was instead of what I’ve become”[.]</p></blockquote>
<p>In response,  23 of his accusers released a <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2019-12-16/harvey-weinstein-interview-sexual-assault-women-response">formal statement</a> reassuring Weinstein that he&#8217;ll certainly be remembered &#8211; just not in the way what he hoped:  </p>
<blockquote><p>“Harvey Weinstein is trying to gaslight society again,” the women say in the statement, provided to the Los Angeles Times. “He says in a new interview he doesn’t want to be forgotten. Well, he won’t be. He will be remembered as a sexual predator and an unrepentant abuser who took everything and deserves nothing. He will be remembered by the collective will of countless women who stood up and said enough. We refuse to let this predator rewrite his legacy of abuse.”</p></blockquote>
<p>And then there are these choice words from Rose McGowan, one his fiercest and unrelenting accusers:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I didn’t forget you, Harvey. My body didn’t forget you. I wish it could. I refused to sign an NDA after it happened because I knew I would come for you. And I did. This is about stopping a prolific rapist. You.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that Weinstein is a sick, delusional bastard, as evidenced by his belief that years of sexual harassment, assault, and the denigration of women should be ignored, or at the very  least, pale in comparison to what he considers his <em>good works</em> on behalf of women.  And yet the ghastly irony is, the very community from whom he demands recognition is the very same community that willingly looked the other way &#8211; for decades &#8211; as he preyed upon its members.  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/12/15/comey-wrong-fbi-wrong-085542">James Comey admits that he was “wrong”</a> about the bureau’s use of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act in the Russia investigation:  </p>
<blockquote><p>“He’s right, I was wrong,” Comey told host Chris Wallace on “Fox News Sunday.” “I was overconfident in the procedures that the FBI and Justice had built over 20 years. I thought they were robust enough. It’s incredibly hard to get a FISA.”</p>
<p>“He’s right: There was real sloppiness,” Comey added.</p></blockquote>
<p>President Trump&#8217;s reaction to Comey&#8217;s admission:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">So now Comey’s admitting he was wrong. Wow, but he’s only doing so because he got caught red handed. He was actually caught a long time ago. So what are the consequences for his unlawful conduct. Could it be years in jail? Where are the apologies to me and others, Jim?</p>

<blockquote><p>Chris Wallace: Horowitz says it wasn’t part — as you told Bret Baier — it wasn’t part of a broader mosaic. He said it played an essential role in establishing probable cause. In fact, he says, if it hadn’t been for the Steele dossier, the FBI probably would haven’t even submitted a FISA application — that it had been reviewed in April of 2016 — or August, rather, of 2016 — they decided not to do it. They get the Steele dossier. They do it. It wasn’t part of a broader mosaic. That’s what you said, sir.</p>
<p>James Comey: I’m not sure he and I are saying different things. What his report says is that the FBI thought it was a close call until they got the Steele report, put that additional information in, and that tipped it over to be probable cause. It’s a long FISA application. It includes Steele material and lots of other material. I don’t think we’re saying different things.</p>
<p>Chris Wallace: Well, I think you are, sir, because he’s saying — you’re saying it’s part of a broader mosaic; it’s just one element. He’s saying it was the tipping point. It’s what brought it over. That doesn’t make it part of a broader mosaic; it makes it the centerpiece of the whole FISA application and the ability to surveil Carter Page.</p>
<p>James Comey: Yeah. I don’t understand it to be saying that. I could be wrong about that —</p>
<p>Chris Wallace: Well, I’ve just — I’ve got his —</p>
<p>James Comey: — I understand —</p>
<p>Chris Wallace: — quote here. He says, “We concluded the Steele reporting played a central and essential role in the decision to seek a FISA warrant, that it pushed the FISA proposal over the line in terms of establishing probable cause.” I mean, he says —</p>
<p>James Comey: Yeah.</p>
<p>Chris Wallace: — what he says. Words mean something.</p>
<p>James Comey: Yeah. And I agree with his characterization. I’m just confused — I no — I don’t see the disconnect between the two of us. And I’m sorry that I’m missing it.</p></blockquote>

<p>Why, yes, I think he did: <a href="https://www.mediaite.com/politics/obama-women-are-indisputably-better-than-men-should-run-the-world/#disqus_thread">sexism, ageism, and identity politics in one fell swoop:</a>:  </p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;Obama declared at the private event, “Now women, I just want you to know; you are not perfect, but what I can say pretty indisputably is that you’re better than us.”</p>
<p>“I’m absolutely confident that for two years if every nation on earth was run by women, you would see a significant improvement across the board on just about everything… living standards and outcomes,” he expressed, adding, “If you look at the world and look at the problems it’s usually old people, usually old men, not getting out of the way.”</p>
<p>“It is important for political leaders to try and remind themselves that you are there to do a job, but you are not there for life,” he continued. “You are not there in order to prop up your own sense of self importance or your own power.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Obama giving a speech about how women should rule because  men drool is a bit rich given that he sure didn&#8217;t step aside in 2008 so that a female candidate he insultingly dismissed as &#8220;likable enough,&#8221; could become the first female Democratic presidential nominee.  But if you consider that his recent comments  also included taking a shot across the bow of Joe Biden (77 years old) and Bernie Sanders (78 years old), it all makes sense.

<blockquote><p>When John, who was in prison, heard about the deeds of the Messiah, he sent his disciples to ask him, “Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?”</p>
<p>Jesus replied, “Go back and report to John what you hear and see: The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is proclaimed to the poor. Blessed is anyone who does not stumble on account of me.”</p>
<p>As John’s disciples were leaving, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John: “What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind? If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No, those who wear fine clothes are in kings’ palaces. Then what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet. This is the one about whom it is written:</p>
<p>“‘I will send my messenger ahead of you,<br />
    who will prepare your way before you.’</p>
<p>Truly I tell you, among those born of women there has not risen anyone greater than John the Baptist; yet whoever is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.</p></blockquote>
<p>The text of today&#8217;s piece is available <a href="http://www.emmanuelmusic.org/notes_translations/translations_cantata/t_bwv186.htm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>. It contains these words:</p>
<blockquote><p>My Savior lets Himself be seen<br />
in His works of grace.<br />
When He reveals Himself powerfully,<br />
to instruct the weak spirit,<br />
to nourish the weary body,<br />
this satisfies body and soul.</p>
<p>Although it appears that He does not will it,<br />
do not be afraid;<br />
for when He is most with you,<br />
He does not reveal it.<br />
Let His word be sure to you,<br />
and, although your heart says only No,<br />
do not let yourself despair.</p></blockquote>
<p>Happy listening! Soli Deo gloria.</p>

Unfortunately I have become quite discouraged about our government and in a broader sense society as a whole due to the blatant hypocrisy and people's inability to have even a small sense of decency. It might even border on apathy these days.

I found it sad that good and positive events and the achievement of individuals could not be honored and celebrated simply because of the person recognizing them.

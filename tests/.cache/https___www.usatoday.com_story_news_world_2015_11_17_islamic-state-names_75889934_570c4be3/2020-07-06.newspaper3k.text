Western governments are divided on what to call the Islamic extremists claiming responsibility for the attacks in Paris and other atrocities. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry recently began using the term "Daesh," adding to the confusion. Where the names come from:

Da'ish or Daesh

• What is it? A disputed acronym based on the group's full Arabic name.

• Stands for: “Dawlat al-Islamiyah f'al-Iraq wa al-Sham,” which translates to “Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant.” The Levant refers to an area between the Mediterranean Sea and the Euphrates River.

• Used by: The French government, starting in September. Some Arab politicians and Arab media use the term, but the group itself doesn't recognize it. The acronym has a negative meaning because it sounds similar to the Arabic word for "sowers of discord," which are enemies of Islam.

ISIS

• Stands for: Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham

• From: The extremists' invasion of Syria. "Al-Sham" can refer to Syria or the Levant.

• Used by: United Kingdom government

ISIL

• Stands for: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant

• Used by: U.S. government and U.N.

Why the difference?

The names have changed with the group's rise in notoriety and Western preferences in Arabic translation.

What should we call it?

USA TODAY identifies the group as the Islamic State, the Islamic State militant group, or the Islamic State extremist group. The acronym is not used except in quotes.

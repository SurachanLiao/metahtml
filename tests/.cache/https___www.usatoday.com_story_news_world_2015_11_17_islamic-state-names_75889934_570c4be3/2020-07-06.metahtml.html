U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry recently began using the term "Daesh," adding to the confusion. Where the names come from:</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Da'ish or Daesh</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8226;&#160;What is it?&#160;A disputed&#160;acronym based on the group's full Arabic name.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8226;&#160;Stands for:&#160;&#8220;Dawlat al-Islamiyah f'al-Iraq wa al-Sham,&#8221; which translates to &#8220;Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant.&#8221;&#160;The Levant&#160;refers to an area between the Mediterranean Sea and the Euphrates River.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8226;&#160;Used by: The French government, starting in September. Some Arab politicians and Arab media use the term, but the group itself doesn't recognize it. The acronym has a negative meaning because it sounds similar to the Arabic word for "sowers of discord," which are enemies of Islam.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">ISIS</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8226;&#160;Stands for:&#160;Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or&#160;Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8226;&#160;From:&#160;The extremists' invasion of Syria.

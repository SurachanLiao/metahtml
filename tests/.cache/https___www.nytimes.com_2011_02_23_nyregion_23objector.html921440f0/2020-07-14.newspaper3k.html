<div><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">The American Civil Liberties Union of Connecticut, which filed a federal lawsuit on Mr. Izbicki&#8217;s behalf in November seeking a reversal of the Navy&#8217;s decision, announced on Tuesday that the Navy had granted Mr. Izbicki his discharge. Mr. Izbicki, who has continued to work at a Navy desk job, may have to reimburse the service for all or part of the cost of his education, said his lawyers, Sandra Staub, legal director of the A.C.L.U. of Connecticut, and Deborah H. Karpatkin and Vera M. Scanlon, of New York.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Mike McLellan, a spokesman for the Navy, said Mr. Izbicki had been discharged as a conscientious objector because &#8220;the Navy Personnel Command determined there was sufficient evidence to satisfy the requirements for this designation, and determined that it was in the Navy&#8217;s best interests to discharge him.&#8221;</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Mr. Izbicki, a National Merit Scholarship finalist in high school, chose the naval academy at Annapolis, Md., over a bevy of colleges, including the California Institute of Technology, that offered him four-year scholarships, because he felt an obligation to serve his country during wartime, he told investigators in his application for discharge.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">He grew up attending nondenominational Christian services in San Clemente, Calif., and remained a regular churchgoer during his four years at the academy, where Christianity is the dominant faith. Cadets are required in their junior year to study the &#8220;<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.iep.utm.edu/justwar/" title="About the just war theory." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">just war&#8221; theory</a>, a doctrine justifying military action, based largely on the writings of St. Augustine and St. Thomas Aquinas.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Not until his senior year did Mr. Izbicki register a sense of unease over what he would refer to in his application as &#8220;the frankness with which people talked about killing.&#8221; He wrote: &#8220;The training did not live up to the ideals of the just war as I envisioned them. I saw formulas for calculating the number and types of casualties that would result from using each of our weapons systems. We calculated the extent of civilian casualties and whether these numbers were politically acceptable.&#8221;</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Still, Mr. Izbicki said, he remained convinced that his Christian beliefs could be reconciled with military culture, and that as an officer he would be able to effect change from within.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">After graduating from the academy, he earned a master&#8217;s degree in computer engineering at Johns Hopkins University in preparation for what he said he expected to be a career in nuclear submarines.</p></div>

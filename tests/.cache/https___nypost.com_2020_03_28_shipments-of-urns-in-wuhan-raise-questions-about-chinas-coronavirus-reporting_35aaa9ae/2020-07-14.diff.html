But one funeral home received two shipments of 5,000 urns over the course of two days, <a href="http://photos.caixin.com/2020-03-26/101534542_6.html#picture" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to the Chinese media outlet Caixin.</a></p> <p>It’s not clear how many of the urns were filled.</p> <p>Workers at several funeral parlors declined to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-27/stacks-of-urns-in-wuhan-prompt-new-questions-of-virus-s-toll" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provide any details to Bloomberg</a> as to how many urns were waiting to be collected, saying they either did not know or were not authorized to share the number.</p> <p>The photos surfaced after both the United States and Italy have reported significantly more cases and than China. Italy has reported just shy of three times the fatalities.</p> <p>China has moved to <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/03/23/wuhan-finally-loosens-coronavirus-restrictions-after-two-month-lockdown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lift the two-month lockdown</a> on Wuhan after officials <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/03/03/china-predicts-coronavirus-victory-as-new-cases-hit-six-week-low/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">predicted a forthcoming “victory”</a> against the virus earlier in the month.</p> <p>President Trump on Friday said he spoke with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping and that he <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/03/27/trump-pledges-to-work-with-chinas-xi-jinping-to-fight-coronavirus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hoped the two countries will share information about the virus</a> to better combat its spread in the US.</p> <p>“China has been through much &amp; has developed a strong understanding of the Virus.

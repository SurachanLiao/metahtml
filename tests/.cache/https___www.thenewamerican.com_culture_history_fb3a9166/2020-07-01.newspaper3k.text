VIDEO - In this special July 4 Independence Day episode of Behind the Deep State, host Alex Newman goes through the U.S. Declaration of Independence and the critical biblical principles that underpin it. Alex explains how knowing who we are as Americans--especially including our history and our founding documents--will be critical in defeating the Deep State and its globalist agenda. Finally, Newman talks about how the principles in the Declaration such as "all men are created equal" and are "endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights" led to eradicating slavery and equality before the law. Don't let the Deep State erase America's incredible history or the amazing fruit produced by its founding!

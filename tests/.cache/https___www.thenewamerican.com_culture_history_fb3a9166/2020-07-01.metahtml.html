<div><p>VIDEO - In this special July 4 Independence Day episode of Behind the Deep State, host Alex Newman goes through the U.S. Declaration of Independence and the critical biblical principles that underpin it. Alex explains how knowing who we are as Americans--especially including our history and our founding documents--will be critical in defeating the Deep State and its globalist agenda. Finally, Newman talks about how the principles in the Declaration such as "all men are created equal" and are "endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights" led to eradicating slavery and equality before the law. Don't let the Deep State erase America's incredible history or the amazing fruit produced by its founding!</p><p class="catItemReadMore">

Christmas is about transcending the material world. "Only a God who has suffered what we have suffered has the moral authority to tell us to endure suffering, and to teach us how to overcome it."</p><p class="catItemReadMore">

		  </p><p>Jesus Christ, whose birthday is celebrated throughout the world on Christmas, has had a greater impact on human history than any person who ever lived. Though he died at the age of 33, the year in which we live is dated from his birth. Though he lived in an obscure corner of the Roman Empire 2,000 years ago, more than one billion people today call themselves followers of Christ. Though he never wrote a book, tens of thousands of books have been written about his life and teachings.</p><p class="catItemReadMore">

		  </p><p>VIDEO - At the Red Pill Expo, Alex Newman had a chance to speak with the one and only General George Washington (professional reenactor) and asked him about his role in the founding of our Republic. Washington tells Alex that the two pillars this country was founded were morality and religion, and that there many men in our capitol today who want to see them removed. He also explains that for civilians to maintain our Republic , they must understand the &#8220;science&#8221; of government, i.e. the cause and effect.</p><p class="catItemReadMore">

		  </p><p>VIDEO - In this interview, Dr. Duke Pesta talks with JBS CEO Art Thompson about the origins and importance of Thanksgiving. Art explains that many people today do not grasp nor understand the real hardships the Pilgrims endured, why they were thankful, and how we still enjoy those freedoms 400 years later. Do we really enjoy the independence that we have? Are we grateful for the things that allow us to be free citizens?</p><p class="catItemReadMore">

		  </p><p>VIDEO - In this episode of Duke&#8217;s Take, Dr. Duke talks about the necessity of Thanksgiving. Progressives are attacking Thanksgiving because of its &#8220;questionable origins,&#8221; but Duke says that is irrelevant. Referencing Shakespeare&#8217;s King Lear, he explains that the Christian virtue of gratitude is necessary for civilization to survive. Today, U.S. students are being taught that being grateful for your country and culture is &#8220;toxic nationalism&#8221; and &#8220;white supremacy,&#8221; which is why millennials and Gen X&#8217;ers condemn &#8220;free speech&#8221; and support socialism. Duke asks, &#8220;How can you improve your country if you have nothing to be grateful for? You can&#8217;t &#8211; you can only destroy it.&#8221;</p><p class="catItemReadMore">

Alex explains how knowing who we are as Americans--especially including our history and our founding documents--will be critical in defeating the Deep State and its globalist agenda. Finally, Newman talks about how the principles in the Declaration such as "all men are created equal" and are "endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights" led to eradicating slavery and equality before the law. Don't let the Deep State erase America's incredible history or the amazing fruit produced by its founding!</p> <p class="catItemReadMore"><ins><a class="k2ReadMore" href="/culture/history/item/36189-alex-newman-declaration-of-independence-vs-the-deep-state">Read more...

Though he died at the age of 33, the year in which we live is dated from his birth. Though he lived in an obscure corner of the Roman Empire 2,000 years ago, more than one billion people today call themselves followers of Christ. Though he never wrote a book, tens of thousands of books have been written about his life and teachings.</ins></p><p class="catItemReadMore"><ins><a class="k2ReadMore" href="/culture/history/item/4646-the-prince-of-peace-jesus-of-nazareth">Read more...

He also explains that for civilians to maintain our Republic , they must understand the “science” of government, i.e. the cause and effect.</ins></p><p class="catItemReadMore"><ins><a class="k2ReadMore" href="/culture/history/item/34327-alex-newman-george-washington-reflects-on-todays-government">Read more...

Do we really enjoy the independence that we have?

Progressives are attacking Thanksgiving because of its “questionable origins,” but Duke says that is irrelevant. Referencing Shakespeare’s King Lear, he explains that the Christian virtue of gratitude is necessary for civilization to survive. Today, U.S. students are being taught that being grateful for your country and culture is “toxic nationalism” and “white supremacy,” which is why millennials and Gen X’ers condemn “free speech” and support socialism. Duke asks, “How can you improve your country if you have nothing to be grateful for? You can’t – you can only destroy it.”</ins></p><p class="catItemReadMore"><ins><a class="k2ReadMore" href="/culture/history/item/34196-attack-on-thanksgiving-dukes-take">Read more...

<p>&#8220;President Obama, as Mark Steyn unkindly explained in After America (2011), was trapped in an &#8220;elderly arrested adolescence&#8221;, his narcissism and naivety passed off as &#8220;nobility of spirit&#8221;. President Trump, vainglorious and glib, may not have read Huntington, or even heard of him, and yet he instinctively understands how the world turns.&#160;&#8221;</p>
<p>The end of the Cold War did not harbinger a golden age of peace, love and understanding between Washington and Moscow. There was talk, once upon a time, of the Russian Federation joining NATO, but it was never a serious option. NATO had been founded in 1949 to prevent Moscow annexing Western Europe. It exists today to prevent Moscow annexing Eastern Europe. We might spot a pattern here. Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Slovenia, Croatia and Montenegro are never again going to countenance Russia being in a position to offer them &#8220;fraternal assistance&#8221; (&#224; la East Berlin 1953, Budapest 1956, Prague 1968). For those nations, at least, the idea of Moscow assuming the role of key strategic power on NATO&#8217;s eastern flank must have sounded like the old Latin proverb Ovem lupo commitere&#8212;&#8220;To set a wolf to guard sheep&#8221;. None of this, however, is to suggest that configuring Russia as our implacable foe in any way serves the interests of the West. </p>
<p>Russia, even in its darkest moments during the 1990s, had little desire to be absorbed into an American-orchestrated New World Order. The West, then, did not lose Russia, because Russia has never been ours to squander. Samuel P. Huntington&#8217;s &#8220;The Clash of Civilisations?&#8221; thesis, which first appeared in a 1993 edition of Foreign Affairs, provides some of the reasons why. Huntington divided the world into nine major civilisational entities. He did not include Russia as part of &#8220;Western civilisation&#8221; but, rather, categorised it as a major part of &#8220;Orthodox civilisation&#8221;. Russia, despite its apparent similarities with the West, had been on a different civilisational journey&#8212;eschewing the Renaissance, the Reformation, the Industrial Revolution, parliamentary democracy, and so on&#8212;and had arrived at a very different destination. The end of the Soviet Union could never guarantee entirely harmonious relations between Russia and America, since each has its own geopolitical interests to pursue. George Kennan said something similar in his famous commentaries at the commencement of the Cold War: the demise of communist rule would not eliminate all civilisational frictions.</p>

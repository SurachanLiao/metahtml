	</p><p>https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/apr/29/israel-is-a-free-and-open-societ</p><p>Last week, Jared Kushner, one of the administration&#8217;s point men on the Middle East, dispensed with the term &#8220;two-state solution&#8221; in its impending peace plan for Israel and the Palestinians. &#8220;The two-state solution has failed,&#8221; he said.</p><p>Not for lack of trying.</p><p>The &#8220;two-state solution&#8221; does not appear in the 1993 Oslo Accords, which called only for &#8220;interim self-government&#8221; for the Palestinians. The goal was a negotiated final status agreement, in which independence was not specified.</p><p>The phrase was intended to create the aura of equality between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Palestinian Authority. It was born of the belief that Israel, the strong party, had to offer the Palestinians, the weak party, a certain status &#8212; or at least potential status. After that, the Palestinians acquired many of the attributes of statehood &#8212; an office in Washington called an &#8220;embassy,&#8221; a designated U.S. diplomatic facility in Jerusalem called an &#8220;embassy&#8221; and full status in a number of international organizations.</p><p class="continue-reading-link"><a href="http://www.ruthfullyyours.com/2019/04/30/the-reality-of-the-two-state-solution-shoshana-bryen/">Continue reading &#8594;</a></p><p class="post-meta post-top-meta">

	</p><p>https://www.city-journal.org/scottish-maritime-museum-gender-neutrality</p><p>Two types of people desire to impose politically correct locutions on the rest of us: those who possess unlimited power and fear to lose it and those who aspire to unlimited power and need a means to attain it. And there is, after all, no greater power than that of prescribing what others must say and what others must not think.</p><p>The Scottish Maritime Museum, dedicated to the history of the country&#8217;s shipbuilding industry, has decided that it will no longer use the words sheand herto refer to ships, but rather itand its. This is in response to feminists, who have defaced plaques referring to ships as sheor her. This change would negate centuries of tradition, during which the words traditionally used on launching a ship, &#8220;May God bless all who sail in her,&#8221; carried no connotation of insult or deprecation&#8212;rather the reverse.</p><p>The Maritime Museum&#8217;s surrender is yet another instance of the craven surrender of British officialdom to the demands of a small but vociferous group of monomaniacs who make the imposition of their views the purpose of their lives. Museum authorities have argued that they must move with the times, and the prevention of vandalism is important, for economic reasons among others. Yet this rationale is something like awarding burglars a pension in an effort to prevent burglary.</p><p class="continue-reading-link"><a href="http://www.ruthfullyyours.com/2019/04/30/every-pronoun-must-go-to-root-out-gender-inequity-we-must-search-every-corner-theodore-dalrymple/">Continue reading &#8594;</a></p><p class="post-meta post-top-meta">

	</p><p>https://quillette.com/2019/04/28/like-the-campus-thought-police/</p><p>Smith College police chief Daniel Hect was put on administrative leave after becoming an object of campus hate. Chief Hect&#8217;s crime was &#8216;liking&#8217; (not writing) tweets that fall outside of academia&#8217;s ever shrinking zone of toleration. Behold the offending tweets:</p><p>&#8220;Stay the course Pres. Trump&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;BUILD THAT WALL!!&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;The National Rifle Association wishes you and your family a very Merry Christmas!&#8221;</p><p>The tweets express opinions that most Trump voters would likely support. And the chief stands accused not of originating these tweets, but of merely liking them on his own personal Twitter account. If you are not familiar with Twitter, know that liking doesn&#8217;t always imply support.</p><p>The official reason given for Chief Hect&#8217;s suspension was, as Smith&#8217;s President wrote, because &#8220;members of our campus community have voiced a lack of trust&#8221; in him. Given the protests, &#8220;lack of trust&#8221; is quite the understatement. Interpreted in the most favorable light, the students might be worried about the chief&#8217;s views on immigration.</p><p>Smith College is devoted to the spirit of the sanctuary campus movement within &#8220;the limits of federal law&#8221; meaning that if anyone in the Smith community determines that a student is in the U.S. illegally we should not tell the immigration authorities unless required to by law. </p><p class="continue-reading-link"><a href="http://www.ruthfullyyours.com/2019/04/30/like-the-campus-thought-police-by-james-d-miller/">Continue reading &#8594;</a></p><p class="post-meta post-top-meta">

	</p><p>https://www.capitolhilloutsider.com/jihad-and-mental-immune-system/</p><p>It is safe to say that before the 9/11 attacks; most Americans did not have the slightest knowledge of Islam and why a group of Arabs murdered so many innocent people in the name of their God. Some 18 years has passed since that dreadful day.</p><p>I think many of the same people who had no way of knowing of Islamic ideology during the 9/11 tragedy, some eighteen years ago, are still in a state of denial and live in a Utopian world, an ideal world where everything is as good as it can possibly be for everyone. But when reality hits again, they don&#8217;t know where to run and hide. This unconscious denial of a thought or an emotion, is referred to by psychologists as &#8220;mental block.&#8221; A mental block runs through their entire system of belief. This philosophy is clearly demonstrated after numerous horrific terrorist attacks in the United States in the aftermath of 9/11.</p><p>Let&#8217;s not blame the people, but instead, briefly try to decipher this phenomenon of the human mind.</p><p class="continue-reading-link"><a href="http://www.ruthfullyyours.com/2019/04/30/jihad-and-mental-immune-system-amil-imani/">Continue reading &#8594;</a></p><p class="post-meta post-top-meta">

The same cannot be said of those making fun of Muslims or Islam.</p><p>In response to the publication of an anti-Semitic cartoon in last Thursday&#8217;s International New York Times, protesters gathered outside the Manhattan office of the &#8220;Gray Lady&#8221; on Monday evening to demand that those responsible for the blatant display of Jew-hatred be fired.</p><p>Among the speakers at the rally were former New York Assemblyman Dove Hikind and eminent law professor Alan Dershowitz, both Jewish Democrats. Hikind led the crowd in chanting, &#8220;Shame on The New York Times.&#8221; Dershowitz decried the paper&#8217;s bias against Israel, and its practice of disguising slant as news coverage and analysis.</p><p>The demonstration followed viral social-media indignation over the cartoon, which depicts a blind, kippah-wearing U.S. President Donald Trump led by a seeing-eye dog (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu) with a Star of David hanging from his collar.</p><p>Initially, the &#8220;paper of record&#8221; issued a clarification, claiming that the publication of the cartoon had been an &#8220;error of judgement.&#8221; When ridiculed for this pathetic excuse, the Times published a better semblance of an apology, expressing &#8220;deep regret,&#8221; yet blaming a single mid-level editor for the mishap.</p><p>Nevertheless, in the following weekend edition, the International New York Times published a second cartoon&#8212;this one of Netanyahu dressed as Moses holding the Ten Commandments in one hand and a selfie-stick in the other.</p><p class="continue-reading-link"><a href="http://www.ruthfullyyours.com/2019/04/30/ruthie-blum-jewish-violence-what-the-gray-lady-knows-it-need-not-fear/">Continue reading &#8594;</a></p><p class="post-meta post-top-meta">

	</p><p>https://quadrant.org.au/magazine/2019/04/america-v-russia-who-won-the-cold-war/</p><p>&#8220;President Obama, as Mark Steyn unkindly explained in After America (2011), was trapped in an &#8220;elderly arrested adolescence&#8221;, his narcissism and naivety passed off as &#8220;nobility of spirit&#8221;. President Trump, vainglorious and glib, may not have read Huntington, or even heard of him, and yet he instinctively understands how the world turns.&#160;&#8221;</p><p>The end of the Cold War did not harbinger a golden age of peace, love and understanding between Washington and Moscow. There was talk, once upon a time, of the Russian Federation joining NATO, but it was never a serious option. NATO had been founded in 1949 to prevent Moscow annexing Western Europe. It exists today to prevent Moscow annexing Eastern Europe. We might spot a pattern here. Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Slovenia, Croatia and Montenegro are never again going to countenance Russia being in a position to offer them &#8220;fraternal assistance&#8221; (&#224; la East Berlin 1953, Budapest 1956, Prague 1968). For those nations, at least, the idea of Moscow assuming the role of key strategic power on NATO&#8217;s eastern flank must have sounded like the old Latin proverb Ovem lupo commitere&#8212;&#8220;To set a wolf to guard sheep&#8221;. None of this, however, is to suggest that configuring Russia as our implacable foe in any way serves the interests of the West. </p><p>Russia, even in its darkest moments during the 1990s, had little desire to be absorbed into an American-orchestrated New World Order. The West, then, did not lose Russia, because Russia has never been ours to squander. Samuel P. Huntington&#8217;s &#8220;The Clash of Civilisations?&#8221; thesis, which first appeared in a 1993 edition of Foreign Affairs, provides some of the reasons why. Huntington divided the world into nine major civilisational entities. He did not include Russia as part of &#8220;Western civilisation&#8221; but, rather, categorised it as a major part of &#8220;Orthodox civilisation&#8221;. Russia, despite its apparent similarities with the West, had been on a different civilisational journey&#8212;eschewing the Renaissance, the Reformation, the Industrial Revolution, parliamentary democracy, and so on&#8212;and had arrived at a very different destination. The end of the Soviet Union could never guarantee entirely harmonious relations between Russia and America, since each has its own geopolitical interests to pursue. George Kennan said something similar in his famous commentaries at the commencement of the Cold War: the demise of communist rule would not eliminate all civilisational frictions.</p><p class="continue-reading-link"><a href="http://www.ruthfullyyours.com/2019/04/30/america-v-russia-who-won-the-cold-war-daryl-mccann/">Continue reading &#8594;</a></p><p class="post-meta post-top-meta">

	</p><p>https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/immigration-western-civilization-leftist-complaints/</p><p>T he harshest critics of the West in general and the United States in particular are the best arguments for it. Take the latest iconic critic, 29-year-old Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez. She has a predictable list of complaints against America, past and present.</p><p>Yet fortunately for her, her paternal grandparents and mother had experienced firsthand the antitheses of mainland America. And thus they were obsessed with what was right, not wrong, with the continental United States &#8212; and with getting there as quickly as possible. If they had once been critics of America, such animus was seemingly not great enough to prevent them moving to a place with a different language, ethnic majority, and traditions from those of their home, itself a territory of the U.S.</p><p>They apparently assumed that a free-market economy and transparent government gave them economic opportunities unknown in Puerto Rico, an otherwise naturally rich landscape. They wisely stayed in North America, apparently because they felt as supposed minorities that they would have far more cultural, social, political, and economic opportunities than they would as part of the majority in Puerto Rico. The fact that her father was a second-generation immigrant and architect, that AOC herself grew up in affluent Westchester County, that she received scholarships to attend pricey Boston University, and that she was elected to Congress bore out her parents&#8217; correct assumptions of a meritocracy, not a caste state.</p><p class="continue-reading-link"><a href="http://www.ruthfullyyours.com/2019/04/30/why-go-west-by-victor-davis-hanson/">Continue reading &#8594;</a></p><p class="post-meta post-top-meta">

	</p><p>https://pjmedia.com/trending/8-times-barack-obama-abused-his-power-to-appease-his-base/</p><p>Joe Biden, now all in for 2020, has his sights set on Donald Trump. With daily attacks, he&#8217;s lobbing any accusation he can against Trump in the hopes that such attacks will get traction. His latest attack is to claim that President Trump has abused his powers. &#8220;There&#8217;s only one thing that stands in our way. It&#8217;s our broken political system that&#8217;s deliberately being undermined by our president to continue to abuse the power of the office,&#8221; Biden claimed, calling Trump &#8220;the only president who has decided not to represent the whole country. He has his base. We need a president who works for all Americans.&#8221;</p><p>Has Creepy Uncle forgotten that thanks to Trump, African-American unemployment is at an all-time low? So is Hispanic unemployment. Last I checked, African Americans and Hispanic vote overwhelmingly Democrat. Women also vote more Democrat, but are thriving in the Trump economy. Looks to me as though Trump has been working for all Americans&#8212;even those not in his base.</p><p>But what really got me about Biden&#8217;s comments was the part about Trump allegedly abusing power. President Trump has spent much of the past two years trying to undo Obama&#8217;s abuses of power&#8212;which Obama did, not in the best interests of the whole country, but for the benefit of his base. Has Biden forgotten Obama&#8217;s presidency or is he just a bad liar? Many of these abuses should have resulted in Obama&#8217;s impeachment. Unfortunately, Republicans in Congress didn&#8217;t have the guts to impeach him, but they tried everything could to reign in on his pseudo-dictatorship. Two pieces of legislation were drafted in order to stop his abuses and force him to follow the law. Obama threatened to veto both bills rather than risk any limits on his ever-expanding legislative authority.</p><p>Below are 8 examples of Obama doing exactly what Joe Biden just accused Donald Trump of doing.</p><p class="continue-reading-link"><a href="http://www.ruthfullyyours.com/2019/04/30/8-times-barack-obama-abused-his-power-to-appease-his-base-by-matt-margoli/">Continue reading &#8594;</a></p><p class="wp-pagenavi">

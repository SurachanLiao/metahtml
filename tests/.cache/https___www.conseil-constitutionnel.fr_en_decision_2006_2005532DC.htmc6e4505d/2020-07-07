Senators</p>
<p>THE CONSTITUTIONAL COUNCIL</p>
<p>Having regard to the Constitution;<br />
Having  regard  to  Ordinance  58-1067  of  November  7th  1958    as  amended  (Institutional Act on the Constitutional Council);<br />
Having  regard  to  the  observations  of  the  Government  registered  on  March  24th2003;<br />
Having regard to the Customs &amp; Excise Code;<br />
Having regard to the Criminal Code;<br />
Having regard to the Code of Criminal Procedure;<br />
Having  regard  to  Act  n°  78-17  of  January  6th  1978  as  amended  pertaining  to  Data processing, data files and individual freedoms ;<br />
Having  regard  to  Programme  and  Guideline  Act  n°  95-73  of  January  21st  1995  as amended pertaining to security;<br />
Having regard to Act n° 2003-239 of March 18th 2003 as amended, pertaining to internal security;<br />
Having  regard  to  Act  n°  2004-575  of  June  21st  2004  as  amended,  pertaining  to  confidence in the digital economy:<br />
Having  regard  to  the  observations  of  the  Government  registered  on  March  24th2003;<br />
Having heard the Rapporteur;</p>
<p>21.The  Senators  have  referred  for  review  by    the  Constitutional  Council  various  provisions of the statute pertaining to the fight against terrorism which concern security  and  border  controls;  they  argue  that  Sections  6  and  8  thereof  are  unconstitutional  ;  they  also  argue  that  Parliament  has  passed  provisions  which  are out of place in the statute referred for review;</p>
<p>WITH RESPECT TO SECTION 6:</p>
<ol start="2"><li>
<p>I   of   Section   6   of   the   statute   inserts   into   the   Post   and   Electronic   Communications  Code  a  new  article  L  34-1-1  which  introduces  "  in  order  to  prevent  and  punish  acts  of  terrorism"  a  procedure  of  administrative  requisition  of   technical   connection   data;   this   procedure   is   to   be   implemented   by   "individually   designated   and   duly   empowered   officers   of   the   Police   and   Gendarmerie  specially  assigned  to  such  tasks";  it  will  apply  to  all  natural  persons  and  legal  entities  operating  an  electronic  communications  network  open  to   the   public   or   providing   the   public   with   a   connection   making   on-line   communication  possible  via  access  to  such  a  network;    this  procedure  will  be  limited "to technical data concerning the identification of numbers of subscribers or   of   connections   to   electronic   communication   services,   to   collecting   all   subscriber  or  connection  numbers  of  a  designated  person,  to  data  concerning  communications  of  a  given  subscriber  as  regards  numbers  and  persons  called,  the  length  and  date  of  the  communications  ";  it  will  be  subject  to  the  prior  approval  of  a  person  designated  by  the  National  Commission  for  Monitoring  Security  Intercepts;  it  will  be  under  the  control  of  the  said  Commission  which  will  address  any  recommendations  to  the  Minister  of  the  Interior  when  it  ascertains " a breach of the rules laid down herein or any infringement of rights and freedoms"; it will allow for financial compensation to cover the extra costs involved in meeting such requests for information;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>II  of  the  same  Article  completes  Section  6  of  the  statute  of  June  21st  2004  aforementioned  by  a  II  bis  which  "in  order  to  prevent  and  punish  acts  of  terrorism",  extends  this  requisition  procedure  to  access  providers  and  internet  hosts;</p>
</li>
</ol><p>4.The Senators making the referral argue that this new procedure is designed not only to prevent but also to punish terrorist offences and that as such, insofar as it is  not  under  the  supervision  of  the  Judicial  authorities,  it  infringes  both  individual  freedoms  and  privacy;  they  also  argue  that  it  infringes  the  right  of  redress;</p>
<ol start="5"><li>
<p>The  technical  data  which  Section  6  of  the  statute  referred  for  review  empowers  the  Police  and  Gendarmerie  to  requisition  may  already  be  obtained  under the provisions of the Criminal Code in the framework of police operations designed  to  detect  the  commission  of  criminal  offences,  to  collect  evidence  or apprehend offenders; the data requisitions permitted by these new provisions are purely administrative police measures; they are not placed under the supervision of  the  Judicial  authorities  but  under  the  sole  authority  of  the  Executive;  they  cannot therefore have any other purpose than to ensure public order and prevent the  commission  of  offences;  thus,  by  stating  that  these  provisions  are  designed  not only to prevent acts of terrorism but also to punish the same, Parliament has infringed the principle of the separation of powers;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The  words  "  and  to  punish"  contained  in  indent  2  of  I  and  indent  2  of  II  of  Section   6   of   the   statute   referred   for   review   should   thus   be   held   to   be   unconstitutional; any administrative authority, when aware of the commission of a  crime  or  a  felony/  indictable  offence  nevertheless  remains  under  a  duty  to  inform the Judicial authorities of said commission;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The words thus found to be unconstitutional may be severed   from the other provisions  of  Section  6  of  the  statute  referred  for  review;  it  is  therefore  necessary  to  examine  whether  the  latter  conform  to  rules  and  principles  of  constitutional value;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Firstly,  Article  66  of  the  Constitution,  according  to  which  "No  one  can  be  arbitrarily  detained.  -    The  Judicial  authority,    guardian  of  individual  freedom,    shall  ensure  respect  for  this  principle  in  the  conditions  provided  for  by  law",  cannot  be  infringed  by  a  measure  which  merely  institutes  a  procedure  for  requisitioning technical data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secondly, it is the task of Parliament to reconcile the prevention of breaches of  law  and  order,  necessary  to  safeguard  rights  and  principles  of  constitutional  value, and the exercising of constitutionally guaranteed freedoms, among which the right to privacy and freedom of enterprise, respectively protected by Article 2 and 4 of the declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen of 1789;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In   the   case   in   hand,   Parliament   has   accompanied   the   procedure   for   requisitioning technical data by suitable limitations and safeguards, as indicated hereinabove,  designed  to  ensure  the  necessary  reconciliation  between  the  right  to privacy and freedom of enterprise on the one hand and the prevention of acts of  terrorism  on  the  other  hand,  which  the  procedure  in  question  is  intended  to  achieve;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lastly, under Article 16 of the Declaration of 1789, "Any Society in which no provision is made for guaranteeing rights or for the separation of powers, has no  Constitution";  this  provision  precludes  any  major  infringement  of  the  rights  of persons involved to effective redress before a court;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the case in hand, the persons having the requisite locus standi are not deprived of the constitutional guarantees which the law provides to accompany administrative police measures ; their right of redress is not infringed ;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It therefore is clear from the foregoing that, except for the words "and to punish" found in the second indents of I and II of Section 6 of the statute referred for review, this section is not unconstitutional;</p>
</li>
</ol><ul><li>WITH RESPECT TO SECTION 8:</li>
</ul><ol start="14"><li>
<p>Section 8 of the statute referred for review rewords Section 26 of the Act of March 18th 2003 referred to hereinabove; it enables Police, Gendarmerie and Customs and Excise Officers to use "fixed or mobile automatic monitoring devices for the purpose of identifying vehicles by photographing the occupants thereof wherever necessary" ...; it provides that "such devices may also be used by the Police and Gendarmerie on a temporary basis in order to preserve law and order, by decision of the administrative authorities, on the occasion of specific events or major gatherings"; it specifies that data thus collected may be processed by automatic means; it determines the conditions under which such data may be exploited and kept, depending on the outcome of comparisons made between such data and processed data concerning stolen or reported vehicles;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Senators making the referral argue that these provisions, by organising a "generalised system of monitoring" which extends to the persons inside monitored vehicles, infringe Article 66 of the Constitution, the right to freedom of movement and the right to privacy; they also argue that Parliament has failed to exercise its powers to the full;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Firstly, by its very nature, the procedure of automatic collection of data relating to vehicles introduced by Section 8 of the statute does not infringe the rule laid down by Article 66 of the Constitution whereby no person may be arbitrarily detained nor the right to freedom of movement protected by Articles 2 and 4 of the Declaration of 1789;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secondly, the device involved may be used for operations of both administrative and criminal law enforcement; it is placed under the authority of the judicial authorities when the criminal law is involved; thus, by vesting this device with the task of simplifying the punishment of offenders, the challenged section, unlike Section 6 review hereinabove, does not infringe the principle of the separation of powers;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thirdly, it is the task of Parliament to reconcile on the one hand the preventing of breaches of the peace, in particular where the safety of persons and property is concerned, and the apprehending of offenders, both of which are necessary for the safeguarding of rights and principles of constitutional value, with, on the other hand, the exercising of constitutionally guaranteed freedoms, which count among their number the right to privacy;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When enacting the challenged provisions, Parliament intended on the one hand to prevent and punish terrorism and terrorism-related offences, and on the other hand to facilitate the detecting of crimes and offences connected with organised crime, theft and receiving of stolen vehicles and also certain Customs offences; the ultimate purpose of these provisions is to apprehend those committing such offences;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recordings are erased after a period of eight days if the information obtained permitting the identification of vehicles is not found in the national data base of stolen or reported vehicles nor in the Schengen vehicle data system ; such searches are intended to focus on the features of the vehicles involved and not on photographing persons inside such vehicles; data which has not been the object of any "positive matching" can only be consulted during this period of time if required for criminal proceedings; only data which has been found to match will be kept; such data shall not be kept for more than one month, unless required for criminal or Customs proceedings; the only person authorised to access such data, within the limits set forth hereinabove, are individually designated and duly empowered officers from the Police and the Gendarmerie ; automatic processing of data thus collected will be governed by the provisions of the Act of January 6th 1978 referred to hereinabove ;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In view of the ultimate purpose which Parliament has striven to achieve and the guarantees provided for, the challenged provisions are such as to reconcile respect for privacy and the safeguarding of law and order in a manner which is not obviously unbalanced;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The arguments raised against section 8, which is not vitiated by any failure of Parliament to exercise its powers fully, are therefore to be dismissed;</p>
</li>
</ol><p>WITH RESPECT TO CERTAINS PROVISIONS OF THE STATUTE REFERRED FOR REVIEW</p>
<ol start="23"><li>
<p>The parties making the referral argue that the statute referred for review contains "numerous provisions foreign to the fight against terrorism"; they argue that such provisions are out of place in this statute and should be held unconstitutional;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Article 6 of the Declaration of 1789 states : " The law is the expression of the general will"; Indent 1 of Article 34 of the Constitution states: "Statutes shall be passed by Parliament"; Indent 1 of Article 39 of the Constitution states "The Prime Minister and Members of Parliament alike shall have the right to initiate statutes"; the right of amendment which the Constitution confers on Members of Parliament and the Government is exercised in the conditions and in compliance with the requirements provided for by Articles 40,11,44,45,47 and 47-1 of the Constitution</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Firstly, the combination of the provisions referred to in the foregoing paragraph show that the right of amendment vested in Members of Parliament and the Government must be able to be freely exercised by each of the two Houses during the first reading of Government Bills and Private Members' Bills. This right may only be restricted at this stage in the proceedings, and with due respect for the requirements of clarity and sincerity of Parliamentary debate, by the rules governing admissibility and the requirement that an amendment be not devoid of any connection with the text tabled before the first House called upon to debate it;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secondly, the wording of Article 45 of the Constitution, and in particular the terms used in indent 1 thereof, whereby " Every Government or Private Member's Bill shall be considered successively in the two Houses of Parliament with a view to passing an identical text", shows that, as reiterated by the Rules of both National Assembly and Senate, additions or amendments which may be made to a Government Bill or Private Member's Bill by Members of Parliament or the Government after the first reading must be directly connected with the provision remaining to be debated. However amendments designed to ensure compliance with the Constitution, coordination with texts under debate or to rectify any material error are not subject to such a requirement;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thus additions or amendments made to a Government Bill or Private Member's Bill in conditions other than those specified above must be considered to have been passed in irregular proceedings;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the case under consideration, the referred statute was only given one single reading before each of the two Houses before the meeting of the Joint Committee; those provisions which were introduced during Parliamentary debate must meet the conditions applicable to amendments passed during first reading, in particular the requirement that they be not devoid of any connection with the initial purpose of the Bill;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Section 19 of the statute referred, originating from an amendment passed by the National Assembly, inserts after indent 4 of section 19 of the Act of January 21st 1995 referred to above, an indent worded as follows: "Trade Union representation within the Joint Administrative Committees competent for civil servants members of the police force in active employment may derogate from the general status of the civil service in order to adapt and simplify the management of such employees. For this purpose, policemen and police sergeants constitute a single electoral college within National and Inter-Departmental Joint Administrative Committees representing officers and men of the Police force;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contrary to the other provisions of the statute referred for review, Section 19 of said statute is devoid of any connection with a Government Bill which, when tabled before the first House called upon to debate it, consisted solely of measures concerning the fight against terrorism, security and border controls; hence Section 19 was passed in proceedings which were unconstitutional;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Constitutional Council is not required proprio motu to examine the question of whether or not such provisions conform to the Constitution</p>
</li>
</ol><p>HELD:</p>
<p>Article 1 - The following are unconstitutional: - the words "and to punish" in the second indents of I and II of Section 6 of the Act pertaining to the fight against terrorism and containing various provisions concerning security and border controls - Section 19 of the same statute<br />
Article 2 - The remaining parts of Sections 6 and 8 of said statute are not unconstitutional Article 3 - This decision shall be published in the Journal Officiel of the French Republic.</p>
<p>Deliberated by the Constitutional Council sitting on January 19th 2006 composed of Messrs and Mesdames Pierre MAZEAUD, President, Jean-Claude COLLIARD, Olivier DUTHEILLET de LAMOTHE, Valéry GISCARD D'ESTAING, Jacqueline de GUILLENCHMIDT, Pierre JOXE, Jean-Louis PEZANT, Dominique SCHNAPPER, Pierre STEINMETZ and Simone VEIL.</p>

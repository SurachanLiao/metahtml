U.S. citizens should not approach the Embassy.” </p><p>Soleimani and the Quds Force “were responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American and coalition service members and the wounding of thousands more,” said the Department of Defense statement explaining the strike. “He had orchestrated attacks on coalition bases in Iraq over the last several months — including the attack on December 27th — culminating in the death and wounding of additional American and Iraqi personnel.” </p></blockquote><p>One U.S. civilian contractor was killed and several service members were wounded in the Dec. 27 rocket attack on the K1 military base used by U.S. and coalition forces in northern Iraq. The attack led to retaliatory U.S. military strikes in Iraq and Syria Sunday against the Iranian-backed militia the U.S. blamed for the Dec. 27 attack, which in turn led hundreds of pro-Iranian protesters to attempt to storm the U.S. embassy in Baghdad on New Year’s Eve. </p><p>Thursday’s strike against Soleimani “was aimed at deterring future Iranian attack plans,” the U.S. statement continued. “The United States will continue to take all necessary action to protect our people and our interests wherever they are around the world.” </p><p>Trump tweeted an American flag after the strike. It went viral within seconds.</p><p>On Friday morning, he Tweeted, “Iran never won a war, but never lost a negotiation!”</p> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><del>Iran never won a war, but never lost a negotiation!</del></p><del>— Donald J.

There will be reprisals, and Iran will likely target American troops and even our own political and military leaders. This is why the United States does not assassinate leaders of foreign nations-in the end such action risks getting more, not less, Americans killed in the long run.</p><p>“President Trump’s disastrous approach to Iran has, from the beginning, been all tactics and no strategy. They make it up day by day. The assassination of Soleimani fits this pattern. I hope I am wrong, but I suspect this White House is totally unprepared for the cascade of consequences that will follow last night’s actions. I pray for the Americans who, today, are in harm’s way. </p><p>“Now, it is up to Congress to press the president to disclose his legal basis for this action and the plan for how our nation manages the fallout. I doubt there is congressional authority for this strike, and I doubt the president has a plan for what comes next. But these are questions Congress must now ask.”</p></blockquote><p>Senator Richard Blumenthal also questioned the action’s consequences of a possible war.</p> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><del>Trump Admin owes a full explanation of airstrike reports—all the facts—to Congress&amp;the American people.

Not consulting with the American people, Congressional leadership and our allies before taking this escalatory action in a part of the world where we have been entangled for eighteen long years is the wrong way to isolate Iranian bad behavior and wind down our involvement in the Middle East.”</p><section id="custom_html-65" class="widget_text widget widget_custom_html"></section></article>

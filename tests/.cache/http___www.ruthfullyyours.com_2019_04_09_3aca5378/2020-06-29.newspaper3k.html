<p>As a result of a complaint that the Center for Equal Opportunity filed in 2004 against Texas Tech, the medical school there recently signed a Resolution Agreement (RA) with the U.S. Department of Education&#8217;s Office for Civil Rights, ending its use of racial preferences in admissions.  As of March 1, &#8220;an applicant&#8217;s race and/or national origin are no longer to be considered.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kudos to Texas Tech: This is even more impressive than its run to the Final Four!</p>
<p>Our complaint was filed when, after the Supreme Court had issued its 2003 decisions narrowly upholding the use of racial-admission preferences in some circumstances, Texas Tech announced that it would begin considering race, notwithstanding the fact that it had not been doing so and had achieved plenty of racial and ethnic diversity nonetheless. In our view, since the Court made clear that race was not to be used except as a last resort, Texas Tech&#8217;s announced new policy was unjustifiable.</p>
<p>In the course of the 15-year investigation that followed, the university clarified or backed away from its 2005 pronouncement until, by last November, only the investigation of the  five health-science schools remained. They, too, then clarified or backed away, so that by early this year the medical school was the only outlier. And on February 20 it came around, too. The relevant documents are posted on our website, here.</p>

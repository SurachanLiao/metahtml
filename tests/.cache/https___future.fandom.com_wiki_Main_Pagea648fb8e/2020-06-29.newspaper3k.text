What is Future Wiki?

Where advancements and changes in biology, electronics, engineering, and society result in many different scientific articles and futuristic scenarios.

Scenarios on how the future may develop - based on current and expected trends or on a contributors vision of the future

Map games where players control a country or faction.

Our guide to futurology provides an introduction to the discipline of futurology, while our standard timeline provides an introduction to the future. Furthermore, please read our guidelines before making any edits.

<div><p>RPG fans can pick up Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition for 50% off, dropping the price from $45 to $22.49. The sequel from Larian Studios earned an essential 10/10 in GameSpot's Divinity: Original Sin 2 review. Original Sin 2 is excellent no matter how you play, but it supports co-op for up to four players. Its predecessor, Divinity: Original Sin, is also quite good and is on sale for $14. The 2016 Diablo-esque action game Grim Dawn is just $5 (was $25), and Neverwinter Nights: Enhanced Edition drops to $14 (was $20). &#8230; <a href="https://www.gamemaz.info/2020/02/pc-multiplayer-games-get-big-discounts-in-new-weekend-sale/" class="more-link">[Read more...] about PC Multiplayer Games Get Big Discounts In New Weekend Sale</a></p></div>

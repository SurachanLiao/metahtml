												<p>The Asian Development Bank today projected a near 7 per cent growth for the Asia Pacific region during 2012.</p>
<p>ADB President Haruhiko Kuroda said the Asian Development Outlook (ADO) forecasts a &#8220;healthy GDP of 6.9 per cent for developing Asia and the Pacific in the 2012&#8243; and an accelerated 7.3 percent growth in 2013.</p>
<p>He said Asia and Pacific region would maintain its growth momentum despite issues elsewhere in the world and emphasised the need to make growth in the region more inclusive.</p> 
<p>Kuroda was addressing the media at the 45th Annual Meeting of the ADB here.</p>
<p>However,&#8221;the very drivers of Asia&#8217;s economic success &#8212; new technology,globalisation and market-oriented reforms &#8212; have also served to create and increase disparities within and among Asian economies,&#8221;  he cautioned.</p>
<p>He suggested remedies through investment in  education to reduce inequality in human capital,infrastructure investments to makes services and opportunities accessible to all and measures to make growth more employment friendly.</p>
<p>Kuroda said inclusive growth will be another key focus of this year&#8217;s annual meeting.</p>

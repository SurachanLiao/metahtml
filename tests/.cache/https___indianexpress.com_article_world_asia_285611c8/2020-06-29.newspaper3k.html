<p>However,&#8221;the very drivers of Asia&#8217;s economic success &#8212; new technology,globalisation and market-oriented reforms &#8212; have also served to create and increase disparities within and among Asian economies,&#8221;  he cautioned.</p>
<p>He suggested remedies through investment in  education to reduce inequality in human capital,infrastructure investments to makes services and opportunities accessible to all and measures to make growth more employment friendly.</p>

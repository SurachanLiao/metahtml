Britain, with only five cases, is trying to buy 32 million masks. And in the United States, President Barack Obama said more of the country's 132,000 schools may have to be shuttered. </p><p>At airports from Japan to South Korea to Greece and Turkey, thermal cameras were trained on airline passengers to see if any were feverish. And Lebanon discouraged traditional Arab peck-on-the-cheek greetings, even though no one has come down with the virus there... </p><p>In Germany, where officials confirmed three cases, Lufthansa announced that starting Thursday it will put a doctor aboard all flights to Mexico, the epicenter of the outbreak. </p><p>Experts said that makes sense: The doctors will be able to field questions from uneasy passengers and tend to anyone who might fall ill. </p><p>The World Health Organization said total bans on travel to Mexico  such as one imposed by Argentina, which hasn't had any confirmed cases  were questionable because the virus is already fairly widespread. </p><p>Roselyne Bachelot, France's health minister, said she would ask the European Union to suspend all flights to Mexico at a meeting Thursday in Luxembourg. </p><p>Travel bans were effective during the 2003 outbreak of SARS in Asia, because that illness can be transmitted only by people who already show symptoms. With flu, by contrast, the incubation period ranges from 24 hours to four days, meaning people often are infectious before they have symptoms...</p><p>(Excerpt) Read more at <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090430/ap_on_he_me/eu_swine_flu_drastic_measures;_ylt=AstjKGaPA26bF0v64LA1OBSs0NUE;_ylu=X3oDMTJ1NXBrZGFiBGFzc2V0A2FwLzIwMDkwNDMwL2V1X3N3aW5lX2ZsdV9kcmFzdGljX21lYXN1cmVzBGNwb3MDMQRwb3MDMgRzZWMDeW5fdG9wX3N0b3J5BHNsawN3b3JsZHRha2" target="_blank">news.yahoo.com</a> ...</p> <del><b>TOPICS:</b> <a href="/tag/foreign-news/index">Foreign Affairs Link: /tag/foreign-news/index </a>; <a href="/tag/government-news/index">Government Link: /tag/government-news/index </a>; <a href="/tag/elections-news/index">Politics/Elections Link: /tag/elections-news/index </a><br> <b>KEYWORDS:</b> <a href="/tag/chimeraflu/index">chimeraflu Link: /tag/chimeraflu/index </a>; <a href="/tag/flu/index">flu Link: /tag/flu/index </a>; <a href="/tag/influenza/index">influenza Link: /tag/influenza/index </a>; <a href="/tag/mexico/index">mexico Link: /tag/mexico/index </a>; <a href="/tag/swineflu/index">swineflu Link: /tag/swineflu/index </a></del> <p class="b2">As far as I can see, Obama has done nothing but talk about it.

World takes drastic steps to contain swine flu

From Egypt's order that all 300,000 pigs in the country be slaughtered to travel bans and putting the kibosh on kissing, the world is taking drastic  and some say debatable  measures to combat swine flu.

Egypt ordered the pig slaughter even though there hasn't been a single case of swine flu there and no evidence that pigs have spread the disease. Britain, with only five cases, is trying to buy 32 million masks. And in the United States, President Barack Obama said more of the country's 132,000 schools may have to be shuttered.

At airports from Japan to South Korea to Greece and Turkey, thermal cameras were trained on airline passengers to see if any were feverish. And Lebanon discouraged traditional Arab peck-on-the-cheek greetings, even though no one has come down with the virus there...

In Germany, where officials confirmed three cases, Lufthansa announced that starting Thursday it will put a doctor aboard all flights to Mexico, the epicenter of the outbreak.

Experts said that makes sense: The doctors will be able to field questions from uneasy passengers and tend to anyone who might fall ill.

The World Health Organization said total bans on travel to Mexico  such as one imposed by Argentina, which hasn't had any confirmed cases  were questionable because the virus is already fairly widespread.

Roselyne Bachelot, France's health minister, said she would ask the European Union to suspend all flights to Mexico at a meeting Thursday in Luxembourg.

Travel bans were effective during the 2003 outbreak of SARS in Asia, because that illness can be transmitted only by people who already show symptoms. With flu, by contrast, the incubation period ranges from 24 hours to four days, meaning people often are infectious before they have symptoms...

As far as I can see, Obama has done nothing but talk about it.

There is going to become a raging epidemic of “Nut Flu” before this is over. Just how 0bama wants it. What a miserable ‘leader’ he is!



To: Brilliant

Bush’s fault! Bush lied, pigs died!.....that ought to get me a job on MSNBC.

To: Brilliant

I am almost satisfied that he is doing nothing, because he has the choice of doing everything. Declaring martial law. Home searches for anyone infected. Quarantines for those that are infected or living with infected persons. In summary he can do all that we fear right now, legally and with the majority of the nation getting the daily Obama cattle prod up the rear they are all too easy to be herded in any direction.

Eh...just wash your hands and leave the borders alone and everything will be hunky dory.



To: Brilliant



It's obviously up to us.

To: Brilliant

Closing schools but leaving the border to Mexico open is stupid. The only way to effectively contain disease is to quarantine those who are sick. In this case, the State Dept. needs to ban travel to Mexico until the outbreak has ended since it is Americans who have visited Mexico who are bringing the swine flu here.



To: steadfastconservative

Unfortunately, it is already here. Travel bans and closing the border will do nothing to prevent the flu spreading further here. However, I think we should continue to push for closing the border for other reasons!



To: Mom MD

“Unfortunately, it is already here.” With all due respect, just what is “already here?” The usual daily hysterical lies about something new invented every other day or bring up something old again if the first time it didn’t stick? THERE IS NO PANDEMIC FLU. If you want to believe this lie, hide under your bed for the next ten years. We will tell you when to come out because we will all still be alive...if we remember to tell you to come out.

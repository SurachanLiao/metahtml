<div><a></a><p>The sequence of the 3' 4508 nucleotides (nt) of the genomic RNA of the Therien strain of rubella virus (RV) was determined for cDNA clones. The sequence contains a 3189-nt open reading frame (ORF) which codes for the structural proteins C, E2 and E1. C is predicted to have a length of 300 amino acids (aa). The N-terminal half of the C protein is highly basic and hydrophilic in nature, and is putatively the region of the protein which interacts with the virion RNA. At the C terminus of the C&#8230; <a class="text-truncator__toggle mod-clickable more" tabindex="0">CONTINUE READING</a> </p></div>

The reputable medical organization declared the coronavirus to be a lesser threat than abuse, drug use, and suicide, all of which pose a major risk to many children who are stuck at home during forced lockdowns and closures. But the statement failed to call into question some of the controversial COVID-19 policies that have been implemented during the pandemic and  encourages their continued use, even as some experts continue to question their effectiveness and safety.</p> <p class="catItemReadMore"><ins><a class="k2ReadMore" href="/culture/education/item/36217-american-academy-of-pedatrics-says-students-should-return-to-schools-in-the-fall">Read more...

Alex explains how knowing who we are as Americans--especially including our history and our founding documents--will be critical in defeating the Deep State and its globalist agenda. Finally, Newman talks about how the principles in the Declaration such as "all men are created equal" and are "endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights" led to eradicating slavery and equality before the law. Don't let the Deep State erase America's incredible history or the amazing fruit produced by its founding!</ins></p><p class="catItemReadMore"><ins><a class="k2ReadMore" href="/culture/history/item/36189-alex-newman-declaration-of-independence-vs-the-deep-state">Read more...

<h3>Changes to Aged Care Assessments</h3>
<p>In the interests of supporting the health and safety of assessors and clients during the COVID-19 pandemic, telephone and telehealth aged care assessments will be adopted as the default approach for community assessments by ACATs and RAS until further notice.</p>
<p>Face to face assessments are still permitted where necessary to support the needs of the client. This will be reviewed as the situation evolves. All assessment organisations are also being asked to increase welfare checks with clients during this period.</p></td>

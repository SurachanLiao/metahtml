This guidance document is provided to ensure consistent and transparent management of the limited supply of personal protective equipment (PPE).

Surgical masks: For GPs and pharmacies and staff for infection control, and for suspect patients.

P2/N95 masks: Specifically for GPs who are prepared and able to undertake specimen collection in their surgeries. P2/N95 respirators are only required for aerosol generating procedures.

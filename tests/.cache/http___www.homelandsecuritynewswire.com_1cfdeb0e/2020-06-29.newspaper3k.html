Hawks see U.S.-China great power competition as requiring a more aggressive posture, while doves worry about the downsides of an adversarial relationship. Ganesh Sitaraman writes that this dualist frame glosses over the fact that neither camp has a shared set of views. Rather, both hawks and doves contain a variety of subgroups&#8212;and some subgroups disagree with others on critical policy questions. &#8220;But without tractable categories for analysis, the debate over policy toward China is too often imprecise and&#160;confusing.&#8221;</p>

The company&#8217;s algorithms weren&#8217;t bringing people together. They were driving people apart. &#8220;Our algorithms exploit the human brain&#8217;s attraction to divisiveness,&#8221; read a slide from a 2018 presentation. &#8220;If left unchecked,&#8221; it warned, Facebook would feed users &#8220;more and more divisive content in an effort to gain user attention &amp; increase time on platform.&#8221; The Wall Street Journal reports that the main reason behind Facebook&#8217;s decision to do nothing was the fear that any content moderation measures would disproportionately affect right-wing pages, politicians, and other parts of the user base that drove up engagement. The company also wanted to stave off accusations of bias against conservative&#160;posters.</p>

John Ratcliffe (R-Texas) was confirmed last Thursday as President Donald Trump&#8217;s top intelligence adviser in a party line Senate vote, putting an inexperienced and highly partisan legislator at the top of the nation&#8217;s intelligence enterprise during a time of unprecedented threats to our security. Matt Olsen and Katrina Mulligan write that Ratcliffe made a name for himself defending the president, noisily and often falsely. At his confirmation hearing earlier this month, Ratcliffe vowed to &#8220;speak truth to power&#8221; and ensure the independence of intelligence agencies. But, will Ratcliffe keep those promises? Olsen and Mulligan are not&#160;sure:</p>

Betsy Woodruff Swan and Natasha Bertrand write that this is at least the fifth DHS has sent out to law enforcement officials in the last two months warning of the growing danger of far-right violent&#160;extremists.</p>

Shirin Sinnar writes that leaving aside the fact that current law does not grant the president the authority to designate the movement a terrorist organization, the deeper issue is this: &#8220;The sad irony in all this is that, over the past two years, some on the left have vocally supported an expansion of domestic terrorism frameworks&#8221; &#8211; calls which neglected the many concerns that civil rights&#160;groups.</p>

Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, walked himself into a civil-military problem when he walked across Pennsylvania Avenue &#8211; in his battle fatigues! &#8211; last week. Jim Golby and Peter Feaver write that Milley was literally following President Donald Trump, who was on his way for a photo-op in front of St. John&#8217;s Episcopal Church in order to counter stories about the president holed up in his basement while riots raged outside. &#8220;Presidents who are struggling politically have a powerful incentive to wrap themselves in military garb precisely because the American public holds the military in high esteem. But, when the language of national security is stretched to provide cover for what is otherwise viewed as a nakedly partisan effort, it jeopardizes the very esteem for the military on which the administration relies,&#8221; they&#160;write.</p>

Why?</a></h3><p></p><p>The &#8220;infodemic&#8221; around covid-19, declared by the WHO in February, is not the world&#8217;s first outbreak of misinformation, but one big difference between the infodemics of the past and those of 2020 is the rapid worldwide transmission of today&#8217;s nonsense, enabled by the internet. Social media enable people to share true news as well as the fake sort. But the fabulists seem to be winning. There is another difference between the past and the present: The historian Richard Hofstadter, in his seminal essay 1964 on the &#8220;paranoid style&#8221; in American politics, wrote that the paranoid style came as easily to those on the left as on the right, but, the Economist notes, &#8220;today&#8217;s infodemic appears to be spreading more easily among the world&#8217;s conservatives than its&#160;liberals.&#8221;</p>

The Justice Department&#8217;s Troubling Explanation</a></h3><p></p><p>Over the previous week, thousands of National Guard troops from states across the country arrived in Washington, D.C., as part of the Trump administration&#8217;s response to the largely peaceful protests taking place across the city. &#8220;But under what legal authority were they deployed to D.C. in the first place?&#8221; The mayor of Washington, D.C. asked Attorney General William Barr the same question &#8211; but Steve Vladeck writes that Barr&#8217;s response, that the deployment of the troops was under the authority of 32 U.S.C.&#167; 502(f), raises two vexing possibilities, neither of them reassuring: either Barr is wrong about 32 U.S.C.&#167; 502(f), or he is&#160;right.</p>

Jacob Zenn, the author, most recently, of Unmasking Boko Haram: Exploring Global Jihad in Nigeria, writes that the increase came as a response to a January meeting with the G5 Sahel (Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, and Niger) that affirmed the Sahel&#8217;s top security threat is the Islamic State&#8217;s local affiliate, popularly known as the Islamic State in Greater Sahara (ISGS), which is formally part of the Islamic State&#8217;s West African&#160;Province.</p>

William Hague writes in <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/06/15/disastrous-lockdown-can-never-repeated-even-virus-returns/">The Telegraph</a> that instead of having to rely entirely on widely varying mathematical models and fight an unknown virus in a fog of uncertainty, governments can start to see what has actually worked in different places around the world. The most important thing we now know is the true cost of a national lockdown, not just in economic but in human terms. The lockdown was a disaster on many fronts. &#8220;Such a disaster cannot under any circumstances be repeated. There can be no second&#160;lockdown.&#8221;</p>

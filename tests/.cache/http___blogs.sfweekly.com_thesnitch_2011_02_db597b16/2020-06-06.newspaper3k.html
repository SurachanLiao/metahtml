                      Coming Wednesday to Yerba Buena Gardens

            <p>This really is a case of life imitating art -- so long as you're willing to permit the "art" classification to be applied to video games. <br><br>It seems that a rally against North Korea has been orchestrated to take place in San Francisco Wednesday by video-game company <a href="http://www.homefront-game.com/#/home">THQ</a>, which this month is publishing a shooter game, <i><a href="http://shootersonly.com/xbox/homefront-has-a-story-to-tell/">Homefront</a></i>, in which players assume the role of American guerrilla fighters challenging North Korean forces that have successfully occupied the United States.<br><br>The rally, which will begin with a march across the Golden Gate Bridge and</p>
<p>ends with a noon protest at Yerba Buena Gardens, doesn't seem to be</p>
<p>the sort of affair to which you should bring your AK-47. A statement from the company states that the event will draw attention to "North</p>
<p>Korea's human rights violations," and "will include speeches by global</p>
<p>experts, musical performances, and the launch of 10,000 balloons."<br> <br></p>

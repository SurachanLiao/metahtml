<p>"There are months and months of work that go behind these looks,"&#160;Emma Stone's&#160;make-up artist and Nars Cosmetics director of pro artistry and red carpet,&#160;Rachel Goodwin tells The Telegraph.&#160;&#8220;It&#8217;s the biggest, most high-pressured day for women. The Oscars is the red carpet;&#160;it&#8217;s&#160;the one that everyone compares all the other ones to."</p>
<p>It's unsurprising then that the beauty looks often feel unattainable to us mere&#160;mortals. And yet, thanks to&#160;a rising numbers of experts taking to social media to share their tricks of the trade, it's become clear that some of the Oscar 2017 red carpet beauty&#160;tricks aren't as complicated as you'd think...&#160;</p>

But for Dakota Johnson&#8217;s chic knotted half-up, half-down look, hairstylist Mark Townsend employed just two products: Dove&#8217;s Extra Hold Hairspray - this isn&#8217;t available in the UK, but Elnett is equally as good - and <a href="http://www.boots.com/scunci-comfort-no-slip-grip-brown-24-10211815" rel="nofollow">Scunci Hair Grips, &#163;2.99</a>.

Henson&#8217;s decolletage and arms just before she hit the red carpet. &#8220;Taraji is a firm believer in &#8216;less is more&#8217;, so we didn&#8217;t want to overcomplicate&#160;or overthink anything,&#8221; Sheriff said. The gloss was applied where the light would naturally hit and is a great tip to employ if you want to enhance, or fake, sculpted limbs.</p><p class="component-content">

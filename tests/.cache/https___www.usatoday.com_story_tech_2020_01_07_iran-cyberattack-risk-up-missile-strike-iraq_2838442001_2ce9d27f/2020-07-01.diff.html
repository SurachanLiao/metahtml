The worm destroyed nuclear centrifuges at the Natanz uranium enrichment plant.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">“Stuxnet caused Iran to really wake up: 'Hey this cyber stuff is really powerful. We can do this, too.' And unlike nuclear weapons, it doesn’t take a huge industrial infrastructure," Bellovin said.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"Iran’s abilities have gotten noticeably stronger over the last 10 years," with hackers targeting major U.S. financial institutions, universities and companies, he said.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Bellovin warns that it could take years for Iran to launch a cyberattack. American companies should shore up their defenses accordingly, he said.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"I worry about companies letting down their guard," Bellovin said. "If people get an alert and then after three weeks revert to business as usual, two years from now they may find themselves hit badly."</p></article> <p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><del>Contributing: Kevin Johnson</del></p>

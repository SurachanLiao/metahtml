We can do this, too.' And unlike nuclear weapons, it doesn&#8217;t take a huge industrial infrastructure," Bellovin said.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"Iran&#8217;s abilities have gotten noticeably stronger over the last 10 years," with&#160;hackers targeting&#160;major U.S. financial institutions, universities and companies, he said.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Bellovin warns that&#160;it could take years for Iran to launch a cyberattack. American companies should shore up their defenses accordingly, he said.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"I worry about companies letting down their guard," Bellovin&#160;said. "If people get an alert and then after three weeks revert to business as usual, two years from now they may find themselves hit badly."</p></article>

Credit Euronews.</ins></p><p><ins>We have a very interesting scenario developing around the world ladies and gentlemen. Al Gore, Greta Thunberg et al, are going to be left with egg on their faces as the use of carbon dioxide emissions drop drastically (which they blame for global warming) due to the global Convid-109 lockdown, as factories and fuel emissions decline world-wide. March brought a substantial (more than 45 %) drop in global commercial air traffic. According to their mantra, as co2 use drops so will the temperature of our planet.</ins></p><p><ins>Will the planet keep on warming? I personally think so, already NOAA is predicting above-average temperatures across the US, this spring, as well as above-average precipitation in the central and eastern United States. Significant rainfall events could trigger flood conditions on top of already saturated soils. 2019 was the wettest year in the U.S., in many years devasting crops the whole year through.</ins></p><p><ins>Above: Earth Wind Map showing how the world looks today regarding the cancer-causing particulates PM2.5, (orange) which have been causing devasting smog in Indian, China and Indonesian cities this year.

Scientists from the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI) have been using data from Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite to monitor both weather and pollution over Europe.

The new images clearly illustrate a strong reduction of nitrogen dioxide concentrations over major cities across Europe – specifically Milan, Paris and Madrid.

The satellite images show nitrogen dioxide concentrations from 14 to 25 March 2020, compared to the monthly average of concentrations from 2019.</ins></p><ins> This animation, using data from the Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite, shows the nitrogen dioxide concentrations from 20 December 2019 until 16 March 2020 – using a 10-day moving average. The drop in concentrations in late-January is visible, coinciding with the nationwide quarantine, and from the beginning of March, the nitrogen dioxide levels have begun to increase. </ins><ins><a href="https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Copernicus/Sentinel-5P/Coronavirus_lockdown_leading_to_drop_in_pollution_across_Europe" target="_blank">ESA Link: https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Copernicus/Sentinel-5P/Coronavirus_lockdown_leading_to_drop_in_pollution_across_Europe </a></ins><p><ins>OUR SUN IS BLANK, REALLY BLANK</ins></p><p><ins>Deep Slumber, credit SDO

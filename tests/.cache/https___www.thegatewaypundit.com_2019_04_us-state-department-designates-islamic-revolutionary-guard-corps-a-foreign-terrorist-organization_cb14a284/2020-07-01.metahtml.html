<h3>Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced on Monday that the United States was designating the Islamic Republic Revolutionary Guard Corps a foreign terrorist organization.</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Revolutionary_Guard_Corps">Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps</a> (IRGC) is a branch of Iran&#8217;s Armed Forces founded after 1979 Revolution by order of Ayatollah Khomeini. The Revolutionary Guard is expected to protect the country&#8217;s Islamic Republic system.

<p>The Iranian Revolutionary Guards Commander Abbassi admitted to having terror cells situation and ready to strike in the United States.</p>
<p>Via activist Banafsheh Zand.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Abbassi: I&#8217;ll be brief. We have two million Iranians there. Be certain that I will raise a guerilla army from amongst them against you. You know this well. Look how vulnerable you were on 9-11 when four Arabs who don&#8217;t know how to fight managed to endanger your foundations. </p>

<p>Here is President Donald Trump&#8217;s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-president-designation-islamic-revolutionary-guard-corps-foreign-terrorist-organization/">statement</a> designating the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a Foreign Terrorist Organization.</p>
<p>Today, I am formally announcing my Administration&#8217;s plan to designate Iran&#8217;s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), including its Qods Force, as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) under Section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. This unprecedented step, led by the Department of State, recognizes the reality that Iran is not only a State Sponsor of Terrorism, but that the IRGC actively participates in, finances, and promotes terrorism as a tool of statecraft. The IRGC is the Iranian government&#8217;s primary means of directing and implementing its global terrorist campaign.</p>
<p>This designation will be the first time that the United States has ever named a part of another government as a FTO. It underscores the fact that Iran&#8217;s actions are fundamentally different from those of other governments. This action will significantly expand the scope and scale of our maximum pressure on the Iranian regime. It makes crystal clear the risks of conducting business with, or providing support to, the IRGC. If you are doing business with the IRGC, you will be bankrolling terrorism.</p>
<p>This action sends a clear message to Tehran that its support for terrorism has serious consequences. We will continue to increase financial pressure and raise the costs on the Iranian regime for its support of terrorist activity until it abandons its malign and outlaw behavior.</p>

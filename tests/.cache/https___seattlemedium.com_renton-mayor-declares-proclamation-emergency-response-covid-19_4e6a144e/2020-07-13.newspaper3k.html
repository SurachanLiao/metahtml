<div><p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-38065" src="http://seattlemedium.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/City-of-Renton-Logo.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="200">Renton Mayor Armondo Pavone has declared a proclamation of emergency for the city of Renton due to public health impacts of the COVID-19 (Coronavirus).&#160;</p>
<p>The proclamation supports measures to be taken to protect public health, safety and welfare within the city.&#160;</p>
<p>Several patients in the region have tested positive for the COVID-19 (Coronavirus), and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has issued warnings regarding the impacts and severity of this event. COVID-19 is a respiratory disease that can result in serious illness or death and can easily spread from person to person.&#160;</p>
<p>On February 29, 2020, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee proclaimed that a State of Emergency exists in all counties in the state, and on March 1, 2020, King County Executive Dow Constantine signed a Proclamation of Emergency due to the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the county.&#160;</p>
<p>Because the City of Renton may require supplemental assistance if the severity of the event goes beyond the capabilities of local resources, the proclamation of emergency enables the city to call in additional resources. Additionally, it provides the mayor with the maximum flexibility to respond to this health crisis.&#160;</p>
<p>We encourage community members to help protect yourself as you would during any cold or flu season.&#160;</p>
<p>The city will continue to keep residents informed with updates to the city website, rentonwa.gov, as well as Facebook (@CityofRenton) and Twitter (@CityofRenton) as information becomes available.&#160;</p>
<p>Information on the coronavirus in other languages is provided below and on the city&#8217;s website.&#160;Share this story:             <a class="synved-social-button synved-social-button-share synved-social-size-24 synved-social-resolution-single synved-social-provider-facebook nolightbox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Share on Facebook" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fseattlemedium.com%2F%3Fp%3D38064&amp;t=Renton%20Mayor%20Declares%20Proclamation%20Of%20Emergency%20In%20Response%20To%20COVID-19&amp;s=100&amp;p%5Burl%5D=https%3A%2F%2Fseattlemedium.com%2F%3Fp%3D38064&amp;p%5Bimages%5D%5B0%5D=https%3A%2F%2Fseattlemedium.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F03%2FCity-of-Renton-Logo.jpg&amp;p%5Btitle%5D=Renton%20Mayor%20Declares%20Proclamation%20Of%20Emergency%20In%20Response%20To%20COVID-19"><img alt="Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" class="synved-share-image synved-social-image synved-social-image-share" width="24" height="24" src="https://seattlemedium.com/wp-content/plugins/social-media-feather/synved-social/image/social/regular/48x48/facebook.png"></a><a class="synved-social-button synved-social-button-share synved-social-size-24 synved-social-resolution-single synved-social-provider-twitter nolightbox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Share on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseattlemedium.com%2F%3Fp%3D38064&amp;text=Check%20out%20this%20story%20from%20seattlemedium.com"><img alt="twitter" title="Share on Twitter" class="synved-share-image synved-social-image synved-social-image-share" width="24" height="24" src="https://seattlemedium.com/wp-content/plugins/social-media-feather/synved-social/image/social/regular/48x48/twitter.png"></a><a class="synved-social-button synved-social-button-share synved-social-size-24 synved-social-resolution-single synved-social-provider-linkedin nolightbox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Share on Linkedin" href="http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fseattlemedium.com%2F%3Fp%3D38064&amp;title=Renton%20Mayor%20Declares%20Proclamation%20Of%20Emergency%20In%20Response%20To%20COVID-19"><img alt="linkedin" title="Share on Linkedin" class="synved-share-image synved-social-image synved-social-image-share" width="24" height="24" src="https://seattlemedium.com/wp-content/plugins/social-media-feather/synved-social/image/social/regular/48x48/linkedin.png"></a><a class="synved-social-button synved-social-button-share synved-social-size-24 synved-social-resolution-single synved-social-provider-mail nolightbox" rel="nofollow" title="Share by email" href="mailto:?subject=Renton%20Mayor%20Declares%20Proclamation%20Of%20Emergency%20In%20Response%20To%20COVID-19&amp;body=Check%20out%20this%20story%20from%20seattlemedium.com:%20https%3A%2F%2Fseattlemedium.com%2F%3Fp%3D38064"><img alt="mail" title="Share by email" class="synved-share-image synved-social-image synved-social-image-share" width="24" height="24" src="https://seattlemedium.com/wp-content/plugins/social-media-feather/synved-social/image/social/regular/48x48/mail.png"></a></p>

COVID-19 is a respiratory disease that can result in serious illness or death and can easily spread from person to person.</p><p>On February 29, 2020, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee proclaimed that a State of Emergency exists in all counties in the state, and on March 1, 2020, King County Executive Dow Constantine signed a Proclamation of Emergency due to the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the county.</p><p>Because the City of Renton may require supplemental assistance if the severity of the event goes beyond the capabilities of local resources, the proclamation of emergency enables the city to call in additional resources. Additionally, it provides the mayor with the maximum flexibility to respond to this health crisis.</p><p>We encourage community members to help protect yourself as you would during any cold or flu season.</p><p>The city will continue to keep residents informed with updates to the city website, rentonwa.gov, as well as Facebook (@CityofRenton) and Twitter (@CityofRenton) as information becomes available.</p><p>Information on the coronavirus in other languages is provided below and on the city’s website.

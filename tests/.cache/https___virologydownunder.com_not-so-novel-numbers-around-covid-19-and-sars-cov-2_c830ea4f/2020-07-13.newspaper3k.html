<p>A mammoth overview was just released by researchers from the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention (their website is a bit slow right now so have patience).[1] It broke down important details of 44,672 RT-PCR confirmed cases from among 72,314 unique records that spanned from close to the known start of the emergence in early December, to  February 11, 2020.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I&#8217;ve taken some of the key findings and put them into an infographic below. Keep in mind that although <strong>80.9%</strong> of cases are described as <strong>mild</strong>, that leaves nearly a fifth (<strong>18.5%</strong>) of all cases in China defined as <strong>severe </strong>or critical. The <strong>critical </strong>group include all those who go on to die. Hospitalisation among more severe disease can last between 2 and 6 weeks. It has been predicted via media reports that 60% or more of a population could be infected during the initial spread of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus; see below).</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">While you&#8217;re here and because I really haven&#8217;t much time to spare for more blogs right now, let&#8217;s jam in a bit of info about the latest &#8211; and hopefully last &#8211; naming system so I have something to reference for people who ask.</p>



<h2>What&#8217;s in a coronavirus name?</h2>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">As we all now know and have committed to memory &#8211; riiiiIIiight??? &#8211; the virus and disease got new names on January 11th.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">On February 12th AEST, the coronavirus first discovered in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China was at last given a permanent name. Up until then, it had simply been called a <a href="https://www.who.int/csr/don/12-january-2020-novel-coronavirus-china/en/">novel coronavirus (nCoV)</a> and then the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). </p>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">BREAKING: WHO has received the genetic sequences for the novel <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/coronavirus?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#coronavirus</a> (2019-nCoV) from the Chinese authorities. We expect them to be made publicly available as soon as possible. <a href="https://t.co/h1w7A0jBm2">pic.twitter.com/h1w7A0jBm2</a></p>&#8212; World Health Organization (WHO) (@WHO) <a href="https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1216108498188230657?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 11, 2020</a></blockquote> 




<p class="has-medium-font-size">After lengthy consideration of the genetic sequence of the virus and how it related to already known coronaviruses, a specific coronavirus study group (CSG) from the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), the global authority on the designation and naming of viruses, designated this virus as <strong>severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)</strong>. This will be the name used in all scientific literature from now on. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">At the same time, the World Health Organization gave the disease in those infected by SARS-CoV-2 a distinct name as well, <strong>corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19)</strong>.[3-4] </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">These two names are not interchangeable as one names the infectious agent and the other the outcome from infection by it.</p>

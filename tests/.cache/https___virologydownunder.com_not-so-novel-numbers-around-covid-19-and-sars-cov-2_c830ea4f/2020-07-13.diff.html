Keep in mind that although 80.9% of cases are described as <ins>mild,</ins> <del><strong>mild</strong>,</del> that leaves nearly a fifth <ins>(18.5%)</ins> <del>(<strong>18.5%</strong>)</del> of all cases in China defined as severe or critical. The critical group include all those who go on to die. Hospitalisation among more severe disease can last between 2 and 6 weeks. It has been predicted via media reports that 60% or more of a population could be infected during the initial spread of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus; see below).</p> <del><img src="https://i0.wp.com/virologydownunder.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/COVID-19-infographic_2_28FEB2020.png?resize=780%2C746&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-9697">Data from the recent distillation characteristics from among 44,672 lab-confirmed cases of COVID-19 due to SARS-CoV-2.[1]

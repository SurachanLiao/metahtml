Bootstrapping the Reward Culture in Online Forums

Every day, Tapatalk picks some of the best discussions to reward the content creators and the participants. We believe communities are built on top of positive reinforcements. You can take part in this process too. Sending awards to others is the best way to pay it forward, and together we can build an advertisement-free online community ecosystem.

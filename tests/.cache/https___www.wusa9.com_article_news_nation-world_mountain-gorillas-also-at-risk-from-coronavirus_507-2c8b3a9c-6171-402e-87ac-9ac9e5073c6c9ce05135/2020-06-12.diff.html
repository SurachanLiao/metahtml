Visitors from virus-affected countries who have gone through quarantine in Uganda need to produce what he called a certificate of isolation before they are permitted to track the gorillas.</p><p>Amos Wekesa, whose Great Lakes Safaris organizes gorilla tours in Rwanda and Uganda, spoke mournfully of “hardly any business" as tourists postpone visits or seek refunds.</p><p>The region’s mountain gorilla population dropped sharply in the past century because of poaching, illness and human encroachment. Mountain gorillas have been listed as critically endangered or endangered since 1996, although their numbers are now said to be growing as a result of conservation efforts.</p><p>But there have been painful losses. Some gorillas die of natural causes, falling from trees or being killed in fights between males for territory or dominance. A lightning strike killed four mountain gorillas in February.</p><p>In Rwanda, where tourism is the top foreign exchange earner, the government has prioritized the protection of gorillas, even launching a naming ceremony for baby primates.</p> <p><ins>RELATED: <a class="cms__embed-related-story__link" href="/article/news/nation-world/pop-superstar-rihanna-donates-5-million-to-relief-efforts/507-ab6b477c-8e93-4ff5-a6f4-61612c34788e">Pop superstar Rihanna donates $5 million to relief efforts Link: /article/news/nation-world/pop-superstar-rihanna-donates-5-million-to-relief-efforts/507-ab6b477c-8e93-4ff5-a6f4-61612c34788e </a></ins></p><p><ins>RELATED: <a class="cms__embed-related-story__link" href="/article/news/nation-world/fda-approves-coronavirus-test-that-produces-results-in-45-minutes/507-188cc9a3-3ad7-48ec-b3eb-30518e626304">FDA approves coronavirus test that produces results in 45 minutes Link: /article/news/nation-world/fda-approves-coronavirus-test-that-produces-results-in-45-minutes/507-188cc9a3-3ad7-48ec-b3eb-30518e626304 </a></ins></p> <p>Tourism revenue is key in protecting mountain gorillas as authorities can use some of the money to help local communities or invest in anti-poaching activities. A gorilla tracking permit costs up to $600 in Uganda, and thousands of tourists pay each year. A similar permit costs upward of $1,000 in Rwanda.</p><p>Some worry the loss of tourist revenue during the coronavirus pandemic could further expose the primates to poachers. Virunga, established in 1925 as Africa’s first national park and now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, has long been vulnerable in a volatile part of eastern Congo.</p><p>“I think this is going to have a huge impact on their sustainability," Kahumbu, the Kenyan conservationist, said of Virunga. “I call on all donors and governments that support these national parks in Africa to make it easy for the parks that need to shut down to do so and survive."</p><p>Poachers could do even more damage to gorillas if they think the anti-poaching efforts have been reduced, she said.</p> <p class="photo__credit"><ins>Credit: AP</ins></p><p class="photo__caption"><ins>FILE- In this Sept. 2, 2019 photo, a silverback mountain gorilla named Segasira sits among plants in the Volcanoes National Park, Rwanda.

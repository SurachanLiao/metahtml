<article class="post-67061217 post type-post status-publish format-standard entry"><p>More than 3,700 Americans have tested positive for the novel coronavirus&#160;and at least 69 have died, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University and CBS News. However, U.S. health officials say a relatively small percentage of children have tested positive for COVID-19 and those who have it tend to show milder symptoms. No child deaths have yet been reported. By comparison, 36 million Americans have gotten the flu this season and about 22,000 have died. Children have been more vulnerable than years past with 144 pediatric deaths reported, according to the latest statistics from the CDC. Eight more child deaths were reported this week. The figures underline a recent trend &#8212; while COVID-19 has largely spared children since its December outbreak in China, the flu has proven particularly devastating for kids in America this season. (In older people, however, coronavirus is much deadlier than the flu.) The CDC&#8217;s most recent&#160;flu report&#160;says that as of March 7, hospitalization rates among children aged 4 and under were the highest on record at this point in the season, surpassing rates reported during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. The 144 children&#8217;s deaths also mark the highest on record since the 2009 season.

<div><p class="standfirst">Can the coronavirus be contained? As the number of infected rises, the world is racing to isolate the disease and prevent a global pandemic. But some experts believe it is already too late.</p><p>Borders closed, roads blocked, flights cancelled. As of 6:00am, 28,000 people are now infected including a new born baby. </p>
                        <p>
                            The biggest operation in history to contain an infectious disease is happening right now in Hubei province, in central China. Over 50 million people are
                            quarantined, banned from leaving the region. Foreign countries are flying their citizens out, monitoring them closely for symptoms of the deadly
                            coronavirus. And the news inside Hubei is of crowded hospitals and shortages of medical supplies.

                        <p>
                            It is a scary picture. The deserted streets and shops look like something out of a zombie apocalypse. But is it as bad as it looks? We now have more data about the virus and
                            epidemiology
                            can help us separate the facts from the panic.

                        <p>
                            Two numbers help us understand what is happening. The first is the
                            case mortality rate. This tells us what percentage of the people infected will die.
                            WHO
                            currently estimates the virus is killing 2.1% of those with the virus, mostly the elderly and people with other health problems. That is much higher than, say, flu (less than 0.1%), but it is nowhere near as deadly as the
                            Sars
                            outbreak of 2003 (9.5%).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The second number is the
                            infection rate. How many people does each person infect, on average? It may be as low as 1.4 people, but Chinese scientists think it could be as high as 5.5. Much less contagious than measles (12 to 18 people), but much more than Sars.
                        </p>
                        <p>One more piece of the puzzle: the virus takes up to two weeks to incubate in the body before you begin to feel ill. This is why the Chinese government has quarantined millions of healthy people in Hubei.</p>
                        <p>The problem, argues expert Jeremy Konyndyk, is &#8220;the horse has probably already left the barn&#8221;. With more cases reported outside China, it is too late to contain the virus. The focus should be on finding a cure. And containment may make things worse, says public health expert Vageesh Jain. &#8220;A quarantine of this scale will create more problems than it solves.&#8221; Shutting down whole cities will cause food shortages, spread panic, and make treating people harder.</p>
                        <p>However, China is taking no chances. With months before we develop a cure, expect to hear a lot more about quarantines and containing the disease. </p>
                        <p>But can it be contained?</p>

      <h2>Stick or twist</h2>
      <p>Yes, because it has to be. There really isn&#8217;t a choice for any responsible government. Firstly, even if containment reduces the spread by as little as 10% or 5%, it is still worth it. Secondly, the idea is to buy time while scientists rush to try and develop a vaccine. That surely is a worthy aim. Thirdly, it is easier to focus medical resources on fewer areas. Building a new 1,000-bed hospital in 10 days in the
                            epicentre
                            of the outbreak was exactly the right thing to do.</p>
      <p>No, we would be better to face the facts. The virus cannot now be fenced in. Quarantine only works with smaller numbers. If it sounds a bit heartless to reduce an epidemic to maths, that misunderstands the power of numbers. Numbers help us to see what is going on. In fact, they are encouraging, for they show that, like any virus, this one will eventually peak and then fall away. And next time it strikes, humanity will be ready with a vaccine.</p>

But physicians say that health insurance behemoth UnitedHealthcare will create exactly this scenario through <a class href="https://medcitynews.com/2021/06/emergency-physicians-oppose-new-unitedhealth-policy-enabling-retroactive-ed-claims-denial/?rf=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">a new policy that would allow it to retroactively deny emergency department claims</a>, MedCity News reported. Expecting people with zero medical training to somehow diagnose themselves is messed-up, period â but especially now, when worrisome symptoms like a fever or nausea could very well indicate COVID-19.</p><p>Starting July 1, UnitedHealthcare can deny or limit coverage for an emergency department (ED) visit if the insurance company determines it wasnât, in fact, an emergency, according to MedCity News. The outlet explained that UnitedHealthcare will make this call based on the patientâs condition, the type and number of diagnostic services they receive, and other external factors.</p><p>The insurer implemented the policy â which would apply to fully insured members in most states â as a means of reducing ED costs, Tracey Lempner, UnitedHealthcareâs director of communications, told MedCity News. âUnnecessary use of the emergency room costs nearly $32 billion annually, driving up healthcare costs for everyone,â she wrote in an email to the outlet. âWe are taking steps to make care more affordable, encouraging people who do not have a healthcare emergency to seek treatment in a more appropriate setting, such as an urgent care center.â Per MedCity News, providers can submit an attestation if they consider the visit an emergency, in which case UnitedHealthcare would probably still cover it.</p><p>But in a letter to UnitedHealthcare, Richard J. Pollack, president and CEO of the American Hospital Association wrote that âthreatening patients with a financial penalty for making the wrong decision could have a chilling effect on seeking emergency careâ and highlighted <a class href="https://www.aha.org/lettercomment/2021-06-08-letter-unitedhealthcare-retroactive-denial-coverage-emergency-level-care" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">the danger of delaying emergency care during the pandemic</a>.</p><p>Pollackâs letter also described UnitedHealthcareâs confusing, contradictory advice to its members: On the one hand, <a class href="https://www.uhc.com/member-resources/know-your-care-options/urgent-care" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">the insurance companyâs website urges them to beeline it to the ER</a> or call 911 if they think theyâre experiencing on emergency. It then lists symptoms that the payer says would warrant urgent care (rather than emergency room care), like stomach pain, diarrhea, and abnormal vaginal bleeding â but Pollack noted that these same symptoms could also indicate a medical emergency.</p><p>The American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) shares Pollackâs <a class href="https://twitter.com/EmergencyDocs/status/1402350787083264002" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">concern that UnitedHealthcareâs policy could dissuade people from seeking emergency care</a>. âIn many instances, even physicians cannot know if a patientâs symptoms require emergency treatment without conducting a comprehensive medical examination,â ACEP wrote in a statement shared on Twitter. &quot;Reckless policies like this will leave millions fearful of seeking medical care just as we're getting hold of the pandemic,&quot; the organization tweeted alongside the statement. </p><p>Indeed, in response to UnitedHealthcareâs new policy, Dr. Megan Ranney, M.D., M.P.H., a physician at Brown Emergency Medicine, tweeted examples of seemingly innocuous symptoms that turned out to be emergencies upon further evaluation. âIâve taken care of people with âindigestionâ who had heart attacks,â she wrote. âPeople with âpink eyeâ who had vision-threatening infections. Ppl with a 'tension headache' who had brain bleed.â Itâs scary to imagine what wouldâve happened if these patients hadnât gone to the ER because they weren't sure if their symptoms amounted to an emergency â at least in the eyes of an insurance company.</p><div class="XeQ"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-tweetid="1402394624296206337"><a href="https://twitter.com/meganranney/status/1402394624296206337"></a></blockquote></div><p>ACEP also tweeted that <a class href="https://twitter.com/EmergencyDocs/status/1402407121694625796" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">they believe UnitedHealthcareâs policy is unlawful</a> because it violates the <a class href="https://www.emergencyphysicians.org/article/access/prudent-layperson-standard" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Prudent Layperson Standard</a>, which requires insurance companies to cover emergency care based on a patientâs symptoms, not their diagnosis. Lempner, however, told MedCity News that if a patient ends up getting treatment for a non-emergent issue (like pink eye) during an ED visit, the company will cover it based on the patient's benefit plan. </p><p>As MedCity News notes, this differs from <a class href="https://www.npr.org/2018/05/23/613649094/anthem-policy-discouraging-avoidable-emergency-room-visits-faces-criticism#:~:text=McNew%2FGetty%20Images-,The%20health%20insurance%20company%20Anthem%20has%20introduced%20a%20policy%20discouraging,%22avoidable%22%20emergency%20room%20visits.&amp;text=Under%20the%20health%20insurance%20company's,actually%20have%20an%20emergency%20condition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Anthemâs similar, highly-criticized policy</a>, which took effect in 2017. Under that policy, if an ED diagnosis falls under a list of non-emergent conditions, Anthem will evaluate the visit and may choose not to cover it. <a class href="https://www.healthleadersmedia.com/finance/doctors-sue-anthem-over-dangerous-er-coverage-policy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">ACEP and the Medical Association of Georgia sued Anthemâs Blue Cross Shield of Georgia</a> over the policy in 2018 and are currently in the midst of that battle.</p><p>The somewhat bright side, according to MedCity News: When challenged, Anthem overturned most of the 12,000 ED claims it denied â perhaps suggesting that UnitedHealthcareâs policy might not be as rigid, either. But none of this changes the fact that it forces patients into the cruel position of making a risky decision about their health  â and during a pandemic, no less. </p></div></div></article><aside

It then lists symptoms that the payer says would warrant urgent care (rather than emergency room care), like stomach pain, diarrhea, and abnormal vaginal bleeding â but Pollack noted that these same symptoms could also indicate a medical emergency."]]],[1,"p",[[0,[],0,"The American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) shares Pollackâs "],[0,[3],1,"concern that UnitedHealthcareâs policy could dissuade people from seeking emergency care"],[0,[],0,". âIn many instances, even physicians cannot know if a patientâs symptoms require emergency treatment without conducting a comprehensive medical examination,â ACEP wrote in a statement shared on Twitter. \"Reckless policies like this will leave millions fearful of seeking medical care just as we're getting hold of the pandemic,\" the organization tweeted alongside the statement. "]]],[1,"p",[[0,[],0,"Indeed, in response to UnitedHealthcareâs new policy, Dr. Megan Ranney, M.D., M.P.H., a physician at Brown Emergency Medicine, tweeted examples of seemingly innocuous symptoms that turned out to be emergencies upon further evaluation. âIâve taken care of people with âindigestionâ who had heart attacks,â she wrote. âPeople with âpink eyeâ who had vision-threatening infections. Ppl with a 'tension headache' who had brain bleed.â Itâs scary to imagine what wouldâve happened if these patients hadnât gone to the ER because they weren't sure if their symptoms amounted to an emergency â at least in the eyes of an insurance company."]]],[10,0],[1,"p",[[0,[],0,"ACEP also tweeted that "],[0,[4],1,"they believe UnitedHealthcareâs policy is unlawful"],[0,[],0," because it violates the "],[0,[5],1,"Prudent Layperson Standard"],[0,[],0,", which requires insurance companies to cover emergency care based on a patientâs symptoms, not their diagnosis. Lempner, however, told MedCity News that if a patient ends up getting treatment for a non-emergent issue (like pink eye) during an ED visit, the company will cover it based on the patient's benefit plan. "]]],[1,"p",[[0,[],0,"As MedCity News notes, this differs from "],[0,[6],1,"Anthemâs similar, highly-criticized policy"],[0,[],0,", which took effect in 2017.

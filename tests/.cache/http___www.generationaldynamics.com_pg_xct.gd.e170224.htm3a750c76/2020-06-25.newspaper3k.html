<p>
Kim Jong-nam, the half-brother of North Korea's dictator Kim Jong-un,
died last week in Kuala Lumpur airport in Malaysia.  Malaysian
investigators have determined that two women used a handkerchief to
apply poison to Jong-nam in the middle of the airport, and he died
several minutes later from the poison on the way to the hospital.  The
two women are in custody.
</p><p>
Malaysia's police have identified either North Koreans in connection
with the assassination, two of whom are in custody, while two others
have fled the country.
</p><p>
Two other North Koreans wanted for questioning are hiding out in the
North Korean embassy.  One is a senior diplomat, Hyon Kwang Song.  The
other works for the state-owned Air Koryo airline.  Malaysia has asked
North Korean officials to make both of them available for questioning,
a request that has not been granted and may never be granted.

</p><h3>North Korea blames the assassination of Kim Jong-nam on South Korea</h3>
<p>

North Korea's state-run news agency KCNA published its own version of
"a citizen of the DPRK [North Korea]" died.  The KCNA report does not
give his name (Kim Jong-nam), and does not say that he's related to
the president.  Here are some excerpts from the KCNA report:
</p><p>
    </p><blockquote>"Pyongyang: A citizen of the DPRK bearing a diplomatic
    passport suddenly fell into a state of shock before boarding an
    airliner and died on the way to a hospital in Malaysia on February
    13.
<p>
    At that time the Foreign Ministry of Malaysia and the hospital
    side informed the DPRK embassy in Kuala Lumpur exercising the
    right to consular protection of DPRK citizens that they confirmed
    he died of heart stroke and decided to transfer his body to the
    embassy and get it cremated.
</p><p>
    So the DPRK embassy confirmed his identity and asked the Malaysian
    side to transfer his body.
</p><p>
    However, no sooner had south Korean conservative media published a
    false report that he was &#147;poisoned to death&#148;, citing it as &#147;source
    from the government&#148; that night, then the Malaysian secret police
    got involved in the case and recklessly made it an established
    fact, only to make matters complicated.
</p><p>
    The DPRK embassy made it clear that autopsy is not necessary as
    his death had already been confirmed as the one due to heart
    stroke and autopsy should never be done as he enjoyed
    extraterritorial right according to the Vienna Convention as a
    carrier of diplomatic passport.
</p><p>
    Nevertheless, the Malaysian side, in disregard of the DPRK&#146;s just
    demand and international law, made an autopsy of the body without
    any prior agreement with the DPRK side and its presence. Moreover,
    the Malaysian side clamored for the second autopsy without
    publishing the results of the first autopsy."</p></blockquote>
<p>
The KCNA goes on to say that the whole thing was a plot of the South
Korean government:
</p><p>
    </p><blockquote>"What merits more serious attention is the fact that
    the unjust acts of the Malaysian side are timed to coincide with
    the anti-DPRK conspiratorial racket launched by the south Korean
    authorities. ...
<p>
    On February 14, a day after his death, Chongwadae of south Korea
    kicked up a fuss over it and the south Korean authorities were
    busy holding a ministerial meeting on February 16, showing an
    excessive response. Moreover, they openly discussed the issue of
    THAAD deployment though it has nothing to do with the death of a
    DPRK citizen.
</p><p>
    This proves that the south Korean authorities has long expected
    the case since it worked out a scenario for it."</p></blockquote>
<p>
So, if I understand the KCNA report, it's accusing South Korea of
having planned the entire scenario for this "citizen's" death via
"heart stroke."
</p><p>
The report concludes, "The DPRK will never allow any attempt to
tarnish the image of the dignified power of independence and nuclear
weapons state but make a thorough probe into the truth behind the
case."  <a href="http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2017/02/23/how-the-north-korean-media-report-the-jong-nam-saga/">Free Malaysia Today / KCNA (Pyongyang)</a>

</p><h3>Relations between Malaysia and North Korea become vitriolic</h3>
<p>
It appears that Malaysia and North Korea have had close relationships
in the past.  Citizens of Malaysia are able to travel to North Korea
and visit without a visa.  However, relations have been on a downward
trajectory for some time, particularly as North Korea has been testing
nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, in violation of UN Security
Council resolutions.
</p><p>
A major turning point in relations occurred in March 2016, with the
unanimous adoption by the Security Council of resolution, which
imposed stringent international sanctions on North Korea following a
nuclear hydrogen bomb test.  Malaysia seriously implemented the
sanctions requirements, as did many other nations, serious souring
relations between the two countries.
</p><p>
The assassination of Kim Jong-nam has added a new level of vitriol.
North Korea's Ambassador Kang Chol demanded that Malaysia immediately
turn the body to the North Korean embassy without conducting an
autopsy.  When Malaysia refused, Kang denied that Jong-nam is related
to Kim Jong-un, and said Malaysia is "colluding with hostile forces,"
referring to South Korea.
</p><p>
Kang's accusations are a major insult to Malaysia.  Malaysia recalled
its ambassador to North Korea "for consultation," and foreign minister
Anifah Aman said Kang's allegations "are culled from delusions, lies
and half-truths."
</p><p>
Malaysian officials are refusing to release the body except in
accordance with international law and Malaysian law.  This means fully
investigating "the cause of death together with its motive as it
happened in our country."
</p><p>
The investigation is turning into a Shakespearean drama, with royal
family members bumping each other off.  Malaysian officials are
demanding that a family member of the dead man come to Malaysia to
identify the body and to undergo a DNA test, in order to that it's
really Kim Jong-nam.  Malaysian media are saying that some family
member is expected to arrive on Saturday.  Speculation is that it will
be his son Kim Han-sol, though police are denying that report.

</p><h3>BBC reporter Mike Embley is completely full of crap</h3>
<p>
As I'm writing this, I just heard BBC reporter Mike Embley state as a
fact that Steve Bannon "is a white supremacist, anti-Semitic, and ran
a news web site specializing in fake news."
</p><p>
I've worked with Steve Bannon, and I've been cross-posting on
Breitbart since 2010, and none of this is even remotely true.
</p><p>
Mike Embley, if you're reading this: You're completely full of crap.
It's hard for me to believe that anyone as stupid as you is on the
air.
</p><p>
In 2005, the BBC suffered huge budget cuts after the Hutton Report
found that they purposely lied all the time.  The BBC calling anyone
else "fake news" is laughable.

Malaysia continues investigation of Kim Jong-nam's death, despite N. Korea objections

Kim Jong-nam, the half-brother of North Korea's dictator Kim Jong-un, died last week in Kuala Lumpur airport in Malaysia. Malaysian investigators have determined that two women used a handkerchief to apply poison to Jong-nam in the middle of the airport, and he died several minutes later from the poison on the way to the hospital. The two women are in custody.

Malaysia's police have identified either North Koreans in connection with the assassination, two of whom are in custody, while two others have fled the country.

Two other North Koreans wanted for questioning are hiding out in the North Korean embassy. One is a senior diplomat, Hyon Kwang Song. The other works for the state-owned Air Koryo airline. Malaysia has asked North Korean officials to make both of them available for questioning, a request that has not been granted and may never be granted. Straits Times (Singapore) and NBC News

North Korea blames the assassination of Kim Jong-nam on South Korea

North Korea's state-run news agency KCNA published its own version of "a citizen of the DPRK [North Korea]" died. The KCNA report does not give his name (Kim Jong-nam), and does not say that he's related to the president. Here are some excerpts from the KCNA report:

"Pyongyang: A citizen of the DPRK bearing a diplomatic passport suddenly fell into a state of shock before boarding an airliner and died on the way to a hospital in Malaysia on February 13. At that time the Foreign Ministry of Malaysia and the hospital side informed the DPRK embassy in Kuala Lumpur exercising the right to consular protection of DPRK citizens that they confirmed he died of heart stroke and decided to transfer his body to the embassy and get it cremated. So the DPRK embassy confirmed his identity and asked the Malaysian side to transfer his body. However, no sooner had south Korean conservative media published a false report that he was poisoned to death, citing it as source from the government that night, then the Malaysian secret police got involved in the case and recklessly made it an established fact, only to make matters complicated. The DPRK embassy made it clear that autopsy is not necessary as his death had already been confirmed as the one due to heart stroke and autopsy should never be done as he enjoyed extraterritorial right according to the Vienna Convention as a carrier of diplomatic passport. Nevertheless, the Malaysian side, in disregard of the DPRKs just demand and international law, made an autopsy of the body without any prior agreement with the DPRK side and its presence. Moreover, the Malaysian side clamored for the second autopsy without publishing the results of the first autopsy."

The KCNA goes on to say that the whole thing was a plot of the South Korean government:

"What merits more serious attention is the fact that the unjust acts of the Malaysian side are timed to coincide with the anti-DPRK conspiratorial racket launched by the south Korean authorities. ... On February 14, a day after his death, Chongwadae of south Korea kicked up a fuss over it and the south Korean authorities were busy holding a ministerial meeting on February 16, showing an excessive response. Moreover, they openly discussed the issue of THAAD deployment though it has nothing to do with the death of a DPRK citizen. This proves that the south Korean authorities has long expected the case since it worked out a scenario for it."

So, if I understand the KCNA report, it's accusing South Korea of having planned the entire scenario for this "citizen's" death via "heart stroke."

The report concludes, "The DPRK will never allow any attempt to tarnish the image of the dignified power of independence and nuclear weapons state but make a thorough probe into the truth behind the case." Free Malaysia Today / KCNA (Pyongyang)

Relations between Malaysia and North Korea become vitriolic

It appears that Malaysia and North Korea have had close relationships in the past. Citizens of Malaysia are able to travel to North Korea and visit without a visa. However, relations have been on a downward trajectory for some time, particularly as North Korea has been testing nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, in violation of UN Security Council resolutions.

A major turning point in relations occurred in March 2016, with the unanimous adoption by the Security Council of resolution, which imposed stringent international sanctions on North Korea following a nuclear hydrogen bomb test. Malaysia seriously implemented the sanctions requirements, as did many other nations, serious souring relations between the two countries.

The assassination of Kim Jong-nam has added a new level of vitriol. North Korea's Ambassador Kang Chol demanded that Malaysia immediately turn the body to the North Korean embassy without conducting an autopsy. When Malaysia refused, Kang denied that Jong-nam is related to Kim Jong-un, and said Malaysia is "colluding with hostile forces," referring to South Korea.

Kang's accusations are a major insult to Malaysia. Malaysia recalled its ambassador to North Korea "for consultation," and foreign minister Anifah Aman said Kang's allegations "are culled from delusions, lies and half-truths."

Malaysian officials are refusing to release the body except in accordance with international law and Malaysian law. This means fully investigating "the cause of death together with its motive as it happened in our country."

The investigation is turning into a Shakespearean drama, with royal family members bumping each other off. Malaysian officials are demanding that a family member of the dead man come to Malaysia to identify the body and to undergo a DNA test, in order to that it's really Kim Jong-nam. Malaysian media are saying that some family member is expected to arrive on Saturday. Speculation is that it will be his son Kim Han-sol, though police are denying that report.

BBC reporter Mike Embley is completely full of crap

As I'm writing this, I just heard BBC reporter Mike Embley state as a fact that Steve Bannon "is a white supremacist, anti-Semitic, and ran a news web site specializing in fake news."

I've worked with Steve Bannon, and I've been cross-posting on Breitbart since 2010, and none of this is even remotely true.

Mike Embley, if you're reading this: You're completely full of crap. It's hard for me to believe that anyone as stupid as you is on the air.

In 2005, the BBC suffered huge budget cuts after the Hutton Report found that they purposely lied all the time. The BBC calling anyone else "fake news" is laughable.

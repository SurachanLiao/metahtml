    <p>Katsuhiko Kawasoe, the president of Mitsubishi, resigned yesterday over the cover-up of customer complaints at the company, a practice that stretches back 30 years and has led to the recall of more than 600,000 cars. Japanese authorities said they would press criminal charges against Mitsubishi.</p>

    <p>Mr Kawasoe will be replaced by Takashi Sonobe, 59, Mitsubishi's head of international operations, who is considered to be highly westernised.</p>

    <p>But DaimlerChrysler said it was installing Rolf Eckrodt, who currently runs its railway subsidiary, Adtranz, as Mitsubishi's chief operating officer. DaimlerChrysler will also increase its board-level presence at Mitsubishi, from the three members originally envisaged, to four out of 11 board directors.</p>
    

            
              
              
                
                  











  
  
  
  






                
              
            

            
            
          
            
    <p>The German company also revised down the price at which it is taking a 34 per cent stake in Mitsubishi, a move announced in March that will give it a greater presence in the smaller car market and in Asia's emerging economies. The price for the issue of new shares has now dropped from $2.1bn (&#163;1.5bn) to $1.9bn, and a "standstill agreement" has been reduced from 10 years to three, after which it can increase the stake. The revised deal is expected to be closed next month.</p>

    <p>Andrew Blair-Smith, an analyst at Commerzbank, said: "DaimlerChrysler gets effective control through this. It can now clean Mitsubishi up, before increasing its holding."</p>
    

            
              
              
                
                  











  
  
  
  






                
              
            

            
            
          
            
    <p>DaimlerChrysler is thought to be reluctant to take its stake above 40 per cent at the moment because it would have to consolidate Mitsubishi's near &#163;10bn of debt on to its balance sheet.</p>
    

            
              
              
            

            
            
          
            
    <p>Mr Eckrodt, 58, has worked at Daimler-Benz since 1966, and is credited with a turnaround at Adtranz, which he has led for two years. The railway unit has been brought out of the red, through 3,000 job cuts and 6 factory closures. Adtranz is being sold to Bombardier, the Canadian transport engineering group.</p>
    

            
              
              
            

            
            
          
            
    <p>Japan's car makers have suffered from the recession in their home market, coupled with export difficulties caused by a strong yen. Only Toyota and Honda now remain independent, withRenault having taken a 37 per cent stake in Nissan and Ford holding 33 per cent of Mazda.</p>

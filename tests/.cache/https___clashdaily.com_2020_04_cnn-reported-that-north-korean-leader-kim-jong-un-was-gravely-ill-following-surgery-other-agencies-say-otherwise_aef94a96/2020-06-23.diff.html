He had been seen four days before that at a government meeting.</p> <p>Another US official told CNN Monday that the concerns about Kim’s health are credible but the severity is hard to assess…</p> <p>…”There have been a number of recent rumors about Kim’s health (smoking, heart, and brain). If Kim is hospitalized, it would explain why he wasn’t present on the important April 15th celebrations,” said Bruce Klingner, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation and former CIA deputy division chief for North Korea. “But, over the years, there have been a number of false health rumors about Kim Jong-un or his father. We’ll have to wait and see.”

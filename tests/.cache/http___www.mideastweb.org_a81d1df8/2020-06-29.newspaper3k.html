MidEastWeb - Hope for the Middle East</h2>

<span><p align="left">
The Middle East is not all bombs, violence and fanaticism. Wonderful people live here, people with dreams and hopes 
about democracy and peace and decency. The Middle East was once the birthplace of the world's great ideas. 
It was the cradle of civilization and the birthplace of the three monotheistic religions. "Greek" science was born in 
Asia minor. After the decline of the ancient world, civilization and intellectual curiosity were revived and maintained 
by the Arab civilization, born once again in the Middle East. </p>
<p align="left">
Those achievements, and not wars and conquest, are the real enduring legacy of the Middle East, that we must revive and 
pass on to our children.
The Middle East is our home. It is time for our home to become ours, not the playground of alien, evil and dogmatic 
ideologies, cynical dictators and religious fanatics. We will not have a bright future in the Middle East until we stop 
letting extremists manipulate us.&#160; A brighter future for the Middle East is up to us.&#160;
<a href="goals.htm">Can we build a better future for the Middle East?</a></p>

An outbreak of respiratory illness (COVID-19 Disease) caused by a novel (new) coronavirus (named 'SARS-CoV-2') was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. To date, thousands of 'SARS-CoV-2' (Coronavirus) infections have been reported in China and in a growing number of international locations. Most of the 'SARS-CoV-2' (Coronavirus) infections have been associated with travel from Wuhan and appear to be spreading from person-to-person with close contact.



The virus, from the same family as SARS and MERS viruses, causes respiratory illness with infections ranging from mild to severe illness, and in some cases, death. Initial data suggests that this virus may have emerged from an animal reservoir.

Method Of Transmission

The SARS-CoV-2 (Coronavirus) is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person, by either close contact with one another (within c.a. 1 meter / 3 feet) or through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Transmission may also be possible from touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching one's mouth, nose or eyes.

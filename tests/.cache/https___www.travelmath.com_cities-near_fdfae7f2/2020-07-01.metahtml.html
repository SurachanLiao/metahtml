<h3 class="home2">Cities near other towns</h3>
<p class="home2">Travelmath helps you find major and local cities near locations like
airports, landmarks, zip codes, and other cities. You can use
this tool to explore the area around your home town, especially
if you're doing a road trip and you want to find new cities to
visit. Use the form to search for cities near any location you
enter. Or change the dropdown menu if you want to measure the
driving distance or drive time between cities.</p>

<p class="home2">You may prefer to browse <a href="/cities-in/">major cities</a> in any
state or country in the world if you're researching a trip.
Or search for a <a href="/cities/">city map</a> 
based on the latitude and longitude coordinates.
If you want to explore destinations within a
particular distance or travel time, look for <a href="https://withinhours.com/">cities
within a radius</a>.</p>

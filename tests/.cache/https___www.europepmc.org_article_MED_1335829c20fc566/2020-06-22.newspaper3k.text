Although both equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1) and equine herpesvirus type 4 (EHV-4) can be associated with respiratory disease, epizootics caused by EHV-1 are much more serious because the virus can cause abortions and paralysis. It is, therefore, important to identify the type of EHV involved in an outbreak by a test that is quick, sensitive, and reliable. We have adapted the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect and distinguish between EHV-1 and EHV-4 in the same reaction. Primers for PCR were designed from the sequences of the glycoprotein B genes of EHV-1 and EHV-4. The PCR products derived from EHV-1 and EHV-4 were 135 and 326 base pairs, respectively, and could be readily separated by electrophoresis. The identity of the PCR products was confirmed by determining their nucleotide sequence, which agreed with the published sequence of the gB genes. The test could be performed directly on virus pelleted from small volumes (300 microL) of medium in which nasal swabs were transported and did not rely on the presence of infectious virus. The PCR was unaffected by conditions that reduced the infectivity of a virus preparation by 99%. The PCR detected EHV-4 in 5 of 10 nasal mucous samples taken from an outbreak of respiratory disease in race horses. Virus isolation in indicator cells was successful in detecting virus in four of the five samples positive by PCR.

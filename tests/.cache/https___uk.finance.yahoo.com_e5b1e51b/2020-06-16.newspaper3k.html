"The corona epidemic and the global measures taken to fight it has led to a market situation impacting our industry severely," Volvo CEO Martin Lundstedt said in a statement.  Volvo said around 15% of the expected reductions were consultants, adding that about 1,250 positions were expected to be cut in Sweden.</p></div>

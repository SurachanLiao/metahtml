Officially announcing the long-rumoured feature on Monday, the company said CarKey works by pairing an iPhone or Apple Watch with a car that supports the software. For extra security a user can then be asked to confirm their identity with Face ID or Touch ID, or this can be disabled. The feature also allows iPhone owners to share their car key with someone else using iMessage, Apple's native text messaging system. At Apple's Wordwide Developers' Conference, which was held remotely this year due to the Covid-19 pandemic, Apple's head of software engineering Craig Federighi said the company was "transforming your relationship with your car by rethinking car keys". The feature does not require a separate app and will also let you keep multiple keys in one place. It will appear in the current operating system, iOS 13, but currently only works with the newest BMW 5 Series car, which comes out next month. Apple said other cars would be included next year. Electric car company Tesla already allows owners to unlock their cars using a mobile phone, and other car manufacturers including Lincoln and Hyundai have also developed apps which work as car keys.</del></p></div>

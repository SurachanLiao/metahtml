<p>A North Korean refugee whose two younger brothers died of starvation says children and babies are &#8220;dying without hope&#8221; under Kim Jong Un&#8217;s regime.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Grace Jo, 26, who now studies at Montgomery College in Rockville, Maryland, told&#160;<a href="http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/10/18/from-terrors-north-korea-to-us-college-student-one-womans-amazing-journey.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fox News</a>&#160;in an interview on Wednesday that the world must stop the North Korean regime and its killing of innocent people, but added that she doesn&#8217;t want to see a military intervention.</p>
<p>&#8220;Child, babies and moms are dying without any hope,&#8221; Jo said.</p>
<p>The refugee said that she and her family escaped three times to China, but were captured and sent back to North Korea.</p>
<p>Starvation led to the deaths of her two younger brothers, and her father was tortured by police for smuggling a bag of rice from China.</p>
<p>On one occasion Jo&#8217;s family had to survive 10 days without food before finding six baby mice in a field, which the grandmother used to make soup.</p>
<p>&#8220;We almost gave up our life, but it is kind of a miracle, a miracle happened to my family to survive,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Jo, who is now a U.S. citizen, explained that after one escape she was caught and sent to intelligence center prison.</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw the North Korean agents torturing adults there and yelling them, it was kind of a scary place. It was dark and had no lights, small room with many people at the night so many insects walking on the wall and a dark hole with a fence around, so it was really scary,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Jo called for action against the North Korean regime, which has threatened to attack the U.S. on multiple occasions, but said she didn&#8217;t support targeted bombing to dismantle the regime, as she fears such a strike would also kill many innocent people.</p>
<p>Grace has received the North Korean Freedom Scholarship program, which is run by the President George W. Bush Institute. The $25,000 fund was established to help North Korean escapees &#8220;pursue higher education and build productive, prosperous lives as new Americans.&#8221;</p>
<p>Others, such as Korean-American missionary Robert Park, who once was held and tortured by North Korea, also&#160;<a href="http://www.christianpost.com/news/tortured-missionary-begs-trump-not-to-go-to-war-and-risk-lives-of-hidden-christians-in-north-korea-203142/">recently warned</a>&#160;that a military option could kill many of the hidden Christians there.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please kindly be reminded that a large number of underground Christians are within North Korea. They are the most persecuted religious group in the world, according to international religious freedom watchdogs groups. As I pray your team accepts upon deep reflection, it would be decidedly un-Christian to countenance indiscriminate killings of those who are among the people in the world who suffer the most,&#8221; Park wrote in an open letter to President Donald Trump earlier this month.</p>

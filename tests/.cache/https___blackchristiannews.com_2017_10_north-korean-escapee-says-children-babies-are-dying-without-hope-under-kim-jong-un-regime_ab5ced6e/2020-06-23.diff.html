It was dark and had no lights, small room with many people at the night so many insects walking on the wall and a dark hole with a fence around, so it was really scary,” she said.</p><p>Jo called for action against the North Korean regime, which has threatened to attack the U.S. on multiple occasions, but said she didn’t support targeted bombing to dismantle the regime, as she fears such a strike would also kill many innocent people.</p><p>Grace has received the North Korean Freedom Scholarship program, which is run by the President George W. Bush Institute. The $25,000 fund was established to help North Korean escapees “pursue higher education and build productive, prosperous lives as new Americans.”</p><p>Others, such as Korean-American missionary Robert Park, who once was held and tortured by North Korea, also <a href="http://www.christianpost.com/news/tortured-missionary-begs-trump-not-to-go-to-war-and-risk-lives-of-hidden-christians-in-north-korea-203142/">recently warned</a>that a military option could kill many of the hidden Christians there.</p><p>“Please kindly be reminded that a large number of underground Christians are within North Korea. They are the most persecuted religious group in the world, according to international religious freedom watchdogs groups. As I pray your team accepts upon deep reflection, it would be decidedly un-Christian to countenance indiscriminate killings of those who are among the people in the world who suffer the most,” Park wrote in an open letter to President Donald Trump earlier this month.</p><p>Click <a href="http://www.christianpost.com/news/north-korean-escapee-children-babies-dying-without-hope-eating-mice-to-survive-203587/">here</a> to read more.</p></article> <p><del>SOURCE: Christian Post, by <a class="reporter" href="http://www.christianpost.com/author/stoyan-zaimov/">Stoyan Zaimov Link: http://www.christianpost.com/author/stoyan-zaimov/ </a></del></p>

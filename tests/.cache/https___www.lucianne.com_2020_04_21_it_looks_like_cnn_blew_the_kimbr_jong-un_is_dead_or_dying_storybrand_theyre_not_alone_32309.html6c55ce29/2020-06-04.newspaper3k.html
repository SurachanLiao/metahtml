        President Donald Trump on Tuesday questioned a CNN report that Kim Jong-un&#8217;s health is reportedly in &#8220;grave danger&#8221; following a surgery.

&#8220;With CNN, they come out with a report &#8212; I don&#8217;t put too much credence in it,&#8221; Trump said.Trump did not confirm or deny the report but said that he does not know if the reports are true.

The president expressed concerns for Kim&#8217;s health after meeting him on three different occasions to negotiate a peace deal with North Korea.

&#8220;I wish him well,&#8221; Trump said. &#8220;If he is in the kind of condition that the reports say, that the news is saying, that&#8217;s a very serious condition.&#8221;

        Well, it finally happened. North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un reportedly had heart surgery and suffered a severe complication that left him in a dire medical situation. He could also be dead. That&#8217;s what CNN and NBC News&#8217; Katy Tur peddled out respectively. Granted, this is a closed society, so be cautious and after China totally botched a science experiment in one of their virology labs in Wuhan which led to the current COVID-19 pandemic&#8212;I&#8217;m not trusting their sources either. It led to some excellent memes and social media posts.

        The Trump administration released its guidelines Thursday for &#8220;Opening Up America Again&#8221; after the country&#8217;s economy plummeted and businesses closed their doors amid the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak. The plan includes three phases, with instructions for both individuals and employers.

&#8220;Based on the latest data, our team of experts agree that we can begin the next front in our war which we are calling &#8216;Opening Up America Again,&#8217; and that&#8217;s what we are doing. We&#8217;re opening up our country,&#8221; said President Donald Trump at Thursday&#8217;s White House press briefing.

        One of the weirdest things about the modern left isn&#8217;t how much the activist class despises people who succeed, it&#8217;s how many of those activists actually come from money themselves. Not that they want you to know it, they pretend it isn&#8217;t true while enjoying the freedoms that come from their family&#8217;s accomplishments.

The latest example of this comes from the New York Post, which exposed a guy named Carlos Maza as a hypocrite on Saturday.

Maza, who goes by the name &#8220;gay wonk,&#8221; is known for whining about people who&#8217;ve earned a lot of money and trying to &#8220;cancel&#8221; conservatives for making fun of him.

        You&#8217;ve noticed it right?

The Democratic leadership of 2020 will not tell you the truth about almost anything. They lie to everyone, at nearly every moment, about almost everything, all the time. 

They lie to their opponents, to the voters, and of course, they lie to each other. 

For instance, after clearly naming two associate Supreme Court justices, and pledging that they &#8220;would not know what hit&#8221; them, the highest-ranking Senate democrat claimed he never said what he in fact said.

From the same event, a congresswoman with a straight face, said to reporters that &#8220;abortions are safer than the extraction

        An international prosecutor, Fatou Bensuda, was advised Thursday by a panel at Hague that she should go ahead and investigate alleged war crimes committed by Americans in Afghanistan. It&#8217;s a shocking development. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called the International Criminal Court panel&#8217;s ruling &#8220;a truly breathtaking action by an unaccountable political institution masquerading as a legal body.&#8221; It is, but what to do?

        What should be done about Senator Schumer&#8217;s threats to two members of the United States Supreme Court? Everyone agrees that the senator&#8217;s words were shocking. Mr. Schumer, while addressing an abortion rights rally in front of the Court, issued threats against two justices over a case on abortion. &#8220;I want to tell you, Gorsuch, I want to tell you, Kavanaugh, you have released the whirlwind, and you will pay the price,&#8221; Mr. Schumer boomed.

The Baltimore Sun, in an editorial today, reckons that Mr. Schumer was merely echoing Justice Kavanaugh&#8217;s expression, during his confirmation hearing, of fear of the whirlwind the Democrats had sewed.

        Mayor Bloomberg's decision to quit the presidential race ignited in us the urge to send him a check for $550 million. We barely know him, but we're partly to blame for the fiasco, in that we issued more editorials than any other paper encouraging him to throw his hat into the ring. Imagine, then, our chagrin when we discovered we couldn't quite cover the 550 million sponduluks. So we'll have to make do with simple sentiments.

        There&#8217;s too much power vested in nine people in black robes. It only takes five justices, though, to make decisions that impact generations. And they&#8217;ve been Supremely wrong, repeatedly. In Dred Scott vs. Sanford, the Supreme Court ruled that slaves were not citizens and, therefore, not afforded constitutional rights. The Civil Rights Act of 1875, both written and passed solely by Republicans, was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. In Plessy v. Ferguson, despite the Reconstruction Amendments (13th, 14th and 15th), an arrogant Supreme Court affirmed codified racial discrimination in what should be called Separate and Unequal. I

        South Carolina mom Debra Harrell worked at McDonald's. She couldn't afford day care for Regina, her 9-year-old daughter, so she took her to work.

But Regina was bored at McDonald's.

One day, she asked if she could just play in the neighborhood park instead. "I felt safe there," tells me in my new video, "because I was with my friends and their parents."

"She had her cellphone, a pocketbook with money in it," says Debra. "She had everything she needed."

Regina was happy. Debra was happy.

But one parent asked Regina where her mom was, and then called the police. Officers went to McDonald's and arrested Debra.

In jail, they berated her.

        In a hypersexualized world, where reality dating shows revolve around sex appeal and dating drama, Netflix&#8217;s new show, Love is Blind, has refreshingly changed the focus of relationships to the importance of emotional connection before physical. In doing so, an uncomfortable truth was shown: men are using abortion as a means to escape responsibility, and abortion is hurting women in the process.

Tearfully, one of the contestants named Amber shared her personal experience with abortion.

North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un reportedly had heart surgery and suffered a severe complication that left him in a dire medical situation. He could also be dead. That’s what CNN and NBC News’ Katy Tur peddled out respectively. Granted, this is a closed society, so be cautious and after China totally botched a science experiment in one of their virology labs in Wuhan which led to the current COVID-19 pandemic—I’m not trusting their sources either. It led to some excellent memes and social media posts.

“With CNN, they come out with a report — I don’t put too much credence in it,” Trump said.Trump did not confirm or deny the report but said that he does not know if the reports are true.

The president expressed concerns for Kim’s health after meeting him on three different occasions to negotiate a peace deal with North Korea.

“I wish him well,” Trump said. “If he is in the kind of condition that the reports say, that the news is saying, that’s a very serious condition.”

North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un reportedly had heart surgery and suffered a severe complication that left him in a dire medical situation. He could also be dead. That’s what CNN and NBC News’ Katy Tur peddled out respectively. Granted, this is a closed society, so be cautious and after China totally botched a science experiment in one of their virology labs in Wuhan which led to the current COVID-19 pandemic—I’m not trusting their sources either. It led to some excellent memes and social media posts.

The plan includes three phases, with instructions for both individuals and employers.

“Based on the latest data, our team of experts agree that we can begin the next front in our war which we are calling ‘Opening Up America Again,’ and that’s what we are doing. We’re opening up our country,” said President Donald Trump at Thursday’s White House press briefing.

Not that they want you to know it, they pretend it isn’t true while enjoying the freedoms that come from their family’s accomplishments.

The latest example of this comes from the New York Post, which exposed a guy named Carlos Maza as a hypocrite on Saturday.

Maza, who goes by the name “gay wonk,” is known for whining about people who’ve earned a lot of money and trying to “cancel” conservatives for making fun of him.

The Democratic leadership of 2020 will not tell you the truth about almost anything. They lie to everyone, at nearly every moment, about almost everything, all the time. 

They lie to their opponents, to the voters, and of course, they lie to each other. 

For instance, after clearly naming two associate Supreme Court justices, and pledging that they “would not know what hit” them, the highest-ranking Senate democrat claimed he never said what he in fact said.

From the same event, a congresswoman with a straight face, said to reporters that “abortions are safer than the extraction

Everyone agrees that the senator’s words were shocking. Mr. Schumer, while addressing an abortion rights rally in front of the Court, issued threats against two justices over a case on abortion. “I want to tell you, Gorsuch, I want to tell you, Kavanaugh, you have released the whirlwind, and you will pay the price,” Mr. Schumer boomed.

The Baltimore Sun, in an editorial today, reckons that Mr. Schumer was merely echoing Justice Kavanaugh’s expression, during his confirmation hearing, of fear of the whirlwind the Democrats had sewed.

Imagine, then, our chagrin when we discovered we couldn't quite cover the 550 million sponduluks. So we'll have to make do with simple sentiments.

But Regina was bored at McDonald's.

One day, she asked if she could just play in the neighborhood park instead. "I felt safe there," tells me in my new video, "because I was with my friends and their parents."

"She had her cellphone, a pocketbook with money in it," says Debra. "She had everything she needed."

Regina was happy. Debra was happy.

But one parent asked Regina where her mom was, and then called the police. Officers went to McDonald's and arrested Debra.

In jail, they berated her.

<a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/%7Erraham/khomeini_timeline.html">Timeline:
Ayatollah Khomeini</a><br style="font-family: Arial;">
</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Born in a small town to descendants
of Imam Mousa al-Kazim, Ruhollah
Khomeini grew up in a family with a long history of religious
scholarship. Khomeini's father died when he was only 5 months old, and
he lost his aunt and mother in 1918. After these losses, Khomeini's
eldest brother Seyed Mourteza, assumed control of the family.
Khomeini's first Islamic education came at a traditional religious
school, where he memorized the Koran. His brother sent him to
Sultanabad (now Arak) for further education in 1920-21. He ended up in
Qom by 1923, where he would complete his education.</span><br
 style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Khomeini did not participate actively
in politics during the 1930s. Still not a leader in the religious
institutions of Qom, he felt that he should follow the decisions of the
important Ayatollahs at the time. He did participate in the campaign
against the Baha'i sect in 1955 to an extent, but failed to win the
support of more powerful Islamic figures. He then devoted the next few
years of his life to teaching and gathering the men that together would
overthrow the Pahlavi Dynasty.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">After the death of Ayatollah
Boroujerdi in 1961, Khomeini began to shift his political and religious
emphases. He was seen as a possible successor to Boroujerdi's
leadership position within the Iranian Islamic clergy. Upon the
recognition of this position by most Iranian Shi'ites, Khomeini began
to assume more leadership responsibilities. In 1962, the Shah's
government promoted new election laws. Part of this new program
abolished the requirement that public officials be sworn in on the
Koran. Khomeini telegraphed the Shah and the prime minister and
threatened a sustained protest from the ulama (religious scholars) if
they did not stop violating both Islamic law and the 1907 constitution.<br>
<br>
When the Shah announced his plans for the White Revolution reforms in
early 1963, Khomeini gathered his colleagues in Qom to discuss their
opposition. Under pressure from Khomeini, the senior ulama decreed a
boycott of the Shah's public referendum on his reform package. Khomeini
continued his fight against the Shah, delivering a speech in June 1963
that contained a thinly veiled threat to the Shah if he did not change
his path. This speech resulted in Khomeini's arrest, the news of which
sparked massive demonstrations in many of Iran's major cities.<br>
<br>
Khomeini was released from prison in 1964. However, soon after his
return to Qom, the Shah's regime announced that American personnel and
relatives in Iran would be immune from prosecution. Khomeini gave
another speech that denounced the Shah and denied the legitimacy of the
government. Instead of arrest, the punishment from the Shah this time
was <a

Commandos surrounded Khomeini's house and took him to the airport,
where he was flown to Turkey. Because he was not allowed to wear his
Muslim scholar's cloak and turban, Khomeini departed Turkey for Najaf,
Iraq, where he spent 13 years.<br>
<br>
While he was in Najaf, Khomeini sent tape cassettes back to Tehran,
where they were sold in the <a

In this way, Khomeini was able to
become the leader of the opposition, even in exile. Demonstrations
supporting him and denouncing the Shah's government became more common
throughout the 1970s. Because of Khomeini's influence, the Shah
successfully asked Iraq to deport him. Troops again forced Khomeini out
of his home, and after he was refused entry to Kuwait at the border,
Khomeini went to Paris. At this point, journalists from around the
world were covering the Ayatollah, and his fame enabled him to spread
his message even more effectively.<br>
<br>
On January 16, 1979, Mohammad Reza Shah left Iran. Two weeks later,
Ayatollah Khomeini boarded an Air France charter plane to Tehran, where
he arrived on the morning of February 1. He was greeted with joy from
the crowds and the opponents of the Shah's regime. By Feburary 12,
following a decree from Khomeini to violate the curfew the Shah had
imposed, the regime collapsed. Khomeini's goal of overthrowing the Shah
had been accomplished. After the March referendum that resulted in the
proclamation of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Khomeini received the
title of Imam and became the Supreme Leader of Iran.<br>
<br>
Until his death in 1979, Khomeini established theocratic rule in Iran,
not even sparing the nationalist and Marxist groups that had assisted
his revolution. He consolidated power among Islamic clerics and
launched efforts to "Islamicize" the entire country. In the end,
Khomeini was able to establish the Islamic government he had envisioned
when he began his political activities against the Shah.<br>

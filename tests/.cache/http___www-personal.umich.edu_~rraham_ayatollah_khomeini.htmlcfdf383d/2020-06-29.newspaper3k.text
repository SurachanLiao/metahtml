Born: September 24, 1902, Khomein, Iran



Timeline: Ayatollah Khomeini

Died: June 3, 1989, Jamaran, Iran

Born in a small town to descendants of Imam Mousa al-Kazim, Ruhollah Khomeini grew up in a family with a long history of religious scholarship. Khomeini's father died when he was only 5 months old, and he lost his aunt and mother in 1918. After these losses, Khomeini's eldest brother Seyed Mourteza, assumed control of the family. Khomeini's first Islamic education came at a traditional religious school, where he memorized the Koran. His brother sent him to Sultanabad (now Arak) for further education in 1920-21. He ended up in Qom by 1923, where he would complete his education.

Khomeini did not participate actively in politics during the 1930s. Still not a leader in the religious institutions of Qom, he felt that he should follow the decisions of the important Ayatollahs at the time. He did participate in the campaign against the Baha'i sect in 1955 to an extent, but failed to win the support of more powerful Islamic figures. He then devoted the next few years of his life to teaching and gathering the men that together would overthrow the Pahlavi Dynasty.

Around 20 officers moved through large crowds of peaceful protesters sitting on the grass to seize a pair of demonstrators and escort them to nearby police vans. The BLM protest, which had been brought forward to today to avoid clashes with right wing activists, began at Hyde Park this afternoon at 2pm and is due to head to Parliament later today. Statues and war memorials in Westminster have been boarded up to prevent any vandalism or damage from protesters.

But in a worrying development, the Government today admitted that the virus's reproduction rate has now risen to above one in at least one part of the country. Official figures indicate the 'R' is between 0.8 and 1.0 across England (right) - slightly higher than for the UK as a whole, where it remains between 0.7 and 0.9. But the Government Office for Science estimates the R is between 0.8 and 1.1 in the  South West and it could have already passed the critical threshold of one.

Rabbi Alter Yaakov Schlesinger, in his 50s, was queuing outside a Nat West bank branch on Stoke Newington High Street, Hackney, before he was attacked. Witnesses say a man in his 40s, said to be of south Asian descent, ran off a bus and set upon the rabbi with a large knife just before 11am. The rabbi was stabbed multiple times, including in the head, before the alleged attacker was tackled by two workmen and a Deliveroo driver. He was pinned to the ground by the group-of-three, which including two Jewish builders, for seven minutes before police arrived. The alleged attacker was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. Though police said they were not treating the incident as terror-related, witnesses allege that the rabbi was the target of a hate crime.

In a stark warning, Mr Johnson said: 'We should not support a protest, which in all probability looking at what has happened before, is going to end in deliberate and calculated violence. He said a 'growing minority' of troublemakers had 'hijacked' the BLM protests 'as a pretext to attack the police, to cause violence and to cause damage to public property'. It came after he blasted 'absurd and shameful' attacks on the statue of Sir Winston Churchill and said the UK 'cannot lie about its history' as Sadiq Khan was accused of 'surrendering' the capital's streets 'to the mob' after he ordered the boarding up of the monument to Britain's greatest prime minister (top left) and the nearby Cenotaph (inset). This afternoon statues of Gandhi and Nelson Mandela are expected to be boarded up while Abraham Lincoln has been fenced off (bottom left).

Civic chiefs had previously agreed to take down the 5ft tall bronze statue in Poole Quay amid fears it would be targeted by Black Lives Matter supporters. But the proposal sparked an angry backlash from Scout leaders and members of the public who sought to protect it, including from two former Scouts, who camped overnight to ensure it wasn't touched by council workmen or protests. A petition to save the statue has also attracted more than 25,000 signatures. Last night bosses at Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council put 24-hour security in place to protect the statute. It came after Lord Powell's statue featured on a website called 'Topple The Racists', which includes a hit-list of 78 statues and monuments that 'celebrate slavery and racism'. The website claims Lord Baden-Powell had homophobic views and Nazi sympathies.

After being fished-out from Bristol Harbour, where it was thrown into by protesters on Sunday, museum workers began a clean-up job on the statue of the 17th century slave trader. But the team from M Shed, the museum which will now house the statue, which they say will not be cleaned of the graffiti sprayed on by protesters, discovered 'two surprising additions'. One was a bike tyre, which emerged with the statue as it was pulled from the harbour. The other item, however, was of a historical interest. Inside the coat tails of the statue, the team found a magazine from 1895 called 'Tit Bits' (pictured left) - a British weekly magazine founded by an early father of popular journalism George Newnes and which gave rise to modern newspapers such as the Daily Mail.

Mourners were seen gathering at Mr Harper's graveside (main) in breach of social distancing rules banning more than ten people at funerals. They had travelled around three miles from nearby Marsh Lane along the usually-busy A27, which had to be closed for 30 minutes by police because some members of the funeral cortege were walking in the road. A Highway Maintenance truck carried a giant photo as well as flower arrangements (bottom right), while some family members were seen standing up through the sun roof of a car as it formed part of the cortege. The cortege was led by a converted Rolls-Royce Phantom VII (inset and top right) which was once owned by Simon Cowell and was being used as the hearse. The car, which was once fitted out with a champagne bar, TV screens and sheepskin rugs, would ordinarily cost around £300,000 if bought new but its conversion into a hearse reportedly cost £500,000.

Ordinarily people would start at the tip or base of the carrot and move the peeler in the opposite direction, before bringing it back up to start again. The process can be slow and laborious, but Miss Dalton's approach would take the average home cook half the time to get the job done.

He tells viewers not to put a fresh back in with the bottom of the bag directly in the bin. Instead, he turns the bag upside down over the bargain bin and punches down the middle. It's unclear what, exactly, is different about the results of doing it this way, though Chris claims there is 'no air' in the bin. The video has already been watched over 700,000 times.

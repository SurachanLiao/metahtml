<div><p>The Khazarian mob is fighting for its life and stoking pandemic fear porn in a desperate attempt to keep its control grid over humanity, multiple sources say.&#160; This is happening because they cannot meet a payments deadline (temporarily extended into February) for the United States of America Corporation, the sources involved in the negotiations say.&#160; One of the aims of the negotiations is to restore sovereignty to the people and the Republic of the United States of America.&#160; This will also result in the unveiling of the secret space program, they add.</p>
<p>We will talk more about this later, but first, let us look at the cabal&#8217;s pandemic survival gambit.&#160; As most of our readers are probably already aware, it is highly unlikely the &#8220;Coronavirus&#8221; outbreak in China was a naturally occurring event.&#160; There are many signs this pandemic was planned in advance in an attempt to extort money from China for the U.S. Corporation.</p>
<p>First of all, there was a systematic attack on all Internet sites that provide news suppressed by the corporate propaganda media.&#160; For example, Natural News, with its long history of exposing vaccine-related scandals, was shut down.&#160; Jimstone Freelance was also hit harder than usual.&#160; Other journalists are being hit with bogus criminal charges.<br>

<p>This site too has come under severe attack.&#160; Our former webmaster suddenly lost his mind and displayed signs of severe PCP poisoning.&#160; Now he has &#8220;committed suicide.&#8221;&#160; Following this, we were locked out of our own site until white hats in the NSA helped restore it.&#160; We are also under serious financial attack.</p>
<p>These attacks came just before the coronavirus pandemic emerged and was given sensational fear-mongering and saturation coverage in the corporate media.&#160; In addition to being blackmail, this appears to be an attempt to reinsert fear and hate as the controlling narrative of our public discourse.</p>
<p>It looks like they had a rehearsal on October 18, 2019, when a huge exercise was held in the U.S. simulating a pandemic and the resulting economic collapse.&#160; The sponsors of this event were the World Economic Forum (Davos), the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and the Bloomberg School of Public Health at John Hopkins University.&#160; In other words, Cabal Central.&#160; Then just as the World Economic Forum was having its annual meeting in Davos on January 21-24, 2020, a real pandemic broke out and was given saturation publicity.<br>

<p>However, this plot, if it is one, is blowing up in their faces, because alternative news sites like Prepare for Change put out some of the massive evidence that exists showing that the U.S. Corporate government has been manufacturing and spreading bio-weapons ever since George Bush Jr. stole the election in 2000.&#160; Remember, these are the guys who said an ethnic-specific bio-weapon would be a &#8220;useful political tool.&#8221;<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_bioweapon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_bioweapon</a></p>
<p>Here, for example, is a U.S. government patent on coronaviruses:<br>

<p>British intelligence are reporting to us that they are hearing it is a &#8220;pneumonia virus which arose out of a poorly managed bio-site.&#8221;</p>
<p>The following statement was put out by the Asian secret societies, including the 55-million-member Hongmen and the Blue Dragon Society with their many millions of members:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;If this virus was artificial or released as part of an attack plot and is not a natural virus, then we, Hongmen, the largest secret society in Asia, together with the iron-bound secret Blue Society, vow that we will for sure hunt down the enemy, chase them to the ends of the earth, and make sure that not even a single one of their hairs remain on this planet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#12300;&#12418;&#12375;&#12289;&#12371;&#12398;&#12454;&#12451;&#12523;&#12473;&#12364;&#20154;&#28858;&#30340;&#12394;&#12414;&#12383;&#12399;&#35584;&#30053;&#30340;&#12394;&#12289;&#20405;&#30053;&#30340;&#12394;&#12418;&#12398;&#12391;&#12289;&#33258;&#28982;&#12395;&#30330;&#29983;&#12375;&#12383;&#12418;&#12398;&#12391;&#12399;&#12394;&#12356;&#22580;&#21512;&#12289;&#25105;&#12293;&#12450;&#12472;&#12450;&#26368;&#22823;&#27966;&#12398;&#31192;&#23494;&#32080;&#31038;&#27946;&#38272;&#23447;&#23478;&#12392;&#37444;&#12398;&#25503;&#31192;&#23494;&#32080;&#31038;&#38738;&#24135;&#12399;&#25973;&#12434;&#24517;&#12378;&#25506;&#12375;&#20986;&#12375;&#12289;&#22320;&#12398;&#26524;&#12390;&#12414;&#12391;&#36861;&#12356;&#12363;&#12369;&#35211;&#12388;&#12369;&#20986;&#12375;&#12289;&#27611;&#39658;&#12398;&#19968;&#26412;&#12391;&#12373;&#12360;&#22320;&#19978;&#12395;&#27531;&#12373;&#12394;&#12356;&#12371;&#12392;&#12434;&#35475;&#12358;&#12301;</p></blockquote>
<p>Now there is a huge campaign to spread the message that this was a naturally occurring virus or that it was spread by the Chinese.<br>
<a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/did-china-steal-coronavirus-canada-and-weaponize-it" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/did-china-steal-coronavirus-canada-and-weaponize-it</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/health/chinese-government-forces-tv-host-who-popularized-eating-bats-apologize" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.zerohedge.com/health/chinese-government-forces-tv-host-who-popularized-eating-bats-apologize</a></p>
<p>For sure, viruses do emerge naturally, especially in the Chinese countryside where ducks, pigs, and humans live in close proximity.&#160; Here is what the chief doctor of a large university hospital who specializes in animal-to-human disease transmission had to say about the outbreak:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the unfortunate result of those horrendous animal markets, with animals that would normally never be in such close proximity with other animals or with humans.&#160; It&#8217;s the perfect doomsday scenario for a new virus to emerge.&#160; We saw it with SARS, we&#8217;re seeing it now, and we&#8217;ll see other similar infections emerge again in the future.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many of the viruses that infect humans are of animal origin.&#160; What is different now is the size of our population and modern transportation which allows for much faster spread of new diseases.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The cabal had better hope she is right and the disease was natural.&#160; In any case, it&#8217;s clear that the Chinese are not telling us the whole truth about how far it has spread.&#160; The official Xinhua News Agency is saying the province of Hubei at the epicenter is reporting &#8220;1,052 cumulative confirmed cases of pneumonia, with 52 deaths and 129 cases in severe condition.&#8221;</p>
<p>If that&#8217;s true, then why is it that &#8220;More than half a million medical staff have joined the epidemic prevention, control, and treatment of patients in Hubei&#8221;?<br>
<a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-01/26/c_138735415.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-01/26/c_138735415.htm</a></p>
<p>Also, if there are only a few more than a thousand patients, why in Wuhan, a &#8220;mega-city that hosts a number of nationally renowned mega-hospitals,&#8221; are people &#8220;working around the clock to build two makeshift hospitals in suburban Wuhan&#8221;?<br>
<a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-01/26/c_138735285.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-01/26/c_138735285.htm</a></p>
<p>Just as this newsletter was about to go public, a high-level CIA-connected whistleblower contacted us to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;This is not a coronavirus.&#160; It is the Nipah virus.&#160; Caused by fruit bats.&#160; There are cycles of much more virulent strains of the Nipah virus.&#160; The WHO (with whom I do research) knew about this in August of 2018.&#160; It is zoonotic.</p>
<p>&#8220;China will soon go into a total lockdown.&#160; Hong Kong will be economically destroyed.&#160; This virus is going global.&#160; The pandemic is already here.&#160; The WHO is delaying calling it what it is because they are scared shitless.</p>
<p>&#8220;In my professional medical opinion, this is the real deal, my friend.&#160; The truth is being covered up as usual by the controlling global cabal.</p>
<p>&#8220;All of reality is a fabric that the controllers are losing control over.</p>
<p>&#8220;If China goes into a complete lockdown, this will be what pushes the global economic collapse into free fall.&#160; It is game over and a reset will take place.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Anybody with any real market experience will tell you that a black swan event is unfolding.&#160; If you look at the charts below, you can see that the financial markets are facing the mathematical certainty of a meltdown.<br>

<p>Also, as the cabal exercise in October predicted, the pandemic will be the trigger by freezing real-world trade and economic activity.</p>
<p>A few other bits of news show that it is not business as usual.&#160; For one thing, we have a huge plague of locusts hitting Africa&#8217;s breadbasket region at the same time as China fights a pandemic.&#160; Coincidence?<br>
<a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/world/africa/article/3047674/skies-go-black-africas-worst-locust-swarm-attack-decades" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.scmp.com/news/world/africa/article/3047674/skies-go-black-africas-worst-locust-swarm-attack-decades</a></p>
<p>Then we have NATO preparations for a war against Russia.<br>
<a href="https://tass.com/politics/1109995" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://tass.com/politics/1109995</a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, U.S. Central Command appears to be ignoring orders from Washington and is beefing up in the Middle East and financing itself with the oil fields there.<br>
<a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/20000-us-troops-have-surged-mideast-last-spring-counter-iran" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/20000-us-troops-have-surged-mideast-last-spring-counter-iran</a></p>
<p>Also, U.S. Corporate president Donald Trump is about to announce an arrogant Israeli peace plan that is already dead on arrival.<br>
<a href="https://www.ynetnews.com/article/BJyqRUobU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.ynetnews.com/article/BJyqRUobU</a></p>
<p>In any case, negative energy generated by the pandemic and associated campaign is failing to blow away a huge wave of positive news that is emerging.&#160; For example, Trump, who recently participated in yet another attempt to start an artificial Armageddon in Iran, did an about-turn at Davos saying, &#8220;To embrace the possibilities of tomorrow, we must reject the perennial prophets of doom and their predictions of the apocalypse.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the same event, the unpopular Prince Charles of the UK actually made some very good policy proposals.&#160; In particular, he called for &#8220;genuinely&#8221; mobilizing &#8220;the kind of trillions of dollars needed&#8221; to fix the planet.<br>
<a href="https://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/speech/keynote-speech-delivered-hrh-prince-wales-world-economic-forum-davos-switzerland" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/speech/keynote-speech-delivered-hrh-prince-wales-world-economic-forum-davos-switzerland</a></p>
<p>The biggest news is that the quarantine on the planet Earth is about to be ended and humanity will be allowed out into space, according to senior leaders of the secret space program.&#160; It is no coincidence that the newly announced U.S. Space Force has a logo that looks very similar to the one in Star Trek.<br>
<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-51245262" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-51245262</a></p>
<p>This is because there has been a high-level agreement reached between East and West for a meritocratic new organization to be created in order to oversee human expansion into the universe.&#160; Star Trek provides the model.</p>
<p>To get from here to there in concrete terms is the task that now lies ahead.&#160; A senior member of the secret space program has in his possession the original secret treaty between King George III and the Republic of the United States of America.&#160; He says a condition for unveiling the secret space program and the 5,000 patents hidden for &#8220;national security reasons&#8221; is the restoration of sovereignty to the American Republic and its people.&#160; Another condition is the replacing of admiralty law with Common Law for the People, he says.</p>
<p>In addition, this individual has in his possession the documents from the Holy Roman Empire that control the world&#8217;s financial system and the 206 countries that operate under it.&#160; Throughout the entire world, he says &#8220;the peoples on the land&#8221; will be liberated from the &#8220;200 corporate countries run by people on the dark side.&#8221;&#160; P3 Freemasons who represent the Holy Roman Empire are also in agreement with these goals.</p>
<p>Once this is accomplished, vast funds can be released to finance a massive campaign to end poverty, war, environmental destruction, disease, and even mortality.&#160; Then the quarantine on the planet will end.</p>

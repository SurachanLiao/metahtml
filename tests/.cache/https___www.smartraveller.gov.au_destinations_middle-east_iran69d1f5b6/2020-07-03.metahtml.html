<li>The security situation in Iran remains volatile and could deteriorate with little or no warning. On 8 January, Iran fired missiles against two military bases in Iraq, containing US personnel. Tensions in the region could escalate rapidly. Iranian authorities have acknowledged responsibility for the shooting down of a Ukrainian International Airlines on 8 January. &#160; &#160;&#160;</li>
<li>There are&#160;ongoing conflicts in Iraq and Syria, rising hostility between Iran and Israel and recent military tensions between Iran, the US and other countries in the Middle East. The Iran-Iraq border area is extremely dangerous. Regional and international politics can trigger protests. These may target Western or UN diplomatic missions. Avoid vigils, demonstrations and large public gatherings, as they can turn violent without warning.</li>
<li>Foreigners in Iran, including Australians, risk arbitrary detention or arrest. The risk is greater if you're a dual citizen. Keep a low profile. We can't guarantee access to consular services or legal representation if you're detained or arrested.</li>
<li>Terrorist attacks could happen anywhere in the country, including Tehran. They could occur at any time. Avoid possible targets and areas with a low level of security. Take official warnings seriously.</li>
<li>Drug traffickers and bandits are active in the Afghanistan and Pakistan border areas. They often clash violently with security forces. Bombings and shootings occur. Be alert to your surroundings, especially at night. Outside these areas, the level of violent crime is low.</li>
<li>Women can face unwanted attention and harassment. If you're a woman, take care when travelling alone, particularly at night.</li>

<li>If despite our advice you travel to Iran, you'll need a visa to enter Iran. If you're a tourist, you can apply for a visa on arrival. You must be staying for 30 days or less and entering through an international airport. For other situations, get a visa before you travel. Contact your nearest <a href="http://en.canberra.mfa.ir/">Iranian embassy</a> for details.</li>
<li>If your passport contains Israeli stamps or visas, Iranian authorities will refuse you entry.</li>
<li>The local currency is the Iranian Rial (IRR). Declare any foreign currency you have when you arrive in Iran. If you don't, authorities may confiscate it when you leave. You can exchange major currencies in all big cities. You can't use international credit or bank cards. You can't transfer money using commercial banks or money transfer companies. Bring enough cash to cover your stay.</li>

On 8 January, Iran fired missiles against two military bases in Iraq containing US personnel. Tensions in the region could escalate rapidly. If, despite our strong advice, you decide to go to or stay in Iran, monitor media for possible threats. Iranian authorities have acknowledged responsibility for the shooting down of a Ukrainian International Airlines flight shortly after take-off from Tehran on 8 January. A number of international airlines have cancelled flights to Iran. Contact your airline or travel company for the latest flight information.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Tensions in the region remain high due to:</p>
<ul dir="ltr">
<li>ongoing conflicts in Iraq and Syria</li>
<li>rising hostility between Iran, US and Israel</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">If despite our strong advice you go to Iran and decide to stay there, monitor media for possible threats and keep a low profile. If tensions escalate, your options to leave may be limited. The Australian Government may not be able to assist with your departure. Check the latest flight status with your airline and make arrangements in case you can&#8217;t leave. Share those plans with family and friends.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Iranian authorities are active in and closely monitor border areas with Iraq. The security situation within 10km of the Iran-Iraq border is extremely dangerous.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Do not visit military or nuclear sites, these are not always clearly marked. Follow the advice of local authorities and monitor the media.</p>
<p dir="ltr">On 21 August 2019, the Australian Prime Minister announced the Government would make a contribution to freedom of navigation and the protection of international shipping in the Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz.&#160; This contribution is not directed at Iran, but is about providing security for the flow of commercial vessels across the Middle East region.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Demonstrations and protests</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Political developments in the region and local political tensions can trigger protests, demonstrations and vigils.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Iranians sometimes protest against some Western and Middle East embassies and UN missions. The Saudi Arabia mission in Tehran was attacked in January 2016. The United Kingdom mission in Tehran was attacked in November 2011.</p>
<p dir="ltr">To protect yourself during periods of unrest:</p>
<ul dir="ltr">
<li>avoid demonstrations, protests, large crowds and vigils</li>
<li>monitor media for possible threats</li>
<li>plan activities to avoid disruption on national or commemorative days</li>
<li>follow the advice of local authorities</li>
<li>share your itinerary with family and friends and keep in close contact so they know where you are.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Be prepared to change your travel plans in case of disruptions.</p>

<ul dir="ltr">
<li>loose-fitting clothing to cover arms and legs</li>
<li>a coat</li>
<li>a headscarf</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">If you're male, don't wear shorts or sleeveless T-shirts.</p>

<ul dir="ltr">
<li>military and nuclear sites</li>
<li>government buildings and installations</li>
<li>critical civil infrastructure</li>
<li>public demonstrations</li>
</ul>
<h4 dir="ltr">Electronic equipment</h4>
<p dir="ltr">It's illegal to use drones without authorisation.</p>

<ul dir="ltr">

<p dir="ltr">Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.</p>
<p dir="ltr">You can end up stranded if your passport isn't valid for more than 6 months.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting <a href="https://www.passports.gov.au/">a new passport</a>.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Lost or stolen passport</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible.</p>

The Iran-Iraq border area is extremely dangerous. Regional and international politics can trigger protests. These may target Western or UN diplomatic missions. Avoid vigils, demonstrations and large public gatherings, as they can turn violent without warning.</ins></li><ins> </ins><li><ins>Foreigners in Iran, including Australians, risk arbitrary detention or arrest. The risk is greater if you're a dual citizen. Keep a low profile. We can't guarantee access to consular services or legal representation if you're detained or arrested.</ins></li><ins> </ins><li><ins>Terrorist attacks could happen anywhere in the country, including Tehran. They could occur at any time. Avoid possible targets and areas with a low level of security. Take official warnings seriously.</ins></li><ins> </ins><li><ins>Drug traffickers and bandits are active in the Afghanistan and Pakistan border areas. They often clash violently with security forces. Bombings and shootings occur. Be alert to your surroundings, especially at night.

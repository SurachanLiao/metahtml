<div><p class="field field--name-field-title field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"><h4>Civil unrest and political tension</h4></p><p dir="ltr">Regional tensions are high.&#160;The security situation in Iran remains volatile. On 8 January, Iran fired missiles against two military bases in Iraq containing US personnel. Tensions in the region could escalate rapidly. If, despite our strong advice, you decide to go to or stay in Iran, monitor media for possible threats. Iranian authorities have acknowledged responsibility for the shooting down of a Ukrainian International Airlines flight shortly after take-off from Tehran on 8 January. A number of international airlines have cancelled flights to Iran. Contact your airline or travel company for the latest flight information.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Tensions in the region remain high due to:</p>
<ul dir="ltr">
<li>ongoing conflicts in Iraq and Syria</li>
<li>rising hostility between Iran, US and Israel</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">If despite our strong advice you go to Iran and decide to stay there, monitor media for possible threats and keep a low profile. If tensions escalate, your options to leave may be limited. The Australian Government may not be able to assist with your departure. Check the latest flight status with your airline and make arrangements in case you can&#8217;t leave. Share those plans with family and friends.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Iranian authorities are active in and closely monitor border areas with Iraq. The security situation within 10km of the Iran-Iraq border is extremely dangerous.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Do not visit military or nuclear sites, these are not always clearly marked. Follow the advice of local authorities and monitor the media.</p>
<p dir="ltr">On 21 August 2019, the Australian Prime Minister announced the Government would make a contribution to freedom of navigation and the protection of international shipping in the Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz.&#160; This contribution is not directed at Iran, but is about providing security for the flow of commercial vessels across the Middle East region.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Demonstrations and protests</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Political developments in the region and local political tensions can trigger protests, demonstrations and vigils.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Iranians sometimes protest against some Western and Middle East embassies and UN missions. The Saudi Arabia mission in Tehran was attacked in January 2016. The United Kingdom mission in Tehran was attacked in November 2011.</p>
<p dir="ltr">To protect yourself during periods of unrest:</p>
<ul dir="ltr">
<li>avoid demonstrations, protests, large crowds and vigils</li>
<li>monitor media for possible threats</li>
<li>plan activities to avoid disruption on national or commemorative days</li>
<li>follow the advice of local authorities</li>
<li>share your itinerary with family and friends and keep in close contact so they know where you are.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Be prepared to change your travel plans in case of disruptions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If civil unrest disrupts transport, ask your airline, travel agent or insurer for help.</p>

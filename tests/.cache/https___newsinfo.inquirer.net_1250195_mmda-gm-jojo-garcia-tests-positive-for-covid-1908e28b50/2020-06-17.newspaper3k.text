MANILA, Philippines — Jojo Garcia, the general manager (GM) of the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA), said on Saturday that he had tested positive for the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19), making him the latest high-ranking official to be afflicted with the virus.

In a statement, Garcia said he would have to work from home from now on as his job “puts (him) in a lot of risk.”

“This (sickness) is part of it. I embrace this challenge with full trust and faith in God that I would overcome the same with your prayers,” he said.

Garcia believes he contracted the virus from a COVID-19-positive patient whom he and other MMDA officials met on March 17.

But Garcia only learned of that patient’s condition the night of March 22. Garcia went into quarantine on March 23.

</p><p dir="ltr">Production of the Volvo XC40 compact SUV in Luqiao, China, started in 2019.</p><p>Volvo expects to lose at least two weeks&#8217; worth of sales, production and supply deliveries in China because of the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak, CEO <a href="https://europe.autonews.com/automakers/volvo-ceo-outlines-strategy-electrify-lineup-become-climate-neutral" target="_blank" class="omnitrack inline-paragraph-link">Hakan Samuelsson</a> said Thursday.&#160;</p><p>&#8220;China has come to a standstill, and that will affect our company, as well as other companies,&#8221; Samuelsson told Automotive News Europe on a call to discuss Volvo&#8217;s 2019 fourth quarter and annual <a href="https://europe.autonews.com/automakers/volvo-q4-profit-rises-18-cost-cuts-china-us-sales-growth" target="_blank" class="omnitrack inline-paragraph-link">financial results</a>.</p><p>Volvo Cars, which is a brand of the Zhejiang Geely Holding Group, a Chinese company, sold 154,961 cars in China in 2019, a 19 percent increase in a market that fell by 7.4 percent overall. China is its largest individual country market, although it sold more than 341,000 cars in Europe in 2019.</p><p>Volvo has a number of factories in China. It makes the XC60 midsize SUV in Chengdu, the XC40 compact SUV in Luqiao and the S90 large sedan in Daqing. In addition, Volvo&#8217;s Polestar electric sub-brand has opened a separate factory in Chengdu. It also has several engine assembly plants.</p><p>Those facilities have remained closed after the New Year holiday break, Samuelsson said. &#8220;We&#8217;re following the recommendations of local authorities, which means we avoid bringing people together, the factories have not opened, and people are requested to stay home and avoid contact,&#8221; he said.</p><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like time has stopped,&#8221; he said of the situation in China. &#8220;It&#8217;s basically two weeks of sales, of production, of supply chain that have been taken out.&#8221;</p><p class="field__item">'Difficult' forecast</p><p><a href="https://europe.autonews.com/automakers/renault-honda-extend-china-plant-closures" target="_blank" class="omnitrack inline-paragraph-link">Other automakers</a>, including Ford, Honda, Hyundai, Nissan and Renault, have suspended Chinese production or extended the holiday furlough as the death toll from the virus neared 600 on Thursday.</p><p>Samuelsson said the disruption was mostly contained to China, and that Volvo&#8217;s plants and operations in North America and Europe were largely unaffected, although there could be a shortage of parts exported from China.</p><p>Volvo said in its annual report that the coronavirus outbreak would affect first-quarter operations. Samuelsson said he expected Volvo to recoup any lost sales and production over the rest of this year. &#8220;We think the effect for the whole year will be relatively minor,&#8221; he said.</p><p>Samuelsson said the virus in China had made it &#8220;extra difficult&#8221; to forecast overall results in 2020, but he said that Volvo was still maintaining its outlook for continued growth and improved profits. Last year Volvo sold more than 705,000 cars globally, a 9.8 percent increase, and the sixth straight year of sales growth.</p><p>A report this week from LMC Automotive said that in the most likely scenario, the virus outbreak could push down sales and production in China by 3 percent to 5 percent this year.</p><p>Other possible outcomes included a quick containment of the virus in the first quarter, which could lead to modest growth for the year. In the worst case, the virus continues into the third quarter, with &#8220;enormous&#8221; macroeconomic impact, and the Chinese auto market would fall by at least 10 percent.</p><p class="recommended-title">

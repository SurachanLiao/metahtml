<div><p>Volvo expects to lose at least two weeks&#8217; worth of sales, production and supply deliveries in China because of the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak, CEO <a href="https://europe.autonews.com/automakers/volvo-ceo-outlines-strategy-electrify-lineup-become-climate-neutral" target="_blank" class="omnitrack inline-paragraph-link">Hakan Samuelsson</a> said Thursday.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;China has come to a standstill, and that will affect our company, as well as other companies,&#8221; Samuelsson told Automotive News Europe on a call to discuss Volvo&#8217;s 2019 fourth quarter and annual <a href="https://europe.autonews.com/automakers/volvo-q4-profit-rises-18-cost-cuts-china-us-sales-growth" target="_blank" class="omnitrack inline-paragraph-link">financial results</a>.</p>
<p>Volvo Cars, which is a brand of the Zhejiang Geely Holding Group, a Chinese company, sold 154,961 cars in China in 2019, a 19 percent increase in a market that fell by 7.4 percent overall. China is its largest individual country market, although it sold more than 341,000 cars in Europe in 2019.</p>
<p>Volvo has a number of factories in China. It makes the XC60 midsize SUV in Chengdu, the XC40 compact SUV in Luqiao and the S90 large sedan in Daqing. In addition, Volvo&#8217;s Polestar electric sub-brand has opened a separate factory in Chengdu. It also has several engine assembly plants.</p>
<p>Those facilities have remained closed after the New Year holiday break, Samuelsson said. &#8220;We&#8217;re following the recommendations of local authorities, which means we avoid bringing people together, the factories have not opened, and people are requested to stay home and avoid contact,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like time has stopped,&#8221; he said of the situation in China. &#8220;It&#8217;s basically two weeks of sales, of production, of supply chain that have been taken out.&#8221;</p>

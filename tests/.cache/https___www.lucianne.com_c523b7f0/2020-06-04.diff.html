The report says Floyd, 44, had first tested positive for COVID-19 back on April 3 and that traces of the virus “can persist for weeks after the onset and resolution of clinical disease.”  The virus in Floyd, the report says, was “asymptomatic but persistent,” leading to the positive postmortem test.

“However sickening the video of Floyd’s arrest, it isn’t representative of the 375 million annual contacts that police officers have with civilians,” Mac Donald wrote in her piece titled “The Myth of Systemic Police Racism.” Mac Donald continues, “A solid body of evidence finds no structural bias in the criminal-justice system with regard to arrests, prosecution or sentencing. Crime and suspect behavior, not race, determine most police actions.”

The lie was the fallacious and already debunked claim that the Trump administration had “gassed and pummeled protesters” prior to President Donald Trump’s “powerful” walk to St. John’s Church earlier this week.

To make matters worse, he spewed the lie while referencing deceased civil rights hero and legend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.

“Kayleigh, you mentioned Dr. King. He likely would not have approved of what took place on Monday evening across from the White House as you probably know,” Acosta said.

What does ISIS stand for?

Many people have heard of the term ISIS, which is an acronym for the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.

It can also mean the Islamic State in al-Sham, the Arabic name for the region, and the group have said its goal is to create a caliphate in this region.

The name ISIS has proved an issue for many companies and brands, as it also belongs to an ancient Egyptian goddess.

The murderous network – known for its barbaric public executions – was originally part of al-Qaeda before splitting with the group over differences in ideology and methods.

It believes all Muslims should unite into a worldwide caliphate.

What is the meaning of Isil?

Isil is an acronym standing for Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.

This name was given to the group as it was thought to be more accurate to their geographical location as the Levant includes Syria, Palestine, Lebanon, Israel and Jordan.

Many governments and leaders, including Barack Obama and David Cameron, have used the term Isil as it is thought to be a better translation for al-Sham, which is the Arabic name for the area.

In a statement released following the brutal beheading of American photojournalist James Foley, Mr Cameron’s office said: “The Prime Minister has condemned the barbaric and brutal murder of James Foley by Isil (Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant) in Syria.

“This will not change our commitment to tackling this appalling organisation and doing everything we can to keep our country safe.”

What is the meaning of Daesh?

The word Daesh is an acronym for al-Dawla al-Islamiya fi al-Iraq wa al-Sham.

The term is derived from a rough translation of Arabic words, including Arabic verb دعس, which means to tread underfoot or crush.

It can also be spelt DAIISH, Da’esh or Daech, and is a name which members of the terror group despise.

According to the Associated Press in 2014, ISIS threatened “to cut the tongue of anyone who publicly used the acronym Daesh”.

Following the attacks in France, the French government started adopting this term instead of ISIS or Isil.

Former French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said: “This is a terrorist group and not a state.

“I do not recommend using the term Islamic State because it blurs the lines between Islam, Muslims and Islamists.”

Which is the correct name?

The four competing names are just a few of the those used by the terror group, which started in 1999 when it was formed by Jordanian militant Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.

As far as they are concerned, the correct term is the Islamic State – but the British and US Governments are among those preferring to use the name Isil.

The term ISIS is more commonly used within international news publications, and has been used as a label in official United Nations reports.

Counter-terrorism expert Dr Anne Aly, a research fellow at Curtin University, said it is neither “here or there” what you call the terror group.

She said it is more important to note that they call themselves the Islamic State, as it shows they are trying to create a state does not respect the borders of Iraq and Syria.

In 2015 the BBC’s Director General refused to drop the term Islamic State from the corporation’s coverage.

All BBC broadcasts and reports refer to the group as the “so-called Islamic State”.

At the time a BBC spokesman said the corporation had no choice but to refer to the group by the name it uses itself.

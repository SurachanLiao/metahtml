</del> <h2>What does ISIS stand for?</h2> <p>Many people have heard of the term ISIS, which is an acronym for the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.</p> <p>It can also mean the Islamic State in al-Sham, the Arabic name for the region, and the group have said its goal is to create a caliphate in this region.</p> <p>The name ISIS has proved an issue for many companies and brands, as it also belongs to an ancient Egyptian goddess.</p> <p>The murderous network – known for its barbaric public executions – was <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/al-qaeda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">originally part of al-Qaeda </a>before splitting with the group over differences in ideology and methods.</p> <p>It believes all Muslims should unite into a worldwide caliphate.</p> <a href="#"><p><del><img class="wp-image-2596154 size-thesun-article-image" alt="A propaganda photograph of an ISIS militant in Syria" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/nintchdbpict0002853666022.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960&amp;quality=100" width="960" height="576"></del></p><del> Link: # </del></a><del> </del><p class="article__credit"><del>Alamy		</del></p><del> </del><a href=""><p class="article__gallery-count-value theme__copy-color"><del>5</del></p></a><del> A propaganda photograph of an ISIS militant in Syria	
	

</del> <h2>What is the meaning of Isil?</h2> <p>Isil is an acronym standing for Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.</p> <p>This name was given to the group as it was thought to be more accurate to their geographical location as the Levant includes Syria, Palestine, Lebanon, Israel and Jordan.</p> <p>Many governments and leaders, including <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2225686/barack-obama-and-russias-vladimir-putin-refuse-to-look-at-each-other-after-discussing-isis-threat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Barack Obama</a> and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/archives/politics/75379/david-cameron-calls-for-destruction-of-isis-monsters-in-syria/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">David Cameron</a>, have used the term Isil as it is thought to be a better translation for al-Sham, which is the Arabic name for the area.</p> <p>In a statement released following the brutal beheading of <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/archives/news/1045324/brit-is-fighter-beheads-missing-us-journalist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">American photojournalist James Foley</a>, Mr Cameron’s office said: “The Prime Minister has condemned the barbaric and brutal murder of James Foley by Isil (Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant) in Syria.</p> <p>“This will not change our commitment to tackling this appalling organisation and doing everything we can to keep our country safe.”</p> <a href="#"><p><del><img class="wp-image-2595994 size-thesun-article-image" alt="ISIS militants parade in 2014 in Raqqa, Syria" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/nintchdbpict0002920966731.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960&amp;quality=100" width="960" height="473"></del></p><del> Link: # </del></a><del> </del><p class="article__credit"><del>Alamy		</del></p><del> </del><a href=""><p class="article__gallery-count-value theme__copy-color"><del>5</del></p></a><del> ISIS militants parade in 2014 in Raqqa, Syria	
	

</del> <h2>What is the meaning of Daesh?</h2> <p>The word Daesh is an acronym for al-Dawla al-Islamiya fi al-Iraq wa al-Sham.</p> <p>The term is derived from a rough translation of Arabic words, including Arabic verb دعس, which means to tread underfoot or crush.</p> <p>It can also be spelt DAIISH, Da’esh or Daech, and is a name which members of the terror group despise.</p> <p>According to the <a href="https://blog.ap.org/announcements/now-we-say-the-islamic-state-group-instead-of-isil" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Associated Press</a> in 2014, ISIS threatened “to cut the tongue of anyone who publicly used the acronym Daesh”.</p> <p>Following the attacks in France, the French government started adopting this term instead of ISIS or Isil.</p> <p>Former French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said: “This is a terrorist group and not a state.</p> <p>“I do not recommend using the term Islamic State because it blurs the lines between Islam, Muslims and Islamists.”</p> <a href="#"><p><del><img class="wp-image-2596157 size-thesun-article-image" alt="The caliph of the self-proclaimed Islamic State, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

</del> <h2>Which is the correct name?</h2> <p>The four competing names are just a few of the those used by the terror group, which started in 1999 when it was formed by Jordanian militant Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.</p> <p>As far as they are concerned, the correct term is the Islamic State – but the British and US Governments are among those preferring to use the name Isil.</p> <p>The term <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/isis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ISIS is more commonly used</a> within international news publications, and has been used as a label in official United Nations reports.</p> <p>Counter-terrorism expert Dr Anne Aly, a research fellow at Curtin University, said it is neither “here or there” what you call the terror group.</p> <p>She said it is more important to note that they call themselves the Islamic State, as it shows they are trying to create a state does not respect the borders of Iraq and Syria.</p> <p>In 2015 the BBC’s Director General refused to drop the term Islamic State from the corporation’s coverage.</p> <p>All BBC broadcasts and reports refer to the group as the “so-called Islamic State”.</p> <p>At the time a BBC spokesman said the corporation had no choice but to refer to the group by the name it uses itself.</p> <p class="bc-video-holder"><span class="article__bc_video-caption">Russia Defence Ministry look like fools after Tweeting video of a computer game and claiming it was US military assisting ISIS</span></p> <p class="rail__header"></p><h3 class="rail__title theme__after-color">MOST READ IN NEWS</h3> <p class="swiper-pagination theme__swiper-pagination"><del></del></p><del> </del><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/12116184/amber-heard-bruises-talk-show-trial/"><p class="delayed-image-load-landscape"><del></del></p><del> </del><p class="delayed-image-load-mobile"><del></del></p><del>  Link: https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/12116184/amber-heard-bruises-talk-show-trial/ </del></a> <p class="rail__item-content"></p><h3 class="rail__item-headline theme__copy-color">'HEADBUTT INJURIES'			</h3> <span class="rail__item-sub">Amber had '2 black eyes' on James Corden show after Depp 'headbutt'			</span> <p class="rail__item-gradient-light"><del></del></p><del> </del><del><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/12116184/amber-heard-bruises-talk-show-trial/" class="rail__item-anchor"> Link: https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/12116184/amber-heard-bruises-talk-show-trial/ </a> </del><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/12121257/ghislaine-maxwell-plead-not-guilty-journalist-jen-marshall-denied-bail/"><p class="delayed-image-load-landscape"><del></del></p><del> </del><p class="delayed-image-load-mobile"><del></del></p><del>  Link: https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/12121257/ghislaine-maxwell-plead-not-guilty-journalist-jen-marshall-denied-bail/ </del></a> <p class="rail__item-content"></p><h3 class="rail__item-headline theme__copy-color">ALIAS EXPOSED			</h3> <span class="rail__item-sub">Ghislaine Maxwell 'posed as journalist to buy retreat' &amp;

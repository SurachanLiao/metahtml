<p>Otto Warmbier, the University of Virginia student who was detained in North Korea for nearly a year and a half, died Monday afternoon, his parents announced.</p>
<p>Fred and Cindy Warmbier had no news about their son during his detention after March of last year. He was not allowed consular visits, and it was not until this month that U.S. officials and the family were told that he had been in a coma for more than a year. He was medically evacuated, landed in Cincinnati on Tuesday night and was rushed to the hospital.</p>
<p>On Thursday, doctors at the&#160;University of Cincinnati Medical Center said that the 22-year-old Otto Warmbier had extensive loss of brain tissue, and was in a state of unresponsive wakefulness.</p>
<p>That morning&#160;Fred Warmbier denounced what he called the &#8220;pariah&#8221; regime that brutalized his son.</p>

<p>Fred and Cindy Warmbier issued a statement Monday afternoon:</p>

<blockquote class="citation"><p>It is our sad duty to report that our son, Otto Warmbier, has completed his journey home.&#160; Surrounded by his loving family, Otto died today at 2:20pm.</p>
<p>It would be easy at a moment like this to focus on all that we lost &#8212; future time that won&#8217;t be spent with a warm, engaging, brilliant young man whose curiosity and enthusiasm for life knew no bounds. But we choose to focus on the time we were given to be with this remarkable person.&#160; You can tell from the outpouring of emotion from the communities that he touched &#8212; Wyoming, Ohio and the University of Virginia to name just two &#8212; that the love for Otto went well beyond his immediate family.</p>
<p>We would like to thank the wonderful professionals at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center who did everything they could for Otto. Unfortunately, the awful torturous mistreatment our son received at the hands of the North Koreans ensured that no other outcome was possible beyond the sad one we experienced today.</p>
<p>When Otto returned to Cincinnati late on June 13th he was unable to speak, unable to see and unable to react to verbal commands. He looked very uncomfortable &#8212; almost anguished.&#160; Although we would never hear his voice again, within a day the countenance of his face changed &#8212; he was at peace.&#160; He was home and we believe he could sense that.</p>
<p>We thank everyone around the world who has kept him and our family in their thoughts and prayers.&#160;&#160; We are at peace and at home too.</p>
<p>Fred &amp; Cindy Warmbier and Family</p></blockquote>
<p>Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), who worked to try to free Warmbier, said in a statement Monday afternoon, &#8220;Otto Warmbier was such a promising young man. He was kind, generous and accomplished. He had all the talent you could ever ask for and a bright future ahead of him. His passing today is a loss for Ohio and for all of us. Jane and I are lifting up the Warmbier family in our prayers at this difficult time, and we are deeply saddened by the tragic loss of this remarkable young Ohioan.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gov. John Kasich said in a written statement: &#8220;All Ohioans mourn the death of Otto Warmbier, a young man of exceptional spirit. Our prayers go out to his family, who have shown great strength and courage throughout this terrible ordeal. This horrendous situation further underscores the evil, oppressive nature of the North Korean regime that has such disregard for human life.&#8221;</p>

<p>Teresa Sullivan, president of U-Va., where Warmbier&#8217;s class graduated last month, said by phone Monday afternoon: &#8220;It&#8217;s just such a waste of a promising young life.&#160;That&#8217;s very hard &#8212; that&#8217;s very hard to accept.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel so sorry for his classmates and his fraternity brothers. He had many friends at the university, professors who taught him, I think everyone feels, very deeply, this loss.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we always somewhere, deep down, thought he would come back to us and finish his degree with us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Todd Siler, a teacher at Wyoming High School, said that he saw two of Warmbier&#8217;s friends from the graduating class of 2013, of which he was salutatorian, earlier Monday. They had been to the hospital to see him, and came to school to see their friend&#8217;s name on the graduation walk; all the students have their name etched on a brick there. &#8220;Tough, tough moments today,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;In a short time&#160; he had an impact on so many people of all different walks of life. It takes an incredibly unique person to be able to do that.&#160;I think that&#8217;s what makes his passing so hard &#8212; there aren&#8217;t enough people like that in this world. We lost a good one. We lost a great one.</p>
<p>&#8220;Otto was strong, such a strong kid,&#8221; Siler added. &#8220;His spirit touched everybody, and I want to believe that, despite the treatment that he experienced, that he was hanging on to come home. And he did that. He knew he was there and with family. &#8230; I think there was a part of him still left that understood that.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s home. So it&#8217;s okay to let go.&#8221;</p>

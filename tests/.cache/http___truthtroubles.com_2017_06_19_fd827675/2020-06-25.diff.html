He was not allowed consular visits, and it was not until this month that U.S. officials and the family were told that he had been in a coma for more than a year. He was medically evacuated, landed in Cincinnati on Tuesday night and was rushed to the hospital.</p><p>On Thursday, doctors at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center said that the 22-year-old Otto Warmbier had extensive loss of brain tissue, and was in a state of unresponsive wakefulness.</p><p>That morning Fred Warmbier denounced what he called the “pariah” regime that brutalized his son.</p><p class="interstitial-link">[<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2017/06/15/otto-warmbier-has-extensive-loss-of-brain-tissue-no-obvious-signs-of-trauma-doctors-say/?utm_term=.6f72cfb95d27">Otto Warmbier has extensive loss of brain tissue, no obvious signs of trauma</a>]</p><p>Fred and Cindy Warmbier issued a statement Monday afternoon:</p><p class="interstitial-link">[<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2017/06/15/after-his-release-from-north-korean-detention-otto-warmbiers-hometown-waits-anxiously-for-news/?utm_term=.2aa15ea24674">Otto Warmbier’s father denounces North Korea</a>]</p><blockquote class="citation"><p>It is our sad duty to report that our son, Otto Warmbier, has completed his journey home.  Surrounded by his loving family, Otto died today at 2:20pm.</p> <p>It would be easy at a moment like this to focus on all that we lost — future time that won’t be spent with a warm, engaging, brilliant young man whose curiosity and enthusiasm for life knew no bounds. But we choose to focus on the time we were given to be with this remarkable person.  You can tell from the outpouring of emotion from the communities that he touched — Wyoming, Ohio and the University of Virginia to name just two — that the love for Otto went well beyond his immediate family.</p> <p>We would like to thank the wonderful professionals at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center who did everything they could for Otto. Unfortunately, the awful torturous mistreatment our son received at the hands of the North Koreans ensured that no other outcome was possible beyond the sad one we experienced today.</p> <p>When Otto returned to Cincinnati late on June 13th he was unable to speak, unable to see and unable to react to verbal commands. He looked very uncomfortable — almost anguished.  Although we would never hear his voice again, within a day the countenance of his face changed — he was at peace.  He was home and we believe he could sense that.</p> <p>We thank everyone around the world who has kept him and our family in their thoughts and prayers.   We are at peace and at home too.</p> <p>Fred &amp; Cindy Warmbier and Family</p></blockquote><p>Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), who worked to try to free Warmbier, said in a statement Monday afternoon, “Otto Warmbier was such a promising young man. He was kind, generous and accomplished. He had all the talent you could ever ask for and a bright future ahead of him. His passing today is a loss for Ohio and for all of us. Jane and I are lifting up the Warmbier family in our prayers at this difficult time, and we are deeply saddened by the tragic loss of this remarkable young Ohioan.”</p><p>Gov. John Kasich said in a written statement: “All Ohioans mourn the death of Otto Warmbier, a young man of exceptional spirit. Our prayers go out to his family, who have shown great strength and courage throughout this terrible ordeal. This horrendous situation further underscores the evil, oppressive nature of the North Korean regime that has such disregard for human life.”</p><p class="wpv-caption pb-caption"><span class="wpv-blurb">Undated video shows American student Otto Warmbier throwing snowballs in North Korea before his arrest for “committing hostile acts” against North Korea.</span> (Austin Warmbier)</p><p>Teresa Sullivan, president of U-Va., where Warmbier’s class graduated last month, said by phone Monday afternoon: “It’s just such a waste of a promising young life. That’s very hard — that’s very hard to accept.</p><p>“I feel so sorry for his classmates and his fraternity brothers.

They had been to the hospital to see him, and came to school to see their friend’s name on the graduation walk; all the students have their name etched on a brick there. “Tough, tough moments today,” he said.</p><p>“In a short time  he had an impact on so many people of all different walks of life. It takes an incredibly unique person to be able to do that. I think that’s what makes his passing so hard — there aren’t enough people like that in this world. We lost a good one. We lost a great one.</p><p>“Otto was strong, such a strong kid,” Siler added. “His spirit touched everybody, and I want to believe that, despite the treatment that he experienced, that he was hanging on to come home. And he did that. He knew he was there and with family. … I think there was a part of him still left that understood that.</p><p>“He’s home. So it’s okay to let go.”</p></article></section> <p class="robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing"><ins></ins></p><h3 class="sd-title"><ins>Like this post?

According to Schoettes, the last straw – or “more like a two-by-four than a straw” – had come in May, after the Republican-dominated House of Representatives passed the American Health Care Act, which he said would have “devastating” effects on those living with HIV.</ins></p><p class="control-bar-credit"><ins><span class="credit">Photo: Evan Vucci, Associated Press</span></ins></p><p class="caption-truncated"><ins>President Donald Trump speaks at an event in Miami.</ins></p><p><ins>“The Trump Administration has no strategy to address the on-going HIV/AIDS epidemic, seeks zero input from experts to formulate HIV policy, and – most concerning – pushes legislation that will harm people living with HIV and halt or reverse important gains made in the fight against this disease,” Schoettes wrote in a blistering guest column for Newsweek announcing the resignations.</ins></p><p><ins>The column also pointed out that Trump has still not appointed anyone to head the White House Office of National AIDS Policy, which former president Barack Obama had done 36 days after his own inauguration.</ins></p><p><ins>“Within 18 months, that new director and his staff crafted the first comprehensive U.S. HIV/AIDS strategy. By contrast, President Trump appears to have no plan at all,” Schoettes wrote. “Public health is not a partisan issue … If the President is not going to engage on the subject of HIV/AIDS, he should at least continue policies that support people living with and at higher risk for HIV and have begun to curtail the epidemic.”</ins></p><p><ins>The column was co-signed by the five other members of the council who had resigned, including Lucy Bradley-Springer, Gina Brown, Ulysses W. Burley III, Grissel Granados and Michelle Ogle. As of Monday morning, their bios remained on PACHA’s government website.</ins></p><p class="robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing"><ins></ins></p><h3 class="sd-title"><ins>Like this post?

Rep. Lee Cheol-woo, chairman of the South Korean parliament’s intelligence committee, made the claim based on reports from South Korea’s intelligence agency.</ins></p><p><ins>“Kim is engrossed with collecting information about the ‘decapitation operation’ through his intelligence agencies,” Lee said following a briefing last week.</ins></p><blockquote class="pull-quote"><p><ins>“Kim is engrossed with collecting information about the ‘decapitation operation’ through his intelligence agencies.”</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins><span class="quote-author">– Lee Cheol-woo, South Korean lawmaker</span></ins></p></blockquote><p><ins>The rumored “decapitation plan” to target Kim and key deputies in the event fighting broke out on the peninsula first surfaced in late 2015, when the U.S. and South Korea signed “Operation Plan 5015,” a joint strategy for possible war scenarios with North Korea. According to the Brookings Institute, the plan “envisions limited warfare with an emphasis on preemptive strikes on strategic targets in North Korea and “decapitation raids” to exterminate North Korean leaders.”</ins></p><p><ins>Something about the term “decapitation” seems to have gotten the attention of the gout-addled, unpredictable and violent dictator. According to Lee, Kim’s is so frightened that he now disguises his movements, travels primarily at dawn and in the cars of his henchmen. Public appearances and jaunts in his prized Mercedes Benz 600 have been curtailed.</ins></p><section class="related-image"><p class="m"><ins><span class="overlay">Expand / Collapse</span></ins></p><p><ins>Kim Jong Un is petrified that he could be the target of a “decapitation” raid.  <span class="copyright">(Reuters)</span></ins></p></section><p><ins>North Korea’s United Nations representative referenced the “beheading operation” in a sternly worded, 2016 letter to the body’s Security Council, suggesting that the joint military operations regularly conducted by the U.S. and South Korea “constitute a grave threat to [North Korea] as well as international peace and security.”</ins></p><p><ins>By January of this year, there were reports that South Korea was speeding up the creation of a specialized unit designed for this mission, initially slated to be ready by 2019.</ins></p><p><ins>During this year’s Foal Eagle and Key Resolve exercises with South Korea, one of the largest annual military exercises in the world, members of U.S. Navy SEAL teams reportedly participated in decapitation drills with our South Korean counterparts for the first time.  Naval officials denied reports that members of SEAL Team 6, the group that took out Usama Bin Laden, took part.</ins></p><p><ins>Shortly after those war games, however, the USS Michigan, a submarine that is sometimes used to move U.S. Special Forces, took a position just off of North Korea’s coast.</ins></p><p><ins>While there are concerns that taking out North Korea’s leader might not be enough, a White House review revealed earlier this year that the U.S. strategy on North Korea does include the possibility of regime change.</ins></p><section class="related-image"><p class="m"><ins><span class="overlay">Expand / Collapse</span></ins></p><p><ins>The Navy SEAL raid that took out Bin Laden in 2011 was easy compared to the challenge of assassinating Kim, say experts.  <span class="copyright">(Associated Press)</span></ins></p></section><p><ins>Kim has become a major problem regionally and for the U.S. as well. Pyongyang has repeatedly tested missiles potentially capable of delivering nuclear warheads and Kim’s threats against South Korea, Japan and the U.S. have grown increasingly bellicose. Last week, North Korea returned American college student Otto Warmbier after holding him for 17 months on a dubious charge. Doctors say Warmbier underwent devastating brain injuries while in North Korean custody and is now in an unresponsive state. Three other U.S. citizens remain locked up in the reclusive nation’s infamous gulags.</ins></p><p><ins>But while taking out Kim may be a possibility, experts say it would be much more complicated that the 2011 raid in Pakistan in which CIA operatives and SEALs took out Bin Laden.</ins></p><p><ins>“A U.S. special operations strike against Kim Jong Un in today’s conditions would make the bin Laden raid look easy,” said Mark Sauter, a former U.S. Army and special forces officer who operated in the Korean de-militarized zone during the Cold War and now blogs about the decades-long effort to defend South Korea at <a href="http://www.dmzwar.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.dmzwar.com Link: http://www.dmzwar.com/ </a>.</ins></p><p><ins>The daring, night-time raid on the Abbottabad compound went off nearly flawlessly. But U.S. forces would face much more deadly opposition in an assault on the North Korean capital.</ins></p><p><ins>“Pyongyang is surrounded by antiaircraft weapons, and while the corpulent Kim presents a large and sluggish target, he’s kept on the move, always surrounded by fanatical guards and often near or in complex underground compounds,” Sauter said.</ins></p><p><ins>Despite those potential challenges, Sauter suggests the North Korean leader “does need to worry about strikes by precision-guided missiles and bunker-buster bombs in the early stages of a preemptive allied attack, and if a conflict continues, everything from (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) to special operators will be on his tracks.”</ins></p><p class="robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing"><ins></ins></p><h3 class="sd-title"><ins>Like this post?

Levin <a href="https://twitter.com/ezralevin/status/875382866452119555">suggested Link: https://twitter.com/ezralevin/status/875382866452119555 </a> that the Democrats could introduce an almost infinite number of amendments that would choke the Senate calendar indefinitely until they got what they wanted.</ins></p><p class="interstitial-link"><ins>[<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/06/19/liberal-groups-are-teaming-up-to-pressure-gop-lawmakers-on-health-care-over-summer-recess/?utm_term=.f7cf81922e28">Liberal groups are teaming up to pressure GOP lawmakers on health care over summer recess Link: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/06/19/liberal-groups-are-teaming-up-to-pressure-gop-lawmakers-on-health-care-over-summer-recess/?utm_term=.f7cf81922e28 </a>]</ins></p><p><ins>The plan hinges on the way in which the bill is being moved through the Senate. To avoid the need for Democratic votes — which the Republican majority wouldn’t get — the Obamacare replacement is being advanced using what’s known as the reconciliation process. That process involves a special set of rules that are meant to fast-track debate over the budget, but, given that it also means legislation can avoid a filibuster in the Senate, it has also been used to pass controversial bills. (Several fixes essential to the passage of Obamacare were moved using the reconciliation process, for example.)</ins></p><p><ins>Those rules, defined by law, include allowing only 20 hours for debate but it also includes a process called “vote-a-rama,” in which amendments may be proposed and must be voted on before the final passage of the bill. That’s where Levin’s idea comes in: He proposed introducing tens of thousands of amendments that would need to be voted on before the Senate’s bill could be passed. In theory, Levin figured, Democrats could introduce enough amendments to shut down the Senate for a year.</ins></p><p><ins>Binder disagrees.</ins></p><p class="interstitial-link"><ins>[<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2017/06/19/mitch-mcconnell-on-the-health-care-legislative-process-2010-versus-2017/?utm_term=.6be542f32c63">Mitch McConnell on the health-care legislative process, 2010 vs. 2017 Link: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2017/06/19/mitch-mcconnell-on-the-health-care-legislative-process-2010-versus-2017/?utm_term=.6be542f32c63 </a>]</ins></p><p><ins>“In reality, that’s not going to happen,” she said. What was more likely, she said, is that someone would make a point of order that the Democrats were being “dilatory” — that is, slowing down the process unnecessarily. The presiding officer — the Republican senator on duty to manage floor debate — would be asked to rule on whether that was the case and would likely agree. Democrats could appeal the decision, but a majority vote would end the process.</ins></p></article></section><p class="robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing"><ins></ins></p><h3 class="sd-title"><ins>Like this post?

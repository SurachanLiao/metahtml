</p>
<p>&#8220;While we are disappointed with the official cancellation of the 2019-20 NBA G League season, the Maine Red Claws accept and understand the league&#8217;s decision,&#8221; said Dajuan Eubanks, president of the Maine Red Claws. &#8220;We as an organization were well on track to have our most successful season, both on and off the court, and are focused on continuing to make a positive impact in the Greater Portland community this offseason. We are excited for, and have our sights set on a return to the Expo for the 2020-21 season.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Red Claws, an affiliate of the Boston Celtics, ended up with a 28-14 record. They led the Atlantic Division by 6 1/2 games and were in third place in the Eastern Conference.</p>
<p>The G League&#8217;s regular season was scheduled to conclude on March 28. Maine was one win away from clinching a playoff berth.</p>
<p>&#8220;While canceling the remainder of our season weighs heavily on us, we recognize that it is the most appropriate action to take for our league,&#8221; G League President Shareef Abdur-Rahim said in a statement. &#8220;I extend my sincere gratitude to NBA G League players and coaches for giving their all to their teams and fans this season. And to our fans, I thank you and look forward to resuming play for the 2020-21 season.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the coming weeks, the league will announce end-of-season award winners, including the most valuable player, Dennis Johnson Coach of the Year and rookie of the year.</p>

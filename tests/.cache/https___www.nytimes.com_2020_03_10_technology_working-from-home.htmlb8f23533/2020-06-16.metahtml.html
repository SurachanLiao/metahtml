I&#8217;m getting plenty of work done, but I&#8217;m starting to get unnerved by the lack of stimulation. It&#8217;s been hours (days?) since I interacted face to face with a human who is not related to me, and cabin fever is setting in.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Among the coronavirus&#8217;s many effects is a boom in people like me: office workers, shooed away from the office, trying to acclimate to a work-from-home lifestyle.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">While the outbreak has already created inconveniences (and much worse) for millions of people in the form of travel restrictions, health scares and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/09/business/stock-market-today.html?action=click&amp;module=Spotlight&amp;pgtype=Homepage" title="">stock market turmoil</a>, it has been an exciting time for some fans of remote work. They argue that quarantined workers are getting a glimpse of our glorious, office-free future.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">&#8220;This is not how I envisioned the distributed work revolution taking hold,&#8221; <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://ma.tt/2020/03/coronavirus-remote-work/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote Matt Mullenweg</a>, chief executive of Automattic, the software company that owns the WordPress blogging platform.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Mr. Mullenweg, whose company&#8217;s work force is fully distributed, sees a silver lining in the coronavirus. In his blog post last week, he wrote that it &#8220;might also offer an opportunity for many companies to finally build a culture that allows long-overdue work flexibility.&#8221;</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">I get where he&#8217;s coming from. I was a remote worker for two years a while back. For most of that time, I was a work-from-home evangelist who told everyone within earshot about the benefits of avoiding the office. No <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/nyregion/coronavirus-commute-nyc-subway-cars.html" title="">commute</a>! No distracting co-workers! Home-cooked lunch! What&#8217;s not to love?</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">But I&#8217;ve been researching the pros and cons of remote work for my upcoming <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/617763/futureproof-by-kevin-roose/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">book</a> about human survival in the age of artificial intelligence and automation. And I&#8217;ve now come to a very different conclusion: Most people should work in an office, or near other people, and avoid solitary work-from-home arrangements whenever possible.</p><section id="styln-covid-updates-markets" class="css-l08pwh interactive-content interactive-size-medium"><p class="briefing-block-header-section">

I don&#8217;t think we should ignore health guidelines and force people to work in an office during a pandemic. And I&#8217;m sympathetic to the millions of teachers, restaurant workers and other professionals for whom working from home has never been a viable option.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">But for those of us lucky enough to be able to work from home, coronavirus or no, a few words of caution are in order.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Fans of remote work often cite studies showing that people who work from home are more productive, like a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/130/1/165/2337855" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2014 study</a> led by the Stanford professor Nicholas Bloom. The study examined remote workers at a Chinese travel agency and found that they were 13 percent more efficient than their office-based peers.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">But research also shows that what remote workers gain in productivity, they often miss in harder-to-measure benefits like creativity and innovative thinking. Studies have found that people working together in the same room tend to solve problems more quickly than remote collaborators, and that <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/11/when-working-from-home-doesnt-work/540660/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">team cohesion suffers</a> in remote work arrangements.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Remote workers also tend to take shorter breaks and fewer sick days than office-based ones, and in studies, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273761672_Work-Life_Balance_and_Working_from_Home" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">many report finding it hard </a>to separate their work from their home lives. That&#8217;s a good thing if you&#8217;re a boss looking to squeeze extra efficiency out of your employees, but less ideal if you&#8217;re someone trying to achieve some work-life balance.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Working in isolation can be lonely, which explains the popularity of co-working spaces like WeWork and The Wing. Even in Silicon Valley, where the tools that allow for remote work are being built, many companies are strict about requiring their workers to come into the office.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Steve Jobs, for one, was a famous opponent of remote work, believing that Apple employees&#8217; best work came from accidentally bumping into other people, not sitting at home in front of an email inbox.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">&#8220;Creativity comes from spontaneous meetings, from random discussions,&#8221; Mr. Jobs said. &#8220;You run into someone, you ask what they&#8217;re doing, you say &#8216;Wow,&#8217; and soon you&#8217;re cooking up all sorts of ideas.&#8221;</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">I&#8217;ll grant that office work has its downsides, even in healthy times. Commuting has been shown to make us less happy, and the open-plan office, a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/25/opinion/wework-adam-neumann.html" title="">truly cursed workplace design trend</a> that emphasizes airy spaces with rows of desks and little privacy, has made distraction-free focus nearly impossible.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">But being near other people also allows us to express our most human qualities, like empathy and collaboration. Those are the skills that can&#8217;t be automated. And they&#8217;re what produces the kind of meaningful interpersonal contact we miss out on when we&#8217;re stuck at home.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">&#8220;There&#8217;s an element of social interaction that&#8217;s really important,&#8221; said Laszlo Bock, the chief executive of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/31/technology/human-resources-artificial-intelligence-humu.html" title="">Humu</a>, a Silicon Valley human resources start-up.</p><section id="styln-faq-coronavirus" class="css-l08pwh interactive-content interactive-size-medium"><p class="g-inlineguide-headline-group">

                <h4>Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?</h4>
                <p>So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5">paper</a> published in April suggests that people are most infectious about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was &#8220;very rare,&#8221;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html#link-1f302e21">but she later walked back that statement.</a></p>

                <h4>What&#8217;s the risk of catching coronavirus from a surface?</h4>
                <p>Touching contaminated objects and then infecting ourselves with the germs is not typically how the virus spreads. But it can happen. A number <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.905.8444&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">of studies</a> of flu, rhinovirus, coronavirus and other microbes have shown that respiratory illnesses, including the new coronavirus, can spread by touching contaminated surfaces, particularly in places like day care centers, offices and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5519164/">hospitals</a>. But a long chain of events has to happen for the disease to spread that way. The best way to protect yourself from coronavirus &#8212; whether it&#8217;s surface transmission or close human contact &#8212; is still social distancing, washing your hands, not touching your face and wearing masks.</p>

                <p>The unemployment rate fell to 13.3 percent in May, the Labor Department said on June 5, an unexpected improvement in the nation&#8217;s job market as hiring rebounded faster than economists expected. Economists had forecast the unemployment rate to increase to as much as 20 percent, after it hit 14.7 percent in April, which was the highest since the government began keeping official statistics after World War II. But the unemployment rate dipped instead, with employers adding 2.5 million jobs, after more than 20 million jobs were lost in April.</p>

                <h4>Will protests set off a second viral wave of coronavirus? </h4>
                <p>Mass protests against police brutality that have brought thousands of people onto the streets in cities across America are raising the specter of new coronavirus outbreaks, prompting political leaders, physicians and public health experts to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/31/health/protests-coronavirus.html">warn that the crowds could cause a surge in cases.</a> While many political leaders affirmed the right of protesters to express themselves, they urged the demonstrators to wear face masks and maintain social distancing, both to protect themselves and to prevent further community spread of the virus. Some infectious disease experts were reassured by the fact that the protests were held outdoors, saying the open air settings could mitigate the risk of transmission.</p>

                <h4>How do we start exercising again without hurting ourselves after months of lockdown?</h4>
                <p>Exercise researchers and physicians have some blunt advice for those of us aiming to return to regular exercise now: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/well/move/coronavirus-exercise-lockdown-quarantine-sports-weights-running-injuries.html">Start slowly and then rev up your workouts, also slowly.</a> American adults tended to be about 12 percent less active after the stay-at-home mandates began in March than they were in January. But there are steps you can take to ease your way back into regular exercise safely. First, &#8220;start at no more than 50 percent of the exercise you were doing before Covid,&#8221; says Dr. Monica Rho, the chief of musculoskeletal medicine at the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab in Chicago. Thread in some preparatory squats, too, she advises. &#8220;When you haven&#8217;t been exercising, you lose muscle mass.&#8221; Expect some muscle twinges after these preliminary, post-lockdown sessions, especially a day or two later. But sudden or increasing pain during exercise is a clarion call to stop and return home.</p>

This means that more public spaces are available for use and more and more businesses are being allowed to open again. The federal government is largely leaving the decision up to states, and some state leaders are leaving the decision up to local authorities. Even if you aren&#8217;t being told to stay at home, it&#8217;s still a good idea to limit trips outside and your interaction with other people.</p>

                <h4>What are the symptoms of coronavirus?</h4>
                <p>Common symptoms <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html">include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath.</a> Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html">The C.D.C. has also</a> added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.</p>

If possible, choose a window seat. A <a href="http://emoryhealthdigest.emory.edu/issues/2018/spring/from_the_well/germs-on-a-plane/index.html">study from Emory University</a> found that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. (Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.)</p>

                <h4>How do I take my temperature?</h4>
                <p>Taking one&#8217;s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as &#8220;normal&#8221; temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don&#8217;t have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-temperature-fever-thermometer.html">other ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications.</a></p>

                <p>The C.D.C. has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/world/coronavirus-news-updates.html">recommended</a> that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/31/health/coronavirus-asymptomatic-transmission.html"> new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms</a>. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don&#8217;t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don&#8217;t replace hand washing and social distancing.</p>

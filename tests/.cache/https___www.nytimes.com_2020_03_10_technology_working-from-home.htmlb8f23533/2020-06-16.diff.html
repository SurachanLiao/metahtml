I don’t think we should ignore health guidelines and force people to work in an office during a pandemic. And I’m sympathetic to the millions of teachers, restaurant workers and other professionals for whom working from home has never been a viable option.</ins></p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0"><ins>But for those of us lucky enough to be able to work from home, coronavirus or no, a few words of caution are in order.</ins></p> <p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Fans of remote work often cite studies showing that people who work from home are more productive, like a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/130/1/165/2337855" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2014 study</a> led by the Stanford professor Nicholas Bloom. The study examined remote workers at a Chinese travel agency and found that they were 13 percent more efficient than their office-based peers.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">But research also shows that what remote workers gain in productivity, they often miss in harder-to-measure benefits like creativity and innovative thinking. Studies have found that people working together in the same room tend to solve problems more quickly than remote collaborators, and that <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/11/when-working-from-home-doesnt-work/540660/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">team cohesion suffers</a> in remote work arrangements.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Remote workers also tend to take shorter breaks and fewer sick days than office-based ones, and in studies, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273761672_Work-Life_Balance_and_Working_from_Home" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">many report finding it hard </a>to separate their work from their home lives. That’s a good thing if you’re a boss looking to squeeze extra efficiency out of your employees, but less ideal if you’re someone trying to achieve some work-life balance.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Working in isolation can be lonely, which explains the popularity of co-working spaces like WeWork and The Wing. Even in Silicon Valley, where the tools that allow for remote work are being built, many companies are strict about requiring their workers to come into the office.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Steve Jobs, for one, was a famous opponent of remote work, believing that Apple employees’ best work came from accidentally bumping into other people, not sitting at home in front of an email inbox.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">“Creativity comes from spontaneous meetings, from random discussions,” Mr. Jobs said. “You run into someone, you ask what they’re doing, you say ‘Wow,’ and soon you’re cooking up all sorts of ideas.”</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">I’ll grant that office work has its downsides, even in healthy times. Commuting has been shown to make us less happy, and the open-plan office, a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/25/opinion/wework-adam-neumann.html" title="">truly cursed workplace design trend</a> that emphasizes airy spaces with rows of desks and little privacy, has made distraction-free focus nearly impossible.</p> <p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0"><ins>But being near other people also allows us to express our most human qualities, like empathy and collaboration.

But there are steps you can take to ease your way back into regular exercise safely. First, “start at no more than 50 percent of the exercise you were doing before Covid,” says Dr. Monica Rho, the chief of musculoskeletal medicine at the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab in Chicago. Thread in some preparatory squats, too, she advises. “When you haven’t been exercising, you lose muscle mass.” Expect some muscle twinges after these preliminary, post-lockdown sessions, especially a day or two later. But sudden or increasing pain during exercise is a clarion call to stop and return home.</ins></p><ins> </ins></li><ins> </ins></ul><ins> </ins><ul class="g-inlineguide-item-list g-inlineguide-list-circle" id="g-inlineguide-item-list"><li><h4><ins>My state is reopening.

Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too.

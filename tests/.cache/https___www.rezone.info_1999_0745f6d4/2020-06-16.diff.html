"In fact, not only is there no seven-headed dragon, but there appears to be no evidence of dragons of any sort, seven-headed or not, in the East or anywhere else." … <a href="https://www.rezone.info/1999/12/no-seven-headed-dragon-rising-in-east/" class="more-link">[Read more...] <span class="screen-reader-text">about No Seven-Headed Dragon Rising In East</span> Link: https://www.rezone.info/1999/12/no-seven-headed-dragon-rising-in-east/ </a></ins></p></article><article class="post-31207107 post type-post status-publish format-standard entry"><p><ins>Sagittarius | Nov. 22 to Dec. 21 You are a melding of light and shadow, sunset and dawn, a multitude of wonders fused in mortal flesh.

I suspect that my chin-up bar could be contributing to a phallocentric and possibly misogynist environment. And I wouldn't want a woman to spend too much time in the trophy room—women don't like taxidermy. Furthermore, the makeshift workshop in the bathroom could be "othering," as could the giant strap-on six-D-battery razorcock above the fireplace.

It's getting real hot in here." Not making a motion that ordinary business be suspended so that window openage may be discussed and debated, mind you. He was simply calling for an open window! "Are we barbarians who chew raw meat with our mouths open?" I wondered to myself. And to make matters worse, the chair neglected to correct the offender by citing the proper point of order.

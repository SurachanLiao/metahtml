Floyd was a Black Minneapolis man who died after a white police officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck for almost eight minutes, ignoring the man's pleas that he was suffocating. In downtown Seattle, police struggled to disperse a crowd, leading Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan to enact a 5 p.m. curfew.

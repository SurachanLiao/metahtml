Daily NK, a Seoul-based specialty website, reported late Monday that Kim was recovering after undergoing the surgery on April 12.</p><p class=""> Just a day before, he hosted a meeting discussing coronavirus prevention as well as electing his sister as an alternate member of the political bureau of the Ruling Worker&#8217;s Party, according to the North&#8217;s Official Korean Central News Agency said. It was the last time Kim was seen in public.</p><p class="ad-caption-text align-center uppercase">Advertisement</p><p class=""> CNN also cited an unnamed U.S. official in a report on Monday claiming the White House was &#8220;monitoring intelligence&#8221; suggesting Kim&#8217;s life was in danger while a Bloomberg source said the North Korean leader&#8217;s health took a turn for the worse in recent days.</p><p class=""> Rumors have been swirling about Kim&#8217;s health since he missed the birthday celebration of his late grandfather and state founder Kim Il Sung on April 15, North Korea&#8217;s most important holiday. It&#8217;s not uncommon for speculation to follow a leader&#8217;s absences from important state events, especially given the secrecy clouding Kim and his health.</p><p class=""> In China, North Korea&#8217;s most major ally, an official with the Communist Party&#8217;s International Liaison Department, told Reuters it did not believe Kim was critically ill.</p><p class="crd--hd flex-container-row align-items-center"> <h2 class="fte-hd">Most Read</h2> </p><ul class="list-unstyled clln clln-vtl clln-crd "> <li class="clln--it flex-container-row align-items-start rcom--it clln-it-bdr-btm rcom-nydn">  <p class="recommender"> <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/ny-man-filmed-killing-hit-ahmaud-arbery-with-truck-investigator-says-20200604-s4kqlnf3rfee5o2nzt2da77hsi-story.html#nt=related-content"> Man who filmed Ahmaud Arbery killing hit him with truck before shooting, investigator says </a> </p>    </li> <li class="clln--it flex-container-row align-items-start rcom--it clln-it-bdr-btm rcom-nydn">  <p class="recommender"> <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/ny-ahmaud-arbery-murder-suspects-face-judge-in-court-hearing-20200604-bfskvsqpjzcmriaesetk4g3mbu-story.html#nt=related-content"> Suspect was overheard saying, &#8216;f---ing n----r,&#8217; after killing Ahmaud Arbery: investigator </a> </p>    </li> <li class="clln--it flex-container-row align-items-start rcom--it clln-it-bdr-btm lt-it rcom-nydn">  <p class="recommender"> <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/ny-huxley-stauffer-youtuber-adopted-son-investigation-20200603-b4vwrci62jeg3mzihfxlrzfngi-story.html#nt=related-content"> Cops looking for Huxley Stauffer, YouTuber&#8217;s adopted son whom she &#8216;rehomed&#8217; </a> </p>    </li> </ul><p class=""> Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Beijing was aware of reports about Kim&#8217;s health, but is not sure what the source of the rumors are.</p><p class=""> Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said his government was monitoring the situation.</p><p class="stop-here"> Kim took power upon his father&#8217;s death in December 2011 and is the third generation to rule the isolated and nuclear-armed country. In the event that Kim is sidelined amid health problems, a political upheaval seems unlikely given his sister&#8217;s current influence and standing within the government.</p><p class=""> The North Korean leader has met with President Trump on three occasions in 2018 and 2019 and has joined summits with other Asian leaders. Despite his pursuing of diplomacy in hopes of ending crippling economic sanctions, his decision to maintain a nuclear arsenal has left him in a stalemate with other world leaders.</p></section><section id="right-rail" class="right artcl--r--sect-tmpl right-rail guttered flex-container-column"><section class="col col-desktop-6 col-tablet-6 col-mobile-6"></section></section></main>

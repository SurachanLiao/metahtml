The Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations (SCVO) is the national membership organisation for the voluntary sector.

Along with our community of 2,240 members, we believe that charities, social enterprises and voluntary groups make Scotland a better place.

By joining SCVO you can become part of a movement that is dedicated to achieving the ambitions of Scotlandâ€™s voluntary sector.

SCVO membership also gives you access to vital support services that can help your group or organisation run smoothly.

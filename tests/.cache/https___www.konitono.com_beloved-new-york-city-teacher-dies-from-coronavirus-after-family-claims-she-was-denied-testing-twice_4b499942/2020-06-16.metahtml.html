Rana Zoe Mungin, 30, was denied access to a coronavirus test two times before eventually being diagnosed, according to her family, who believes race played a role in the care she received.&#160; Mungin&#8217;s six-week battle with coronavirus was chronicled on social media by her sister Mia Mungin, who is a registered nurse. She notified others about her sister&#8217;s death on Monday. &#8220;She fought a long fight but her body was to weak,&#8221; she tweeted.&#160; Mia Mungin told a local television station that her sister, who had asthma, went to Brookdale Hospital Medical Center&#160;twice after developing a fever and on both occasions she was sent home without getting tested. The first time, on March 15, she was given medicine for her headache and asthma, and the second time, on March 19, the hospital didn&#8217;t have enough testing kits, her sister said. She also took issue with an ambulance worker who transported her sister the second time to the hospital.&#160; &#8220;He insinuated she was having a panic attack. She kept saying, &#8216;I can&#8217;t breathe,&#8221; Mia Mungin told&#8230; <a href="/go?url=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2JzbmV3cy5jb20vbmV3cy9yYW5hLXpvZS1tdW5naW4tYnJvb2tseW4tdGVhY2hlci1jb3JvbmF2aXJ1cy1kaWVzLWRlbmllZC10ZXN0aW5nLw==" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Read full this story</a></p><blockquote class="wps-mine-source-information"> Beloved New York City teacher dies from coronavirus after family claims she was denied testing twice have 300 words, post on <a href="/go?url=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2JzbmV3cy5jb20vbmV3cy9yYW5hLXpvZS1tdW5naW4tYnJvb2tseW4tdGVhY2hlci1jb3JvbmF2aXJ1cy1kaWVzLWRlbmllZC10ZXN0aW5nLw==" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">www.cbsnews.com</a> at April 29, 2020.

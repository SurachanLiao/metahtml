					Supporting The Times of Israel isn&#226;&#128;&#153;t a transaction for an online service, like buying Netflix. Our Community is for people like you who care about a common good: ensuring that balanced, independent coverage of Israel and the Jewish world continues to be available to millions across the world, for free.
				</p><p>Israel becomes stronger from your support - as does the global Jewish community and its friends, who rely on ToI for accurate, timely updates and enriching insights. The Times of Israel is a 24/7 act of Zionism.</p><p>Your contribution does entitle you to an  ad-free experience  on the site and to exclusive content shared only with the ToI Community, like private sessions held weekly with our journalists. But what you really get for as little as $6 per month is the pride of partnership in advancing Israel&#226;&#128;&#153;s standing, its democracy, and the education of millions.</p><p>Our editorial team is, of course, fallible - we make mistakes. But we&#226;&#128;&#153;re trying - trying to report Israel fairly, and trying, in our analysis and op-eds, to encourage and bolster the best Israel we can. We&#226;&#128;&#153;re trying to accurately report what&#226;&#128;&#153;s going on and not sensationalize, and to curate our homepage so that what matters most is prominent.</p><p>So please support our work today by becoming a member of The Times of Israel Community - not only for yourself, but also for the health and resilience of Israel and the Jewish world.</p><p class="crm-bottom-popup__content_italic">* The AD-FREE experience is available for signed-in Community members, on The Times of Israel website on desktop and mobile, and in the iOS and Android apps. Minimal advertising will continue to display on The Times of Israel newsletters.</p></div>

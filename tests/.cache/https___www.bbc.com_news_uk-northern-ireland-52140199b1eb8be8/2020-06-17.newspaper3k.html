                    Ollie Grant's family is missing weekly home care visits

Riona said it felt as if their "security network" had been taken away.</p><p>"You are never out of the woods with Ollie, but with all of the amazing support of the NHS we have learned to cope," she said. </p><p>"We miss the security of them coming to the house to look after him."</p><p>Riona urged people to continue to stay at home to support the NHS workers and protect children like Ollie.</p><p>"There is no cure for Ollie and if he was to catch it [Covid-19] he would not survive," she said.</p><p>Damien said they now "walked a tightrope" of assessing when it was worth the risk of bringing Ollie to hospital.</p><p>"We have to decide what is the greater risk when his oxygen levels are low - taking him to a doctor or trying to deal with it ourselves."</p><p>Damien said Ollie must attend his next hospital appointment in mid-April, which is categorised as urgent.</p><p>"The thought of bringing him to hospital, an area with a concentration of people who may be affected, is terrifying but we don't have a choice," he said.</p><p>A South Eastern Health Trust  spokesperson confirmed there were not as many direct health care visits due to the virus, although telephone support was available. </p><p>Services were still available to respond to urgent and high risk issues or for families struggling to cope, the spokesperson added.</p>

It's frightening for the children as well," said Nicola.</p><p>"I miss the support - talking to other mums in the waiting room can be a lifeline."</p><p>Nicola said she was always anxious attending clinics, but said it was now more frightening to take "an extremely vulnerable child into a hospital". </p><p>She said there had been a wider emotional toll on Austin as other support was scaled back due to the crisis.</p><p>He was devastated by the cancellation of a residential scheme at Daisy Lodge in Newcastle run by the Cancer Fund for Children, she said.</p><p>"The first residential helped him find his courage - it was the first in a long time I saw him be a 12-year-old boy again," she said. </p><p>"When we told him it couldn't happen he broke his heart."</p><p>Nicola said Daisy Lodge brought the children together virtually instead.</p><p>"To hear him laughing online with the rest of them at home was brilliant," she said.</p><p>"Families with children with cancer feel isolated enough, the pandemic is making it so much more difficult."</p>

<p>When Ollie Grant survived an earlier strain of coronavirus as a newborn, his parents said it was "a miracle".</p><p>Ollie, now aged one, has incurable congenital heart disease, which makes him vulnerable to even minor illness.</p><p>After contracting a coronavirus - different to the one behind the current epidemic - he had a stroke and was airlifted to Birmingham hospital.</p><p>Ollie's parents said their son would not be alive without the NHS.</p><p>Now the are struggling to adapt to looking after him at home without their usual extensive NHS support.</p><p>Damien and Riona Grant, from Kilcoo, County Down, said physiotherapists, community nurses, speech and language and occupational therapists used to call weekly to their home to help care for Ollie.</p><p>They said that was no longer possible due to the risk of infection. Riona said it felt as if their "security network" had been taken away.</p><p>"You are never out of the woods with Ollie, but with all of the amazing support of the NHS we have learned to cope," she said. </p><p>"We miss the security of them coming to the house to look after him."</p><p>Riona urged people to continue to stay at home to support the NHS workers and protect children like Ollie.</p><p>"There is no cure for Ollie and if he was to catch it [Covid-19] he would not survive," she said.</p><p>Damien said they now "walked a tightrope" of assessing when it was worth the risk of bringing Ollie to hospital.</p><p>"We have to decide what is the greater risk when his oxygen levels are low - taking him to a doctor or trying to deal with it ourselves."</p><p>Damien said Ollie must attend his next hospital appointment in mid-April, which is categorised as urgent.</p><p>"The thought of bringing him to hospital, an area with a concentration of people who may be affected, is terrifying but we don't have a choice," he said.</p><p>A South Eastern Health Trust  spokesperson confirmed there were not as many direct health care visits due to the virus, although telephone support was available. </p><p>Services were still available to respond to urgent and high risk issues or for families struggling to cope, the spokesperson added.</p><p>'Other mums are a lifeline'</p><p>Nicola Rothwell's son Austin, 12, was diagnosed with leukaemia in 2018.</p><p>Austin was in intensive care for three months and spent a year learning to walk again.</p><p>He now attends regular clinics at the Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast, for maintenance cancer treatment.</p><p>Nicola, from Belfast, said the clinics were now done as remotely as possible, which was "stressful, scary but necessary".</p><p>She said they were now allocated a slot by text message and advised to wait in the car park until they received another message to come inside.</p><p>Austin's blood results are also delivered by text.</p><p>"I always had access to a consultant, which was reassuring, but now the only person Austin sees is the person who takes his blood. It's frightening for the children as well," said Nicola.</p><p>"I miss the support - talking to other mums in the waiting room can be a lifeline."</p><p>Nicola said she was always anxious attending clinics, but said it was now more frightening to take "an extremely vulnerable child into a hospital". </p><p>She said there had been a wider emotional toll on Austin as other support was scaled back due to the crisis.</p><p>He was devastated by the cancellation of a residential scheme at Daisy Lodge in Newcastle run by the Cancer Fund for Children, she said.</p><p>"The first residential helped him find his courage - it was the first in a long time I saw him be a 12-year-old boy again," she said. </p><p>"When we told him it couldn't happen he broke his heart."</p><p>Nicola said Daisy Lodge brought the children together virtually instead.</p><p>"To hear him laughing online with the rest of them at home was brilliant," she said.</p><p>"Families with children with cancer feel isolated enough, the pandemic is making it so much more difficult."</p><h2 class="story-body__crosshead">'It will happen when it happens'</h2><p>David Hall was diagnosed with kidney cancer a week after his wedding in 2013.</p><p>He had six years of dialysis before having a double kidney transplant in February 2019.</p><p>David said the NHS had saved his life on more than one occasion and is now waiting for parathyroid surgery because of side effects of long-term kidney dialysis.</p><p>He said he had been advised his operation, which is classed as elective surgery, should be carried out "sooner rather than later".</p><p>But due to coronavirus, he said "there was uncertainty around whether it was going to happen and when".</p><p>David is one of 40,000 vulnerable patients in Northern Ireland who received letters from their doctors this week advising them to self-isolate for 12 weeks.</p><p>He said the main issues for waiting for surgery while waiting were "bone pain and potential fractures".</p><p>"An ongoing issue would be possible damage to the two transplanted kidneys - having two kidneys transplanted is rare," he added.</p><p>David said he had overcome so many hurdles since his diagnosis in 2013 that he was unperturbed by potential delays.</p><p>"There's no point in worrying about it, it will happen when it happens," he said.</p>

Recently, Parineeti Chopra took to her Instagram to share an informative post related to the coronavirus scare. She penned down a note to thank the doctors and other medical staff around the world who are risking their lives to save people.''While all of us have the ''luxury'' to be house arrested and waiting for news- please spare a thought for the doctors and the medical staff around the world who are risking their lives, away from their families, to save us! Exactly like our soldiers to at a war. Thank you guys, we will NEVER, EVER be able to repay you", she wrote.

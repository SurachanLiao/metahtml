He does not possess the requisite intellect and does <a href="https://www.spiegel.de/international/world/clinton-campaign-chair-john-podesta-on-president-trump-a-1146317.html">not understand the significance of the office he holds Link: https://www.spiegel.de/international/world/clinton-campaign-chair-john-podesta-on-president-trump-a-1146317.html </a> nor the tasks associated with it. He doesn't read. He doesn't bother to peruse important files and intelligence reports and knows little about the issues that he has identified as his priorities. His decisions are capricious and they are delivered in the form of tyrannical decrees.He is a man free of morals. As has been demonstrated hundreds of times, he is a liar, a racist and a cheat. I feel ashamed to use these words, as sharp and loud as they are. But if they apply to anyone, they apply to <a href="https://www.spiegel.de/thema/donald_trump_en/">Trump Link: https://www.spiegel.de/thema/donald_trump_en/ </a>. And one of the media's tasks is to continue telling things as they are: Trump has to</ins> </p></a></p> <del>into a laughing stock and he is a danger to the world. He must</del> be removed from the White <ins>House. Quickly. He is a danger to the world.</ins><p><ins>Trump is a miserable politician. He fired the FBI director simply because he could. James Comey had gotten under his skin with his investigation into Trump's confidants. Comey had also refused to swear loyalty and fealty to Trump and to abandon the investigation. He had to go.</ins></p><p><ins>Witnessing an American Tragedy
</ins></p><p><ins>Trump is also a miserable boss. His people invent excuses for him and lie on his behalf because they have to, but then Trump wakes up and posts tweets that contradict what they have said. He doesn't care that his spokesman, his secretary of state and his national security adviser had just denied that the president had handed Russia (of all countries) sensitive intelligence gleaned from Israel (of all countries). Trump tweeted: Yes, yes, I did, because I can. I'm president after all.</ins></p><p><ins>Nothing is as it should be in this White House. Everyone working there has been compromised multiple times and now they all despise each other - and everyone except for Trump despises Trump. Because of all that, after just 120 days of the Trump administration, we are witness to an American tragedy for which there are five theoretical solutions.</ins></p><p><ins>The first is Trump's resignation, which won't happen. The second is that Republicans in the House and Senate support impeachment, which would be justified by the president's proven obstruction of justice, but won't happen because of the Republicans' thirst for power, which they won't willingly give up. The third possible solution is the invocation of the 25th Amendment, which would require the cabinet to declare Trump unfit to discharge the powers of the presidency. That isn't particularly likely either. Fourth: The Democrats get ready to fight and win back majorities in the House and Senate in midterm elections, which are 18 months away, before they then pursue option two, impeachment. Fifth: the international community wakes up and finds a way to circumvent the White House and free itself of its dependence on the U.S. Unlike the preceding four options, the fifth doesn't directly solve the Trump problem, but it is nevertheless necessary - and possible.</ins></p><p><ins>No Goals and No Strategy

The country is, as David Brooks wrote recently in <a href="https://www.spiegel.de/international/business/trump-and-the-new-york-times-a-love-hate-relationship-a-1145096.html">the New York Times Link: https://www.spiegel.de/international/business/trump-and-the-new-york-times-a-love-hate-relationship-a-1145096.html </a>, dependent on a child. The Trump administration has no foreign policy because Trump has consistently promised American withdrawal while invoking America's strength. He has promised both no wars and more wars. He makes decisions according to his mood, with no strategic coherence or tactical logic. Moscow and Beijing are laughing at America. Elsewhere, people are worried.</ins></p><p><ins>In the Pacific, warships - American and Chinese - circle each other in close proximity. The conflict with North Korea is escalating. Who can be certain that Donald Trump won't risk nuclear war simply to save his own skin? Efforts to stop climate change are in trouble and many expect the U.S. to withdraw from the Paris Agreement because Trump is wary of legally binding measures. Crises, including those in Syria and Libya, are escalating, but no longer being discussed. And who should they be discussed with? Phone calls and emails to the U.S. State Department go unanswered. Nothing is regulated, nothing is stable and the <a href="https://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/angela-merkel-hits-her-stride-as-german-campaign-begins-a-1146307.html">trans-Atlantic relationship Link: https://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/angela-merkel-hits-her-stride-as-german-campaign-begins-a-1146307.html </a> hardly exists anymore. German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel and Bundestag Foreign Affairs Committee Chair Norbert RÃ¶ttgen fly back and forth, but Germany and the U.S. no longer understand each other. Hardly any real communication takes place, there are no joint foreign policy goals and there is no strategy.</ins></p><p><ins>In "Game of Thrones," the Mad King was murdered (and the child that later took his place was no better). In real life, an immature boy sits on the throne of the most important country in the world. He could, at any time, issue a catastrophic order that would immediately be carried out. That is why the parents cannot afford to take their eyes off him even for a second. They cannot succumb to exhaustion because he is so taxing. They ultimately have to send him to his room - and return power to the grownups.</ins></p> </section></article> <del>House before things get even worse.

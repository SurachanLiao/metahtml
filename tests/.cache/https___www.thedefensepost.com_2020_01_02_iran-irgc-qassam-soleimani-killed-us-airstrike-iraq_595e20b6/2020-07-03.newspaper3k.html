<div><p>Qassam Soleimani, commander of Iran&#8217;s elite Quds Force and the general responsible for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps clandestine operations in the region, was killed in a U.S. airstrike in Iraq early on Friday, January 3.</p>
<p>Iranian state TV first&#160;<a href="https://twitter.com/FaghihiRohollah/status/1212926025077862401" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">confirmed</a> that General Soleimani was killed in the strike on his convoy at Baghdad international airport, which also killed Abul Mahdi al-Muhandis, leader of the powerful Hashd al-Shaabi militia Kataib Hezbollah.</p>
<p>A U.S. Department of Defense statement said President Donald Trump ordered the strike to kill Solemani, who it was &#8220;actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region.&#8221;</p>
<p>The strike was &#8220;aimed at deterring future Iranian attack plans,&#8221; the Pentagon said, accusing Soleimani of approving an <a href="https://www.thedefensepost.com/2019/12/31/us-embassy-iraq-protest-kataib-hezbollah/">attack on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad</a> earlier this week and of <a href="https://www.thedefensepost.com/2019/12/12/iraq-rockets-baghdad-base/">&#8220;orchestrating&#8221; missile strikes on Iraqi bases housing the U.S.-led Coalition against Islamic State</a>, including at the K1 base near Kirkuk last month that killed an American contractor and wounded Iraqi Security Forces and U.S. military personnel.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the Coalition could not immediately be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Demonstrations broke out at the embassy on December 30 in reaction to a series of <a href="https://www.thedefensepost.com/2019/12/29/us-airstrikes-kataib-hezbollah-pmu-iraq-syria/">U.S. strikes against Kataib Hezbollah forces in Iraq and Syria</a>. Protesters, including some carrying Kataib Hezbollah and other Hashd al-Shaabi flags, attempted to storm the embassy and set fires outside.</p>
<p>Muhandis, deputy and de facto commander of the Hashd, also called the Popular Mobilization Units, had <a href="https://www.thedefensepost.com/2019/12/30/iraq-pmu-muhandis-retaliate-kataib-hezbollah/">vowed revenge on the U.S. for the strikes</a>.</p>
<p>Many of the Hashd al-Shaabi militias were folded into the Iraqi Security Forces last year, but Kataib Hezbollah has maintained strong ties to Iran&#8217;s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. The Quds Force which 62-year-old Soleimani headed is the IRGC&#8217;s external arm, and the commander freely traveled around Iraq and Syria for years. The <a href="https://www.thedefensepost.com/2019/04/08/us-iran-irgc-foreign-terrorist-organization/">Trump administration designed the IRGC a foreign terrorist organization</a> in July.</p>
<p>IRGC General Mohsen Razaee <a href="https://twitter.com/ir_rezaee/status/1212929895803822081" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vowed</a> &#8220;revenge&#8221; on the U.S. for killing Soleimani.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a reason why previous administrations did not escalate to the level of assassinating Soleimani,&#8221; said Elizabeth Dent, a non-resident scholar Middle East Institute&#8217;s Countering Terrorism and Extremism program and former Special Assistant to the Special Presidential Envoy to the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS.</p>
<p>Dent warned of &#8220;tit for tat escalation,&#8221; and said, &#8220;I can&#8217;t imagine this ends well for anyone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Iraqi caretaker Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi&#160;called the killings of Soleimani and al-Muhandis a &#8220;dangerous escalation&#8221; and called for an emergency session of parliament. Mahdi had already advocated for a review of the U.S. military presence in Iraq following the weekend strikes.</p>
<h3>Iran&#8217;s clandestine operations in the Middle East</h3>
<p>As the head of the Quds Force, Soleimani was responsible for Iran&#8217;s proxies in the Middle East, including Lebanese Hezbollah as well as pro-Iran militias who fought on behalf of President Bashar al-Assad&#8217;s regime in Syria. The IRGC has been accused of&#160;<a href="https://www.thedefensepost.com/2019/06/14/us-accuses-iran-tanker-attacks-gulf-oman/">giving advanced military technology that&#160;Yemen&#8217;s Houthi rebels</a> use to attack Saudi Arabia, and of orchestrating attacks against America&#8217;s Gulf allies in the region.</p>

<p>Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei declared three days of public mourning and swore vengeance against the &#8220;criminals&#8221; behind Soleimani&#8217;s death.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Javad Zarif <a href="https://twitter.com/JZarif/status/1212946202280579073" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> that the strike was &#8220;extremely dangerous &amp; a foolish escalation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The U.S. bears responsibility for all consequences of its rogue adventurism,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Earlier this week the Pentagon deployed Marines to Iraq in response to the embassy attack and sent additional <a href="https://twitter.com/82ndABNDiv/status/1212933376459583490" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">forces</a> to the region.</p>
<p>82nd Airborne Division troops arrived in Kuwait on Thursday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Their deployment in support of U.S. Central Command is a precautionary action taken to respond to increased threat levels against U.S. personnel and facilities,&#8221; the 82nd Airborne Division said.</p>

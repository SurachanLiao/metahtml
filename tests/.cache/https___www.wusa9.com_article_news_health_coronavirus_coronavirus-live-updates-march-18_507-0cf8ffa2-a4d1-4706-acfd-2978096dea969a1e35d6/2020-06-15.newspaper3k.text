Tucker Carlson says he felt obligation to meet with Trump on virus

Fox News Channel's Tucker Carlson says he felt a moral obligation to meet with President Donald Trump to warn him about the seriousness of coronavirus. He told Vanity Fair that while he didn't feel it was his role, his wife convinced him to request the meeting, which took place March 7. Two nights later, Carlson issued a blunt warning on Fox about the coming pandemic.

It speaks to both Fox News' influence with the president and his supporters that a cable news host was able to request and receive a meeting with him.

Avenatti cites coronavirus threat in seeking jail release

Michael Avenatti wants out of a New York federal lockup. He told a California judge Wednesday that a recent bout with pneumonia and filthy Manhattan jail conditions make him vulnerable to the coronavirus.

Avenatti's lawyer, H. Dean Steward, wrote in a submission in Los Angeles federal court that Avenatti had pneumonia six months ago. He also says the client who gained fame representing porn star Stormy Daniels had a cellmate recently with flu-like symptoms.

Avenatti awaits sentencing in June after he was convicted of trying to extort $25 million from sportswear giant Nike. He also faces criminal trials in New York next month and Los Angeles in May.

Wuhan reports no new cases of infection

China's health ministry says the virus epicenter of Wuhan and its surrounding Hubei province have reported no new cases.

The ministry said Thursday that results over the past 24 hours showed 34 new cases, all detected in people arriving from abroad.

Eight new deaths were reported, all in Wuhan.

Wuhan at the peak reported thousands of new cases of coronavirus infection daily, overwhelming its health care system.

Of those new cases of infection, 21 were in Beijing, nine in the southern manufacturing powerhouse of Guangdong, two in Shanghai and one each in coastal Zhejiang and Heilongjing in the far northeast.

China has only just begun loosening draconian travel restrictions within the country, but has stepped-up 14-day quarantine regulations on those arriving in Beijing, Shanghai and elsewhere from overseas, amid expectations of a new influx of students and others returning home.

China has now recorded a total of 80,928 confirmed virus cases with 3,245 deaths. Another 70,420 people have been released from hospital and 7,263 remain in treatment.

Trump signs relief package

President Donald Trump has signed a second coronavirus relief package, while Congress eyes a larger economic stimulus.

The Senate had overwhelmingly passed the measure to provide sick leave to workers who contract COVID-19. It'll also make diagnostic tests for the virus free.

The Pentagon's role in responding to the coronavirus outbreak in the United States is rapidly expanding, with the likely deployment of Navy hospital ships and Army field hospitals.

But the military faces limits. Its health care system is geared more toward handling combat casualties than infectious diseases. And there are logistical and legal concerns about expanding the military’s role in civilian affairs, such as tasking it with enforcing quarantines.

The winner will face Democratic U.S. Sen. Doug Jones in November.

Trump dubs COVID-19 'Chinese virus' despite hate crime risks

President Donald Trump says it's not racist to call COVID-19 the “Chinese virus" to emphasize where the pandemic started. Yet ever since infections started appearing in the United States, Asian Americans have shared stories of minor aggression to blatant attacks from people blaming them for the virus that has swept the world.

Trump says he's just being accurate and thinks Asian Americans would agree that the virus started in China.

John Yang, with the group Asian Americans Advancing Justice, says the remark amounts to racial stereotyping. He says Asians are not genetically prone to transmit the virus and says nicknames like “kung-flu” are not funny.

First congress member tests positive for COVID-19

Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart tested positive for the new coronavirus.

The Florida representative tweeted on Wednesday claiming he was positive for the virus. He decided to self-quarantine in Washington D.C. after votes on Friday, March 13. In the tweet, the congress member said he started to show symptoms, like a fever and headache, on Saturday.

"I'm feeling much better. However, it's important that everyone take this seriously and follow CDC guidelines in order to avoid getting sick & mitigate the spread of this virus. We must continue to work together to emerge stronger as a country during these trying times," he said.

The congress member has been working remotely from his Washington D.C. apartment.

Senate passes second coronavirus response bill

Trump announced he'll invoke emergency powers to marshal critical medical supplies against a pandemic threatening to overwhelm hospitals and other treatment centers. Trump took a series of extraordinary steps to steady the country. Congress is considering his broad economic rescue package.

Study finds very young children can become seriously ill by new coronavirus

A New York Times report citing the journal Pediatrics, says that though children account for the smallest percentage of infections, a portion of them could experience very strong symptoms.

About half in the study of 2,000 children in China had mild symptoms, but about 6 percent developed a very serious illness with dire respirator problems. Dr. Srinivas Murthy, an associate professor of pediatrics at the University of British Columbia (who was not involved in the study, but quoted in the New York Times) said, “effectively, what this tells us is that hospitals should prepare for some pediatric patients because we can’t rule out children altogether.”

Shilu Tong, the study’s senior author, believes that because young children have rapidly developing respiratory systems, they are more susceptible to infection, the Times reported.

Johns Hopkins University says the total number of confirmed cases of the new coronavirus worldwide has surpassed 200,000.

The Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering's online tally showed 201,436 cumulative cases by 6:13 a.m. EDT on Wednesday, with 82,032 listed as recovered.

The majority of people who have the new coronavirus, which causes the disease known as COVID-19, will get better without any long-term effects, according to an Oregon doctor.

About 80% of cases tend to be mild. In these cases, symptoms diminish over five to seven days, although people are still capable of transmitting the disease. But there are many people with a higher risk of having a more severe disease if they are diagnosed with coronavirus, including those with heart disease, diabetes, asthma and other vascular disease problems. Also, most children who get it have mild symptoms.

UN: Pandemic could cause 25 million job losses

The U.N.’s International Labor Organization estimates that fallout from the new coronavirus outbreak could cause nearly 25 million job losses and drain up to $3.4 trillion worth of income by the end of this year.

The Geneva-based agency said “an internationally coordinated policy response” could help mitigate such losses through worker protections, fiscal stimulus, and support for jobs and wages,

ILO laid out a number of scenarios on the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, estimating an increase in worldwide unemployment of between 5.3 million and 24.7 million people. That’s on top of the estimated 188 million that the agency had predicted late last year in its annual forecast.

The agency noted the global financial crisis boosted global unemployment by 22 million people.

“Falls in employment also mean large income losses for workers,” ILO said as it presented its preliminary assessment.

Adding to the many delays and closures in the entertainment world, the Daytime Emmy Awards have been cancelled due to the coronavirus crisis.

‘Given our concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic, we have decided that we will not be staging the 47th Annual Daytime Emmy Awards in Pasadena this coming June,’ the NATAS chairman Terry O’Reilly has announced.

‘As there are so many unknowns right now with the flow of information changing on a daily, almost hourly, basis, it would simply be irresponsible to move forward with our annual celebration of excellence in daytime television at this time.’

Adhering to social distancing advice, the ceremony will not go ahead but the awards will still be given out.

‘Judging continues, and we look forward to announcing our incredibly talented nominees later this spring,’ Daytime Emmy Awards executive director Brent Stanton has said.

‘We are working on some interesting alternative ideas for how to best recognise the honorees later this year and will share more details in the weeks ahead.’

‘These were extremely difficult decisions to make, but at the end of the day the health and safety of our event attendees and staff must remain our paramount concern,’ NATAS president and CEO Adam Sharp has said.

What do we reckon – acceptance speeches via Skype? Conference call presenting? All will be revealed.

The Daytime Emmys aren’t the first awards ceremony to be affected by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Cannes Film Festival has been postponed from late May to the end of June or beginning of July.

Major film releases such as the latest James Bond offering No Time To Die, Mulan and A Quiet Place II have also been pushed back, and the West End theatre district in London and Broadway in New York have also gone dark.

However, new movies such as The Invisible Man and Birds of Prey will now be available to watch digitally following the closure of cinemas nationwide.

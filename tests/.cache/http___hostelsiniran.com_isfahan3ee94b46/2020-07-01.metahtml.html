    <h1 class="mytitle">Isfahan</h1>
        <p align="left">With a population of 1.7 million people 
and as the third 
populous city in Iran, <a href="http://hostelsiniran.com/isfahan">Isfahan</a> is the most touristic city in this country. There 
are so many attractions in Isfahan that most of the 
tourists who travel to this city extend their stay further than what they have already planned. Isfahan is 
located 450 km south of Tehran and with its magnificent religious and 
non-religious buildings, is a perfect epitome of the fusion of the 
Islamic and ancient Persian architecture. The symmetric shape of the enchanting buildings 
in Isfahan reminds one of that of the most beautiful building in the world,  
Taj Mahal, whose architects were also Persian. Isfahan&#8217;s sights are a living 
museum of traditional culture ranging from the 
 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoroastrianism">Zoroastrian</a> Persia 6000 years ago 
until the present time. The city&#8217;s main square, 
<a href="http://hostelsiniran.com/isfahan/tourist-attractions/naghsh-e-jahan-square">Naghsh-e Jahan Square</a> is one of 
the largest city squares in the world and has been enlisted by UNESCO as a World 
Heritage Site.

<h2 align="left">Isfahan; Half of the World</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">There is a common saying in Iran about Isfahan, it says &#8220;Isfahan 
Nesf-e Jahan&#8221; which literally means Isfahan is half of the world. And when 
you come to think about it, you&#8217;ll see that the city deserves the praise quite 
well; during its rich history, Isfahan has been the capital of the glorious 
Persian Empire twice and Shahs of the time tried their best to make it look like 
the capital of Persia that was known for its advanced sciences, culture and art. 
Another factor that contributed to the prosperity of the ancient city of Isfahan 
was that this city was located at the intersection of major east-west and 
north-south routes of the Empire.&#160; </p>
 
<h2 align="left">Isfahan's History</h2>
<p align="left">Archeological studies in Isfahan show that the 
earliest forms of human life in this city date back to the Stone Age in Iran in
800,000 - 200,000 BCE. But the settlement took the 
form of a town during the time of Elamite Period. Aside from its central location, the fertile soil around 
the once mighty  
Zayanderud River 
accelerated the growth of the town. Furthermore, due to the religious tolerance 
shown by the Persian Kings during the time of Achaemenid (648&#8211;330 BCE) 
and Sassanid (226 &#8211; 652 CE) Dynasties, many Jews fled from their cruel 
rulers and took refuge in Isfahan. And this explains for Isfahanis&#8217; knack 
for making money. After the invasion of the Arabs and the fall of Isfahan in 642 CE, 
Isfahan continued to prosper especially during the time of the Safavid Dynasty 
under Shah Abbas the Great 
who moved the capital of the empire from 
<a href="http://hostelsiniran.com/qazvin">Qazvin</a> to Isfahan in 
1598.

Isfahan Today</h2>
<p align="left">To say nothing of the city&#8217;s artistic talents for producing handcrafts like 
carpets, textile, and metal ware, the city boasts its advanced metallurgy-related 
industry, and nuclear enrichment facilities. An international airport and the 
city&#8217;s metro are also being constructed but at a very slow rate.</p>
<h2 align="left">
How to Go to Isfahan?</h2>
<p align="left">There is a major bus terminal in the south of Tehran called 
South Bus 
Terminal or Termnal-e Jonub 
where there are frequent <a href="http://irantts.com">Iran VIP buses</a> leaving for Isfahan.</p>

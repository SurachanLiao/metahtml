Hovering like a ghoulish spectre over the fates of two women is a length of rope.

If found guilty of murdering the estranged half-brother of North Korean despot Kim Jong Un, the pair will surely swing in the Malaysian breeze.

But that prospect may be an executioner’s pipe dream.

Last week, Malaysian prosecutors wrapped up their case against Indonesia’s Siti Aisyah, 25, and Vietnam’s Doan Thi Huong, 29.

The ditzy duo were busted for the brazen assassination of Kim Jong Nam at Kuala Lumpur’s busy airport on Feb. 13, 2017.

Aisyah and Huang are accused of smearing VX nerve agent on Kim’s face at the behest of North Korean intelligence operatives who fled Malaysia.

The two party girls have pleaded not guilty, claiming they believed they were taking part in a reality TV prank.

Their murder trial began last fall and has been punctuated by protracted breaks. The prosecution interviewed 34 witnesses and closing arguments begin on June 27.

Bizarrely, in Malaysia after closing arguments, the judge decides whether there is a strong enough case against the hard-partying pair. If there isn’t, they walk.

But if he decides he’s heard enough, they will then be called to make their defence.

Part of the problem for the prosecution is proving Aisyah and Huang intended to kill Kim or if they were merely scapegoats.

What’s been printed about the women’s selfie-satisfying lifestyles, the latter argument is increasingly holding more water.

So far, the defence believes the prosecution’s case has one critical hole: Motive.

Why would two fame-seeking nightlife fixtures want to murder the exiled Kim Jong nam?

Neither wore gloves during the assassination and they didn’t get rid of their tainted clothes. In fact, they didn’t even attempt to escape or flee the crime scene.

Huong’s lawyer, Hisyam Teh Poh Teik, characterized the police investigation as sloppy and biased. He says the duo have been deprived of a fair trial.

“We are confident with the innocence of our client because that’s the truth,” Teh said.

But prosecutors say there are deep connections between the tippling twosome and North Korean intelligence.

“We believe we have a good case,” Iskandar Ahmad told reporters.

Intelligence sources believe Kim Jong Nam — who fell out of favour with the regime because of an ill-considered jaunt to Disneyland Tokyo — was considered a threat to his half-brother.

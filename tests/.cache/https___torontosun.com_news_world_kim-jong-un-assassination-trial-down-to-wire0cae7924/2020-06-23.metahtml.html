The prosecution interviewed 34 witnesses and closing arguments begin on June 27.</span></p><p><span>Bizarrely, in Malaysia after closing arguments, the judge decides whether there is a strong enough case against the hard-partying pair. If there isn&#8217;t, they walk.</span></p><p><span>But if he decides he&#8217;s heard enough, they will then be called to make their defence.</span></p><p><span>Part of the problem for the prosecution is proving Aisyah and Huang intended to kill Kim or if they were merely scapegoats.</span></p><p><span>What&#8217;s been printed about the women&#8217;s selfie-satisfying lifestyles, the latter argument is increasingly holding more water.</span></p><p><span>So far, the defence believes the prosecution&#8217;s case has one critical hole: Motive.</span></p><p><span>Why would two fame-seeking nightlife fixtures want to murder the exiled Kim Jong nam?</span></p><p><span>Neither wore gloves during the assassination and they didn&#8217;t get rid of their tainted clothes. In fact, they didn&#8217;t even attempt to escape or flee the crime scene.</span></p><p><span>Huong&#8217;s lawyer, Hisyam Teh Poh Teik, characterized the police investigation as sloppy and biased. He says the duo have been deprived of a fair trial.</span></p><p><span>&#8220;We are confident with the innocence of our client because that&#8217;s the truth,&#8221; Teh said.</span></p><p><span>But prosecutors say there are deep connections between the tippling twosome and North Korean intelligence.</span></p><p><span>&#8220;We believe we have a good case,&#8221; Iskandar Ahmad told reporters.</span></p><p><span>Intelligence sources believe Kim Jong Nam &#8212; who fell out of favour with the regime because of an ill-considered jaunt to Disneyland Tokyo &#8212; was considered a threat to his half-brother.</span></p></article>

<div><p>Hovering like a ghoulish spectre over the fates of two women is a length of rope.</p><p>If found guilty of murdering the estranged half-brother of North Korean despot Kim Jong Un, the pair will surely swing in the Malaysian breeze.</p><p>But that prospect may be an executioner&#8217;s pipe dream.</p><img src="https://postmediatorontosun.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/13x193_0e98_9-e1523217747416.jpg?quality=60&amp;strip=all&amp;w=640"> 

<p>Last week, Malaysian prosecutors wrapped up their case against Indonesia&#8217;s Siti Aisyah, 25, and Vietnam&#8217;s Doan Thi Huong, 29.</p><p>The ditzy duo were busted for the brazen assassination of Kim Jong Nam at Kuala Lumpur&#8217;s busy airport on Feb. 13, 2017.</p><p>Aisyah and Huang are accused of smearing VX nerve agent on Kim&#8217;s face at the behest of North Korean intelligence operatives who fled Malaysia.</p><img src="https://postmediatorontosun.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/kim-jong-nam-suspects-e1523217835555.jpg?quality=60&amp;strip=all&amp;w=640"> 

<p> The two party girls have pleaded not guilty, claiming they believed they were taking part in a reality TV prank.</p><p>Their murder trial began last fall and has been punctuated by protracted breaks. The prosecution interviewed 34 witnesses and closing arguments begin on June 27.</p><p>Bizarrely, in Malaysia after closing arguments, the judge decides whether there is a strong enough case against the hard-partying pair. If there isn&#8217;t, they walk.</p><p>But if he decides he&#8217;s heard enough, they will then be called to make their defence.</p><img src="https://postmediatorontosun.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/13x158_72bc_9-e1523217927867.jpg?quality=60&amp;strip=all&amp;w=640"> 

<p>Part of the problem for the prosecution is proving Aisyah and Huang intended to kill Kim or if they were merely scapegoats.</p><p>What&#8217;s been printed about the women&#8217;s selfie-satisfying lifestyles, the latter argument is increasingly holding more water.</p><p>So far, the defence believes the prosecution&#8217;s case has one critical hole: Motive.</p><p>Why would two fame-seeking nightlife fixtures want to murder the exiled Kim Jong nam?</p><img src="https://postmediatorontosun.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/kim2-e1523218000817.jpg?quality=60&amp;strip=all&amp;w=640"> 

<p>Neither wore gloves during the assassination and they didn&#8217;t get rid of their tainted clothes. In fact, they didn&#8217;t even attempt to escape or flee the crime scene.</p><p>Huong&#8217;s lawyer, Hisyam Teh Poh Teik, characterized the police investigation as sloppy and biased. He says the duo have been deprived of a fair trial.</p><p>&#8220;We are confident with the innocence of our client because that&#8217;s the truth,&#8221; Teh said.</p><img src="https://postmediatorontosun.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/kim3-e1523218084969.jpg?quality=60&amp;strip=all&amp;w=640"> 

<p>But prosecutors say there are deep connections between the tippling twosome and North Korean intelligence.</p><p>&#8220;We believe we have a good case,&#8221; Iskandar Ahmad told reporters.</p><p>Intelligence sources believe Kim Jong Nam &#8212; who fell out of favour with the regime because of an ill-considered jaunt to Disneyland Tokyo &#8212; was considered a threat to his half-brother.</p><p>&#160;</p>		</div>

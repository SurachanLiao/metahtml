A disease that can pass from an animal to a human is called a zoonotic disease. H7N9 rarely passes from one person to another. The H7N9 virus first appeared in March 2013 in China, and it has reappeared each winter and spring since then. Cases have also occurred in Taiwan, Malaysia, and Canada. A total of four epidemics have come and gone in China, and a fifth is under way. Up to April 5, 2017, H7N9 has infected 1,364 people altogether, including 566 people affected by the current seasonal epidemic. During the first four seasonal epidemics, 40 percent of patients with H7N9 died. In March 2017, an outbreak of H7N9 was reported in poultry in Tennessee, but the risk to the American public from this infection is considered to be &#8220;low.&#8221; H7N9 is an avian, or bird, flu virus. The virus normally affects poultry birds, but it has mutated so that it can affect humans too. Humans do not have immunity to these subtypes of flu virus, as they are continually evolving. This is why the infections they cause us can be severe and life-threatening.

The US-based aunt of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has launched legal action against three defectors, claiming they made defamatory statements about her.

Ko Yong Suk has filed the defamation suit through her lawyer in South Korea, Kang Yong-Seok, where the three defendants now live.

Mr Kang said the action relates to claims that Ms Ko managed a secret fund for Kim's late father, Kim Jong-Il, that her father collaborated during Japan's colonial rule over the Korean peninsula, and that she had plastic surgery after defecting to the US.

"The defectors made groundless remarks without really knowing about her life," her lawyer said.

"These defectors who often make appearances on TV are not in a position to know about her directly and what they are saying is not true.

"She and her husband find it very unpleasant."

Ms Ko, who sought asylum in the US in 1998, looked after Kim Jong-un for several years while he was at school in Switzerland.

She has accused the three defectors of "spreading false information" about her and her family.

It is not yet known whether Ms Ko will travel to Seoul for the court hearing.

She is seeking 60 million won (Â£34,000) in damages.

The lawsuit is unusual for North Korea's ruling family; relatives who have left the state usually shun the spotlight.

The three defectors named in the court documents include a former North Korean agent, the son-in-law of a former North Korean prime minister and an ex-diplomat.

One of the defendants, An Chan-il, who fled to South Korea in 1979 said he had merely repeated what had been reported in media, adding that he and one of the other defendants planned to file a counter-suit for libel.

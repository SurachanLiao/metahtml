      1 GEOGRAPHIC SETTING AND ENVIRONMENT
    </h2>
    

       
    
    <p>
      Iran is located in southwestern Asia. It covers an area of 1,648,000
      square kilometers (636,296 square miles), slightly larger than the state
      of Alaska. Iran is geologically unstable, and experiences periodic
      earthquakes. In 1978, a deadly earthquake struck eastern Iran, killing at
      least 25,000 people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Air and water pollution are significant problems in Iran. Twenty-five
      percent of the rural people do not have pure water.

      2 HISTORY AND FOOD
    </h2>
    <p>
      Since the beginning of human civilization in present-day Iran, a series of
      peoples has invaded and conquered the region, exposing the area to new
      customs, beliefs, ideas, and foods, as well as bringing Iranian customs
      and foods back to their own home countries. The ancient Babylonians,
      Assyrians, Persians, Greeks, Romans, and Turks are just a few of the
      groups that have had an influence on Iranian culture and its cuisine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Iranian cuisine is often referred to as "Persian." This is
      because, until 1934, Iran was known as Persia. The Persians are an ancient
      culture believed to have originated in central Asia as far back as 2000
      B.C. At one time, Persian territory stretched as far east as India. Curry
      (a spice) was adapted from the people of India and incorporated into the
      Persian (now Iranian) cuisine. Modern spicy curry stews demonstrate
      India's influence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Indians also adapted foods from the Persians. When the Moghuls invaded
      India in 1526, they brought with them ingredients from the Persian
      cuisine, which they highly admired. A northern Indian cuisine called 
      
        mughulai
      
       is modeled after what the Persians commonly ate: mounds of rice seasoned 
      </p> 
       with saffron, topped with nuts, raisins, and various meats. Dishes such
      as 
      
        kofta
      
       (KOFtah, meatballs) and 
      
        pilau
      
       (POO-lau) are now common to both Iranians and northern Indians.
    
    <p>
      Several of Iran's most prominent dishes originated from the Greeks,
      Arabs, Turks, and Russians. Greece invaded present-day Iran in the A.D.
      200s, introducing stuffed grape leaves. Yogurt may have originated from
      either Greece or Turkey, where it is also a dietary staple. The Iranian
      food rules that categorize foods into "hot or "cold"
      is believed to have been derived from ancient Greek theories of medicine
      (See 
      
        Mealtime Customs
      
      ). Dishes made of lamb, dates, and figs were brought into the Persian diet
      during the Arab invasion of the 600s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three hundred years later, the Turks expanded their Ottoman Empire into
      Persian territory. The idea of stuffing leaves, vines, fruits, and
      vegetables with various fillings (Turkish 
      
        dolma
      
      ) was reinforced by the Turks. 
      
        Dolma
      
       and 
      
        kofte
      
       (meatballs) have become very popular throughout the Middle Eastern
      countries. The 
      
        kebab
      
       (cubes of skewered meat) is probably the most important introduction by
      the Turks&#8212;it has become one of Iran's national dishes.
      Strong Turkish coffee was also introduced. Once a widely consumed Iranian
      beverage, it has now fallen behind the popularity of 
      
        ch&#226;y
      
       (tea). The strong, dark tea is brewed in an urn called a 
      
        samovar
      
      , a Russian word. Tea most likely originated in Russia.

            Grape leaves are sold in jars at most large supermarkets. In many
            Middle Eastern and Mediterranean countries, including Iran, cooks
            prepare a filling of rice and meat to be rolled up inside the tender
            grape leaves. The rolls are then simmered in a savory broth, often
            with tomato juice.

      3 FOODS OF THE IRANIANS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Iranian food (also referred to as Persian food) is some of the most
      delicious and fresh in its region. It is also quite healthy, using only
      small amounts of red meat (usually 
      </p>
        
        <p class="caption">
          
            Ch&#226;y (tea), the favorite beverage in Iran, is brewed in a
            large, ornate pot called a samovar.

       lamb or beef), emphasizing larger amounts of grains (especially rice),
      fruits, and vegetables. Although it is often lumped under the category of
      general "Middle Eastern" fare, the Iranian cuisine is able
      to retain its uniqueness in a variety of ways. One of these ways is
      preparing meals with contrasting flavors, such as a combination of sweet
      and sour or mild and spicy.
    
    <p>
      The country's cuisine is largely based on 
      
        berenj
      
       (rice). It is relatively inexpensive and grown locally, making it an
      affordable and readily available staple in the everyday diet. A typical
      Iranian meal is often a heaping plate of 
      
        chelo
      
       (CHEH-loh; plain, cooked rice) topped with vegetables, fish, or meat. It
      also provides a cool contrast to spicy meat toppings. The two national
      rice dishes are 
      
        chelo
      
       and 
      
        polo
      
       (POH-loh; rice cooked with several ingredients). There are seemingly
      endless varieties of dishes that can be prepared with rice in Iran.
    </p>
    <p>
      
        N&#226;n
      
       (bread), a round, flat bread that can either be baked or cooked over a
      bed of small stones, is the other staple food of Iranian cuisine. There
      are several varieties, including 
      
        lav&#226;sh
      
      , a very thin, brittle bread served for breakfast, and 
      
        sangak
      
       (sahn-GAHK), a thicker, chewier variety that is usually marked by small
      "dimples" in the crust. Villages often make their own 
      
        n&#226;n
      
      , while those who live in the city are frequently seen leaving bakeries
      with armfuls of freshly made loaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meat, particularly chicken and lamb, is most commonly eaten as 
      
        kebabs
      
       (KEE-bahbs), pieces of meat served on a skewer. 
      
        &#194;sh
      
       (soups) and 
      
        khoresh
      
       (stews) make popular entrees to most Iranian meals and often contain such
      meat. 
      
        Abgoosht
      
       (up-GOOSHT) is a hearty soup made of mutton (sheep meat) and chickpeas.
      Soups are drunk directly from the bowl. 
      
        Koftas
      
       (meatballs), vegetables (such as eggplant), fruits (such as quince, an
      apple-like fruit), and even yogurt (an Iranian mainstay) are often added
      to soups and stews.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quinces, pears, grapes, dates, apricots, and Iranian melons flavored with
      rosewater are typically eaten for dessert. 
      
        Halva
      
       (HAHL-wah, a sesame treat) and 
      
        baklava
      
       (bahk-LAH-vah, crisp paper-like pastry layered 
       with nuts and honey) are common throughout the Middle East. Iranians also
      love ice cream and puddings. Although sugared 
      
        ch&#226;y
      
       (tea) is the country's most treasured beverage and 
      
        ghahv&#233;
      
       (coffee) is highly popular, Iranians (particularly children) often enjoy
      a sweet drink after large meals. 
      
        Palouden
      
       (PAO-loo-den), a rose- and lemon-flavored drink, 
      
        dugh
      
       (sour milk or yogurt mixed with sparkling water) and fresh fruit juices
      can be made at home or bought in cafes and at street stalls.

      4 FOOD FOR RELIGIOUS AND HOLIDAY CELEBRATIONS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Almost all (about 98 percent) of Iranians are Shi'ah Muslims. They
      follow Shi'ah Islam, the government religion, and celebrate Muslim 
       holidays throughout the year. Many of the country's religious
      holidays celebrate the birthdays of 
      
        imams
      
       (religious leaders). One such leader is the Prophet Muhammad, who is
      remembered each year with a celebration called 
      
        Mouloud
      
       (moo-LOOD). 
      
        Ashura
      
       is a day to remember the Prophet's grandson, Husayn, who was
      murdered in A.D. 680. On this day, parades typically crowd city streets
      and people give money or food to the poor if they can afford to.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ramadan is the most sacred time of the year for Muslims. For an entire
      month, Muslims fast (do not eat or drink) from sunrise to sunset every
      day, hoping to cleanse their bodies and minds and remember those who are
      less fortunate. Restaurants and food stores are often closed or have
      limited hours during this holy month. Ramadan ends with the sighting of
      the new moon. The three-day festival marking Ramadan's end is known
      as 
      
        Eid al-Fitr
      
      . During this time, the month-long fast is broken by community prayer, and
      then followed by a large feast with family and friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      
        Now Ruz
      
       (no-ROOZ), the Iranian New Year, takes place on the first day of spring
      (March 21) and is probably the most important festival in Iran. Iranians
      of all ages eagerly await this day (literally meaning "new
      day"), and look forward to a new beginning and an abundance of
      delicious meals and sweets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Festivities for 
      
        Now Ruz
      
       begin nearly two weeks ahead of time&#8212;planting seeds, buying
      clothes, and cleaning homes. 
      
        Haft sin
      
       (hoft-SEEN) is a tradition in which tables are decorated with seven items
      that symbolize triumph over evil, including 
      
        sir
      
       (garlic) and 
      
        senjid
      
       (olives). 
      
        Samanu
      
       (sah-muh-NOO), a pudding made from flour, sugar, and walnuts, is also
      made at this time. For additional good luck, a mother will often eat one
      cooked egg for every one of her children.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beginning on the day of 
      
        Now Ruz
      
       and lasting for two weeks, feasting and visiting with friends and
      relatives takes place while schools and offices remain closed. Iranian
      sweets and snacks such as fruits, nuts, pastries, puddings, and tea, are
      placed on tables in anticipation of visiting guests. Iranian rice cakes
      and 
      
        sabzi polo
      
      , a rice dish flavored with herbs, are popular foods. On the thirteenth
      day of the New Year, called 
      
        Sizdeh Bedar
      
       (seez-DAH-bee-DAR), it is believed that homes are filled with bad luck.
      To help chase it away, 
      
        sabzeh
      
       (wheat or lentil seeds grown during 
      
        haft sin
      
      ) are thrown out the window and a picnic outdoors is enjoyed. At 5 
      
        P.M.
      
      , it is customary to eat lettuce leaves dipped in a honey and vinegar
      dressing, accompanied by tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Iranians make their container of 
      
        sabzeh
      
      , or green sprouts, for 
      
        Now Ruz,
      
       they sometimes simply scatter the seeds over a plate and keep them
      moistened with water as they sprout and grow. They may also choose to fill
      a porous clay pot or jar with water and attach the seeds to the outside of
      the jar with strips of cloth until they stick to the moist surface. The
      strips are then removed and the sprouts grow upward in
      sunlight&#8212;green and full.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sprouts, similar to those grown by Iranians, can be grown by filling a
      bowl or other container with sterile potting mix from a plant nursery, and
      scattering lentils or grains of barley or wheat thickly across the surface
      of the potting mix. The mix should 
       be watered until it is evenly moist throughout, and then the container
      should be covered loosely with plastic wrap to hold in the moisture. The
      seeds will sprout if the container is left on a sunny windowsill; the
      surface should be sprinkled with water once or twice a day to keep the
      seeds moist.
    </p>
    <p>
      After three days, the seeds should have begun to sprout and the plastic
      wrap may be removed. When the sprouts are a few inches tall, they may be
      tied into a bunch with a pretty ribbon, or snipped and added to a salad.

      5 MEALTIME CUSTOMS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Upon entering an Iranian home and removing one's shoes at the door,
      a gift or reciprocated dinner invitation should be offered to the host.
      When the meal is ready to be served, the host will place large platters of
      food on top of the 
      
        sofreh
      
       (sof-RAY, tablecloth) that rests on top of a floor rug. Diners sit
      cross-legged in front of individual settings of plates, bowls, and
      silverware (typically a fork and a spoon). Iranians of the opposite sex
      (unless related) do not sit next to one another while eating. Talking is
      also kept to a minimum.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although most meals will offer bread, rice, and meat (often a 
      
        kebab
      
      ), Iranians often choose what foods will be served by following a set of
      food rules that originated from ancient Greek medicine. Foods are
      classified as either "hot" or "cold,"
      depending on the food's heating or cooling effect on the individual
      (rather than the food's actual temperature). Hot foods include
      meats, sweets, and eggplant. Yogurt, cucumbers, and fish classify as cold.
      Iranians try to serve a balance of hot and cold foods. After dinner, 
      
        ch&#226;y
      
       (tea) is commonly accompanies fresh fruit for dessert, although more
      elaborate meals or special occasions will include pastries such as 
      
        baklava
      
       or 
      
        halva
      
      .
    </p>
    <p>
      Iranians consume three meals a day, including snacks (usually nuts, seeds,
      fruit, or a light yogurt dish). 
      
        Soph'ha'neh
      
       (breakfast), separate from the typical Iranian fare of lunch and dinner,
      usually consists of hot tea, cheese, and fresh baked bread from the local
      bakery or home kitchen. Some choose to purchase it from "bicycle
      breadmen" who travel from door to door, selling leftover bread for
      a reduced price. Northern provinces prefer 
      
        asal
      
       (honey) with cooked, cold rice and fish. Central Iranians enjoy yogurt
      and soft cream, while southern Iranians prefer cheese and dates.
    </p>
    <p>
      A child's weekday (Saturday through Thursday) breakfast before
      school is often the same as that of adults: tea, honey, bread, and feta
      cheese. Similar to breakfast, the light lunch served by most schools
      typically includes fresh fruit, dates, pistachio nuts, bread, and cheese.

      6 POLITICS, ECONOMICS, AND NUTRITION
    </h2>
    <p>
      About 6 percent of the population of Iran is classified as undernourished
      by the World Bank. This means they do not receive adequate nutrition in
      their diet. Of children under the age of five, about 16 percent are
      underweight, and roughly 19 percent are stunted (short for their age).
    </p>
    <p>
      Unemployment, caused by Iran's unstable economy, helps to
      contribute to urban and rural poverty. Such poverty often leads to hunger
      and undernourishment. An absence of cooked eggs, beans, lentils, and 
       nuts from the diet can lead to protein deficiency. Similarly, a lack of
      fruits and vegetables can result in an overall vitamin deficiency. Many
      families affected by the country's shaky economy cannot afford to
      purchase or grow themselves the necessary foods for a healthy diet.

      "The White Balloon." Iranian director Jafar Panahi, 1996. 85
      minutes. This is a story of a seven-year-old Iranian girl named Razieh who
      asks her mother for money to buy a special goldfish for the 
      
        Now Ruz
      
       celebration. (Goldfish in a bowl of water are traditionally placed on the
      table this time of year.) Eager to purchase one, Razieh travels through
      the city of Tehran on her journey to the pet store. As she does so, she
      meets people of many different cultures. The differences and similarities
      of people from all over the world become apparent in this charming film.

Yougurt, even the name as it is internationalized today is a Turkish food. But, what is your sources for suggesting many of Iranian food originating from foreigners as Russians (they have only been around for a 1000 years) and others like Arabs and Greeks. Who know f.ex. where Dolma was originated? </p></p></div>

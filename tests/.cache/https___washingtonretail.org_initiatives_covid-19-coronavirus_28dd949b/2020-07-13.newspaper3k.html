<ul>
<li><strong>If your scheduled hours have been temporarily reduced or diminished entirely&#8230; </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Besides keeping employees safe and healthy, finding resources to support their financial need is a priority inquiry from our members. The Employment Security Department (ESD) launched a <a href="https://esd.wa.gov/newsroom/covid-19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID-19 resource webpage</a> with a <a href="https://washingtonretail.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/COVID-19_Scenarios-and-Benefits.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scenarios &amp; Benefits Option Chart</a> to provide guidance on various potential benefits available to employees in our state. You will likely find one or more of the following options applicable to your scenario. <a href="https://esd.wa.gov/unemployment/eligibility-and-general-questions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Frequently Asked Questions</a> is a wonderful resource also.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Protected leave and state benefit options for infected employees, quarantined or care for family members
<ul>
<li>Paid sick leave may be available for many scenarios common in the current crisis.</li>
<li>Paid family medical leave is available only when you are tested positive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://esd.wa.gov/SharedWork" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shared work</a> is a great resource if your employer reduces work hours, but employers need to initiate and coordinate with the ESD.</li>
<li><a href="https://esd.wa.gov/unemployment/temporary-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Temporary layoffs or standby</a> &#8211; Employees who are either part-time or full-time are eligible to apply for this benefit without meeting the job search requirement. (ESD has just promulgated emergency rules to also make this option for part-time employees.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Applications with the ESD are available by phone or online <a href="https://esd.wa.gov/unemployment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. According to the ESD Commissioner Suzan LeVine, their staffing to process unemployment applications is ready and adequate unless the current situation worsens dramatically.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>If you or your family members are quarantined or ill due to COVID-19 exposures </strong><strong>&#8230;</strong>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fmla/pandemic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Emergency Family and Medical Leave Expansion Act</a> temporarily expands the current Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and provides paid sick leave for eligible employees who can&#8217;t work (or telework) because of their minor child&#8217;s school or childcare service closure due to a COVID-19 emergency declared by a federal, state or local authority. A tax credit is created for employers who incur expenses due to this act.</li>
<li>The Department of Labor and Industries (L&amp;I) just announced allowance of COVID-19 exposure as a valid workers&#8217; compensation claim for healthcare providers, first responders and those who work in facilities with documented exposures. For retail employees whose exposure or contraction is incidental, the claim will likely be denied. You may read L&amp;I news on this topic sent on March 9, 2020&#160;<a href="https://washingtonretail.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Workers-Comp-And-COVID-Exposure.pdf">here</a>.</li>

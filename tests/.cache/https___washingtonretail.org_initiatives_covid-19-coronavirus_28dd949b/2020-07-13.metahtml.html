Should you have additional input and or questions, please contact <a href="https://washingtonretail.org/profile/rose-gundersen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rose Gundersen, VP of Operations and Retail Services</a>, at <a href="rgundersen@waretailservices.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rgundersen@waretailservices.com</a> or 360-200-6452 (o) / 360-704-0049 (c).</p><h2> Resources for employees</h2><ul>
<li>If your scheduled hours have been temporarily reduced or diminished entirely&#8230; </li>
</ul><p>Besides keeping employees safe and healthy, finding resources to support their financial need is a priority inquiry from our members. The Employment Security Department (ESD) launched a <a href="https://esd.wa.gov/newsroom/covid-19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID-19 resource webpage</a> with a <a href="https://washingtonretail.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/COVID-19_Scenarios-and-Benefits.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scenarios &amp; Benefits Option Chart</a> to provide guidance on various potential benefits available to employees in our state. You will likely find one or more of the following options applicable to your scenario. <a href="https://esd.wa.gov/unemployment/eligibility-and-general-questions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Frequently Asked Questions</a> is a wonderful resource also.</p><ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Protected leave and state benefit options for infected employees, quarantined or care for family members
<ul>
<li>Paid sick leave may be available for many scenarios common in the current crisis.</li>
<li>Paid family medical leave is available only when you are tested positive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://esd.wa.gov/SharedWork" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shared work</a> is a great resource if your employer reduces work hours, but employers need to initiate and coordinate with the ESD.</li>
<li><a href="https://esd.wa.gov/unemployment/temporary-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Temporary layoffs or standby</a> &#8211; Employees who are either part-time or full-time are eligible to apply for this benefit without meeting the job search requirement. (ESD has just promulgated emergency rules to also make this option for part-time employees.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><p>Applications with the ESD are available by phone or online <a href="https://esd.wa.gov/unemployment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. According to the ESD Commissioner Suzan LeVine, their staffing to process unemployment applications is ready and adequate unless the current situation worsens dramatically.</p></article>

Overall, the proposed free trade agreement (FTA) intends to &#8220;builds on the objectives of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) and serve as an enduring foundation to expand U.S.-Africa trade and investment across the continent.&#8221; USTR also visions to conclude an agreement with Kenya that &#8220;can serve as a model for additional agreements in Africa, leading to a network of agreements that contribute to Africa&#8217;s regional integration objectives.&#8221;</p><p>Regarding the textiles and apparel (T&amp;A) sector, USTR says it will &#8220;Secure duty-free access for U.S. textile and apparel products and seek to improve competitive opportunities for exports of U.S. textile and apparel products while taking into account U.S. import sensitivities.&#8221; The proposed agreement also will &#8220;Establish origin procedures that streamline the certification and verification of rules of origin and that promote strong enforcement, including with respect to textiles.&#8221; The same/very similar language is used in the proposed <a href="https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/2018.12.21_Summary_of_U.S.-Japan_Negotiating_Objectives.pdf">U.S.-Japan Free Trade Agreement</a> and <a href="https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/01.11.2019_Summary_of_U.S.-EU_Negotiating_Objectives.pdf">U.S.-EU trade negotiation</a>.</p><p>Of the total $667million U.S. merchandise imports from Kenya in 2019, nearly 70% were apparel items, making the sector the single largest stakeholder of the proposed FTA. While still being a relatively minor supplier, Kenya&#8217;s apparel exports to the U.S. reached a record high of $453million in 2019, which was an increase of 132% from ten years ago. For many U.S. fashion companies, Kenya is also its single largest apparel-sourcing base in Sub-saharan Africa (SSA), accounting for one-third of the region&#8217;s total apparel exports to the U.S. in 2019.</p><p>However, how to design the textile and apparel chapter in the proposed U.S.-Kenya FTA is anything but easy. A preliminary content analysis of the <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/docket?D=USTR-2020-0011">133 public comments </a>submitted to the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC) as of May 2020 shows that various stakeholders have proposed competing views on several complicated issues, ranging from the rules of origin to the tariff elimination schedule. Specifically:</p><p>First, the fashion apparel industry has expressed strong unanimous support for the proposed U.S.-Kenya FTA. Notably, Kenya is widely regarded as a growing sourcing destination for U.S. fashion brands and retailers. As noted by the U.S. Fashion Industry Association (USFIA) in its comment &#8220;there is a tremendous opportunity to expand trade between the United States and Kenya&#8221; through the elimination of both tariff and non-tariff barriers under the FTA.</p><p>Second, the fashion apparel industry calls for the proposed U.S.-Kenya FTA to &#8220;do no harm&#8221; to the existing supply chain established based on AGOA and ensure a seamless transition between the two trade programs. For example, PVH, one of the largest U.S. fashion corporations, says in its comment, &#8220;no change should be made with respect to market access and duty&#8208;free treatment for apparel made in Kenya effective from the date of entry into force of the agreement.&#8221; Likewise, USFIA calls for the new FTA to &#8220;Preserve the commercial opportunities developed through AGOA benefits.&#8221; The American Apparel and Footwear Association (AAFA) further proposes to extend AGOA for another ten years after 2025, regardless of the status of the U.S.-Kenya FTA.</p><p>Third, despite the overall support for the agreement, industry stakeholders hold different views on how liberal the apparel-specific rules of origin should be in the U.S.-Kenya FTA and how long to keep it. Data shows, between 2015 and 2019, 99.7% of U.S. apparel imports from Kenya claimed the AGOA benefits. Of these imports, almost 100% took advantage of the so-called &#8220;third-country&#8221; fabric provision, which allows lesser-developed SSA countries like Kenya to enjoy duty-free access to the U.S. market for apparel made from yarns and fabrics originating from anywhere in the world (also known as the &#8220;cut and sew&#8221; or &#8220;single transformation&#8221; rules of origin).</p><p>On the one hand, some argue that without AGOA-like liberal rules of origin, Kenya won&#8217;t survive as an apparel sourcing destination for U.S. fashion companies because of the lack of local textile manufacturing capacity. For example, according to the African Coalition for Trade representing businesses in several SSA countries, &#8220;Africa does not currently have the capacity to produce the volume and variety of yarn and fabric necessary to support its apparel industry. Any tightening of the third-country fabric rule of origin in the post-AOGA model FTA would decimate the African apparel industry and lead to the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs.&#8221;</p><p>However, some other industry stakeholders suggest that U.S.-Kenya FTA should gradually adopt the more restrictive &#8220;yarn-forward&#8221; rules of origin to encourage the development of the local textile industry in Kenya and the broader SSA region. Should U.S.-Kenya FTA adopt the &#8220;yarn-forward&#8221; rules of origin, garment factories in Kenya would have to either import yarns and fabrics from the United States, an option that is commercially infeasible given the long-distance, or use textile inputs locally-made. PVH, in its comment, explains the rationale behind the proposal, &#8220;we should move to a yarn forward rule of origin in phases&#8230;to allow the orderly verticalization of the apparel industry (in Kenya).&#8221; AAFA further adds, &#8220;A strong, vertical supply chain for the apparel and footwear industry in Kenya will reduce costs, minimize disruption and improve efficiency.&#8221;</p><p>Notably, the National Council of Textile Organizations (NCTO), which represents the voice of the U.S. textile industry, has not commented on U.S.-Kenya FTA yet but may potentially join the rules of origin debate. For years, NCTO insists that all U.S. free trade agreements should adopt the strict &#8220;yarn-forward&#8221; rules of origin. NCTO is most likely to hold the same position for the proposed U.S.-Kenya FTA because of two reasons: 1) avoid setting a &#8220;bad precedent&#8221; that may have implications for future U.S. FTA negotiations; 2) prevent the case when U.S. apparel imports from Kenya substantially increase and negatively affect apparel suppliers in the Western Hemisphere (such as Mexico and countries in Central America).</p><p>Furthermore, the debate on rules of origin is connected with the discussion on how to promote a regional textile and apparel supply chain in SSA and enhance regional economic integration. Several stakeholders, including AAFA, urge that U.S.-Kenya FTA should support regional supply chain collaboration rather than intensify the competition between Kenya and other AGOA members in the U.S. apparel market. The Atlantic Council, a well-known think tank also argues, &#8220;the bilateral (FTA) approach should not undercut the US&#8217; longstanding support for regional integration in African markets and the progress that has been made in the East African Community (EAC) and the African continental free trade agreement area (AfCFTA).&#8221; Mauritius embassy echoes and suggests that the U.S.-Kenya FTA &#8220;could be made conductive to regional integration in Africa by allowing cumulation provisions in the agreement that would allow the use of materials sourced from other African partners to achieve the rules of origin requirements.&#8221;</p><p>Fourth, industry stakeholders also suggest that U.S.-Kenya FTA could include modern trade agendas to make the agreement more relevant to the needs of the fashion apparel industry in the 21st-century world economy. The most commonly mentioned issues include: 1) Sustainability, labor, and environmental standard; 2) E-commerce, digital trade, and data protection; 3) Strengthened intellectual property rights (IP) protection; 4) Transparency and trade facilitation. The released USTR negotiation objectives have covered most of these topics.</p><p>Additionally, how to deal with Kenya&#8217;s secondhand clothing import restriction could be another thorny issue relevant to fashion apparel in the U.S.-Kenya FTA negotiation. In its submitted comment, the Secondary Materials and Recycled Textiles Association (SMART), whose members export 8-10 million kilograms of used clothing each year, urged the proposed U.S.-Kenya FTA to &#8220;prohibit the imposition of any import ban on secondhand clothing&#8221; and &#8220;phase-in duty eliminations on secondhand clothing.&#8221; However, SMART&#8217;s position could be at odds with apparel manufacturers in Kenya, along with U.S. fashion brands and retailers interested in expanding apparel sourcing from the country.</p></article>

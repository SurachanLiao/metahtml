The Economic History and Economy of Iran

Historical Background

Iran has been the home of a culture which has been influential but not mainstream in the history of world civilization. There have been significant contribution to other cultures from Iranian culture but Iranian culture, as a whole, has been an enigma to the peoples of the Mediterranean civilizations and their successors.

One example of the cultural influence of Iran is the element of dualism that has appeared in several religions. Iran has been the source of several religions, such as Zoroastrianism and Manicheaism. Shia Islam, concentrated in Iran but which arose in what is now southern Iraq, is distinctively different from Sunni Islam.

Some believe the social structure of feudalism arose in Iran many centuries before it appeared in Europe. To protect the cities from the nomadic mounted archer warriors from central Asia the defending warriors and their horses had to be protected with armor. The armor was expensive, the horses were expensive and the warriors' training was expensive. The central government gave each local area the responsibility of raising and supporting the armored knights. Over time the armored knights became the rulers of the territories they protected and the feudal social system emerged.

The cultural area of Iranian language speakers extends into Afghanistan (Dari Language) and into central Asia (Tajiks). In ancient times speakers of languages in the Iranian language family, the Scythians and Sarmations, controlled central Asia from the Chinese Empire on the east to the Roman Empire on the west. This specifically included the area north of the Black Sea.

A Brief Chronology of Iranian History

5000 B.C.-1000 B.C.: An advanced society develops in region of Elam in southwestern Iran around the city of Susa. The Elamites left written records which have not yet been deciphered. The linguistic affiliation of the Elamites is not known but it was probably not Indo-European.

1000 B.C.: Various nomadic tribes speaking Indo-European languages settle in Iran. Their cultures and economies were based upon horses and herding. The Scythian settled in the northwest in the Zagros Mountains. The Medes settled in central Iran and the Parsa settled in several areas including the southwest north of the kingdom of Elam.

550-330 B.C. (The Achaemenids): Rise of the Achaemenes dynasty and the creation of an empire based upon the coalition of the Medes and Persians under the leadership of Cyrus the Great. Achaemenes is the Greek form of the Iranian family name of Haklamanesh. The Achaemenic Empire extended from the western Anatolian lands of the Greeks to the Hindu Kush in what is now Afghanistan. This included the conquest of the city of Babylon.

330 B.C. to 323 B.C. (Alexander): The defeat of the Persian emperor by Alexander of Macedonia and the conquest of the Persian empire. Alexander tried to meld the Greek and Persian societies even to the point of forcing the marriage of ten thousand Iranian women to his Greek soldiers.

323 B.C. to 247 B.C. (The Seleucids): Upon Alexander's death in Babylon in 323 B.C. his empire was divided among his generals and Seleucus took control of Babylon and established a dynasty which ruled Iran until about 250 B.C.

250 B.C. to 224 A.D. (The Pathian Empire): A revolt of a Parni tribe in 243 B.C. leads to the downfall of the Seleucidian empire and the emergence of a Parthian empire. The Parthian Empire flourished and came into conflict with the Roman Empire, to the latter's detriment. At the high point of the Parthian Empire the Parthian emperors began identifying themselves as the descendants of the Achaemenid emperors and the Greeks. A revolt in the province of Fars led by Ardeshir resulted in the defeat of the Parthian emperor.

224 A.D. to 642 A.D. (The Sassanid Empire): Ardeshir, the leader of the revolt against the Parthians, claimed descent from a legendary hero, Sasan and this is why the emperors of this dynasty were known as the Sassanids. The Sassanid emperors engaged in major reorganizations of Iran, including reorganization of the bureaucracy for centralization of control, tax reforms and the importation of technology and learning. Zoroastrianism became the state religion and the Zoroastrian priests as a class were a key element of the social and political system. The emperors adopted the title of Shahanshar , the king of kings. The period after about 600 A.D. was notable in the lavish expenditure for the court and the military to support the wars against the Byzantine Empire.

, the king of kings. The period after about 600 A.D. was notable in the lavish expenditure for the court and the military to support the wars against the Byzantine Empire. 642 A.D. to 650 A.D. (The Arab Conquest): The first caliph of Islam, Abu Bakr, led the campaign against the Byzantine and Sassanid Empires. First Damascus was captured from the Byzantines in 635 A.D. Two years later Abu Bakr's army captured the Sassanid capital of Ctesiphon. In the campaign of 641-642 Abu Bakr's army decisively defeated the Sassanid army. By 650 the Sassanid Empire was under Abu Bakr's control.

650 A.D. to 750 A.D.: The subjects of the Sassanid Empire had little reason to resist the conquering Muslims. The Sassanid Empire had been corrupt and incompetent. The conquerors abided by the policy of religious tolerance of the People of the Book ; i.e., Jews, Christians and Zoroasterians. The Zoroastrians thus were not forced to convert to Islam. They and other non-Muslims did have to pay a special tax so there was a small economic incentive to convert. It took about two centuries for the general population of Iran to become Muslim. The Arab conquerors of Iran allowed Iranians to serve as administrator-advisers ( viziers ) in the conquered territory and later adopted this arrangement in other regions of the Muslim world. There remained the belief among the conquerors of that the rulers should be Arabs, Allah's chosen people. Shia'ism arose in what is now southern Iraq. It spread to Iran but was long merely a minority religion there.

It took about two centuries for the general population of Iran to become Muslim. 750 A.D. to 1000 A.D.: In 750 A.D. an Arabic group utilizing an Iranian army commanded by an Iranian general defeated the armies of the old dynasty of caliphs, the Umayyads, and established a new dynasty of caliphs, the Abbasids, with a new capital at Baghdad. Although the Abbasid dynasty started out as Arabic, over time with intermarriage its Arabic character faded. The Abbasid caliphs in the ninth century began to rely upon Turkic tribes coming from Central Asia for warriors for their armies. Eventually these Turkish warriors, although brought into the armies as slaves, became the real wielders of power. The caliphs became religious figureheads and the leaders of the Turkic tribes in the region possessed the real power in the Empire.

1000 A.D. to 1220 A.D.: By the eleventh century the leaders of the Oghuz and Seljuk Turks achieved achieved formal recognition as the rulers of territories in the Iraq-Iran-Afghanistan area.

1220 A.D. to 1500 A.D.: In the thirteenth century Genghis Khan and his successors leading armies consisting of Mongols and Turks conquered much of Eurasia including Iran. The Khans' conquests initially brought devastation and despair to the region but later the Iranian viziers that were chosen by the conquerors to serve as administrators brought some recover in Iran. But the Mongol-Turkic rule of Iran continued until 1501 A.D.

1501 A.D. to 1722 A.D. (The Safavids): The Safavids were an order of Sufis founded in Ardabil in the fourteenth century. The brought Turkoman warriors into the order and commenced an program of conquest. In the middle of the fifteenth century the Safavid order accepted Shia'ism as the true form of Islam. With this conversion there campaign of conquest became a holy war to bring all over to the true religion. By 1501 the Safavid armies captured Trabiz and their leader Ismail was declared Shah of Iran. Prior to the rise of the Safavids there was relative religious tolerance in Iran. The Shias were in the minority but after the rise of the safavids there was a vigorous campaign to convert all to Shia'ism. So Iran became predominantly Shia only in the sixteenth century. In 1524 the Safavid expansion was stopped by defeat at the hands of the Ottoman Turks, who were Sunni. The Ottomans even captured the Safavid capital of Trabiz temporarily. Thereafter the Safavids had to maintain a defense that mixed diplomacy and treaties for some enemmies while fighting other enemies. For example, it order to deal with the Uzbeks on the east treaties had to be negotiated with Ottomans to the west. The power of the Safavids declined and in 1722 Afghans defeated the Safavid army and captured the Safavid capital of Trabiz. The Afghans were driven out by the forces of the Afshar tribe. Later the head of that tribe assumed the title of Shah of Iran. This was Nader Shah who subsequently conquered Afghanistan and later sacked Delhi. Nader Shah's military campaigns exhausted the resources of Iran and in desperation the leaders of his own tribe, the Afshar, killed him.

1925: The Rise of Reza Khan. As a result of the influence of the Russian Empire Iran had a Cossack Brigade which was commanded by Russian officers. Reza Khan joined the Cossack Brigade at age fourteen and distinguished himself with his courage and daring. He rose to leadership. After the Russian Revolution in 1917 and the capture of power by the communists Britain undertook to contain the spread of communism. Because of the strong Russian influence in Iran Britain occupied the country. During this occupation Britain dismissed from the Iran Cossack Brigade all Russian officers. Reza Khan was selected by the British to command the Cossack Brigade. After the British withdrew the Cossack Brigade was one of the few organized military units in the country. Reza Khan, as commander of the Cossack Brigade, ordered the reigning shah, Sultan Ahmad, to either reorganize the government or abdicate. Ahmad Shah tried for four years, from 1921 to 1925, to reorganize the Iranian goverment but without notable success. By 1925 Reza Khan was prime minister. Reza Khan called for a vote in the Majlis (legislature) to end the reign of Ahmad Shah and had himself declared shah on April 25, 1925 under the name Reza Shah Pahlavi. Reza Shah sought to carry out in Iran what Kemal Atat√ºrk had done in Turkey. He opened the schools to women and abolished the requirement that women wear chadors. He reorganized the government and created a modern bureaucracy. He also modernized the army. He created a secular judiciary. Reza Shah started a program of redistributing the land by taking some land away from the religious organizations. In 1941 Reza Shah looked at the victories of the German army and became convinced that Germany would win the war. He expressed sympathy for the Axis side in the war and Britain and the Soviet Union reacted by jointly occupying Iran and sending Reza Shah into exile in South Africa. He abdicated in favor of his son, Mohammed Reza Pahlavi. Mohammed Reza Pahlavi received a Swiss education and then training in the Iranian Military Academy. For the first 15 years of his reign he had very little power. During the period 1941 to 1946 Iran was occupied in the north by Soviet troops and in the south by British troops. From 1946 to 1955 there were strong, nationalistic prime ministers that held the reins of power. It was not until the prime minister Mohammad Mossadeq was deposed with help from the British and Americans that Mohammed Reza Shah acquired real power in Iran.

The White Revolution

(later known as

the Revolution of the Shah and the People)

It is ironic that of all the misdeeds, corruption, and short-comings of the Shah's regime the thing that brought it down was an attempt to better the lot of the Iranian peasants and poor.

During the 1960's and early 1970's Iran experience rates of growth in GDP and consumption in the 10 to 12 percent range. The rates accelerated in the 1970's. Investment, particularly public investment, was growing even faster. The higher revenues from petroleum in the 1970's financed vastly expanded public investment and consumption, so much expanded that by 1975 public investment surpassed private investment by 50 percent and public consumption was equal to 50 percent of private consumption.

The economic philosophy of the leaders in Iran as elsewhere in government around the world is Corporatism. Corporatism differs from socialism in that it allows for private ownership of resources and private production but reserves a strong role for the government in regulating and guiding the economy to promote economic development and social justice.

The Shah's ultimate objective was to strengthen the Iranian State, perhaps resurrect the prestige of the Iranian Empire, by achieving economic development. He chose to further this objective by promoting three immediate goals:

develop heavy industry in Iran

develop the infrastructure of Iran

create a welfare state

There is a good deal of cart-before-the-horse thinking in these objectives. A welfare state is a luxury that developed economies choose to spend their resources on, not something that is beneficial in achieving development. Infrastructure is something that is creasted to serve the economy in the course of its development. The infrastructure should not be built first in anticipation of development. Also heavy industry, even a petrochemical industry, may not be something that works to Iran's advantage. In the case of petrochemicals it is generally cheaper to ship the crude petroleum to the market and have it processed into petrochemicals at the markets. Arbitrarily chosen industry may have to be subsidized by taking resources away from viable industries.

To create some of the trappings of a welfare state the Shah had the labor legislation modified to provide workers with fringe benefits, profit sharing and job security. Free education was provided from nursery school through universities. To promote this the government nationalized the private schools. Social security, disability benefits and free health care were created. The funding was to be shared by the workers, their employers and the State. This raised the cost of employing labor and contributed to unemployment.

Licensing, tax policy and tariff protection were policy instruments used by the government to control who could and who could not do business.

The regime made available low-cost capital to industrial businesses favored by the regime. This, combined with higher cost of labor, promoted more capital intensive technology. The businesses created under this program tended to be oligopolistic and dependent upon government subsidies and protection. Direct foreign investment in Iran was encouraged. This too tended to create oligopolistic industries dependent upon governmental favors and protection. Thus, the program promoted the exact opposite of what Iran needed. Furthermore the role of the government in protecting and subsidizing industry opened the way for corruption of government officials by actual and potential recipients of these government favors.

Price controls were imposed upon businesses and their profit margins were limited to 15 percent. To enforce the price controls the Government mobilized students to check prices and impose penalties. This earned the Shah the hatred of businesses. It was these disgruntled business people who financed the revolution of 1979. The Shah also forced a land reform program which alienated another class from his program.

The clergy organized the revolution, but without the backing and financial support of small businesses in Iran it is doubtful whether or not the revolution would have succeeded.

Ruhollah Khomeini was perceived as being a reactionary Shi'ite Islamic fundamentalist. He was such but his political economic philosophy was more than that. He emphasized goals of social justice within Iran and Iranian nationalism in the international arena. This allowed him to appeal for the support of the more secular leftists, at least initially. He garnered the support of the merchant class because they were alienated by the interventionism and corruption of the Shah's regime and because Islam does not disdain a market economy. By adopting some of the rhetoric of Third World leaders Khomeini could further appeal to the merchant class of Iran who wanted market protection from the Capitalist world.

Thus the revolution was carried out in 1979 with broadbased support. A constitution was adopted which included democratic ideals and some concern for civil liberties. Khomeini once in power then began to systematic eliminate the potential rivals for power. This included the leftists and once they were eliminated the moderates who wanted a real democracy. Khomeini campaigned for the abrogation of the original constitution and its replacement with one that create the office of Supreme Leader for him. The Supreme Leader was above electoral review in much the same way that monarchs were in feudal regimes. The major difference was that the office of Supreme Leader was not heritary the way the monarchy was.

The Economic Record of the Islamic Republic of Iran

There have been some notable accomplishments:

Mortality rates are significantly lower now than before the revolution; e.g., infant mortality dropped from 104 per thousand in the mid1970's to 25 per thousand. Life expectancy rose from 55 years to 68 years.

Literacy rates have risen from below 50 percent to around 67 percent.

Average living standards have risen

Schools and infrastructure have been built in the rural areas

Educational and employment opportunities have improved for females.

The birth rate has been reduced.

There have been some projects for which it is uncertain as to whether they were the best use of the resources required. See the material on dam building in Iran.

But there are some significant short-comings and failures of the regime; notably:

Middle class real incomes have declined, as has the middle class itself.

Women are forced to adhere to strict rules concerning dress and behavior.

While the access to education has improved there has been some deterioration of the quality of education.

Standards of living have been maintained by city dwellers through working multiple jobs.

Industry, particularly the petroleum industry, is in need of substantial investment.

As shown below the output of Iran went through some significant episodes of economic depressions and recoveries.

Parvin Alizadeh, the editor of a volume in 2000 entitled The Economy of Iran, says in summary of the economic state of Iran:

The performance of the Iranian economy in the 1980's and 1990's has witnessed a marked deterioration, in absolute terms as well as relative to other countries in the region. The growth of the economy has slackened drastically. The economy, with a rapidly expanding population, has experienced a marked decline in investment, low labor productivity, a widening trade gap, a fast accumulation of debt and, above all, a sharp decline in the standard of living.

On the matter of per capita GDP and income, Hassan Hakimian and Massoud Karshenas, in their article "Dilemmas and Prospects of Economic Reform and Reconstruction in Iran," say

During the two decades before 1975 per capita income in Iran grew faster than in Turkey and kept pace with Korea. By 1975 the level of per capita GDP in Iran was more than double those attended in Korea and Turkey. However, since the late 1970s income per head in Iran has witnessed a rapid decline. . . By 1990, GDP per capita in Iran had declined by half, almost down to the levels prevalent in the early 1960s and falling behind Turkey and Korea.

  <p>Iran is a source, transit, and destination for men, women, and children trafficked for the purposes of sexual exploitation and involuntary servitude. Iranian women are trafficked internally for the purpose of forced prostitution and forced marriages.

[ The World Factbook, U.S.C.I.A. 2009]</p><p>Iran's economy is marked by an inefficient state sector, reliance on the oil sector, which provides the majority of government revenues, and statist policies, which create major distortions throughout the system. Most economic activity is controlled by the state. Private sector activity is typically limited to small-scale workshops, farming, and services. Price controls, subsidies, and other rigidities weigh down the economy, undermining the potential for private-sector-led growth. Significant informal market activity flourishes. Corruption and shortages of goods are widespread.</p>

  <p class="MsoBodyText">Child prostitution has risen 635 percent in recent
  years. Dozens of Iranian girls are brought to Karachi, Pakistan,
  to be sold as sex slaves every day. Reports in Tehran newspapers indicate that senior
  government figures have been involved in human trafficking. There are at
  least 300,000 runaway girls in Iran.</p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">By law, the father has the right to force a girl into
  marriage at the age of nine. A man can have up to four wives and forty
  "temporary marriages". Prostitution is thus codified in the Iranian
  law. Mentioning only a small part of the atrocities carried out by the
  Iranian regime, it is not hard to understand that Iran currently has the
  highest suicide rate in the world.</p>

  effectively enforce the law and made no significant effort to address forced

  <p class="g">The head of Iran&#146;s
  Interpol bureau believes that the sex slave trade is one of the most
  profitable activities in Iran today. This criminal trade is not conducted
  outside the knowledge and participation of the ruling fundamentalists.
  Government officials themselves are involved in buying, selling, and sexually
  abusing women and girls.<p></p></p>

  ?The girls who run away from home have no idea what the future holds for
  them. We have 200 missing girls in Tehran, as we speak and we only know of
  the fate of a few. There are many rings lurking for these young women and
  girls. They use these run-a-way girls for stealing, trafficking and for
  illicit drugs and sex. Most of all they use these victims for their organs.?
  Every once in a while bodies of unknown girls are found here and there in
  large cities, particularly in Tehran. Some of these bodies are identified;
  however most of them are buried without being identified because no one comes
  to claim their body. <p></p></p>
  <p class="g">The dealers of
  human organs are also trafficking girls by promising them a better life and
  transporting them across borders. Once taken to another country, the
  traffickers sell the girls? body parts for enormous amounts of money.<p></p></p>

  <p class="g">A measure of
  Islamic fundamentalists' success in controlling society is the depth and
  totality with which they suppress the freedom and rights of women. In Iran
  for 25 years, the ruling mullahs have enforced humiliating and sadistic rules
  and punishments on women and girls, enslaving them in a gender apartheid
  system of segregation, forced veiling, second-class status, lashing and
  stoning to death.<p></p></p>

  <p class="g">This abhorrent form
  of exploitation does not confine itself to adult women, but extends to children
  as well. The head of the Tehran province judiciary asserts that traffickers
  looking to sell women in the international market target girls between 13 and
  17, although some of the girls are reported to be as young as 8 and 10. The
  younger girls are often forced to work as maids until slave traders deem them
  old enough to work out of clubs, motels, or brothels.<p></p></p>

  <p class="g">TRAFFICKING
  IN PERSONS
  &#150; According to foreign observers, women and girls are trafficked to Pakistan, Turkey,
  and Europe for sexual exploitation. Boys
  from Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Afghanistan
  were trafficked through the country to the Gulf states. Afghan women and girls were
  trafficked to the country for sexual exploitation and forced marriages.
  Internal trafficking for sexual exploitation and forced labor also occurs. It
  was difficult to measure the extent of the government's efforts to curb human
  trafficking. It appears that the government did not fully comply with the
  minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking, but it has made
  significant efforts to do so. In 2004 the government conducted a study on
  trafficking of women, passed a law against human trafficking, and signed
  separate Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) with Afghanistan,
  Turkey,
  IOM, and the International Labor Organization (ILO). According to Pakistani
  press reports in December, Iran,
  Pakistan, Greece, and Turkey formed a joint working
  group to fight human trafficking. On September 22, domestic media reported
  that the Tehran
  police chief stated eight human trafficking networks smuggling mostly
  Bangladeshis, Afghans, and Pakistanis had been broken up and members
  arrested. During 2004 border police arrested more than 250 Pakistanis
  smuggled into the country, some of whom likely were trafficking victims. <p></p></p>

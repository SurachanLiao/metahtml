  marriage at the age of nine. A man can have up to four wives and forty
  "temporary marriages". Prostitution is thus codified in the Iranian
  law. Mentioning only a small part of the atrocities carried out by the
  Iranian regime, it is not hard to understand that Iran currently has the

  regime displays a different kind of brutality towards women. Womens Forum
  Against Fundamentalism was the first organization in the United States
  who exposed the Iranian regimes plan to stone a teenage girl in the city of Marvian. In less than two months, there has been
  pubic hanging of a 16-year-old girl, execution order of a 33-year-old mother
  and stoning sentence for a 14-year-old girl. Misogyny is the pillar of
  fundamentalist rule in Iran.
  Crimes against women are justified because mullahs view women as embodiment
  of sin and seduction. It is for this reason the fundamentalist regime in
  Tehran has found sex trafficking a profitable business.</span></p> <p class="g"><span>Sex Slave Jihad</span><span>[PDF]</span></p> <p class="g"><span>Prof. Donna M. Hughes,

  ?The girls who run away from home have no idea what the future holds for
  them. We have 200 missing girls in Tehran, as we speak and we only know of
  the fate of a few. There are many rings lurking for these young women and
  girls. They use these run-a-way girls for stealing, trafficking and for
  illicit drugs and sex. Most of all they use these victims for their organs.?
  Every once in a while bodies of unknown girls are found here and there in
  large cities, particularly in Tehran. Some of these bodies are identified;
  however most of them are buried without being identified because no one comes
  to claim their body. </span></p> <p class="g"><span>The dealers of

  younger girls are often forced to work as maids until slave traders deem them

  IN PERSONS</span><span> According to foreign observers, women and girls are trafficked to Pakistan, Turkey,
  and Europe for sexual exploitation. Boys
  from Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Afghanistan
  were trafficked through the country to the Gulf states. Afghan women and girls were
  trafficked to the country for sexual exploitation and forced marriages.
  Internal trafficking for sexual exploitation and forced labor also occurs. It
  was difficult to measure the extent of the government's efforts to curb human
  trafficking. It appears that the government did not fully comply with the
  minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking, but it has made
  significant efforts to do so. In 2004 the government conducted a study on
  trafficking of women, passed a law against human trafficking, and signed
  separate Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) with Afghanistan,
  Turkey,
  IOM, and the International Labor Organization (ILO). According to Pakistani
  press reports in December, Iran,
  Pakistan, Greece, and Turkey formed a joint working
  group to fight human trafficking. On September 22, domestic media reported
  that the Tehran
  police chief stated eight human trafficking networks smuggling mostly
  Bangladeshis, Afghans, and Pakistanis had been broken up and members
  arrested. During 2004 border police arrested more than 250 Pakistanis
  smuggled into the country, some of whom likely were trafficking victims. </span></p> <p class="g"><span>All

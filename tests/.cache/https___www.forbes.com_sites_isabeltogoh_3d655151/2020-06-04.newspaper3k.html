I studied Social Anthropology at the London School of Economics, where I was a writer and editor for one of the university&#8217;s global affairs magazines, the London Globalist. That led me to Goldsmiths, University of London, where I completed my M.A. in Journalism. Got a story? Get in touch at isabel.togoh@forbes.com, or follow me on Twitter @bissieness.

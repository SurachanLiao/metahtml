<p><strong>Just when you thought that Washington could not sink any lower in the international diplomacy game, the Trump White House compounds its previous misdeed by issuing a public death threat against the successor of assassinated Quds Force General Qasem Soleimani.</strong></p>

<p>Soleimani was&#160;<a href="https://21stcenturywire.com/2020/01/09/trump-stands-down-against-iran-but-still-in-denial-of-this-new-middle-east/">killed by a US drone strike on January 3</a>, along with senior Iraqi PMU commander,&#160;<strong>Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis</strong>.</p>
<p>Hook continued saying,&#8220;We will hold the regime and its agents responsible for any attack on Americans or American interests in the region.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hook also went on to boast that Washington&#8217;s state-sponsored assassination of Soleimani has made the Middle East a safer place because it has&#160;&#8220;create a vacuum that the Regime will not be able to fill,&#8221;&#160;inferring that Ghaani will not be able to marshal &#8220;Iran&#8217;s agents in the region&#8221;.</p>
<p>Hook also repeated the common talking point that Soleimani was the &#8216;world&#8217;s most dangerous terrorist&#8217; &#8211; a label which hardly corresponds with facts which clearly demonstrate that the Iranian military leader was leading the fight against ISIS and al-Qaeda in Iraq and Syria.</p>
<p>In the interview, Hook also used the opportunity to reinforce another State Department narrative which still claims that Iran somehow launched the September attack on Saudi Arabia&#8217;s Aramco oil facilities &#8211; even though the likely culprit, Yemen&#8217;s&#160;Houthi&#160;rebel forces,&#160;<a href="https://21stcenturywire.com/2019/09/21/latest-trump-to-deploy-more-us-troops-and-equipment-to-saudi-arabia-and-uae/">had already taken credit</a>&#160;for the attack.</p>

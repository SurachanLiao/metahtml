The female assassins then immediately hailed a cab and left the scene. Meanwhile, Jong-nam died&#160;in an ambulance on the way to Putrajaya Hospital&#160;after collapsing at the airport.</p><p class="code-block-label">(Advertisement Below)</p><p>The eldest son of former North Korean dictator Kim Jong-il, Jong-nam had fallen out of favor with his home country as of late after speaking out publicly&#160;against his family&#8217;s dynastic control of the isolated state.&#160;Consequently, he began to fear for his life. It now appears that he had every reason to worry that he would be targeted by his tyrannical half-brother.</p><p>Fadzil Ahmat, an official with the Malaysian police, told <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-malaysia-kim-idUSKBN15T1DN">Reuters</a>:</p><p class="code-block-label">(Advertisement Below)</p><blockquote><p>So far there are no suspects, but we have started investigations and are looking at a few possibilities to get leads.</p>
<p>The deceased &#8230; felt like someone grabbed or held his face from behind.&#160;He felt dizzy, so he asked for help at the &#8230; counter of KLIA.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t know if there was a cloth or needles; the receptionist said someone grabbed his face, he felt dizzy.</p></blockquote><p>Cheong Seong-Jang, the&#160;senior researcher at Seoul&#8217;s Sejong Institute think-tank, said that &#8220;if Jong-Nam committed an act to damage Jong-Un&#8217;s authority, I think it&#8217;s possible that the Reconnaissance General Bureau may have directly conducted the assassination under the orders of Jong-Un since it has been in charge of closely watching Jong-Nam.&#8221;</p><p>It&#8217;s difficult to imagine a scenario where family feuds are settled through covert assassinations, though this is the norm when it comes to North Korea.</p></article>

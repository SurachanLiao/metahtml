The female assassins then immediately hailed a cab and left the scene. Meanwhile, Jong-nam died in an ambulance on the way to Putrajaya Hospital after collapsing at the airport.</p><p class="code-block-label">(Advertisement Below)</p><p>The eldest son of former North Korean dictator Kim Jong-il, Jong-nam had fallen out of favor with his home country as of late after speaking out publicly against his family’s dynastic control of the isolated state. Consequently, he began to fear for his life. It now appears that he had every reason to worry that he would be targeted by his tyrannical half-brother.</p> <del><img class="size-full wp-image-205175" src="https://madworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/0B94B84B000005DC-0-image-a-20_1487072141935.jpg" alt="" width="634" height="631"></del> <p>Fadzil Ahmat, an official with the Malaysian police, told <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-malaysia-kim-idUSKBN15T1DN">Reuters</a>:</p><p class="code-block-label">(Advertisement Below)</p><blockquote><p>So far there are no suspects, but we have started investigations and are looking at a few possibilities to get leads.</p> <p>The deceased … felt like someone grabbed or held his face from behind. He felt dizzy, so he asked for help at the … counter of KLIA.</p> <p>We don’t know if there was a cloth or needles; the receptionist said someone grabbed his face, he felt dizzy.</p></blockquote> <del><img class="size-full wp-image-205176" src="https://madworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/3CECE77900000578-4223088-image-a-43_1487074442370.jpg" alt="" width="634" height="425"></del> <p>Cheong Seong-Jang, the senior researcher at Seoul’s Sejong Institute think-tank, said that “if Jong-Nam committed an act to damage Jong-Un’s authority, I think it’s possible that the Reconnaissance General Bureau may have directly conducted the assassination under the orders of Jong-Un since it has been in charge of closely watching Jong-Nam.”</p><p>It’s difficult to imagine a scenario where family feuds are settled through covert assassinations, though this is the norm when it comes to North Korea.</p></article> <p class="code-block-label"><del>(Advertisement Below)</del></p><del> </del><p><del>[H/T: <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4223088/Half-brother-Kim-Jong-dies-Malaysia.html">Mail Online Link: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4223088/Half-brother-Kim-Jong-dies-Malaysia.html </a>]</del></p><del> </del><p class="swp_social_panel swp_horizontal_panel swp_flat_fresh  swp_default_full_color swp_individual_full_color swp_other_full_color scale-100  scale-"><del></del></p><p class="swp-content-locator"><del></del></p>

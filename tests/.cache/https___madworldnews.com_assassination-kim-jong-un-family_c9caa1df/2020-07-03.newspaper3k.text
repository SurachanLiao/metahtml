Kim Jong-nam, the 45-year-old half-brother of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un, was assassinated at Kuala Lumpur airport while awaiting a flight to Macau on Monday. Now, reports out of Malaysia appear to reveal who ordered the killing, and the information is enough to send chills down your spine.

Proving his bitter ruthlessness, Kim Jong-un allegedly had his own brother assassinated by two women who snuck up from behind and attacked him with either poisoned needles or toxic spray, though the cause of death has not yet been confirmed, pending the results of an autopsy. The female assassins then immediately hailed a cab and left the scene. Meanwhile, Jong-nam died in an ambulance on the way to Putrajaya Hospital after collapsing at the airport.

The eldest son of former North Korean dictator Kim Jong-il, Jong-nam had fallen out of favor with his home country as of late after speaking out publicly against his family’s dynastic control of the isolated state. Consequently, he began to fear for his life. It now appears that he had every reason to worry that he would be targeted by his tyrannical half-brother.

Fadzil Ahmat, an official with the Malaysian police, told Reuters:

So far there are no suspects, but we have started investigations and are looking at a few possibilities to get leads. The deceased … felt like someone grabbed or held his face from behind. He felt dizzy, so he asked for help at the … counter of KLIA. We don’t know if there was a cloth or needles; the receptionist said someone grabbed his face, he felt dizzy.

Cheong Seong-Jang, the senior researcher at Seoul’s Sejong Institute think-tank, said that “if Jong-Nam committed an act to damage Jong-Un’s authority, I think it’s possible that the Reconnaissance General Bureau may have directly conducted the assassination under the orders of Jong-Un since it has been in charge of closely watching Jong-Nam.”

It’s difficult to imagine a scenario where family feuds are settled through covert assassinations, though this is the norm when it comes to North Korea.

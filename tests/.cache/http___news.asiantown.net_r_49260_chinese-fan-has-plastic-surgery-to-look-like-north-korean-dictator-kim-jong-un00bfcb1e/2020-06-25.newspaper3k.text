Wang Lei, from Nanjing, Jiangsu Province is a Kim Jong-un lookalike

He has undergone plastic surgery to look like the North Korean dictator

Wang Lei was caught by photographerwhile on a "date" with a model

Wang Lei is the spitting image of the 32-year-old "Dear Leader" of North Korea, and has reportedly gone under the knife to enhance his likeness.

He was caught by photographers in Nanjing, capital of east Chinaâ€™s Jiangsu Province, after bumping into a fellow plastic surgery lover - and going on a date.

Wang Lei met Liu Zixuan, an actress based in Nanjing, at a plastic surgery clinic when she went for a check-up following a breast enlargement.

The couple discovered their mutual interest in artificial body alterations and arranged to go on a gold date - inviting photographers to come along.

The pair attracted crowd attention as they walked through town and Wang Lei took it in his stride, waving back to "fans" and posed for pictures.

Many people could not help but say that he was too into his character, local media reports.

Liu Zixuan, 31, has been attracting media attention after announcing that she opted to have a boob job after her favourite social media celebrity revealed that a sizeable chest is what attracts him to a partner.

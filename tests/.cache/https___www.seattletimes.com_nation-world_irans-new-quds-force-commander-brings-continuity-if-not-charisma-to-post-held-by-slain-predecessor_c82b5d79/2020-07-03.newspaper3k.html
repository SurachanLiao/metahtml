<div><p>ISTANBUL &#8212; Just hours after a U.S. drone strike killed Iran&#8217;s charismatic elite Quds Force commander in Baghdad early Friday, Tehran announced it had named a successor: the force&#8217;s little-known deputy chief, Brig. Gen. Ismail Qaani.</p><p>Qaani, 62, was appointed by supreme leader Ali Khamenei, who issued a statement praising the general&#8217;s role as a prominent commander in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. As a key branch of the Revolutionary Guard, the country&#8217;s most powerful security organ, the Quds Force carries out the Iranian military&#8217;s special operations abroad.</p><p>Qaani&#8217;s predecessor, Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani, was a larger-than-life figure and deft architect of Iran&#8217;s success in building loyal proxy forces in the Middle East. It is a network that Tehran used to help defeat the Islamic State and to project military and political power in places such as Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Yemen.</p><p>But the bespectacled Qaani &#8212; whose portfolio as deputy included Quds Force operations in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Central Asian republics &#8212; boasts few notable military victories. Instead, experts say, he is believed to have focused on the organization&#8217;s day-to-day administrative affairs.</p><p>&#8220;Qaani&#8217;s war-era record does not display the same degree of distinction as Soleimani&#8217;s,&#8221; said Ali Alfoneh, a senior fellow at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington and author of &#8220;Iran Unveiled: How the Revolutionary Guards are Transforming Iran from Theocracy Into Military Dictatorship.&#8221;</p><p>Arash Azizi, a New York-based writer who is researching a forthcoming book on Iran&#8217;s external military operations, said: &#8220;Qaani was presumed to be the heir apparent for a long time. But he&#8217;s very bureaucratic &#8212; he does not have Soleimani&#8217;s charisma.&#8221;</p><p class="ad-label font-micro u-tc u-mid-light-gray u-sans pv-10 u-upper">Advertising</p>

<p>&#8220;As someone who works in Iran&#8217;s national security apparatus, he hasn&#8217;t really distinguished himself,&#8221; Azizi said.</p><p>What the obscure new commander brings, however, is continuity in the face of an extraordinary blow to the Quds Force&#8217;s leadership, analysts say. As deputy commander, a position he assumed in the late 1990s or early 2000s, according to reports, he possesses intimate knowledge of the force&#8217;s inner workings and covert activities.</p><p>&#8220;Under Qaani&#8217;s leadership, there is likely to be greater continuity than change in the Quds Force,&#8221; said Alfoneh.</p><p>&#8220;I suspect he&#8217;ll have little difficulty filling Soleimani&#8217;s shoes when it comes to operations and strategy,&#8221; said Afshon Ostovar, author of &#8220;Vanguard of the Imam: Religion, Politics, and Iran&#8217;s Revolutionary Guards.&#8221;</p><p>Qaani first joined the Revolutionary Guard as a young man in 1980, when it was a nascent force tasked with protecting the Islamic Republic. He soon became division commander, leading battles in the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s, and oversaw operations in northeastern Iran, where he was born.</p><p>There, according to Alfoneh, Qaani likely helped facilitate support for Afghanistan&#8217;s Northern Alliance, a group of fighters that sought to overthrow the Taliban, a Sunni militant movement that came to power in 1996.</p><p class="ad-label font-micro u-tc u-mid-light-gray u-sans pv-10 u-upper">Advertising</p>

<p>In 1998, when Taliban forces attacked Iran&#8217;s consulate in the northern Afghan city of Mazar-e Sharif, killing nine diplomats, Qaani was instrumental in dissuading Tehran&#8217;s leadership from responding militarily, Azizi said.</p><p>&#8220;Many people were eager for Iran to take action,&#8221; Azizi said. &#8220;It was an act of maturity on Qaani&#8217;s part in deciding not do anything rash.&#8221;</p><p>Qaani and his predecessor appear to have divided the labor: Soleimani operated on Iran&#8217;s western front, while Qaani&#8217;s focus remained on its eastern borders.</p><p id="userMessagingInset" class="user-messaging animate"></p><p>Qaani also once traveled with Iran&#8217;s then-president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, to several countries in Africa and South America. In 2012, the Treasury Department sanctioned Qaani for overseeing the distribution of the Quds Force&#8217;s finances to regional allies. He was also responsible for a weapons shipment to Gambia that was intercepted in Nigeria in 2010, the department said.</p><p>He is also believed to have to have played a prominent role in establishing Liwa al-Fatemiyoun, a military brigade of mostly Afghan Shiite Hazaras who were deployed to Syria to assist government forces.</p><p>In 2012, Qaani was the first Revolutionary Guard commander to publicly acknowledge Iran&#8217;s military presence in Syria, telling an Iranian news outlet that due to Iran&#8217;s involvement in the war, &#8220;big massacres were prevented.&#8221;</p><p class="ad-label font-micro u-tc u-mid-light-gray u-sans pv-10 u-upper">Advertising</p>

<p>&#8220;Qaani seems to be a more cagey personality than his predecessor. But like Soleimani, Qaani seems to have a strong personal relationship with the supreme leader,&#8221; said Ostovar.</p><p>His decades-long career at the highest levels of the Revolutionary Guard &#8220;says a lot about the trust both Khamenei and Soleimani had in him,&#8221; he said.</p><p>Still, experts say, Qaani lacks broader experience in the Arab world, an area crucial to Iran&#8217;s efforts to counter U.S. and Israeli military power.</p>      <p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think that he speaks Arabic, and he doesn&#8217;t have the same understanding of the Arab world or of Israel that Soleimani had,&#8221; said Azizi.</p><p>According to Ostovar, &#8220;it&#8217;s unlikely that Qaani&#8217;s friendships with proxy commanders are as well developed or run as deep as Soleimani&#8217;s.&#8221;</p><p>As a result, he will &#8220;probably run operations primarily from a distance,&#8221; Ostovar said. &#8220;Even if he wanted to replicate Soleimani&#8217;s general-on-the-frontlines photo ops, it&#8217;ll be difficult for him to do now.&#8221;</p>           </div>

  <p class="MsoBodyText">In June of 1980, the <i>New York Times </i>reported that the new leader of Iran, the
  Ayatollah Khomeini, was complaining loudly that many people who had served
  under the Shah had not been purged from the government bureaucracies. &#147;He
  singled out the Foreign Ministry for criticism, saying that in this
  department and in other ministries there were &#145;the same emblems and the same
  corruption&#146; as before.&#148;<a name="ftnref0"></a><a href="#ftn0">[0]</a> It
  is curious that he should not have singled out SAVAK -- especially SAVAK.<p></p></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">SAVAK had been the Iranian Shah (King) Mohammed Reza
  Pahlavi's feared security service, which routinely tortured and assassinated
  dissidents, and spied on everybody. It had been created by the CIA after the
  CIA installed the shah in power in a 1953 coup d'&#233;tat.<a name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> &#160;As a dissident leader prior to
  the Iranian Revolution of 1979, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini had been
  denouncing SAVAK. So why so much noise now about other ministries being full
  of Shah agents and nothing in particular about SAVAK?<p></p></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">Earlier the same month, the Washington Post had
  published an interesting article with the title: &#147;Khomeini Is Reported to
  Have a SAVAK of His Own.&#148;<a name="_ftnref1a"></a><a href="#_ftn1a">[1a]</a>
  And what was Khomeini&#146;s own SAVAK like? It was none other than <i>SAVAK
  itself</i>. Here is what the Washington Post writes (emphases are mine):<p></p></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">&#147;Though it
  came to power denouncing the shah&#146;s dreaded SAVAK secret service, the
  government of Iran&#146;s Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini has created a new internal
  security and intelligence operation, <i>apparently with a similar
  organizational structure and some of the same faces as its predecessor</i>.<p></p></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">The new
  organization is called SAVAMA. It is run, according to U.S. sources and Iranian
  exile sources here and in Paris, by Gen. Hossein Fardoust, who was <i>deputy
  chief of SAVAK under the former shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and a friend from
  boyhood of the deposed monarch</i>.<p></p></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">...&#145;SAVAK is
  alive and kicking&#146; in the form of SAVAMA, claims Ali Tabatabai, former press
  counselor at the Iranian Embassy in Washington under the shah... now
  president of the Iran Freedom Foundation in Bethesda [Maryland, near
  Washington D.C.]&#133; &#145;There are large numbers of former SAVAK people&#146; in the new
  organization, he says. &#145;In fact, with the exception of the bureau chiefs [who
  ran the individual sections of SAVAK] <i>the whole organization seems to be
  intact</i>.&#146;<p></p></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">In Paris, a
  French lawyer who specializes in representing Iranian exiles told Washington
  Post correspondent Ronald Koven that <i>&#145;SAVAMA is SAVAK without any
  change in structure. They just replaced some of the chiefs...</i><p></p></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">...Tabatabai,
  who claims he has good sources on the situation in Tehran, says that <i>SAVAMA&#146;s
  organization &#145;is almost a carbon copy&#146; of SAVAK&#146;s</i>, with nine bureaus.
  These, he said, cover personnel, collection of foreign intelligence,
  collection of domestic intelligence, surveillance of its own agents and
  security of its own agents and security of government buildings,
  communications, finances, analysis of collected intelligence,
  counterintelligence, and recruitment and training.&#148;<p></p></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">What Tabatabai is describing above is the security
  apparatus of a totalitarian police state: the nine bureaus of SAVAK/SAVAMA
  were spying on ordinary Iranians and even on SAVAK/SAVAMA itself. They were
  also torturing and murdering ordinary Iranians, as they judged it necessary:
  &#147;SAVAK used torture systematically as a tool of internal repression.&#148; The
  Ayatollah Khomeini, of course, installed a totalitarian police state, so from
  this point of view swallowing SAVAK -- which had a great deal of experience
  running <i>the shah&#146;s </i>totalitarian police state -- was convenient. But it
  was still a perfectly absurd thing for Khomeini to do if he was really an
  enemy of the US ruling elite, because it was this ruling elite&#146;s CIA that had
  installed Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi in power and created SAVAK for him, and
  therefore only an ally of the US ruling elite would welcome the &#147;very close
  ties that SAVAK, under the shah, [had] maintained with the U.S. Central
  Intelligence Agency.&#148;<p></p></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">Of course, US officials were very busy telling
  everybody that the Ayatollah Khomeini (whom they would soon start arming to
  the teeth, in secret, for the entire duration of the Iran-Iraq war<a name="_ftnref1b"></a><a href="#_ftn1b">[1b]</a>) was supposedly their enemy,
  so they rushed to deny that there was really <i>that </i>much SAVAK in
  SAVAMA. As reported in the same article:<p></p></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">&#147;In
  Washington, however, U.S. government analysts offer a more subdued
  assessment.<p></p></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">&#145;It may be
  tempting to look at SAVAMA as SAVAK reborn,&#146; one source said, &#145;but that is
  too fanciful for the facts.&#146; &#133;U.S. sources say that some vestiges of the
  previous system could be useful [to new regime]. So, some former SAVAK
  functionaries -- described as &#145;lower level&#146; -- who were able to function for
  the shah without being tainted now work for Khomeini.&#148;<p></p></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">Uh-huh. But as you can see from one of the quotes
  above, the one thing that both US and Iranian exile sources were definitely
  agreeing on was that &#147;SAVAMA&#133;is run&#133;by Gen. Hossein Fardoust, who was deputy
  chief of SAVAK under the former shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi...&#148;<p></p></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">Not only that:<p></p></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">&#147;Fardoust...[was]
  a longtime friend, classmate and confidant of the shah. Fardoust, Tabatabai
  says, was also head of a special SAVAK bureau that summarized all intelligence
  information. Fardoust delivered it personally to the shah daily.&#148;<p></p></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">This Fardoust was not exactly &#147;lower level,&#148; was he?
  Nor was he merely &#147;tainted&#148;: <i>Fardoust had been running Iran for the shah.</i>
  It also turns out that &#147;Fardoust&#146;s deputy at SAVAMA is said to be Gen. Ali
  Mohammed Kaveh, formerly the head of the SAVAK bureau dealing with analysis
  of collected intelligence.&#148; This Kaveh was not exactly &#147;lower level&#148; either.
  Finally, &#147;In three former bureaus dealing with personnel organization and
  summation of intelligence, Tabatabai claims, every member who worked for
  Fardoust when he was deputy chief of SAVAK still works for him as chief of
  SAVAMA.&#148;<p></p></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">The US ruling elite did not support Ali Tabatabai&#146;s
  Iran Freedom Foundation, which wanted to topple Khomeini,<a name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> and it was awkward for the US ruling
  elite that Ali Tabatabai was explaining out loud how the Ayatollah was
  running Iran with the CIA&#146;s SAVAK, just like the shah had before him. It is
  possible that Tabatabai's assassination in his Bethesda, Maryland home,
  shortly after he made the above statements to the press, was unrelated to the
  CIA.<a name="_ftnref3">[3]</a> However, it does
  seem significant that,<p></p></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">&#147;Only
  Tabatabai was willing to let his name be attached publicly to the foundation.
  Only Tabatabai was eager to go before television cameras and radio
  microphones to discuss the positions of the foundation. In the end, said one
  of the original 10 [founders] who asked that his name not be used, their
  fears for the safety of their families and themselves were borne out by what happened
  to Tabatabai. ...&#145;Our object was primarily to expose the true nature of
  Khomeini,&#146; he said.<p></p></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">...Tabatabai
  was president of the foundation as well as its spokesman. Because of his
  prominent public profile, the Iran Freedom FOUNDATION (IFF) became in turn
  the most widely known of nine anti-Khomeini groups in the United States.<p></p></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">...In all
  cases, it was Tabatabai who took the public stage. ... He appeared on talk
  shows, both radio and television, locally, nationally and in Canada. He
  helped organize a major anti-Khomeini demonstration in Los Angeles earlier
  this month, designed to bring together the different anti-Khomeini groups.&#148;<a name="_ftnref4">[4]</a><p></p></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">In other words, Tabatai had a big mouth, and he was
  the only person that needed shutting up -- everybody else had already gotten
  the message. With Tabatabai out of the picture, problem solved. And indeed, I
  was unable to find mention of the SAVAK/SAVAMA identity in newspaper articles
  since. On the contrary: the next year, <i>The New York Times </i>'informed'
  the public in a headline that &#147;[SAVAMA] Isn&#146;t Like Savak Under Sha,&#148; stating
  in the body of the text that &#147;Savak [was] disbanded after the 1979
  revolution.&#148;<a name="_ftnref5">[5]</a> An article in <i>The
  Christian Science Monitor</i>, the same year, did say that &#147;Savama [was] the
  name given [to] the reconstituted Savak secret police organization, so long a
  weapon of terror and torture in the late Shah&#146;s hands,&#148; but it rushed to
  assure its readers that the reason &#147;many Savak members gladly serve in
  Savama&#148; was &#147;to save their own skins.&#148;<a name="_ftnref6">[6]</a> This,
  however, does not answer the obvious question: <i>Why would Khomeini trust them?</i> For SAVAK to become SAVAMA it is
  not enough that SAVAK members want to survive and thrive; it is also
  necessary that Khomeini have no problem making people trained by &#145;Great Satan,&#146;
  and until very recently working for &#145;Great Satan,&#146; the very basis of his own
  power.<p></p></p>

people from the city at the center of the coronavirus outbreak were also booked on the flight — leading to an hours-long standoff, according to reports.</p> <p>More than 70 passengers refused to board the Chinese Southern Airlines plane in Nagoya, Japan, after recognizing the accents of 16 fellow travelers meant they came from Wuhan, where the deadly virus originated, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10835094/coronavirus-passengers-refuse-plane-people-from-wuhan/">the Sun reported</a>, citing the Asian News Agency.</p> <p>Wuhan has been on lockdown following the emergence of the mysterious illness last month, but <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/01/27/half-of-wuhans-population-fled-town-before-lockdown-raising-risk-of-spread/">millions of people</a> had left the city before the quarantine began.</p> <p>The passengers demanded the Wuhan travelers be barred from the flight to Shanghai — but eventually relented once staff from the Chinese consulate in Nagoya stepped in to mediate, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7937943/Air-passengers-refuse-board-plane-16-tourists-Wuhan.html">the Daily Mail reported</a>.</p> <p>All of the passengers eventually boarded the plane, which landed five hours later than scheduled at Shanghai Pudong International Airport, the Sun reported.</p> <p class="tag-list"><ins><span>Filed under</span> <a

About TED
</h3>
<p class="c:gray-d l-h:n t-a:c@md m-w:measure m-x:a">
TED is a nonpartisan nonprofit devoted to spreading ideas, usually in the form of short, powerful talks. TED began in 1984 as a conference where Technology, Entertainment and Design converged, and today covers almost all topics &#8212; from science to business to global issues &#8212; in more than 110 languages. Meanwhile, independently run TEDx events help share ideas in communities around the world.

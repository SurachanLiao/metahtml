None of the medical experts at the briefing suggested that these were plausible treatments for people already infected.</p><p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" type="text">“Supposing we hit the body with a tremendous — whether it’s ultraviolet or just very powerful light. And I think you said that hasn’t been checked, but we’re going to test it,” Trump said. “And then I said, supposing you brought the light inside the body, either through the skin or some other way.”</p><p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" type="text">As Bryan looked on uncomfortably, the president went on to speculate about the possibility of using disinfectants as a treatment.</p><p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" type="text">“And then I see the disinfectant where it knocks it out in a minute, one minute. And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning? Because you see it gets in the lungs and does a tremendous number on the lungs,” Trump continued.</p><p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" type="text">“It would be interesting to check that. That you’re gonna have to use medical doctors with, but it sounds interesting to me, so we’ll see.”</p><p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" type="text">Asked directly whether Trump’s suggestion that injecting bleach or using light to treat COVID-19 made sense, Bryan said his laboratory was not pursuing those ideas.</p><p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" type="text">The temperatures Bryan’s laboratory had been researching in terms of their effect on the coronavirus were in the range of 70 degrees to 95 degrees.

At the same time, the president said he had not read new studies that seemed to show that the drugs <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/touted-by-trump-hydroxychloroquine-and-remdesivir-fail-as-coronavirus-therapy-in-preliminary-studies-185031030.html">hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir</a>, which he has championed despite a lack of clinical trials, were not effective in treating COVID-19.</p><p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" type="text">Pressed by reporters on whether Bryan’s findings were enough to guarantee that it was safe to reopen the country in the coming weeks, Trump dialed back expectations.</p><p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" type="text">“I hope people enjoy the sun, and if it has an impact that’s great,” Trump said. “I’m just hearing this, not really for the first time, there’s been a rumor that, a very nice rumor, that you go outside in the sun or you have heat and that does have an affect on other viruses. But now we get it from one of the great laboratories in the world, I have to say.”</p><p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" type="text">The president then returned to his theory that light and heat might be harnessed to treat patients sickened by the coronavirus.</p><p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" type="text">“I would like you to speak to the medical doctors to see if there’s any way that you can apply light and heat to cure, you know? If you could, and maybe you can, maybe you can’t,” Trump said. “Again, I say, maybe you can, maybe you can’t. I’m not a doctor, but I’m like a person who has a good — you know what.”</p><p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" type="text">Trump then turned to Dr. Deborah Birx, one of the leading scientific experts on the task force, and asked, “Have you ever heard of that?”</p><p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" type="text">“Not as a treatment,” Birx responded. “I mean, certainly fever is a good thing. When you have a fever it helps your body respond.”</p><p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" type="text">“I think it’s a great thing to look at,” Trump added.</p><p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" type="text">When Washington Post reporter Phil Rucker then told Trump that people tuned into the briefings not to hear rumors, but to learn useful information, Trump responded, “I’m the president and you’re fake news.”</p> <p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" type="text"><ins>Dismayed physicians, however, took to Twitter during the briefing to warn patients not to use common cleaning products to counteract the coronavirus.</ins></p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p><ins>Hi, ER Doc here.

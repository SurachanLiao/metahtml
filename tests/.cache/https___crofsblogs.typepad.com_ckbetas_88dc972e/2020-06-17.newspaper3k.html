<div><a></a><p>I have just read, watched, and listened to John Branch's <a title="Snow Fall: The Avalanche at Tunnel Creek - Multimedia Feature - NYTimes.com" href="https://www.nytimes.com/projects/2012/snow-fall/#/?part=tunnel-creek">Snow Fall: The Avalanche at Tunnel Creek</a> published by The New York Times. Anyone who writes long text for the web needs to become familiar with it, and to study how it was put together.</p><p>The text is core, and brilliantly suited to the medium: short sentences, short paragraphs, displayed in short lines.</p> 
<p>Inset in the margin are photos and videos of the people involved. The narrative is broken into six segments, each set off with a dramatic graphic. Animated maps trace the paths of the skiers and snowboarders down the mountain, and the path taken by the avalanche.</p> 
<p>The result is a powerful multimedia narrative. More importantly, it's a benchmark: This is how such narratives can be created with our present technology, and with enough resources to exploit that technology. Not all stories can be told this way, or need to be. But some stories will be enormously enhanced by the techniques used in "Snow Fall."</p>

We could end up with a digital dystopia if we don’t turn things around. It’s not that we need a 10-year plan for the web, we need to turn the web around now.”  </ins></blockquote><ins> </ins><blockquote cite="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/24/tim-berners-lee-unveils-global-plan-to-save-the-internet"><ins>The contract, which has been worked on by 80 organisations for more than a year, outlines nine central principles to safeguard the web – three each for governments, companies and individuals. </ins></blockquote><ins> </ins><blockquote cite="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/24/tim-berners-lee-unveils-global-plan-to-save-the-internet"><ins>The document, published by Berners-Lee’s <a href="https://webfoundation.org/">Web Foundation Link: https://webfoundation.org/ </a>, has the backing of more than 150 organisations, from Microsoft, Google and Facebook to the digital rights group the Electronic Frontier Foundation. At the time of writing, neither Amazon nor Twitter had endorsed the principles.  </ins></blockquote><ins> </ins><blockquote cite="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/24/tim-berners-lee-unveils-global-plan-to-save-the-internet"><ins>Those who back the contract must show they are implementing the principles and working on solutions to the tougher problems, or face being removed from the list of endorsers. If the stipulation is properly enforced, some may not last long. A report from Amnesty International accuses Google and Facebook of “enabling human rights harm at a population scale”. The report comes weeks after Google was found to have acquired the personal health records of 50 million Americans without their consent.</ins></blockquote><ins> </ins><blockquote cite="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/24/tim-berners-lee-unveils-global-plan-to-save-the-internet"><ins>The contract’s principles require governments to do all they can to ensure that everyone who wants to can connect to the web and have their privacy respected. People should have access to whatever personal data is held on them and have the right to object or withdraw from having that data processed.  </ins></blockquote><ins> </ins><blockquote cite="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/24/tim-berners-lee-unveils-global-plan-to-save-the-internet"><ins>Further principles oblige companies to make internet access affordable and calls on them to develop web services for people with disabilities and those who speak minority languages. To build trust online, companies are compelled to simplify privacy settings by providing control panels where people can access their data and manage their privacy options in one place. </ins></blockquote><ins> </ins><blockquote cite="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/24/tim-berners-lee-unveils-global-plan-to-save-the-internet"><ins>Another principle requires companies to diversify their workforces, consult broad communities before and after they release new products, and assess the risk of their technology spreading misinformation or harming people’s behaviour or personal wellbeing. </ins></blockquote><ins> </ins><blockquote cite="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/24/tim-berners-lee-unveils-global-plan-to-save-the-internet"><ins>Three more principles call on individuals to create rich and relevant content to make the web a valuable place, build strong online communities where everyone feels safe and welcome, and finally, to fight for the web, so it remains open to everyone, everywhere. </ins></blockquote><ins> </ins><blockquote cite="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/24/tim-berners-lee-unveils-global-plan-to-save-the-internet"><ins>“The forces taking the web in the wrong direction have always been very strong,” Berners-Lee said. “Whether you’re a company or a government, controlling the web is a way to make huge profits, or a way of ensuring you remain in power. The people are arguably the most important part of this, because it’s only the people who will be motivated to hold the other two to account.”</ins></blockquote><ins> </ins><p class="entry-footer-info"><ins><span class="post-footers">Posted at 06:59 PM in <a href="https://crofsblogs.typepad.com/ckbetas/current_affairs/">Current Affairs Link: https://crofsblogs.typepad.com/ckbetas/current_affairs/ </a>, <a href="https://crofsblogs.typepad.com/ckbetas/politics-and-the-web/">Politics and the web Link: https://crofsblogs.typepad.com/ckbetas/politics-and-the-web/ </a>, <a href="https://crofsblogs.typepad.com/ckbetas/social-media/">Social media Link: https://crofsblogs.typepad.com/ckbetas/social-media/ </a>, <a href="https://crofsblogs.typepad.com/ckbetas/tweeting/">Tweeting Link: https://crofsblogs.typepad.com/ckbetas/tweeting/ </a>, <a href="https://crofsblogs.typepad.com/ckbetas/webwriting/">Webwriting Link: https://crofsblogs.typepad.com/ckbetas/webwriting/ </a> </span> <span class="separator">|</span> <a class="permalink" href="https://crofsblogs.typepad.com/ckbetas/2019/11/tim-berners-lee-unveils-global-plan-to-save-the-web-technology-the-guardian.html">Permalink Link: https://crofsblogs.typepad.com/ckbetas/2019/11/tim-berners-lee-unveils-global-plan-to-save-the-web-technology-the-guardian.html </a> <span class="separator">|</span> <a class="entry-comments" href="https://crofsblogs.typepad.com/ckbetas/2019/11/tim-berners-lee-unveils-global-plan-to-save-the-web-technology-the-guardian.html#comments">Comments (1) Link: https://crofsblogs.typepad.com/ckbetas/2019/11/tim-berners-lee-unveils-global-plan-to-save-the-web-technology-the-guardian.html#comments </a> </ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="entry-footer-share entry-footer-share-buttons"><ins><span class="entry-footer-links-reblog"><a href="#" class="share-link share-link-reblog" title="Grab this post for your own blog">Reblog

It was 1978, and I was bored to death with structuralism and post-structuralism. I wrote with a cheap ballpoint pen in the exercise book that I used for lecture notes. I noticed at once that the time passed differently when writing a story. It wasn’t quicker or slower, simply absent. You moved into a dream space. You didn’t know whether it was early or late. </ins></blockquote><ins> </ins><blockquote cite="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/do-we-write-differently-on-a-screen"><ins>When I finished, I typed up the story on a small manual typewriter. I have to thank America for teaching me how to type fast, with all fingers and never looking at the keys. In England, you gave your weekly essay assignments to professors handwritten. In the States, they had to be typed. Walking back through the campus, late on spring evenings, you could hear a clatter of typewriters from open windows. I bought a book called “Teach Yourself Typewriting.”  </ins></blockquote><ins> </ins><blockquote cite="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/do-we-write-differently-on-a-screen"><ins>When a story was typed, you let it rest, then reread it and made handwritten corrections. Then reread it again. Then again. Then typed it up again, hopefully without mistakes. A lot of paper was thrown away. A lot of Wite-Out was used. You were a craftsman, producing pieces of paper with neat black signs. After making photocopies, you sent the story, by post, to a magazine, and it came back, months later, with a rejection and perhaps some suggestions how to improve it. You rewrote and retyped and re-sent. </ins></blockquote><ins> </ins><blockquote cite="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/do-we-write-differently-on-a-screen"><ins>It was many years before I had a story published. Meantime, I moved back to the U.K., then, with my Italian wife, to Verona, where I began to translate. Here, typing skills were invaluable. You rode your moped into town in the morning, picked up a piece of work—perhaps a description of a marble-quarrying machine—rode home and had to translate it onto camera-ready paper for evening delivery and immediate printing. There was no time for rough drafts. You read each sentence, thought it through, produced an English version in your head, and typed it out perfect the first time. It was a fantastic discipline. And hugely stressful.  </ins></blockquote><ins> </ins><blockquote cite="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/do-we-write-differently-on-a-screen"><ins>In the early eighties, we bought an electric typewriter that could memorize about half a page before printing it out. To read the page, you had to scroll it from right to left, on a single line of display, between keyboard and print roller. It cost the equivalent of a thousand euros in today’s money and wasn’t satisfactory. </ins></blockquote><ins> </ins><blockquote cite="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/do-we-write-differently-on-a-screen"><ins>A year or two later, we spent double that for a machine that could memorize a fantastic four pages on an audiocassette and offered a yellowish monochrome screen where you could read as many as fifteen lines at once. That was the machine on which I translated Roberto Calasso’s “The Marriage of Cadmus and Harmony.” On more than one occasion, the audiocassette jammed and four pages of work were lost.</ins></blockquote><ins> </ins><p class="entry-footer-info"><ins><span class="post-footers">Posted at 04:53 PM in <a href="https://crofsblogs.typepad.com/ckbetas/webwriting/">Webwriting Link: https://crofsblogs.typepad.com/ckbetas/webwriting/ </a> </span> <span class="separator">|</span> <a class="permalink" href="https://crofsblogs.typepad.com/ckbetas/2019/02/do-we-write-differently-on-a-screen.html">Permalink Link: https://crofsblogs.typepad.com/ckbetas/2019/02/do-we-write-differently-on-a-screen.html </a> <span class="separator">|</span> <a class="entry-comments" href="https://crofsblogs.typepad.com/ckbetas/2019/02/do-we-write-differently-on-a-screen.html#comments">Comments (1) Link: https://crofsblogs.typepad.com/ckbetas/2019/02/do-we-write-differently-on-a-screen.html#comments </a> </ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="entry-footer-share entry-footer-share-buttons"><ins><span class="entry-footer-links-reblog"><a href="#" class="share-link share-link-reblog" title="Grab this post for your own blog">Reblog

I’ve caught myself squinting and holding the screen closer to my face. I’ve worried that my eyesight is starting to go. </ins></blockquote><ins> </ins><blockquote cite="https://backchannel.com/how-the-web-became-unreadable-a781ddc711b6#.u1juyjpkn"><ins>These hurdles have made me grumpier over time, but what pushed me over the edge was when Google’s App Engine console — a page that, as a developer, I use daily — changed its text from legible to illegible. Text that was once crisp and dark was suddenly lightened to a pallid gray. Though age has indeed taken its toll on my eyesight, it turns out that I was suffering from a design trend. </ins></blockquote><ins> </ins><blockquote cite="https://backchannel.com/how-the-web-became-unreadable-a781ddc711b6#.u1juyjpkn"><ins>There’s a widespread movement in design circles to reduce the contrast between text and background, making type harder to read. Apple is guilty. Google is, too. So is Twitter. </ins></blockquote><ins> </ins><blockquote cite="https://backchannel.com/how-the-web-became-unreadable-a781ddc711b6#.u1juyjpkn"><ins>Typography may not seem like a crucial design element, but it is. One of the reasons the web has become the default way that we access information is that it makes that information broadly available to everyone. “The power of the Web is in its universality,” wrote Tim Berners-Lee, director of the World Wide Web consortium. “Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect.” </ins></blockquote><ins> </ins><blockquote cite="https://backchannel.com/how-the-web-became-unreadable-a781ddc711b6#.u1juyjpkn"><ins>But if the web is relayed through text that’s difficult to read, it curtails that open access by excluding large swaths of people, such as the elderly, the visually impaired, or those retrieving websites through low-quality screens. And, as we rely on computers not only to retrieve information but also to access and build services that are crucial to our lives, making sure that everyone can see what’s happening becomes increasingly important. </ins></blockquote><ins> </ins><blockquote cite="https://backchannel.com/how-the-web-became-unreadable-a781ddc711b6#.u1juyjpkn"><ins>We should be able to build a baseline structure of text in a way that works for most users, regardless of their eyesight. So, as a physicist by training, I started looking for something measurable.</ins></blockquote><ins> </ins><blockquote cite="https://backchannel.com/how-the-web-became-unreadable-a781ddc711b6#.u1juyjpkn"><ins>It wasn’t hard to isolate the biggest obstacle to legible text: contrast, the difference between the foreground and background colors on a page. In 2008, the Web Accessibility Initiative, a group that works to produce guidelines for web developers, introduced a widely accepted ratio for creating easy-to-read webpages. </ins></blockquote><ins> </ins><blockquote cite="https://backchannel.com/how-the-web-became-unreadable-a781ddc711b6#.u1juyjpkn"><ins>To translate contrast, it uses a numerical model. If the text and background of a website are the same color, the ratio is 1:1. For black text on white background (or vice versa), the ratio is 21:1. The Initiative set 4.5:1 as the minimum ratio for clear type, while recommending a contrast of at least 7:1, to aid readers with impaired vision. The recommendation was designed as a suggested minimum contrast to designate the boundaries of legibility. Still, designers tend to treat it as as a starting point.</ins></blockquote><ins> </ins><blockquote cite="https://backchannel.com/how-the-web-became-unreadable-a781ddc711b6#.u1juyjpkn"><ins>For example: Apple’s typography guidelines suggest that developers aim for a 7:1 contrast ratio. But what ratio, you might ask, is the text used to state the guideline? It’s 5.5:1.</ins></blockquote><ins> </ins><blockquote cite="https://backchannel.com/how-the-web-became-unreadable-a781ddc711b6#.u1juyjpkn"><ins>Google’s guidelines suggest an identical preferred ratio of 7:1. But then they recommend 54 percent opacity for display and caption type, a style guideline that translates to a ratio of 4.6:1. </ins></blockquote><ins> </ins><blockquote cite="https://backchannel.com/how-the-web-became-unreadable-a781ddc711b6#.u1juyjpkn"><ins>The typography choices of companies like Apple and Google set the default design of the web.

Excerpt:</ins></p><ins> </ins><blockquote cite="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/mariakonnikova/2014/07/being-a-better-online-reader.html"><ins>Certainly, as we turn to online reading, the physiology of the reading process itself shifts; we don’t read the same way online as we do on paper. Anne Mangen, a professor at the National Centre for Reading Education and Research at the University of Stavanger, in Norway, points out that reading is always an interaction between a person and a technology, be it a computer or an e-reader or even a bound book. </ins></blockquote><ins> </ins><blockquote cite="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/mariakonnikova/2014/07/being-a-better-online-reader.html"><ins>Reading “involves factors not usually acknowledged,” she told me. “The ergonomics, the haptics of the device itself. The tangibility of paper versus the intangibility of something digital.” The contrast of pixels, the layout of the words, the concept of scrolling versus turning a page, the physicality of a book versus the ephemerality of a screen, the ability to hyperlink and move from source to source within seconds online—all these variables translate into a different reading experience. </ins></blockquote><ins> </ins><blockquote cite="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/mariakonnikova/2014/07/being-a-better-online-reader.html"><ins>The screen, for one, seems to encourage more skimming behavior: when we scroll, we tend to read more quickly (and less deeply) than when we move sequentially from page to page. Online, the tendency is compounded as a way of coping with an overload of information. There are so many possible sources, so many pages, so many alternatives to any article or book or document that we read more quickly to compensate. </ins></blockquote><ins> </ins><blockquote cite="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/mariakonnikova/2014/07/being-a-better-online-reader.html"><ins>When Ziming Liu, a professor at San Jose State University whose research centers on digital reading and the use of e-books, conducted a review of studies that compared print and digital reading experiences, supplementing their conclusions with his own research, he found that several things had changed. On screen, people tended to browse and scan, to look for keywords, and to read in a less linear, more selective fashion. On the page, they tended to concentrate more on following the text. </ins></blockquote><ins> </ins><blockquote cite="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/mariakonnikova/2014/07/being-a-better-online-reader.html"><ins>Skimming, Liu concluded, had become the new reading: the more we read online, the more likely we were to move quickly, without stopping to ponder any one thought. </ins></blockquote><ins> </ins><blockquote cite="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/mariakonnikova/2014/07/being-a-better-online-reader.html"><ins>The online world, too, tends to exhaust our resources more quickly than the page. We become tired from the constant need to filter out hyperlinks and possible distractions. And our eyes themselves may grow fatigued from the constantly shifting screens, layouts, colors, and contrasts, an effect that holds for e-readers as well as computers. </ins></blockquote><ins> </ins><blockquote cite="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/mariakonnikova/2014/07/being-a-better-online-reader.html"><ins>Mary Dyson, a psychologist at the University of Reading who studies how we perceive and interact with typography and design online and in print, has found that the layout of a text can have a significant effect on the reading experience. We read more quickly when lines are longer, but only to a point. When lines are too long, it becomes taxing to move your eyes from the end of one to the start of the next. We read more efficiently when text is arranged in a single column rather than multiple columns or sections. The font, color, and size of text can all act in tandem to make our reading experience easier or more difficult. </ins></blockquote><ins> </ins><blockquote cite="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/mariakonnikova/2014/07/being-a-better-online-reader.html"><ins>And while these variables surely exist on paper just as they do on-screen, the range of formats and layouts online is far greater than it is in print.

</ins></blockquote><ins> </ins><blockquote cite="http://www.scmp.com/news/china-insider/article/1323529/two-million-employed-monitor-chinese-public-opinion"><ins>By trawling through blogs, microblog posts and social networks, these "Internet opinion analysts," most of them government employees, dissect public opinion on local issues and try to identify accusations of corruption and poor governance. They keep local leadership, from county to province, informed on a daily basis via text messages and written reports. 
</ins></blockquote><ins> </ins><blockquote cite="http://www.scmp.com/news/china-insider/article/1323529/two-million-employed-monitor-chinese-public-opinion"><ins>The Beijing-based newspaper took advantage of a seminar for these monitors, held in the capital in mid-October by the People’s Daily Online Public Opinion Monitoring Centre, a think tank-like unit of the Communist Party’s official mouthpiece, to meet these usually anonymous local government staffers known as “online public opinion analysts”. 
</ins></blockquote><ins> </ins><blockquote cite="http://www.scmp.com/news/china-insider/article/1323529/two-million-employed-monitor-chinese-public-opinion"><ins>Even though the industry has been around for at least six years, the Ministry of Human Resources only listed their duties earlier this month as an official profession certified by the ministry’s China Employment Training Technical Instruction Centre.  </ins></blockquote><ins> </ins><blockquote cite="http://www.scmp.com/news/china-insider/article/1323529/two-million-employed-monitor-chinese-public-opinion"><ins>Since 2008, the People’s Daily’s think tank has advised local governments to quicken the pace of issuing public statements and reacting to online debate and viral political statements. In 2011, it called on officials to react within the “four golden hours” after an incident, such a train crash or a riot, to provide information and prevent allegations of cover-ups. 
</ins></blockquote><ins> </ins><blockquote cite="http://www.scmp.com/news/china-insider/article/1323529/two-million-employed-monitor-chinese-public-opinion"><ins>One such analyst the Beijing News interviewed heads the public opinion monitoring office of a county in Henan province. Every day, the man with the pseudonym Yuan Ming would search his county’s name on Google and Baidu, the Chinese equivalent of the international search engine. Special software bought by the county at a cost of three million yuan alerts his office to trending topics on social media, according to the report.
</ins></blockquote><ins> Look at the bright side: If you're blogging or tweeting in China, you're assured of added traffic and a readership that really cares what you say.

Lincoln, Instructor : Columbia Journalism Review">Composition 101: A. Lincoln, Instructor Link: http://www.cjr.org/the_kicker/lincoln_the_writer.php?page=all </a>. After using the impending Oscars as a news peg, Kevin Coyne writes:
</ins></p><blockquote cite="http://www.cjr.org/the_kicker/lincoln_the_writer.php?page=all"><ins>Writing is thinking, and if you don’t think clearly about what you want to say, what story you want to tell, you will never write clearly about it. Clarity - of thought, of purpose, of expression - is the cardinal virtue of good writing, and it shines abundantly through everything Lincoln says and does in the movie. Writing is not just what happens at a desk. It happens everywhere and always, whenever your mind encounters a thought it wants to wrap words around. 
</ins></blockquote><ins> </ins><blockquote cite="http://www.cjr.org/the_kicker/lincoln_the_writer.php?page=all"><ins>I have a mantra in class: “Readers do no work.” If you’re James Joyce or Toni Morrison or any other writer lavishly blessed with the gifts of linguistic prestidigitation, you can presume that your readers signed up for the ride, expecting that some heavy lifting might be required of them. </ins></blockquote><ins> </ins><blockquote cite="http://www.cjr.org/the_kicker/lincoln_the_writer.php?page=all"><ins>Most of us, though - and all of us in the realms of nonfiction and journalism - cannot presume that. It is for us to do the work first, so that none is required of our readers. Clear thinking leads to clear writing, which leads, most importantly, to clear understanding.</ins></blockquote><ins> My own classroom mantra through 40 years of teaching was: "The writer's job is to make the reader's job effortless." Coyne's is briefer.

Anyone who writes long text for the web needs to become familiar with it, and to study how it was put together. 
</p><p>The text is core, and brilliantly suited to the medium: short sentences, short paragraphs, displayed in short lines.</p> <p>Inset in the margin are photos and videos of the people involved. The narrative is broken into six segments, each set off with a dramatic graphic. Animated maps trace the paths of the skiers and snowboarders down the mountain, and the path taken by the avalanche.</p> <p>The result is a powerful multimedia narrative. More importantly, it's a benchmark: This is how such narratives can be created with our present technology, and with enough resources to exploit that technology. Not all stories can be told this way, or need to be. But some stories will be enormously enhanced by the techniques used in "Snow Fall."</p> <p class="entry-footer-info"><ins><span class="post-footers">Posted at 08:13 PM in <a href="https://crofsblogs.typepad.com/ckbetas/webwriting/">Webwriting Link: https://crofsblogs.typepad.com/ckbetas/webwriting/ </a> </span> <span class="separator">|</span> <a class="permalink" href="https://crofsblogs.typepad.com/ckbetas/2012/12/is-this-the-new-longform-of-web-writing.html">Permalink Link: https://crofsblogs.typepad.com/ckbetas/2012/12/is-this-the-new-longform-of-web-writing.html </a> <span class="separator">|</span> <a class="entry-comments" href="https://crofsblogs.typepad.com/ckbetas/2012/12/is-this-the-new-longform-of-web-writing.html#comments">Comments (0) Link: https://crofsblogs.typepad.com/ckbetas/2012/12/is-this-the-new-longform-of-web-writing.html#comments </a> </ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="entry-footer-share entry-footer-share-buttons"><ins><span class="entry-footer-links-reblog"><a href="#" class="share-link share-link-reblog" title="Grab this post for your own blog">Reblog

I concur. Excerpt:
</ins></p><blockquote cite="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2012/10/website_pagination_stories_should_load_into_a_single_page_every_time_.html"><ins>Slate’s editorial guidelines call for articles to be split into multiple pages once they hit the 1,000-word mark, so I have to keep this brief: Splitting articles and photo galleries into multiple pages is evil. It should stop. </ins></blockquote><ins> </ins><blockquote cite="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2012/10/website_pagination_stories_should_load_into_a_single_page_every_time_.html"><ins>Pagination is one of the worst design and usability sins on the Web, the kind of obvious no-no that should have gone out with blinky text, dancing cat animations, and autoplaying music. It shows constant, quiet contempt for people who should be any news site’s highest priority—folks who want to read articles all the way to the end. </ins></blockquote><ins> </ins><blockquote cite="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2012/10/website_pagination_stories_should_load_into_a_single_page_every_time_.html"><ins>Pagination persists because splitting a single-page article into two pages can, in theory, yield twice as many opportunities to display ads—though in practice it doesn’t because lots of readers never bother to click past the first page. The practice has become so ubiquitous that it’s numbed many publications and readers into thinking that multipage design is how the Web has always been, and how it should be. </ins></blockquote><ins> </ins><blockquote cite="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2012/10/website_pagination_stories_should_load_into_a_single_page_every_time_.html"><ins>Neither is true: The Web’s earliest news sites didn’t paginate, and the practice grew up only over the past decade, in response to pressure from the ad industry. It doesn’t have to be this way—some of the Web’s most forward-thinking and successful publications, including BuzzFeed and the Verge, have eschewed pagination, and they’re better off for it. </ins></blockquote><ins> </ins><blockquote cite="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2012/10/website_pagination_stories_should_load_into_a_single_page_every_time_.html"><ins>So would we all be: Pageview juicing is a myopic strategy. In the long run, unfriendly design isn’t going to help websites win new adherents, and winning new readers is the whole point of being a website. </ins></blockquote><ins> </ins><blockquote cite="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2012/10/website_pagination_stories_should_load_into_a_single_page_every_time_.html"><ins>I bet that if all news sites switched to single-page articles—and BuzzFeed-style scrolling galleries instead of multipage slideshows—they’d experience short-term pain followed by long-term gain. Their articles would get shared more widely and, thus, win more loyal, regular visitors for the publication. </ins></blockquote><ins> </ins><blockquote cite="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2012/10/website_pagination_stories_should_load_into_a_single_page_every_time_.html"><ins>In fact, pagination is so horrible that I suspect eradicating it from the Web might also lead to bigger breakthroughs—it would almost certainly solve the Iran nuclear crisis and eliminate the fiscal cliff—but I don’t want to make any promises.

Before he actually got into the discussion about fonts, he wrote:
</ins></p><blockquote cite="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/web-typography.html"><ins>Not only are computer screens getting bigger, they're also finally getting better — which might be more important. In June 2012, Apple introduced the first mainstream computer with a high-definition screen: the MacBook Pro with a resolution of 2880×1800 on a 15-inch display. This screen delivers a pixel density of 220 PPI (pixels per inch, corresponding to the DPI — dots per inch — that measure laser printer quality.) 
</ins></blockquote><ins> </ins><blockquote cite="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/web-typography.html"><ins>Apple uses the propaganda term "Retina display" for screen qualities above approximately 200 PPI, under the theory that this is as much as the human eye can resolve. Of course, this is not true: we need around 900 PPI for a screen so good that adding pixels wouldn't make it look any better. 
</ins></blockquote><ins> </ins><blockquote cite="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/web-typography.html"><ins>Although Apple's screen quality isn't perfect, it's dramatically better than anything on offer from other computer vendors. It's a disgrace that the PC industry hasn't recognizably improved screen quality over the last decade — despite the fact that we have known for decades that 300 PPI screens offer dramatically faster reading speed than low-density monitors.</ins></blockquote><ins> </ins><p><ins>By all means read his whole post. I'm bringing up the subject now because last week I bought myself a MacBook Pro 15"—and it's been a revelation. No doubt 300 PPI would be even better, but until it comes along I'm more than content.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>Composing text on screen has become a pleasure, and reading is too—whether or not I'm reading any faster. Most strikingly, this machine has made me realize how god-awful tiring it's been, for years, to read and write on a low-res screen. </ins></p><ins> </ins><p><ins>So we finally have something like the resolution that Nielsen has been demanding for decades. As HD screens become the norm, they're going to oblige web designers and writers to reconsider content and display issues: Can we write longer sentences in longer paragraphs? I suspect we can and will. Should we prefer serif to sans serif? Nielsen thinks it's now a personal call, based on branding or the "mood" of a given type style. I agree.</ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="entry-footer-info"><ins><span class="post-footers">Posted at 03:26 PM in <a href="https://crofsblogs.typepad.com/ckbetas/webtech/">Web/Tech Link: https://crofsblogs.typepad.com/ckbetas/webtech/ </a>, <a href="https://crofsblogs.typepad.com/ckbetas/webwriting/">Webwriting Link: https://crofsblogs.typepad.com/ckbetas/webwriting/ </a> </span> <span class="separator">|</span> <a class="permalink" href="https://crofsblogs.typepad.com/ckbetas/2012/09/nielsen-on-hd-screen-and-their-typographical-implications.html">Permalink Link: https://crofsblogs.typepad.com/ckbetas/2012/09/nielsen-on-hd-screen-and-their-typographical-implications.html </a> <span class="separator">|</span> <a class="entry-comments" href="https://crofsblogs.typepad.com/ckbetas/2012/09/nielsen-on-hd-screen-and-their-typographical-implications.html#comments">Comments (0) Link: https://crofsblogs.typepad.com/ckbetas/2012/09/nielsen-on-hd-screen-and-their-typographical-implications.html#comments </a> </ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="entry-footer-share entry-footer-share-buttons"><ins><span class="entry-footer-links-reblog"><a href="#" class="share-link share-link-reblog" title="Grab this post for your own blog">Reblog

</ins></blockquote><blockquote cite="http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/189021/twitter-study-hashtags-and-urls-can-double-engagement/"><ins>One surprising finding, Anderson said, was that accounts using <a href="http://www.mediabistro.com/alltwitter/howto-send-old-style-retweets-from-newtwitter_b12253" target="_blank">old-style retweets Link: http://www.mediabistro.com/alltwitter/howto-send-old-style-retweets-from-newtwitter_b12253 </a> grew followers more slowly than those who retweet using Twitter’s built-in button.

</ins></blockquote><blockquote cite="http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/189021/twitter-study-hashtags-and-urls-can-double-engagement/"><ins>Be a source of info for people who follow what you cover — sounds obvious, right? But posting a “concentrated number of tweets in a short time span,” what Luckie calls “tweet burstiness”  — live tweeting an event, for instance — can increase your engagement 50 percent more than your expected baseline. Sara Ganim’s Twitter feed during the Jerry Sandusky trial is a great example of this, Anderson said.

This brings up two crucial issues for webwriters: Text has printlike clarity and readability on a Retina Display screen, but sites not updated look worse than ever. Excerpt:
</ins></p><blockquote cite="http://www.poynter.org/how-tos/digital-strategies/175513/how-news-organizations-are-taking-advantage-of-the-latest-ipads-features/"><ins>Non-updated text is distracting and hard to read on the new iPad. It’s a bit like watching standard definition content on a high-definition TV. Just as standard definition TV looks worse on a high-definition TV than it does on a standard definition one, the same effect happens on the iPad. It’s not that apps need to be updated to look even better on the new iPad; it’s that if they aren’t updated, they’re very hard to look at. 
</ins></blockquote><ins> </ins><blockquote cite="http://www.poynter.org/how-tos/digital-strategies/175513/how-news-organizations-are-taking-advantage-of-the-latest-ipads-features/"><ins>I’ve found that apps that haven’t been updated are not worth using. The text is so hard to read and distracting that it ruins the reading and news consumption experience. It’s hard to imagine someone who enjoys the typography of print getting into such a pixelated reading experience. 
</ins></blockquote><ins> </ins><blockquote cite="http://www.poynter.org/how-tos/digital-strategies/175513/how-news-organizations-are-taking-advantage-of-the-latest-ipads-features/"><ins>Some magazines are more known for their visual flair than The Economist. Vanity Fair is now taking advantage of the higher resolution display to feature higher resolution photos that show off more detail. Many users and app developers had concerns, however, that the new iPad would lead to magazine issues that were too big. 
</ins></blockquote><ins> </ins><blockquote cite="http://www.poynter.org/how-tos/digital-strategies/175513/how-news-organizations-are-taking-advantage-of-the-latest-ipads-features/"><ins>Vanity Fair, Wired and others had large file sizes, sometimes 500 MB or more. The smallest iPad has about 13.5 GB of usable storage space. At 500 MBs an issue, that doesn’t leave a lot of room for many issues or other apps or movies. And that was 500 MB per issue on a device that needs to push four times less pixels than the new iPad. 
</ins></blockquote><ins> </ins><blockquote cite="http://www.poynter.org/how-tos/digital-strategies/175513/how-news-organizations-are-taking-advantage-of-the-latest-ipads-features/"><ins>Vanity Fair recently switched to a bundled PDF format from a PNG format, which has allowed the magazine to use higher resolution art assets while also reducing the file size of their issues. Its May issue weighed in at 135 MB. 
</ins></blockquote><ins> </ins><blockquote cite="http://www.poynter.org/how-tos/digital-strategies/175513/how-news-organizations-are-taking-advantage-of-the-latest-ipads-features/"><ins>Art Director Chris Mueller said in an email that Vanity Fair also rethought some of the apps’ usability. Issues now feature less scrolling content. The Table of Contents page is several individual pages instead of one big, long scroll. 
</ins></blockquote><ins> </ins><blockquote cite="http://www.poynter.org/how-tos/digital-strategies/175513/how-news-organizations-are-taking-advantage-of-the-latest-ipads-features/"><ins>“We’re adapting and working through other quirks as they come up, but overall the huge improvement to the appearance of type and images on the tablet is worth the effort,” Mueller said of the changes made to the Vanity Fair app for the new iPad. 
</ins></blockquote><ins> </ins><blockquote cite="http://www.poynter.org/how-tos/digital-strategies/175513/how-news-organizations-are-taking-advantage-of-the-latest-ipads-features/"><ins>The Washington Post is another iPad app in transition. The text looks great, but photos are low resolution. Joey Marburger, designer for mobile and new digital products at the Post, said in an email that higher resolution photos are on the way. He cautioned that a balance needs to be struck between high resolution photos and download speed. </ins></blockquote><ins> </ins><blockquote cite="http://www.poynter.org/how-tos/digital-strategies/175513/how-news-organizations-are-taking-advantage-of-the-latest-ipads-features/"><ins>He said that offline storage is another issue that iPad news app makers need to take into account. (iPads hold a small fraction of what desktops and laptops can hold.)</ins></blockquote><ins> </ins><p class="entry-footer-info"><ins><span class="post-footers">Posted at 11:03 AM in <a href="https://crofsblogs.typepad.com/ckbetas/webwriting/">Webwriting Link: https://crofsblogs.typepad.com/ckbetas/webwriting/ </a> </span> <span class="separator">|</span> <a class="permalink" href="https://crofsblogs.typepad.com/ckbetas/2012/08/how-news-organizations-are-taking-advantage-of-the-latest-ipads-features.html">Permalink Link: https://crofsblogs.typepad.com/ckbetas/2012/08/how-news-organizations-are-taking-advantage-of-the-latest-ipads-features.html </a> <span class="separator">|</span> <a class="entry-comments" href="https://crofsblogs.typepad.com/ckbetas/2012/08/how-news-organizations-are-taking-advantage-of-the-latest-ipads-features.html#comments">Comments (0) Link: https://crofsblogs.typepad.com/ckbetas/2012/08/how-news-organizations-are-taking-advantage-of-the-latest-ipads-features.html#comments </a> </ins></p><ins> </ins><p class="entry-footer-share entry-footer-share-buttons"><ins><span class="entry-footer-links-reblog"><a href="#" class="share-link share-link-reblog" title="Grab this post for your own blog">Reblog

The medium really is the message online, and the message is jolts. </ins></blockquote><ins> </ins><blockquote cite="http://thetyee.ca/Opinion/2012/01/30/Bad-Apple/"><ins>Jolts are the little sensory rewards the computer gives us. They come when we turn on the machine and it bongs at us. Jolts come with every alert, every new window, every avian squawk and porcine grunt in Angry Birds. Jolts come with every email and text message. Isaacson [in his biography of Steve Jobs] doesn't use the word, but his description of Apple packaging shows that jolts of pleasure are designed right into the boxes that your Mac and iPhone come in. </ins></blockquote><ins> </ins><blockquote cite="http://thetyee.ca/Opinion/2012/01/30/Bad-Apple/"><ins>Jolts also come in the form of verbal abuse, which inspired the email and forum flame wars of the 1990s, the ongoing hysteria of today's political blogs, and the punchlines of Twitter. </ins></blockquote><ins> </ins><blockquote cite="http://thetyee.ca/Opinion/2012/01/30/Bad-Apple/"><ins>Like lab rats with electrodes wired into their brains' pleasure centers, we learn what gives us the strongest online jolts, and we keep doing it. We forget that the lab rats preferred to push their jolt button until they starved to death, but in our few lucid moments we realize that we're well and truly addicted to the jolts that Apple gives us. </ins></blockquote><ins> </ins><blockquote cite="http://thetyee.ca/Opinion/2012/01/30/Bad-Apple/"><ins>Hence our rapt anticipation of the next jolt machine: the iPhone 5, the iPad 3, or something completely novel that Steve knew we'd want before we ourselves did.

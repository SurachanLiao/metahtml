They do this each time they attend to patients, whether it is to take their vital signs like their temperature or to serve them food, and they help one another to make sure the gear is worn properly.</p><p>Said Dr Chia: We are front-line (staff) and we are well-versed in all these infection control practices. We are well-trained."</p><p>Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said at an event at NCID last Friday that the outbreak was a shock but not a surprise.</p><p>He had thanked the front-line staff that day and said that the facility, which was then caring for nine out of 13 confirmed infection cases, has helped boost Singapore's confidence in handling the current situation.</p><p>While the novel coronavirus is spreading fast in China and the death toll is rising, Associate Professor Brenda Ang, a senior consultant at the department of infectious diseases at Tan Tock Seng Hospital and NCID, has reason to be calm.</p><p>She is a Sars veteran, having worked through the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in 2003.</p><p>"When we had a patient who brought back Sars, it was before the world knew that there was such a thing," she said. "Don't worry, we have been through this before."</p> <p><del><img alt="" src="https://www.straitstimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/2020/02/02/yq-ncid2-02022021.jpg" width="800" height="585"><br>Nurse manager Imrana Banu Khider Mohamed, who manages a team of 25 healthcare staff, at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases on Jan 31, 2020.

To do so, she wears an N95 mask and a visor to protect her eyes, as well as gloves and a hospital gown.</p><p>"A lot of worried people come in. They may not fit the criteria, but they are still worried," she said.</p><p>She added: "Of course, our family and friends are worried for us, but we have to reassure them that we are taking the necessary precautions."</p><p>Mr Low, the senior staff nurse, said: "My wife is a nurse and she's not worried... because she has confidence in the way we don our protective gear. If you're not taking shortcuts and if you're following good infection control practices, you are very well protected."</p><p>Additional reporting by Linette Lai</p> <h4 class="label-above"><ins>Related Stories: </ins></h4><p><ins>Read the latest on the Covid-19 situation in Singapore and beyond on our <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/coronavirus">dedicated site here Link: https://www.straitstimes.com/coronavirus </a>.</ins></p><p><ins>Get The Straits Times app and receive breaking news alerts and more.

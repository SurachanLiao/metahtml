Dr Jeremy Rossman Senior Lecturer in Virology at the University of Kent has insisted there is no guarantee a vaccine will be developed to completely wipe out COVID-19 and a yearly booster jab is one option researchers will be looking at. The medical community has so far been unable to develop an accurate anti-body test to determine whether an individual has previously contracted the virus.

Dr Rossman has admitted the lack of evidence on anti-bodies will complicate the search for a vaccine as researchers do not know whether someone can be re-infected. He told Express.co.uk: “At present, we know that the virus causes a robust immune activation, we know that survivors do generate antibodies to the virus but we don’t yet know if generates an immune memory that protects against re-infection. “We don’t know what percentage of people will be protected and we don’t know how this protection would last. “This complicates the vaccine development, but we still have many different vaccine development tools that can help to boost the immune response and help to ensure longer duration immunity.”

A yearly coronavirus vaccine may be required to prevent COVID-19 infections

The virus expert has outlined a number of possible treatment options that could be made available including a one-off vaccine, a series of procedures or a yearly jab. He added: “We may have a one and done vaccine, we may have multiple shot series required, we may need a yearly booster or we may not have a vaccine that works at all. “Even if we knew how the immune system responded and how immunity developed for COVID-19, there is no guarantee that we’d be able to make a vaccine or get it to work on the first try.”

A yearly coronavirus vaccine would draw comparisons to the winter flu jab which is used to treat the common cold – known as rhinovirus. There is currently no medical cure for the common cold as there are more than 150 different variations but a jab helps to prevent infection. Dr Rossman insists finding a cure for coronavirus will be much easier than the flu because COVID-19 mutates much slower. He added: “Not all viruses are easy to immunise against though. For example, we don’t have a vaccine against rhinovirus - the common cold – however, researchers have shown that a vaccine can work to prevent infection.

“The reason why we don’t have one is due to the huge number of different types of rhinoviruses over 150 and each can cause the cold. “We can make a vaccine against one type, but to make a vaccine that protects against all is far more difficult. “Thankfully this is not the case with COVID-19, the virus mutates very slowly for an RNA virus and there is only one type that we need to protect against. “This makes the vaccine development a much more straightforward, though still complicated process.” DON'T MISS Coronavirus map LIVE: Historian outlines TERRIFYING fate [LIVE]

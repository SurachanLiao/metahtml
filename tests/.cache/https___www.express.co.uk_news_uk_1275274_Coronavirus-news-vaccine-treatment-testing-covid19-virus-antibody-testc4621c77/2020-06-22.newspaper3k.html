For example, we don&#8217;t have a vaccine against rhinovirus - the common cold &#8211; however, researchers have shown that a vaccine can work to prevent infection.<p></p></p><p></p><p><strong>READ MORE:&#160;<a href="/news/world/1275208/Angela-Merkel-news-Germany-lockdown-reimposed-coronavirus-infection-rate-COVID-19" target="_blank">Angela Merkel at risk of reimposing lockdown as infection rate spikes</a></strong></p><p class="text-description">   </p><p></p><p><strong>       </strong></p><p>&#8220;The reason why we don&#8217;t have one is due to the huge number of different types of rhinoviruses over 150 and each can cause the cold.<p></p></p><p>&#8220;We can make a vaccine against one type, but to make a vaccine that protects against all is far more difficult.<p></p></p><p>&#8220;Thankfully this is not the case with COVID-19, the virus mutates very slowly for an RNA virus and there is only one type that we need to protect against.</p><p>&#8220;This makes the vaccine development a much more straightforward, though still complicated process.&#8221;</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>DON'T MISS</strong></p><p><strong><a href="/news/uk/1275209/Coronavirus-uk-death-uk-lockdown-covid-19-outbreak-news-social-distancing-Boris-Johnson" target="_blank">Coronavirus map LIVE: Historian outlines TERRIFYING fate</a>&#160;[LIVE]</strong><br><strong><a href="/comment/columnists/1275211/coronavirus-lockdown-deaths-families" target="_blank">Callous lockdown lacks compassion, says ANN WIDDECOMBE</a>&#160;[COMMENT]</strong><br><strong><a href="/news/uk/1275199/UK-lockdown-latest-matt-hancock-coronavirus-restrictions-poll" target="_blank">Britons BACK lockdown: Poll shows 70% back restrictions</a>&#160;[POLL]</strong></p><p></p><p class="withoutCaption">  <img class="lazy" src="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/page/preloaderbig.gif" alt="coronavirus" title="coronavirus"></p><p class="newsCaption">The UK's coronavirus exit strategy </p><p>    </p><p>Professor John Newton the national testing co-ordinator has insisted he is confident an anti-body test will be developed.<p></p></p><p>The Department for Health has confirmed a further 586 patients have died from COVID-19 in UK hospitals.<p></p></p><p>As of 5pm on Monday the total number of coronavirus fatalities now stands at 21,678.<p></p></p><p></p></div>

<div><p>What&#8217;s the difference between Trump and Kim Jong Un? Eight inches. Trump claims to have grown an inch so his official height is now 6&#8217;3&#8243;. Kim Jong Un says he is 5&#8217;7&#8243;. Of course that is wearing platform shoes and includes three inches of hair. There isn&#8217;t a sandbox big enough to contain these two egos, and that is what we should all be worried about.</p>
<p>Trump hasn&#8217;t given the American people any indication that he is a grown-up and if he doesn&#8217;t take any grown-ups with him to North Korea we should all be scared shitless. This isn&#8217;t like stiffing the Sheetrock contractor or telling the bank to sue me when he defaults on a loan, millions of lives are at stake and we have already seen that Trump has no regard for humanity.</p>
<p>Here is the issue that I have with this deal, Trumps motives. This smells like, at least to me, that he is attempting to change the story currently playing out in the media taking the attention off of Stormy Daniels and putting it back on him. That is what egotistical narcissists do and we all know he is the poster child for an egotistical narcissist.</p>
<p>If his motives were pure, if his attentions were true the people in his administration that have a stake in these negotiations would have known about what was coming down the pipe in advance. They didn&#8217;t, at least all indications are that they didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>I am all for having a dialog with&#160;Kim Jong Un. I just wish we had someone smarter, more mature representing our interest. This could turn-out to be a Stormy situation for all of us.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;A weakened, amateur president agrees to highest-level diplomatic talks with a rogue nuclear power, without a clear strategy or diplomatic team in place. What could possibly go wrong?&#8221; &#8211; Steve Benen, MSNBC</strong></p>

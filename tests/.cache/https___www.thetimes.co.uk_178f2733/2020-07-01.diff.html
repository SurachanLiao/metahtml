This led to Percy Lefroy Mapleton being tried, convicted and executed for murder; in 1937 Britain implemented the 999 number for emergency services, the first of its kind in the world; in 1969 British sailor Donald Crowhurst died at sea during the inaugural Sunday Times Golden Globe round-the-world yacht race. His log, with the last entry on this date, revealed that he was in a distressed state and had been recording false co-ordinates; in 1979 the first Sony Walkman portable music player went on sale in Japan. The device was originally called Soundabout in the US and Stowaway in England; in 2004 Saddam Hussein, the former president of Iraq, refused to recognise the authority of the court in Baghdad in his first appearance since he was found by US troops on the edge of Tikrit in 2003. He was executed by hanging in 2006 at an Iraqi army base.</ins></p><h4 class="Item-headline Headline Headline--light Headline--m"><ins>Nature notes</ins></h4><p><ins>Blackbirds are still waking people up with a sudden energetic burst of song at the crack of dawn. However, this will not go on for much longer. They may be heard spasmodically again in the evening but generally blackbird song is coming to an end for this year. It will begin again regularly at about the end of January. In the woods the titmice are joining up in silent flocks but warblers such as blackcaps and chiffchaffs can be heard. Between their usual “chink chank” syllables, odd little muttering notes are now being added by the chiffchaffs, for no evident purpose.</ins></p><p class="Byline Byline-name"><ins>Derwent May</ins></p><h4 class="Item-headline Headline Headline--light Headline--m"><ins>Birthdays today</ins></h4><p><ins>Pamela Anderson, actress, Baywatch (1992-97, 2017), 53; Dan Aykroyd, actor, Ghostbusters (1984), 68; Leslie Caron, actress, Gigi (1958), 89; Wayne David, Labour MP for Caerphilly, shadow foreign and Commonwealth affairs minister, 63; Rosie Duffield, Labour MP for Canterbury, 49; Malcolm Elliott, sprint cyclist, two-time Commonwealth Games gold medallist (1982), 59; Missy Elliott, hip-hop musician, Get Ur Freak On (2001), 49; John Ellis, Clerk Maxwell professor of theoretical physics, King’s College London, 74; Sir Vernon Ellis, co-chairman, Britten-Pears Foundation, 73; Iain Ferguson, chairman, housebuilder Crest Nicholson, 65; Carl Fogarty, motorcyclist, four-time superbike world championship winner, 55; Prof Dame Julia Goodfellow, molecular biologist, president, Royal Society of Biology, chairwoman, Public Health England, 69; Debbie Harry, singer, Shayla (1979), 75; Dame Olivia de Havilland, actress, Gone with the Wind (1939), 104; Dame Julia Higgins, polymer scientist, emeritus professor and senior research investigator, Imperial College London, 78; Mark Hunter, rower, Olympic gold medallist (2008), 42; Prof Sir David Lane, scientist involved in discovering the cancer gene, 68; Carl Lewis, athlete, nine-time Olympic gold medallist, 59; Li Keqiang, premier of the People’s Republic of China, 65; Sir John Low, chief executive, Charities Aid Foundation, 67; Jean Marsh, actress and co-creator, Upstairs, Downstairs (1971-75, 2010-12), 86; Victoria Miro, director, Victoria Miro galleries, London, 75; Ruud van Nistelrooy, footballer, Manchester United (2001-06) and Holland (1998-2011), 44; Dave Prowse, bodybuilder and actor, Darth Vader in the original Star Wars trilogy, 85; Daniel Ricciardo, racing driver, Renault F1 Team, 31; Garry Schofield, rugby league player, 55; Léa Seydoux, actress, Spectre (2015), 35; Twyla Tharp, dancer and choreographer, 79; Liv Tyler, actress, The Lord of the Rings (2001-03), 43; Chris Walker-Hebborn, swimmer, Olympic silver medallist (2016), 30.</ins></p></section><section class="Section Section--world js-orientationHook" id="section-world"><p class="Item-content"><ins></ins></p><h3 class="Item-headline Headline--xl"><ins><a href="/edition/world/australia-rearms-for-less-benign-era-in-the-pacific-h8v2cv3lt" class="js-tracking">Australia rearms for ‘new strategic era’ in Pacific Link: /edition/world/australia-rearms-for-less-benign-era-in-the-pacific-h8v2cv3lt </a></ins></h3><p class="Dip Item-dip"><ins><span class="u-showOnWide">Australia will get its first long-range strike missiles as well as new anti-ship weaponry as it scrambles to counter China’s rapid military build-up in the Pacific.

This element controls the URLs for author names in article bylines. Each author's name
should link to the content ID for his or her reporter page. An author can have multiple
entries all pointing to the same content ID if they spell their name in multiple ways.

To add a new author, add a new line in the format:
  authors["<author name>"] = "<page content ID>";

For ease of use, please keep authors in alphabetical order by last name.

For help, contact Paul Thomas, Interactive Media team.

<div><p>Amid reports Kim Jong Un is in "grave condition" after surgery, it begs the question about the chain of command behind the dictator, since he has no heir apparent.</p>

<p>That leaves Kim's brother and sister as&#160;the leading candidates,&#160;<a href="https://nypost.com/2020/04/21/kim-jong-uns-potential-successors-include-powerful-sister/" target="_blank">the New York Post reported.</a></p>

<p>Kim Yo Jong is the most powerful woman in North Korea, a senior member of the&#160;ruling Workers' Party of Korea, but it is unlikely the country's&#160;patriarchal politics that hands power over to&#160;male heirs&#160;would give&#160;leadership over to a woman, according to the report.</p>

<p>That leaves older brother Kim Jong Chol, who was passed over when their father&#160;Kim Jong Il died in 2011. Kim Jong Un reportedly ordered the murder&#160;his half-brother&#160;Kim Jong Nam in a nerve agent attack by two women assassins at a Kuala Lumpur airport.</p>

<p>Kim Jong Chol has not been targeted because he has not been considered&#160;to have political ambitions, according to the report.</p>

<p>Kim Jong Chol has shown an interest in music and playing the guitar, once spotted at an Eric Clapton concert in London in 2015.</p>

<p>Academics fear political upheaval if the family's 72-year reign ends, and the U.S. reportedly has contingency plans in place if there is a humanitarian crisis, according to the report.</p>

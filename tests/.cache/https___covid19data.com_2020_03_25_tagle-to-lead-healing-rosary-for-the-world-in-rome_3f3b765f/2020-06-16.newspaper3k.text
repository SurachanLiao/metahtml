Metro Manila (CNN Philippines, March 25)— Former Manila Archbishop Luis Antonio Cardinal Tagle will lead the Catholic faithful Wednesday in praying the “Healing Rosary for the World” in Rome— as part of the Church’s response against the COVID-19 pandemic.

Tagle, who now serves as the Prefect of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples in Vatican, will lead the prayer at 9 p.m. (Philippine time) from the Pontificio Collegio Filippino, the Manila Cathedral said in a statement.

“Because of the overwhelming response of Filipinos who joined our worldwide rosary, we are now initiating every Wednesday night the Healing Rosary for the World,” the Church wrote on its Facebook page.

The prayer event will be streamed live on Facebook, it added.

The event follows the global prayer of the Lord’s Prayer (Our Father) to be led by Pope Francis on Wednesday noon in Rome (7 p.m. in Manila)— as intercession for all those affected by the infectious disease.

The Pope is also expected to give a special Urbi et Orbi (to the city and the world) blessing on Friday (Saturday 1 a.m. in Manila) at the St. Peter’s Square. The said blessing is usually given on Christmas Day and Easter.

Italy has been the most coronavirus-affected European country, with over 69,000 cases recorded as of Wednesday.

Globally, the disease has infected more than 417,000 people in 169 different countries including China, the ground zero of the pandemic.

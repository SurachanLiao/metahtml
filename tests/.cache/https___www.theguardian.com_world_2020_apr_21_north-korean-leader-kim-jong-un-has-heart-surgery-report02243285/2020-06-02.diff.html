Asked about how political succession would work in North Korea, the national security adviser, Robert O’Brien, said: “The basic assumption would be maybe it would be someone in the family. But, again, it’s too early to talk about that because we just don’t know what condition chairman Kim is in and we’ll have to see how it plays out.” </p><p>Daily NK claimed Kim had been admitted to hospital after chairing a meeting of the ruling workers’ party’s politburo on 11 April – this was his most recent public appearance.</p><p>He was absent when Pyongyang fired multiple short-range missiles last week and did not take part in low-key commemorations for Kim Il-sung’s anniversary, a national holiday known as the Day of the Sun.</p><p>Some observers speculated that Kim had been limiting his public appearances this month as a precaution against the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/north-korea" class="u-underline">North Korea</a> continues to insist that it has not discovered a single case of Covid-19, but experts and defectors have challenged those claims.</p><p>It is not the first time that Kim’s failure to appear in public has triggered speculation about his health.</p><p>In 2014, he dropped out of sight for nearly six weeks before reappearing with a cane. Days later, South Korea’s spy agency said he had undergone surgery to remove a cyst from his ankle.</p><p>North Korean state media took the rare step of admitting that he was suffering from an “uncomfortable physical condition”, after TV footage showed him with a pronounced limp and he failed to attend an important parliamentary session.</p><p>But the report did not address rumours that he was suffering from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/26/north-korea-kim-jong-un-ill-health" class="u-underline">debilitating attacks of gout</a>.</p><p>“No one knows what’s going on inside North Korea,” said Martyn Williams, who is affiliated with the 38 North research website.</p><p>“Kim Jong-il (Kim’s father) had been dead several days before it was announced and it took everyone by surprise,” Williams tweeted. “Kim Jong-un has been ‘missing’ before, and has always reappeared. That said, his absence this week was more notable.”</p></article>

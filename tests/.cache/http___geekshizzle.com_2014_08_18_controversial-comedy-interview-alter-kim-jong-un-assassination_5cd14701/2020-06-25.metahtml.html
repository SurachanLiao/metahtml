There have been many threats from North Korea and growing international safety concerns since the release of the trailer for the highly controversial comedy <a href="http://geekshizzle.com/tag/the-interview/">&#8216;The Interview</a>&#8216;. Sony initially <a href="http://geekshizzle.com/2014/06/23/north-korea-happy-seth-rogens-interview/">ignored the backlash</a> from The Centre for North Korea-U.S. Peace, but the situation was more serious than anticipated when a firm warning was sent to the United States to not release the upcoming comedy flick. A spokesman for the North Korean Foreign Ministry threatened <a href="http://geekshizzle.com/2014/06/26/north-korea-will-declare-war-u-s-kim-jong-un-assassination-plot-seth-rogens-film/">&#8220;merciless counter-measures&#8221;</a> according to reports released. The studio apparently has second thoughts about the release of the film, but some changes will be made to accommodate the <a href="http://geekshizzle.com/2014/07/10/north-korea-complains-u-n-seth-rogen-james-francos-kim-jong-un-assassination-movie/">concerns raised with the UN</a>.</p><p>Also see: <a href="http://geekshizzle.com/2014/06/12/james-franco-seth-rogen-joins-plot-kill-kim-jong-un-interview-trailer/">James Franco and Seth Rogen Joins Plot to Kill Kim Jong-Un in &#8216;The Interview&#8217; Trailer</a></p><p id="caption-attachment-33595" class="wp-caption-text">Seth Rogen and James Franco set pic courtesy of <a title="http://nextprojection.com/2014/06/12/interview-trailer/" href="http://nextprojection.com/2014/06/12/interview-trailer/" target="_blank">nextprojection.com</a></p><p>The <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/sony-altering-kim-jong-assassination-725092">Hollywood Reporter</a> said the following:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Sources say the studio is digitally altering thousands of buttons worn by characters in the film &#8212; which on Aug. 8&#160;was pushed from October to a prime Dec. 25 release&#160;&#8212; because they depict the actual hardware worn by the North Korean military to honor the country&#8217;s leader,&#160;Kim Jong Un, 31, and his late father,&#160;Kim Jong Il&#160;(showcasing military decorations would be considered blasphemous to the nuclear-armed nation).&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>There is also a graphic scene involving Kim Jong Un that will be removed apparently:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Sources say the studio is considering cutting a scene in which the face of Kim Jong Un (played by&#160;Randall Park) is melted off graphically in slow motion.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Catch all the drama for the &#8216;The Interview&#8217; <a href="http://geekshizzle.com/tag/the-interview/">HERE</a></p><p id="caption-attachment-29205" class="wp-caption-text">&#8220;The Interview&#8221; poster</p><p>James Franco stars as a talk show host, and <a href="http://geekshizzle.com/tag/Seth-Rogen/">Seth Rogen</a> his producer as they go to &#8220;the most dangerous country on earth&#8221; to interview the world&#8217;s most notorious dictator.

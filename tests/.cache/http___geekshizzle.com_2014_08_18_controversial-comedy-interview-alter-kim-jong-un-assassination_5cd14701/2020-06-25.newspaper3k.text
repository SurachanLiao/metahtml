Controversial Comedy ‘The Interview’ to Alter Kim Jong-Un Assassination

Well that escalated quickly! There have been many threats from North Korea and growing international safety concerns since the release of the trailer for the highly controversial comedy ‘The Interview‘. Sony initially ignored the backlash from The Centre for North Korea-U.S. Peace, but the situation was more serious than anticipated when a firm warning was sent to the United States to not release the upcoming comedy flick. A spokesman for the North Korean Foreign Ministry threatened “merciless counter-measures” according to reports released. The studio apparently has second thoughts about the release of the film, but some changes will be made to accommodate the concerns raised with the UN.

The Hollywood Reporter said the following:

“Sources say the studio is digitally altering thousands of buttons worn by characters in the film — which on Aug. 8 was pushed from October to a prime Dec. 25 release — because they depict the actual hardware worn by the North Korean military to honor the country’s leader, Kim Jong Un, 31, and his late father, Kim Jong Il (showcasing military decorations would be considered blasphemous to the nuclear-armed nation).”

There is also a graphic scene involving Kim Jong Un that will be removed apparently:

“Sources say the studio is considering cutting a scene in which the face of Kim Jong Un (played by Randall Park) is melted off graphically in slow motion.”

Franco and Rogen are joined by Lizzy Caplan, Randall Park, and Timothy Simons.

<p>For my 2013 hate-mail of the year award, go <a href="https://asiansecurityblog.wordpress.com/2013/11/15/my-latest-japanese-hate-mail-apparently-i-am-a-s-kimchi-propagandist-hah/">here</a>. </p>
<p>So I get a lot of weird email and comments because of my blog, or in the comment sections of <a href="http://thediplomat.com/authors/robert-e-kelly/">my op-eds for the Diplomat</a>. A lot of it is fairly ridiculous (&#8216;you want the terrorists to win!&#8217;) or ad hominem (&#8216;you&#8217;re a tool of the IMF; you&#8217;re a Muslim&#8217;), but occasionally I get pretty unique stuff like this letter below. (The image above is a personal picture of a plaque on the Juche Tower in Pyongyang. Perhaps the correspondent comes from this study group.) </p>

<p>&#8220;Dear Robert Kelly, </p>
<p>I read <a href="https://asiansecurityblog.wordpress.com/2014/08/04/my-op-ed-for-the-korea-time-on-us-north-korea-relations-in-short-theyre-awful/">your column in The Korea Times</a> with great interest and would like to share my thoughts with you. </p>
<p>You may think that my opinion is weird and crazy from a point of American. </p>
<p>Most Americans think that North. Korea is vitally harmful, threatening the world peace by shooting the missile toward America. </p>
<p>America had fought with North. Korea at 1950 and kept a hostile relations with it since then. </p>
<p>I think North. Korea is a great country, because it has shown sophisticated diplomacy against a big country. </p>
<p>I claim that North. Korea is less westernized and less materialized. It keeps a strong defense for people. </p>
<p>I also argue that North. Korea has not tarnish tradition and nature unlike South. Korea. </p>
<p></p><p>I wonder that you can say that all the people in South. Korea and U.S. are happy, just because they live in a democratic and capitalistic society.  </p>
<p>I also ask you that most people in North.Korea is unhappy, because their government infringes on its citizen&#8217;s individual freedom severely. </p>
<p></p><p>I am sure some people may have been successful in adapting to a totalitarian society and they may have made a fortune and achieved a solid social position. </p>
<p>If the U.S. is a perfect society for living, I wonder why so many American came to Korea to get a job.  </p>
<p></p><p>I have met many Americans who blamed their country and they don&#8217;t want to go back to their country. </p>
<p>Some American has settled down in Korea, marrying a Korean woman.  </p>
<p></p><p>Deciding which government is better is subjective.  </p>
<p></p><p>In a nutshell, North. Korea never collapses. </p>
<p></p><p>Best regards, </p>

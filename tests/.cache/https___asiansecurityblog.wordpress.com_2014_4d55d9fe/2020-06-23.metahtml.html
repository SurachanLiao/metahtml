Not surprisingly, South Korea handles NK far more intelligently, whereas the US seems to have a weird, somewhat creepy obsession with North Korea invading America.

But a side benefit is noticing the various tropes and themes of movie genres. And one thing I&#8217;ve picked up watching movies in my field (international relations) in South Korea, is the regular use of stock American villains. Maybe I notice it just because I am an American, but it seems pretty pronounced to me.</p><p align="justify">It is well-known that westerners in Korean soaps are frequently used to introduce duplicity, sleaze, STDs, and so on. But in the film industry, the Americans are more nefarious, usually plotting to manipulate Korea&#160; to serve neo-imperial goals or something preposterous like that. Amusingly, the plots are usually ludicrous to the point of laughable (Americans mass-bombing plague victims in downtown Seoul in broad daylight?! &#8211; hah!); the dialogue is risibly ridiculous as well (&#8220;Korea is independent and sovereign, and you Yankees can&#8217;t tell us what to do!&#8221; Yeah!!); and the &#8216;American&#8217; characters almost always sound like Russians or non-American English teachers the movie producers just pulled off the street and stuck in a bad rip-off of a US Army uniform.</p><p align="justify"> It is also noticeable that all this American manipulation of Korea is self-congratulation: if the Americans are going to great lengths to use Korea for their dastardly plots, then Korea must be pretty important to the world&#8217;s lone superpower. Better fanciful American flattery of Korea, in trying to manipulate it, than the <a href="https://asiansecurityblog.wordpress.com/2012/03/13/the-us-will-not-pivot-much-to-asia-2-we-dont-really-care-asia/">reality of American ignorance of it</a>.</p><p align="justify">So here is some nice holiday relaxation. Revel in the sheer laughable paranoia of left-wing Korean cinema.

Korea is vitally harmful, threatening the world peace by shooting the missile toward America. </p><p>America had fought with North. Korea at 1950 and kept a hostile relations with it since then. </p><p>I think North. Korea is a great country, because it has shown sophisticated diplomacy against a big country. </p><p>I claim that North. Korea is less westernized and less materialized. It keeps a strong defense for people. </p><p>I also argue that North. Korea has not tarnish tradition and nature unlike South. Korea. </p><p>I wonder that you can say that all the people in South. Korea and U.S. are happy, just because they live in a democratic and capitalistic society.  </p><p>I also ask you that most people in North.Korea is unhappy, because their government infringes on its citizen&#8217;s individual freedom severely. </p><p>I am sure some people may have been successful in adapting to a totalitarian society and they may have made a fortune and achieved a solid social position. </p><p>If the U.S. is a perfect society for living, I wonder why so many American came to Korea to get a job.  </p><p>I have met many Americans who blamed their country and they don&#8217;t want to go back to their country. </p><p>Some American has settled down in Korea, marrying a Korean woman.  </p><p>Deciding which government is better is subjective.  </p><p>In a nutshell, North. Korea never collapses. </p><p>Best regards, </p><p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8220;</p><h3 class="sd-title">Share this:</h3><ul><li class="share-twitter"><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" class="share-twitter sd-button share-icon" href="https://asiansecurityblog.wordpress.com/2014/12/08/my-2014-hate-mail-of-the-year-kelly-youre-wrong-north-koreas-awesome/?share=twitter" target="_blank" title="Click to share on Twitter"><span>Twitter</span></a></li><li class="share-facebook"><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" class="share-facebook sd-button share-icon" href="https://asiansecurityblog.wordpress.com/2014/12/08/my-2014-hate-mail-of-the-year-kelly-youre-wrong-north-koreas-awesome/?share=facebook" target="_blank" title="Click to share on Facebook"><span>Facebook</span></a></li><li class="share-linkedin"><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" class="share-linkedin sd-button share-icon" href="https://asiansecurityblog.wordpress.com/2014/12/08/my-2014-hate-mail-of-the-year-kelly-youre-wrong-north-koreas-awesome/?share=linkedin" target="_blank" title="Click to share on LinkedIn"><span>LinkedIn</span></a></li><li class="share-reddit"><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" class="share-reddit sd-button share-icon" href="https://asiansecurityblog.wordpress.com/2014/12/08/my-2014-hate-mail-of-the-year-kelly-youre-wrong-north-koreas-awesome/?share=reddit" target="_blank" title="Click to share on Reddit"><span>Reddit</span></a></li><li class="share-pinterest"><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" class="share-pinterest sd-button share-icon" href="https://asiansecurityblog.wordpress.com/2014/12/08/my-2014-hate-mail-of-the-year-kelly-youre-wrong-north-koreas-awesome/?share=pinterest" target="_blank" title="Click to share on Pinterest"><span>Pinterest</span></a></li><li class="share-tumblr"><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" class="share-tumblr sd-button share-icon" href="https://asiansecurityblog.wordpress.com/2014/12/08/my-2014-hate-mail-of-the-year-kelly-youre-wrong-north-koreas-awesome/?share=tumblr" target="_blank" title="Click to share on Tumblr"><span>Tumblr</span></a></li><li class="share-email"><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" class="share-email sd-button share-icon" href="https://asiansecurityblog.wordpress.com/2014/12/08/my-2014-hate-mail-of-the-year-kelly-youre-wrong-north-koreas-awesome/?share=email" target="_blank" title="Click to email this to a friend"><span>Email</span></a></li><li class="share-print"><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" class="share-print sd-button share-icon" href="https://asiansecurityblog.wordpress.com/2014/12/08/my-2014-hate-mail-of-the-year-kelly-youre-wrong-north-koreas-awesome/" target="_blank" title="Click to print"><span>Print</span></a></li></ul><h3 class="sd-title">Like this:</h3><p class="likes-widget-placeholder post-likes-widget-placeholder"><span class="button"><span>Like</span></span> <span class="loading">Loading...</span></p></article><article id="post-3232" class="post-3232 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-foreign-policy category-korea-north category-korea-south category-united-states"><p align="justify">This is a reprint of an <a href="http://www.lowyinterpreter.org/post/2014/11/26/Why-US-control-of-the-South-Korean-military-is-here-to-stay.aspx">essay first published</a> by the Lowy Institute a week ago.</p><p align="justify">The reversion of OPCON &#8211; operational wartime control of the South Korean military &#8211; to South Korea is finally over. After 10 years of endless meetings, papers, op-eds, and power-points, everyone seems to have realized it was a basically a huge mistake (which it was). The US and Korea recently agreed to push it off the 2020s, which is another way of saying it will probably never happen. </p><p align="justify">The irony is that almost as soon as reversion was agreed to last decade, the South Koreans got cold feet and tried to have it changed back. No one seems to have thought that closing down the Combined Forces Command would mean that Korea would have to do a lot more for its own defense and stop free-riding so much. Once that reality hit by the end of President Roh&#8217;s term, &#8216;US imperialism&#8217; didn&#8217;t look so bad after all: it meant Seoul could continue to woefully under-invest in defense. So here we are at last, back to where we started from.

Gimme a break. </p><p align="justify">This is a point I have made again and again on this blog: Asia does not activate the racial/cultural/religious paranoias of Americans, especially conservatives, evangelical Christians (who are around 45% of the country), and the GOP. This is why we won&#8217;t stop fighting in the Middle East. The &#8216;America is a Judeo-Christian country&#8217; crowd absolutely wants to stay and fight it out against the jihadis, because it fears/hates them in a visceral way it never will feel about east Asian geopolitics. China may be threatening in a traditional, state-to-state kinda way, but that doesn&#8217;t move people&#8217;s deep fears/beliefs/angst though. But the idea that Muslims might bring sharia to the West, build a mosque near ground-zero, or see their <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/no-muslim-holiday-on-montgomery-county-school-calendar-isnt-fair-or-pc/2014/11/12/ce1dee46-6ac0-11e4-a31c-77759fc1eacc_story.html">holidays treated equally</a> by Western public authorities is enough see a lot of Americans into a cultural panic. Hence the huge well of public opinion support to keep fighting and fighting in the Middle East. </p><p align="justify">This is what Huntington grasped a long time ago with the clash of civilizations, but China is too different for most Americans to get excited about in a personal way. But Islam does provoke Americans like this; <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/world/2014/10/06/3576385/fox-news-host-visibly-angry-when-guests-dont-agree-agree-with-maher-and-condemn-islam/">just watch Fox</a>. Its focus on Islam is relentless and astonishing.

Run for the hills! </p><p align="justify">To me, in retrospect, the big story was not KJU&#8217;s disappearance, but the wild, almost lunatic conspiracy-theorizing it unleashed in the West. </p><p align="justify">North Korea is a running punch-line in the West. Kim Jong Il was the villain in Team America. The story that the Norks found a unicorn a few years ago got play for weeks in the US for its sheer laugh value. So this essay was an effort to get a handle on this &#8211; why do Western media feel license to make any wild, preposterous claim they want about North Korea? Where does this bizarre obsession come from? There&#8217;s probably a good MA thesis in here actually if you were serious about it. </p><p align="justify">The following essay was first published by the <a href="http://www.lowyinterpreter.org/post/2014/10/30/What-did-we-learn-from-all-the-Kim-Jong-Un-has-dissappeared-hysteria.aspx?COLLCC=2212766809&amp;">Lowy Institute</a>, and then <a href="http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/north-korea-the-mafia-lessons-the-kim-jong-un-has-11584">picked up by The National Interest</a>.

It is a great way to keep up to date with what is being read and discussed in the humanities and social sciences. They seem to offer mostly book reviews and roundtables. I find them particularly good in my area &#8211; the intersection of history and political science. H-Net has a general qualitative bent also, so its reviews are mercifully readable.</p><p align="justify">Over the summer, they asked me to review Amitav Acharya&#8217;s book, The <a href="https://www.h-net.org/reviews/showpdf.php?id=42206">End of the American World Order</a>. Here is <a href="https://www.h-net.org/reviews/showpdf.php?id=42206">the link</a> to review on the actual H-Net site. I have re-printed it below. In brief, he argues that the US is in terminal relative decline, and that a world order without a domineering American role must be discussed. He sketches a few (unconvicing) alternatives.</p><p align="justify">And being the child of the 80s and <a href="https://asiansecurityblog.wordpress.com/2009/05/08/top-10-gloriously-bad-ir-movies-you-still-should-see/">its so-bad-it&#8217;s-awesome film</a>, what image of American World Order could surpass Stallone beating the crap out of commies while draped in an American flag? Awesome! Go Rocko! I remember cheering in my seat when Rocky beat Drago. We won the Cold War and kicked some russki butt! Hah! I think I was 12.

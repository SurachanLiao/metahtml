Wear OS generates a multitude of different form factors and also wildly different designs. Today, TAG Heuer has launched its latest Wear OS smartwatch, the TAG Heuer Connected 2020 which offers updated specifications and a price that cannot yet be justified.

Now available for purchase (via Droid-Life), TAG Heuer Connected 2020 has a lot in common with previous generations. It offers a 45mm case which is 13.5mm thick. It is not a small clock, but it makes use of that space. Along the side of the watch, you’ll find a rotating crown that doubles as a power button flanked by two thin buttons on either side of the crown. As usual with Wear OS, these can be customized to open any app.

TAG Heuer’s new app collection is also a special fitness app that can track your workouts and golf, and custom dials are also pre-installed.

Under the hood, Connected 2020 is quite similar to the rest of the Wear OS package. The biggest update compared to previous TAG Heuer models is the arrival of the “new” Snapdragon Wear 3100 processor. There is no mention of RAM in the store list, but there is no reason to believe it has anything less. of 1 GB since all previous models have highlighted the specific ones.

Further rounding of the specification page is a 1.39-inch OLED display, 430 mAh battery, 5ATM water resistance, heart rate monitor, GPS, Bluetooth 4.0, Wifi and NFC for Google Pay.

When it comes to design, the new TAG Heuer Connected 2020 has a design similar to the previous models, but with some refinements added and, as mentioned above, the two extra buttons on the right side. Four designs are available: stainless steel PVD bezel with rubber strap ($ 1,800), black ceramic bezel with rubber strap ($ 1,800), alternative finish steel case with stainless steel strap ($ 1,950) and stainless steel case titanium with a rubber strap ($ 2,350). All four are illustrated below. In particular, they all have a sapphire crystal display.

As usual for TAG Heuer, Connected 2020 isn’t cheap at all. The “cheaper” model is a whopping $ 1,800 which the high-end models reached $ 2,350. TAG Heuer also sells extra straps for $ 100 (rubber) up to $ 490 (stainless steel).

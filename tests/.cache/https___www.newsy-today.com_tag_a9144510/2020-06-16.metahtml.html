Today, TAG Heuer has launched its latest Wear OS smartwatch, the TAG Heuer Connected 2020 which offers updated specifications and a price that cannot yet be justified.</p><p>Now available for purchase (via Droid-Life), TAG Heuer Connected 2020 has a lot in common with previous generations. It offers a 45mm case which is 13.5mm thick. It is not a small clock, but it makes use of that space. Along the side of the watch, you&#8217;ll find a rotating crown that doubles as a power button flanked by two thin buttons on either side of the crown. As usual with Wear OS, these can be customized to open any app.</p><p>TAG Heuer&#8217;s new app collection is also a special fitness app that can track your workouts and golf, and custom dials are also pre-installed.</p><p>Under the hood, Connected 2020 is quite similar to the rest of the Wear OS package. The biggest update compared to previous TAG Heuer models is the arrival of the &#8220;new&#8221; Snapdragon Wear 3100 processor. There is no mention of RAM in the store list, but there is no reason to believe it has anything less. of 1 GB since all previous models have highlighted the specific ones.</p><p>Further rounding of the specification page is a 1.39-inch OLED display, 430 mAh battery, 5ATM water resistance, heart rate monitor, GPS, Bluetooth 4.0, Wifi and NFC for Google Pay.</p><p>When it comes to design, the new TAG Heuer Connected 2020 has a design similar to the previous models, but with some refinements added and, as mentioned above, the two extra buttons on the right side. Four designs are available: stainless steel PVD bezel with rubber strap ($ 1,800), black ceramic bezel with rubber strap ($ 1,800), alternative finish steel case with stainless steel strap ($ 1,950) and stainless steel case titanium with a rubber strap ($ 2,350). All four are illustrated below. In particular, they all have a sapphire crystal display.</p><p>As usual for TAG Heuer, Connected 2020 isn&#8217;t cheap at all. The &#8220;cheaper&#8221; model is a whopping $ 1,800 which the high-end models reached $ 2,350. TAG Heuer also sells extra straps for $ 100 (rubber) up to $ 490 (stainless steel).</p><h2>More on Wear OS:</h2><p class="disclaimer-affiliate">FTC: We use automatic affiliate links to earn revenue.

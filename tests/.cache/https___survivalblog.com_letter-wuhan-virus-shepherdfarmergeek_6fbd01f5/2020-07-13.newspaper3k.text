The following are my comments to the SurvivalBlog article Post-Exposure Prevention (PEP) Protocol, by JJ in MI.

This is great to be considering post-exposure treatment. Our protective gear is likely to be *less than perfect*, and if we know we’ve been exposed we need a Plan B!

This study supports the use of PVP-I as an antiviral, although I do wonder about swabbing my nose with it!

Thinking in terms of what we can do *on the scene* when we realize we’ve been exposed, I’m wondering if it would be more convenient to use a Betadine spray, into our mouths (don’t spray your face or lips!), followed by a swig of water from a bottle, with gargling for a minute. Remember to NOT SWALLOW this!!!!

It seems to me that time is of the essence once exposed. The sooner we can gargle and swish the better, right? For my own family I’ve made up some saline nose spray bottles with two drops of Grapefruit Seed Extract and about 1/8 of a teaspoon of Xylitol. Supposedly the Xylitol helps wash microorganisms from your nose. I’d rather carry this solution in my pocket than Betadine that might ruin my clothes if it leaks. And I can use it immediately and discretely while in public.

As far as re-using an N95 mask goes, one of the dangers would be putting it back on if it really DOES have the virus on the outside. You’re putting it very near your eyes and would have to be *extremely* careful (goggles first).

Since the viruses don’t foul the mask like pollution or smoke or fallout would I don’t see why they couldn’t be re-used. But exposure to strong ultraviolet light might sanitize them better (sunlight, for as long as possible). I’m thinking that some N-95 mask – even re-used – is better than no N-95 mask, IF it comes to that.

Don’t spray the mask with liquids (diluted bleach comes to mind) or bake them – the mask works by having a huge network of *fuzzy fibers* to attract tiny particles as they make their way through. If the fuzzies get clumped together by being wetted (and dried) they aren’t going to work.

(The masks don’t actually block viruses – they’re too small to be stopped – but viruses in the air are usually embedded in tiny saliva droplets that are large enough to stop, although some free viruses will be caught by the fibers because of an electrostatic attraction.)

There are filter masks in the pipeline with copper and silver fiber elements, but best I can tell they’re not for sale yet…

Here’s my two cents for supplements that help with viral infections. My family is already taking some of these:

Vitamin A

Quercetin

Andrographis

Astragalus (immune stimulant)

Olive Leaf

Selenium

N acetyl cysteine (NAC)

Vitamin C

Guaifenesin (thins mucuous and makes bronchial cilia row faster to clear lungs better)

When treating a sick family member remember: this virus affects people’s respiration and that could require positioning them on the bed face down.

And, by the way, you can buy oxygen concentrators online via eBay, if you’ve got that kind of budget…

Last idea: Treating a sick family member at home (should professional medical care be overloaded) could burn through all of our N95 masks. This might be a better solution (and I can tell you from personal experience it’s more comfortable!):

It’s a powered filter hood. I’m guessing that with a little ingenuity preppers could improvise a 110v household power supply to run the motors so you’re not going through expensive C123 batteries!

Thank you JJ in MI and everyone else for your ideas! God have mercy on us all.

Hope this helps.

Trust God. Be prepared. We can do both!

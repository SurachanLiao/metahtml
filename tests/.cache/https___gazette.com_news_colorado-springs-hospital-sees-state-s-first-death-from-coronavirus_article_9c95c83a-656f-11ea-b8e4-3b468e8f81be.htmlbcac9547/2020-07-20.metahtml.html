"Just as we'll be sensitive to all the families and loved ones of the victims we want to make sure that we're providing the basic information to the public while respecting the family's desires.</p><p>"Many Coloradans will come down with coronavirus and most of those will have a minor illness and be as inconvenienced as they might with a cold and be able to return to work after their period of isolation. For the most vulnerable, and for a small percentage of those of all ages, this will take on a much more threatening form."</p><p>Polis declined to say where the woman lived or how she may have contracted the virus.</p><p>Cary Vogrin, a hospital spokeswoman, said privacy laws prevent her from answering when the woman was admitted to the hospital, if she was thought to have coronavirus at the time and if medical staff and others in the hospital are being contacted or tested for the disease.</p><p>"However, I can tell you that we have had screening guidelines in place for more than a month and have been constantly educating and training our staff &#8212; as is the case for any communicable disease, such as the flu &#8212; and we are following all CDC and CDPHE guidelines to ensure the safest environment for all patients, visitors and our care teams," she said.</p><p>The woman was among 28 new presumptive positive cases announced Friday morning, raising the total in the state to 77, the fifth highest in the country.</p><p>Polis said the coronavirus pandemic is "one of the greatest international public health disasters of our lifetime" in another statement Friday. He reiterated the statewide guidance of avoiding large gatherings of more than 250 people.</p><p>"For areas that have active contagion and become hot spots we fully are in correspondence with their local health authority and are supportive of additional steps that they feel are necessary in that community," Polis said.</p><p>&#8220;We offer our deepest, heartfelt condolences to the family and are saddened by this news,&#8221; said Susan Wheelan with the El Paso County Health Department. &#8220;We have a dedicated team of experts working around the clock to protect the health and safety of our community. We are doing everything we can to prevent more loss of lives. We know all of El Paso County, and Colorado, will join us.&#8221;</p><p>Contact Liz Henderson, 719-476-1623</p><p>Twitter: @GazetteLiz</p><p class="share-container content-below"><ul class="social-share-links hidden-print list-inline icon"><li class="social-share-link fb">

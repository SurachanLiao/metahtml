The Washington Retail Association has expanded its outreach with a new emphasis on Seattle politics and the debates and decisions of the City Council. The laws and regulations approved at City Hall not only affect hundreds of retailers across the city.

In cooperation with the state Employment Security Department, Washington Retail has begun an annual campaign to raise awareness about the retail industry’s importance to the economy and the many job and career opportunities it provides. The annual September promotion falls at the beginning of the busy holiday hiring season for retailers. It is summarized in a focus on retail on the WorkSource Washington website.

Washington Retail would like to acknowledge the rapid response and resiliency demonstrated by the business community and employees during this unprecedented COVID-19 situation.

As stewards of Washington’s retail experience, this COVID-19 resource page is developed to support retailers as we continue to understand your unique needs in the situation.

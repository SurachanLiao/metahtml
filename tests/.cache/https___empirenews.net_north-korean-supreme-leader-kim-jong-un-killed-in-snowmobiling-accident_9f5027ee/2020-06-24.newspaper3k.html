<p><strong>NEW YORK&#160;CITY, New York&#160;&#8211;&#160;<a href="https://empirenews.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/North-Korean-Supreme-Leader-Kim-Jong-un-Killed-In-Snowmobiling-Accident.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7452" src="https://empirenews.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/North-Korean-Supreme-Leader-Kim-Jong-un-Killed-In-Snowmobiling-Accident-300x181.jpg" alt="North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un Killed In Snowmobiling Accident" width="300" height="181"></a></strong></p>
<p>The Associated Press in New York City, New York is receiving reports from the office of North Korean second-in-command Hwan Cho that North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un has been killed during a horrific snowmobiling accident just hours ago.</p>
<p>In the onslaught of reports bombarding press rooms, it is said that Kim Jong-un received a snowmobile as a Christmas gift from Russian President Vladimir Putin. The two had previously bonded over their shared hatred of the United States, and had developed a very close friendship according to North Korean third-in-command Chung Chin-mae, who has released a more detailed statement of the tragic account.</p>
<p>In his statement sent worldwide, Chung said that the Supreme Leader had taken the gift out for a joyride just after breakfast.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is with a heavy heart filled with sadness that I issue my words upon the people of the world, and relay this tragic message. Kim Jong-un has died after an accident involving the snowmobile given to him as a Christmas gift by Russian President Putin. Supreme Leader&#160;took the machine out for riding, and struck a tree branch. He was decapitated, dying only hours later,&#8221; Chung said in the statement.</p>
<p>Of course, the news bring mixed emotions among the public of North Korea. Some citizens have taken to the streets with joy, holding&#160;signs with phrases of relief, such as&#8221;We Are Free&#8221;, &#8220;The Evil Has Died&#8221;, and &#8220;America Wins.&#8221;</p>
<p>The thirty-one year old Kim had assumed the office of North Korean Supreme Leader on December 17th,&#160;2011. He is survived by his spouse, Ri Sol-ju, a child, Kim Ju-ae, and live-in man slave Dong Bong-cha. Funeral arrangements have not been announced. Second-in-command Hwan Cho has reportedly assumed the title of Supreme Leader of North Korea.</p>
